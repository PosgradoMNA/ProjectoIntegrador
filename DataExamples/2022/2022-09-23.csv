After nearly two decades of directing and designing the bands of music's biggest stars Adam Blackstone has officially unveiled his debut studio album Legacy.

The 14-track project rallies friends family and fellow Philly jazz and r&b heroes including Jill Scott Robert Glasper Queen Latifah (delivering her feature since 2016) Terrace Martin Jazmine Sullivan and more. Legacy was announced earlier this month with release of the album's lead single ""Round Midnight"" which is a buttery update on Thelonious Monk standard featuring Sullivan on vocals along with accompaniment from Questlove and James Poyser.

Legacy arrives on the heels of another mantel-worthy year for Blackstone. At the top of September the 38-year-old bassist and musical director who took home his first Emmy for Outstanding Music Direction for the Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show (which also won awards for Outstanding Variety Special and Outstanding Production Design for a Variety Special) celebrating the impact of Dr. Dre's catalog career and influence with Aftermath signees galore including Kendrick Lamar Snoop Dogg Anderson .Paak 50 Cent and Eminem.

The Bengaluru-headquartered startup valued at $22 billion had pushed back on some payments for the approximately $1 billion acquisition of the physical education chain last year citing regulatory clearance. Blackstone which is also an investor in Byju’s owned about 38% of Aakash prior to the acquisition.

Byju Raveendran founder and chief executive of the eponymous edtech startup told TechCrunch earlier this month in an interview that Byju’s and Blackstone had mutually decided to process the payments later. The Indian startup cleared the dues this week the source said requesting anonymity as the details are private.

Blackstone and Byju’s did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday evening.

The Indian startup which offers online and offline learning services to students from kindergarten to those preparing for competitive college entrance exams has spent over $2.5 billion in the past two years to acquire scores of firms including the U.S.-based reading platform Epic coding suite Tynker India-based Great Learning GradeUp Topper and Austria’s GeoGebra.

It has also made a bid to acquire publicly listed edtech firm 2U Raveendran confirmed in the earlier interview.

Earlier this month the Indian startup revealed its financial accounts for the year ending in March 2021 after a prolonged delay. Byju’s said it clocked a revenue of $305.6 million and widened its losses to $577.4 million in the financial year that ended in March 2021. Raveendran said some 40% of FY21 revenue — because of the period of consumption and credit sales duration — were deferred to the subsequent year.

The startup which counts Blackrock Tiger Global Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sequoia India among its backers said it generated a gross revenue of $1.258 billion (unaudited) in the financial year that ended in March this year. Between April and July the startup logged revenue of $570 million it said.

Byju’s is looking to go public next year. Raveendran said in the earlier interview that Byju’s is watching the macro market conditions closely and will file for an IPO in nine to 12 months. “I don’t think the markets will turn this year” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZG90LmxhL2JsYWNrc3RvbmUtZ3Jvd3RoLWpvbi1rb3JuZ29sZC0yNjU4MzEyNTE1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blackstone's Jon Korngold Discusses Private Equity Strategy,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='dot.la', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /blackstone-growth-jon-korngold-2658312515.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026743885150>, 'Connection to dot.la timed out.

According to Stanford Law School’s FCPA ClearingHouse “Millicom disclosed that it had received a subpoena from the DOJ on April 27 2022 requesting information concerning the company’s business in Guatemala (“Tigo Guatemala”) including information related to the purchase in 2021 of Millicom’s former joint venture partner’s interest in Tigo Guatemala and information related to any contacts with certain Guatemalan government officials.”

The FCPA passed by Congress in 1977 is the main U.S. anti-corruption law. It prohibits the payment of bribes to foreign government officials in order to obtain business advantages. It also contains accounting provisions requiring publicly traded corporations to make and keep books and records that accurately reflect the transactions of the corporation. In 2010 the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) which established the SEC Whistleblower Program added whistleblower provisions to the FCPA. Individuals can disclose information relevant to potential FCPA violations to either the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

Through the SEC and CFTC Whistleblower Programs qualified whistleblowers individuals who voluntarily provide the SEC or CFTC with original information that leads to a successful enforcement action are entitled to a monetary award of 10-30% of funds recovered by the government. Additionally the DFA’s related action provisions allow whistleblowers to receive awards when their disclosure to the SEC also leads to a successful enforcement action by another agency. For example a whistleblower whose disclosure leads to FCPA charges by both the SEC and the DOJ could be eligible for awards based on the sanctions collected by both agencies.

In August Boston Scientific a biotechnical engineering firm revealed in a quarterly filing that a whistleblower alleges the company violated the FCPA with its activities in Vietnam.

2021 was a down year for FCPA enforcement. According to a report from FCPA Clearinghouse 2021 saw the lowest amount of FCPA enforcement actions in a decade. The report states that the SEC and DOJ only filed 18 FCPA enforcement actions in 2021.

The drug won approval in February of 2021 under the FDA’s controversial accelerated pathway but was pulled off the U.S. market eight months later when data from a confirmatory trial indicated that it might do more harm than good.

“How the heck would I give informed consent to a patient to receive this drug?” Mikkael Sakeres M.D. a former chair of the committee now at the University of Miami asked during the meeting.

But Pepaxto is alive and well in Europe where it won approval in June based on the same data that the committee reviewed on Thursday. The difference is the regulatory acceptance of Oncopeptides’ interpretation of the trial results.

“There are different regulatory environments but fundamentally science is science” Oncopeptides CEO Jakob Lindberg said in an interview after the adcomm. “Gravity should apply on both sides of the pond.”

In the Ocean-3 trial the death rate for Pepaxto was 47.6% versus 43.4% for Bristol Myers Squibb’s Pomalyst (pomlidomide) the control arm. Meanwhile the median duration of survival was 19.7 months for those on Pepaxto versus 25 months for Pomalyst.

The Swedish-based company however says a subgroup analysis shows that Pepaxto has value. Oncopeptides pointed to positive results when eliminating a key patient group—those who had undergone stem-cell transplants within the last three years.

The company also says age is a major separator. While Pomalyst performs better on younger patients Pepaxto is a superior option for those who are elderly.

“It’s an astonishingly heterogenous survivor result” Lindberg said. “You have almost twice the survival on melflufen compared to pomalidomide in the elderly and almost twice the survival with pomalidomide over melflufen in the young.”

At the urging of the FDA the committee rejected this subgroup analysis to the tune of a 14-2 vote. FDA oncology czar Richard Pazdur M.D. blasted Oncopeptides for its “post hoc” approach.

“When you have people resubmitting data and changing analysis this could bring up issues of study conduct and integrity of the study” Pazdur said. “They have to demonstrate with substantial evidence efficacy. It is not our responsibility to disprove something.”

In retrospect Lindberg said that the company and the FDA never found “a good way to collaborate and have a good scientific dialogue.”

“It was almost like there was bad blood” Lindberg said of the adcomm.

The session was another example of why harsh scrutiny has fallen upon accelerated approvals following the FDA’s ill-fated green light for Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm.

The process was designed to speed promising drugs to the market and save lives. But in the case of Pepaxto the drug has proven to be less than advertised.

“Given what is currently known we would not have granted accelerated approval as we cannot conclude melflufen provides a meaningful benefit over existing therapies” FDA clinical reviewer Alexandria Schwarsin M.D. said during the meeting.

Lindberg said it would take three to four years to conduct another trial. Meanwhile Pepaxto will be on different development stages in the United States and Europe. The launch of Pepaxti—as it is known in Europe—begins in October.

“It would be interesting if we wrote some regulatory history here” Lindberg said with a laugh. “Where the same dataset results in full approval in one geography and then we have product withdrawal due to safety concerns in the other. It would be like OK that will be a first.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hbmFseXplLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L3NlbGVjdGEtYmlvc2NpZW5jZXMtc3RvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Selecta Biosciences Stock: Mind the Dilution,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hbmFseXplLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L3NlbGVjdGEtYmlvc2NpZW5jZXMtc3RvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267421986D0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Regional Analysis

Technavio has announced its latest market research report titled Global PD-1 and PD-L1 Inhibitors Market 2022-2026

North America will account for 51% of the market's growth during the forecast period. This growth is attributed to factors such as the increasing prevalence of various solid tumors and blood-related tumors in the region and the sales of approved therapeutics. However market growth in this region will be slower than the growth of the market in other regions. The US and Canada are the key countries for the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors market in North America.

As Broadcom’s $61 billion bid for VMware inches towards a finish line of sometime next year more details are emerging about the deal including the other companies who were interested in the virtualization giant VMware’s counter offer which CEO Hock Tan refused and the conversations Michael Dell had at Davos that played a part in creating the mega offer. Broadcom filed a 309-page document with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that laid out its rationale to shareholders for buying VMware. Included in the lengthy July text was day-by-day rehashing of the significant meetings and events numerical figures and estimates that played a role in shaping the deal. According to this SEC filing at least two companies other than Broadcom were interested in buying VMware during the go-shop period. Leaders at two separate companies also spoke with Michael Dell at Davos as negotiations between Broadcom and VMware intensified in mid-May. The filing also gives the public a glimpse of the expected timeline of the deal. Broadcom initially wanted it to close within 15-months however VMware asked for the longer 18-month window during negotiations. Broadcom has since repeatedly said the deal would close by October 31 2023 about 18 months after it was announced. During the days Broadcom negotiated with VMware over value VMware disclosed its revenue projections for the next five years out to 2027 estimating that it would grow from $13.35 billion in sales by the end of this fiscal year to $18.93 billion by the end of 2027 according to the SEC filing. VMware said it will achieve those numbers “fueled by subscription and SaaS revenue” which it plans to increase “from 26% to 37% in fiscal years 2023 through 2025 so that it accounts for 46% of the overall revenue mix in fiscal year 2025 the filing stated. The moves would be in keeping with Broadcom’s goals for VMware as Tan has said he too plans to quickly increase subscription revenue at VMware once the deal closes. Here is the account of how the deal came together as stated by Broadcom in its July filing:

Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell Assistant to Assistant On April 26 Hock Tan’s assistant called Michael Dell’s assistant to make an appointment. What followed was a fast-paced month of meetings phone calls offers and counter-offers that launched the merger of Broadcom and VMware. Tan the CEO of Broadcom wanted to talk with Michael Dell CEO of Dell Technologies the largest single shareholder of VMware and president of VMware’s board but Tan wouldn’t say what the meeting was about. The two CEOs agreed to meet on Friday May 6 the day after Dell Technologies World ended in Las Vegas. “At the May 6 meeting Mr. Tan told Mr. Dell that Broadcom would be interested in a potential combination with VMware on a friendly basis. Mr. Tan and Mr. Dell discussed Broadcom’s strategic rationale with respect to such a transaction but did not discuss the price or any other terms of a potential transaction” according to a filing with the SEC. During their conversation Dell suggested Tan speak with Egon Durban a VMware board member who is also co-CEO at Silver Lake one of the nation’s largest private equity firms. Until 2019 Silver Lake had been an investor in Broadcom. Besides Dell SilverLake has the largest stake in VMware at 10 percent. Then immediately after the meeting Dell called board member Paul Sagan the lead independent director of VMware to tell him about Tan’s proposal. Sagan a former television news writer and director has been a board member of VMware since 2015. The next day Tan was on the phone with Durban and by Thursday Tan had brought together Broadcom executives Durban and Silver Lake executives to talk about a potential merger.

The Offer On Friday a week after Tan’s first meeting with Dell Broadcom sent a confidential letter to “Messrs. Dell Durban and Sagan” suggesting a purchase price of $142.50 per share with shareholders selecting either cash or equivalent shares of Broadcom. Additionally Broadcom offered a board seat to VMware upon close of the deal and a “go-shop” provision but said it wanted to sign an agreement quickly by May 26 the date of VMware’s next earnings call. VMware’s board formed a transaction committee with Dell Durban Sagan and Karen E. Dykstra that got early glimpses of Broadcom’s first quarter performance as well as its own and then on May 21 hatched a counter offer. “The VMware board of directors then discussed a potential counterproposal to Broadcom including an increase in headline price from $142.50 to $150 per share an increase in exchange ratio (stock equivalent) from 0.242 to 0.2602 shares of Broadcom for one share of VMware increasing the amount of Broadcom stock used from 50 percent of the financing to 60 percent extending the timeline from 15 months to 18 months and extending the “go-shop” provision from 35 days to 40 days” an SEC filing stated. Durban went to Tan that day to discuss the board’s proposal. Tan refused the price hike telling Durban that $142.50 was Broadcom’s best and final offer. The “go-shop” provision was set at 40 days when the deal was announced indicating VMware won some of the negotiations. However “Broadcom was unwilling to increase the maximum amount of stock consideration to be issued by Broadcom to VMware stockholders in the proposed transaction” the filing stated.

Davos “Party A” and “Party B” The next day Sunday May 22 VMware’s transaction committee met with the full VMware board J.P. Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs Silver Lake and lawyers from Gibson Dunn to talk about Broadcom’s final offer. Missing from that meeting was Michael Dell who was in Davos at the World Economic Forum. In the meeting Durban said another CEO who was also in Davos had reached out to speak with Dell without specifying a topic similar to how Tan had broached a merger with VMware when he spoke with Dell. On May 22 the opening day of the World Economic Forum Bloomberg reported that Broadcom and VMware were expected to soon announce a merger agreement. This was followed by several other reports including CRN’s in which partners pleaded with Broadcom not to “Screw VMware Up.” Meanwhile in Davos Dell and the CEO -- called “Party A” in SEC filings -- had a chat. “During the meeting the Chief Executive Officer of Party A asked Mr. Dell if Mr. Dell could comment on the rumors that VMware was in discussions regarding a potential transaction to which Mr. Dell said he had no comment. The Chief Executive Officer of Party A did not make any offer or proposal regarding a potential strategic combination between Party A and VMware.” Two days later VMware CEO Raghu Raghuram said he was approached by another company which might be interested in buying VMware. “Raghuram noted that a senior executive of a large publicly traded corporation (referred to as Party B) had reached out following the news reports regarding a potential Broadcom transaction and expressed interest in a potential transaction” the filing stated. However Dell countered that. He told those assembled that he had interacted with a senior executive of “Party B” in Davos the day prior. Dell said the executive did not mention anything regarding a potential transaction. Bloomberg which sent a reporter to cover the World Economic Forum reported that it saw Dell at the event. It also reported that Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff was in Davos.

Broadcom Software Group President Tom Krause May 26 Early in the morning on May 26 one month to the day after Tan’s assistant had called Dell’s assistant to set up a meeting the VMware Board of Directors voted unanimously to approve the deal and recommended that shareholder do the same. “Before the opening of New York Stock Exchange … Broadcom delivered to VMware fully executed versions of the debt commitment letter and Gibson Dunn delivered the legal opinion required by the tax matters agreement between VMware and Dell for VMware to engage in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Promptly following execution of the merger agreement VMware and Broadcom publicly announced the merger agreement.” Tan along with then-Broadcom Software Group President Tom Krause held a call with investors and talked about the opportunities Broadcom saw with VMware including a chance to “embrace the channel.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc3RvY2tuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FtZC1zdG0teHBlci1hdmdvLXVtYy10aW1lLXRvLWJ1eS1hbWQtc3RvY2stbm90LXNvLWZhc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD: Time to Buy AMD Stock?

Russ Curtis a spokesperson for nonprofit organization International Bird Rescue said the organization has recovered sick pelicans in Southern California too. Since April 20 the organization has cared for more than 235 pelicans at its wildlife rescue centers in Fairfield in the Bay Area and San Pedro in Los Angeles.

“They’re in really poor physical shape. They’re starving and they haven’t gotten enough nutrition” Curtis said in an interview with KQED. Some of the injuries are from fishing lines and hooks.

“When there’s not the fishing stock that they can find they take chances around fishing piers and fishing boats and places where there are people with fishing tackle” he continued.

Sick birds have been spotted off Alameda Point in the Bay Area which is a roosting ground for brown pelicans. But many were found in places where people don’t usually find these stocky large seabirds. On city streets and parking lots for example. One bird in Santa Cruz attempted to walk into a bar Curtis said. The majority of pelicans at the Fairfield center came from the Monterey and Santa Cruz areas.

It’s not clear why the birds are having trouble finding food.

“It’s still a mystery” Curtis said. “We haven’t had any conclusive proof of what’s really going out in the wild right now.”

The Los Angeles Times reported there was a similar spike in malnourished brown pelicans along California’s coast in 2022 with no clear cause. International Bird Rescue reported other spikes in starving brown pelicans in 2010 and 2012.

During these prior incidents International Bird Rescue cared for pelicans for weeks.

“We’re not going to release them back out to an area where there is not proper fish stock for them to feed on” said Curtis. “They would just rebound and probably come back into care at some point.”

While they wait for more information Curtis said wildlife rescue centers like theirs — which rely on public donations — are feeling a financial squeeze.

“At this point we’re going through about 500 pounds of fish a day just at this center and that’s about $1000 a day” he said.

Curtis said the public can help by keeping an eye out for unwell brown pelicans.

“As you enjoy the warm weather and you’re at the beach or along the coast if you see a pelican that’s out of place or might have a fishing line injury if you see something say something” Curtis said. “Let your local animal control know that there’s a bird in distress and let’s get it into care as soon as we can.”

If you see an injured or unwell pelican you can reach International Bird Rescue’s Bird HelpLine at 866-SOS-BIRD or get help by calling your local animal control.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL2FkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9uLzQ2NTk0MTgtYmlkZW4tdG8tbWVldC13aXRoLWJyb3duLXYtYm9hcmQtcGxhaW50aWZmcy1kdXJpbmctd2Vlay1vZi1lbmdhZ2VtZW50LXdpdGgtYmxhY2stY29tbXVuaXR5L9IBkwFodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL2FkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9uLzQ2NTk0MTgtYmlkZW4tdG8tbWVldC13aXRoLWJyb3duLXYtYm9hcmQtcGxhaW50aWZmcy1kdXJpbmctd2Vlay1vZi1lbmdhZ2VtZW50LXdpdGgtYmxhY2stY29tbXVuaXR5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden to meet with Brown v.

On Counsell’s watch the Milwaukee Brewers developed All-Star pitchers without drafting them at the top of the first round or fast-tracking them into the major-league rotation. Brown’s curiosity and studious approach to the game led him down this path.

“I had gone into a deep Corbin Burnes dive last year when I was struggling” Brown said. “This was right in the middle of it. This was me struggling in Triple A and then getting hurt. I can tell you about a lot of guys who had bounce-back years.”

Brown laughed and continued: “I did the same thing when I had Tommy John. I can probably rattle off every dude who had TJ in all of North America.”

Brown’s Tommy John surgery cost him most of the 2019 season but he popped up as a prospect in the summer of 2022 when the Philadelphia Phillies traded him for veteran reliever David Robertson. By this time last year Brown had already earned a promotion from Double-A Tennessee and submitted two lights-out starts for the Iowa Cubs. The phone call every player dreams about did not happen.

Opening Day rolled around this season and Brown was still waiting. And then Justin Steele dropped to the ground with a strained left hamstring in the fifth inning of Game 1 making Brown the next man up. Brown 24 struggled in his major-league debut before quickly settling into a hybrid role that took him off the roster bubble.

Brown’s value could be seen in Friday’s 7-2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates as he replaced starter Javier Assad and threw 3 2/3 scoreless innings that featured six strikeouts against one walk. Managing Brown’s workload — he threw fewer than 100 innings last year — is a bigger issue than determining whether he belongs.

Brown’s future could be in the rotation — the 6-foot-6 210-pound right-hander certainly looks the part — and the Cubs will keep open that possibility. His heavy fastball/curveball combination has also led reporters to ask Counsell whether Brown could emerge as the team’s closer.

“Ben’s best asset right now is he throws really hard” Counsell said. “Without being too analytical it’s just the hitters’ reaction. He’s beating hitters with the fastball. That’s not easy to do in the big leagues. No matter what your velocity is it’s just not easy to do. He’s beating hitters with the fastball and that makes you cheat. And that makes his off-speed very good. That’s kind of his formula.”

Counsell’s formula for small-market success included more than just Burnes and Woodruff. They were never regarded as generational pitching prospects like Paul Skenes the No. 1 pick in the 2023 MLB Draft who debuted Saturday against the Cubs at PNC Park. Woodruff was optioned to Triple-A Colorado Springs seven times between July 2017 and July 2018 an example of the roster management that showed Counsell’s dexterity during Milwaukee’s rise.

“He has an excellent track record” Brown said mentioning Josh Hader Devin Williams and Freddy Peralta by name. “There are some really good arms that Craig really helped develop.”

As a rookie in 2018 Burnes went 7-0 with a 2.61 ERA in 30 appearances out of the bullpen a midseason boost that helped the Brewers force a Game 163 at Wrigley Field and take away a division title from the Cubs. Burnes split the next season between the majors (8.82 ERA) and Triple-A San Antonio (8.46 ERA). His name then appeared in the Cy Young Award voting in each of the next four years and he won the award in 2021.

Progress as Cubs executives like to say isn’t always linear. Brown spent a month-plus on the injured list with a strained left oblique and finished last season working out of Iowa’s bullpen. He needed those reminders when his development stalled.

“Corbin Burnes went through that one funky year before he ended (up) going off for a Cy Young ride” Brown said. “Woodruff was a little bit of a late bloomer as well. There’s the (Jacob) deGroms of the world who didn’t debut until he was (almost) 26. Last year with my frustration I was like ‘Hey there’s still hope for me to be a good baseball player one day.’”

Brown’s self-awareness and dedication to his craft should help him continue to make adjustments. He has a 2.84 ERA in four starts and four multi-inning appearances as a reliever. His fastball velocity (96.5 mph) is elite. His strikeout rate (25.8 percent) is above average on a staff that doesn’t have that much classic swing-and-miss stuff.

Brown’s personality traits will also likely keep him in Counsell’s circle of trust. It’s not like the Cubs are going to suddenly get healthy. Before Saturday’s game in Pittsburgh the team placed reliever Yency Almonte on the 15-day injured list with a strained right shoulder and recalled right-hander José Cuas from Iowa. Whatever Counsell needs Brown will be available.

“It’s all good” Brown said. “Put in the time. Put in the work. And try not to worry too much about going down or whatever. It’s been awesome.”

That infamous philosophy entered the world after Poirier repeatedly tried guillotine chokes against Benoit Saint Denis at UFC 299 against the advice of his coaches who could be heard in his corner telling him “no more guillotines” after the first round. Poirier has a nasty guillotine choke and he never hesitates to use it even if the move almost always ends with him in a bad position after his opponent slips free from the submission.

It turns out cameras actually missed the rest of the interaction between Poirier and his head coach Mike Brown at UFC 299 which is where he told the Louisiana native to stop looking for that same submission.

“They actually didn’t play it in between the rounds after the first round I said ‘No more guillotines’ and then they switched to the other corner” Brown told MMA Fighting. “But right after I said that Dustin said ‘No but I can hit it! I can hit it!’ I just replied ‘You crazy bastard.’

“I literally said that and then he went and jumped another one. They didn’t play that part but there was more words said after I said don’t jump the guillotine.”

Poirier ultimately beat Saint Denis by knockout but he’s been rather adamant that a failed guillotine attempt won’t stop him from going for the choke again in the future.

Despite never finishing a fight with a guillotine Brown knows Poirier is effective with the technique because he’s witnessed it in the gym hundreds of times over the years.

“He puts a lot of guys to sleep in the gym to be honest” Brown said. “He does have a very good one. He just hasn’t hit them in the fight.”

While his instructions to stop going for guillotine chokes got a lot of attention around the Saint Denis fight Brown admits that Poirier’s love of the submission actually got a bigger reaction out of him during a different matchup a couple of years ago.

“The fight where I was losing my mind is the fight with [Dan] Hooker” Brown said. “Because he had lost the first two rounds and then he was battling back and then he was jumping guillotine in those later rounds and had he got stuck on bottom in any one of those rounds he would have lost the third round and wouldn’t have won the decision.

“But somehow he wouldn’t hit the guillotine but he would somehow scramble to get back to his feet and start dropping bombs on him and doing damage and then somehow stealing the round anyway. He would somehow find a way to make it work. He made us sweat and bite our nails in that one that’s for sure.”

Poirier’s next chance to land a guillotine choke comes at UFC 302 on June 1 when he faces reigning lightweight champion Islam Makhachev in the main event.

Back in 2019 when he faced then-champion Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 242 Poirier famously went for his guillotine choke — and for a moment looked as if he might become the first person to hand the undefeated Russian a loss. It wasn’t meant to be however as Nurmagomedov escaped and used his top position to rain down punishment on Poirier before eventually securing a rear-naked choke submission of his own to finish the fight.

Now five years later Poirier faces Nurmagomedov’s protege Makhachev and Brown admits it would be rather poetic if a guillotine ends up winning him the UFC lightweight title.

“It absolutely could happen” Brown said. “He’s done so much in the sport. I almost feel like he doesn’t have anything more to prove but this is the one box he has to check. I feel like he’s a champion even though he hasn’t won a title a true UFC title. He’s won the interim. I feel like he’s a champion in my eyes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzc2VuY2UuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS95dmV0dGUtbmljb2xlLWJyb3duLWh1c2JhbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yvette Nicole Brown Wants Her Engagement At 52 To Inspire Women Not To Settle,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzc2VuY2UuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS95dmV0dGUtbmljb2xlLWJyb3duLWh1c2JhbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673E6E7FA0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The school is adding a new building to serve female students as well



Girls could attend as soon as 2024



The expansion is a $10 million project LOUISVILLE Ky. — Nestled in Louisville’s Chickasaw neighborhood sits the West End School a school that is on a mission to help young boys be their best selves.

Markario Hamiliton is a 5th grader at West End School. He has been attending since Pre-k and has learned how to play the violin and skipped the 4th grade at the school. “I like I think it’s a good school environment. It helps you engage with other people” said Hamilton.

For almost 2 decades West End School has served low-income pre-k to 8th-grade boys with a tuition-free private school. Over 99% of the school’s alumni graduate high school. Over 70% receive scholarships to attend private high schools.

Don Hall is on the board of trustees and is excited that the school will soon double its student population of 140 and welcome a new demographic. “Beginning in the fall of 2024 the West End School for the first time we’ll open our doors to serve girls students. How wonderful is that?” said Hall.

The West End School’s goal is to enable students regardless of their circumstances to achieve their highest potential.

Former University of Louisville and Utah Jazz basketball star Darrell Griffith attended Carter Elementary which was once housed in West End School’s building. Before that school was there it was Virginia Avenue Colored School. A gymnasium named after Griffith is located on West End School’s campus.

Griffith still remembers the names and influence of all his teachers there. “I grew up in the west end three blocks down. I used to walk here every day” said Griffith. “I still remember who believed in me who helped me and who taught me and who inspired me. These people had an impact on my life and I remember them as I should.”

Decades later teachers staff and supporters of the West End School are still making that impact.

“The teachers they helped me. They really engage with you like the counselors. If you’re feeling down about yourself they’ll come back and help you get up so you can go to class and do your best” said Hamilton.

Hamilton is excited that soon young girls and his little sister will be able to experience those same benefits. “I think she’ll still get the same feeling as me when I first moved here. I think it’ll be a good environment for her too” said Hamilton.

It will cost $10 million to construct the new school building. The school board and community partners have already raised $6 million and hope to raise the rest by the end of the year.

(WAVE) - The West End School announced plans for a new building creating the West End Girls School.

The tuition-free school in Louisville’s Chickasaw neighborhood has served boys from pre-kindergarten through 8th grade for 17 years. There are currently about 140 boys enrolled.

The goal is to double that by bringing in up to 150 girls when the new school is complete.

The building will stand where the soccer field currently is with a new field and additional outdoor space being built on surrounding properties.

The West End Girls School has already secured $6 million in pledges from multiple sources in organizations. An additional $4 million is needed by the end of 2022.

They plan to start construction on the new building in 2023.

Brown-Forman will grant $20 million over the next 10 years split between the boys and girls schools.

Kenneth Gray a 2010 graduate and now board member of the West End School could barely contain his excitement. He said this expansion will allow for more opportunities for both young girls and their families.

“It was really emotional because it was full circle” Gray said. “We were in the board meeting and I definitely had a few tears- I think a lot of us did. It was a good stress. It was like where do we start? What do we do?”

Current West End School students and several city leaders were at the announcement on Friday including Darryl Griffith; Lawson Whiting President and CEO of Brown-Forman; Paul Perconti co-founder and board chair emeritus for the West End School; and Mayor Greg Fischer.

It’s a show that whisks audiences away to a world where anything goes—and we do mean anything. Yes the talents on display here mesmerize like few others on the Strip but to say it’s adults-only is putting it lightly. When it comes to the comedy both spoken and physical you’re going to need to be open. You have to be willing to let your guard down and let your freak flag fly because eventually the whole audience will be waving theirs proudly.

It’s a show that makes it OK to be naughty and your hosts The Gazillionaire and his assistant Wanda Widdles are both the creators and ambassadors of that naughtiness. And from that impropriety comes those big laughs—the comedy here is crass and all sass; it’s also super-sexual and the audience absolutely eats it up from start to finish.

But let’s get back to that rotating cast of talent. During a recent show audiences were treated to a cornucopia of acts made to amaze and excite: a couple gets lovey during an aerial number; a ripped guy works the pole; gasps and shock ripple the theater as a sword-swallower goes from one sword to six; juggling skills set the stage for a risqué undressing; a roller-skating duo elicits shock and awe; talented twins tap dance to thunderous applause; and a group of strongmen use each other’s bodies to balance.

In between the vignettes The Gazillionaire likes to pick on the audience—no one is safe and no one can keep a straight face. There’s even opportunity for couples to get up onstage and compete in a lap-dance competition for free cocktails. Speaking of inebriation—you’ll get drunk with delights when The Green Fairy makes an appearance for some song and striptease—doing justice to the show’s namesake spirit from which she was spawned.

We can’t forget to talk about Absinthe’s home too. The theater construction is a nod to the traveling circuses of yesteryear and the theater-in-the-round is erected under a speigeltent that gives off old vaudevillian vibes. Plan on getting there a little early so you can hang outside the tent and play some games like cornhole or kick it with a cocktail underneath the huge LED tree. Inside you can order drinks from the bar or if you paid for table seating cocktail servers will stop by and take drink orders.

The party atmosphere of the show fits in perfectly with the Vegas crowd too. If you’re wanting entertainment where you get to hoot and holler laugh out loud and cheer and loudly applaud this is the show to do it. Absinthe really is an anything-goes show that takes the audience through 90 minutes of extremely impressive entertainment and jaw-on-the-floor comedy. And once it’s all done you can’t wait to experience it all over again.

But that’s the thing. Campbell’s has been and always will be that aluminum can with a red and white label to me. So the launch of a new Campbell’s brand is fascinating if not important news. Trade publication FoodDive reports that Campbell’s has come out with a new line called FlavorUp which is their first new brand addition in six years. Campbell’s has confirmed to me that the product is out as of this week.

FlavorUp is a line of flavor concentrates that you use in small doses to enhance the taste of whatever you’re cooking. There are three kinds: Rich Garlic and Herb Caramelized Onion and Burgundy Wine and Savory Mushroom and Herb. Notice one key detail: This isn’t soup. It’s not a huge departure but this is new territory for Campbell’s.

This is just in time for sweater weather when people start using flavors such as those to create stews and soups. Some of them like caramelized onion can take a long time to develop in a home kitchen. Having a handy flavor booster ready to go for a quick soup or sauce could prove useful for home cooks looking for easy shortcuts.

Linda Lee who is chief marketing officer of Campbell’s U.S. Meals and Beverage division says via FoodDive “We’ve seen at-home cooking occasions continue to stay above pre-pandemic levels while Americans’ lives continue to get busier.” It “is the newest way to cook up concentrated flavor with just a squeeze while elevating meals quickly and affordably.”

I have to admit while our dining out habits are increasing a little bit for now I’ll probably hang out at home more often soon. I’ve been doing a lot of home cooking and will only end up doing more during fall and winter as the idea of hanging out in a crowded indoor space still doesn’t seem terribly wise to me. Campbell’s is betting on that too.

The new products are out nationwide via Amazon at a suggested retail price of $4.59. Campbells also informed me that the product will be placed in the dry seasoning aisle not the canned soups and broth aisle which is also uncharted territory for the brand. Is this a new era for Campbell’s? We’ll have to see. The red and white cans will always be there but maybe we’ll be seeing more colors from them in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vMTAyMzgzMi90aGUta2V5LXN0ZXAtY2hvYmFuaS1qdXN0LXRvb2stdG93YXJkLWdsb2JhbC1leHBhbnNpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Key Step Chobani Just Took Toward Global Expansion,"The Key Step Chobani Just Took Toward Global Expansion

It's been an eventful few years for Chobani. In 2019 it released its first oat milk and oat milk yogurts with plans to further expand its product line to include coffee creamers per CNBC. ""Our ambition has always been to go outside of yogurt and we're really prepared for it"" said Chobani President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Peter McGuinness.

According to a filing with the Security and Exchange Commission the company released in November 2021 Chobani holds 20% of the market share for yogurt. But in March 2022 McGuinness and a large portion of the company's executive team left the company (per The Wall Street Journal).

Now per a recent announcement Chobani is gearing up for another change in leadership this time in the name of expansion. But the company has its sights set on a much larger arena than the dairy aisle. Here's the key step Chobani just took toward global expansion."

They are making friends along the way with co-brands that Amex Chase and Citi would savor.

Record credit card accounts

First there was Apple which brought an addressable market of 113 million iPhone users in the U.S. Then came the GM card an iconic brand representing a base of 2.2 million car sales in the U.S. (and 61 million total General Motor vehicles on the road whether they be good bad or ugly). Now comes T-Mobile with 22 years in the U.S. market and 109 million customers.

What a way to build a credit card company. Prescreened prospective customers in three vertical markets. No branches to manage simply good names to harvest and solicit.

The strategy is disruptive to the U.S. credit card industry. Goldman Sachs entered the saturated credit card market four years ago and ramped up over one million accounts in record time. There were some stumblings such as the sexist claims about their credit decisioning. (Goldman Sachs was in the right and the claims were wrong.)

Credit Scores

Then there is the current issue of going too deep into low FICO Scores and having the worst charge-off rates in the business. Would you want to be the one to eye-to-eye with David Solomon and explain the Apple Credit Card posted sky-high credit losses of 2.93% for 2Q-2022? In comparison top U.S. credit card banks sit at only 1.84%. The best answer to the high-powered DJ is that the portfolio needs to cure for a few years.

Those losses will continue to outpace top issuers such as American Express Capital One Chase Citi Discover and Wells Fargo well into 2023. Still with a market capitalization of $107 billion Goldman Sachs can afford to learn about using credit scores as the guiding light for credit management decisioning.

American Express might select prime and superprime credit scores above the 720 cut-offs. Capital One and Discover know how to make things work with a deeper cut and have management processes engineered to address the market. But successful credit card companies know you cannot just cross your fingers and hope for the best. Credit quality matters. Safety and soundness is still the order of the day.

Cobrand Credit Card Machine

The big picture is that Goldman Sachs is executing a strategy and the goal is more significant than just putting out credit cards. They are getting into households. Read those numbers in the second paragraph again and think about the addressable market.

Goldman Sachs now will have an addressable market of more than two hundred million people. Sure there is an overlap between people with Apple phones and those with GM vehicles which now have T-Mobile accounts. I have two affinities and would bet you have at least one of the three relationships.

There are 258 million adults in the U.S. and Goldman Sachs has potential relationships with arguably more than half. Right now they have about 1% penetration but with three connections they have the potential to scale their business rapidly even as the economy goes into a tailspin.

Goldman Sachs has plenty of consumers to harvest over the next few years. They are building a card acquisition machine much like Chase. Chase is in 62 million households just about half of the number of U.S. households. But if you know U.S. history Chase dates to the Bank of Manhattan and Aaron Burr in 1799. Goldman will take some time strategy and luck to approach Chase’s prowess but after four years in the business this is a major league play for U.S. consumers. Goldman Sachs has been around since the end of the American Civil War but less than a decade in retail banking.

With co-brand partners Goldman will not need to go through the challenging learnings that American Express Capital One and Discover mastered without a branch banking network but booking a few more partnerships will soon address most credit-qualified households in the U.S. With lots of intelligent people at Goldman Sachs you can be confident their credit policy issues will quickly be mastered and they will increase competition in the U.S. market.

Overview by Brian Riley Director Credit Advisory Service at Mercator Advisory Group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vaW93YWNhcGl0YWxkaXNwYXRjaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yMy90d28taW93YS1jYXJlLWZhY2lsaXR5LXJlc2lkZW50cy1mcmVlemUtdG8tZGVhdGgtb25lLXdvcmtlci1mYWNlcy1hLW11cmRlci1jaGFyZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two Iowa care-facility residents freeze to death; one worker faces a murder charge • Iowa Capital Dispatch,"Two Iowa caregivers accused of failing to protect elderly Iowans who froze to death on their watch are now facing very different consequences.

One of the workers has been criminally charged with second-degree murder and faces up to 50 years of imprisonment if convicted while the other is facing no criminal charges and has been allowed to keep her nursing license.

The murder charge is highly unusual for a case involving a care-facility worker accused of neglect.

“I can’t say definitively that the state has never charged anyone with second-degree murder in these circumstances but if they have I am not aware of it” said Matthew S. Sheeley an assistant state public defender who is working the case.

“The two resident deaths were tragic and avoidable” said Toby Edelman senior policy attorney for the nonprofit Center for Medicare Advocacy and a nationally recognized expert in senior care. “Many people in each facility are responsible and should be held accountable for their obvious failures to keep the residents safe.”

“Every Iowan should be concerned about these tragic deaths” said John Hale a consultant and advocate for older Iowans. He said while Iowans should insist on justice for the families involved “all too often it’s the direct-care staff members that get blamed for these tragedies — and in some cases that may be warranted if they failed to act when they could have.”

He said in many cases facilities have a lack of sufficient staff provide scant training or use temporary workers who are not familiar with residents or the facility’s procedures. “When those additional factors exist the responsibility for tragedies goes beyond the direct care staff on duty – it also goes to supervisory staff facility management facility owners and corporate directors” he said.

The first of the two cases involves 95-year-old Elaine Creasey who on Dec. 9 2021 froze to death outside Keelson Harbour assisted living center in Spirit Lake. The second case involves 77-year-old Lynne Harriet Stewart a former state social worker who froze to death on Jan. 21 2022 outside Courtyard Estates at Hawthrone Crossing in Bondurant.

According to state records Creasey wandered from her room at Keelson Harbour and exited the building shortly after 10 p.m. on Dec. 8 2021. Because Creasey was known to wander the staff was instructed to perform hourly visual checks on her and the exit door was equipped with an alarm to alert the staff in case someone left the building.

But according to state records the temp-agency worker who was assigned to check on Creasey during the night – identified in Board of Nursing records as registered nurse Brooke Arndt of Lake Park – repeatedly failed to confirm Arndt was in her room and didn’t investigate the cause of the door alarm.

With Creasey outside a short distance from the exit door that had locked behind her the temperature dropped to a wind chill of 14 degrees.

About 7 a.m. the next day a worker went to Creasey’s room to check on her and noticed she was not in her apartment. A search was initiated and within a half-hour employees found her unresponsive lying on the ground outside the facility’s memory care unit.

The staff summoned an ambulance that transported Creasey to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival. The medical examiner later reported that his findings of hypothermia due to exposure were consistent with Creasey having exited the building about 10 p.m. the previous day.

Nurse: I wasn’t trained on bed checks

According to state inspectors Arndt told investigators she had performed all of the required visual safety checks on Creasey between midnight and 5 a.m. although she added she had not been trained on how to perform such checks.

She reportedly told the inspectors that when she performed bed checks she would open the door to a resident’s room leave the light off walk in a few steps and look for a silhouette of the resident in bed. She allegedly reported that she thought she had seen Creasey in bed each time she checked her room that night.

A review of the door-alarm system at Keelson Harbour allegedly showed the alarm had sounded at 10:07 p.m. indicating someone had exited the building and was shut off and reset by the staff nine minutes later.

When interviewed Arndt allegedly told inspectors that she had silenced the door alarm without checking on the residents or searching the area to see who might have left the building. Another worker at the home had told her not to worry about it she said.

Arndt also stated she was not sure what the door alarm signified or what had triggered it inspectors later reported and alleged she had not received any training on emergencies and door alarms.

The state inspections department fined Keelson Harbour $10000 for staff-training violations. Arndt was not criminally charged but the Iowa Board of Nursing charged her with committing an act that “causes injury” to a patient and with failure to properly assess evaluate or accurately document a patient’s status.

As part of a settlement agreement the board placed Arndt’s license on one year of probation and required her to complete 30 hours of additional professional education.

Creasey’s family is now suing both Keelson Harbour and the temp agency that employed Arndt accusing them of negligence and reckless disregard for another’s safety. The two companies deny any wrongdoing and a trial is scheduled for Aug. 15 2023.

The family has alleged Creasey’s hands and knees were covered in abrasions when she was found indicating “that she had been crawling around in the cold outside for some time.” They say Creasey “suffered immensely both physically and mentally before she passed away.”

Video shows worker ‘walking around’ facility

A few weeks after Creasey died 200 miles east of Spirit Lake Lynne Stewart froze to death outside the Courtyard Estates assisted living center in Bondurant.

As with Creasey Stewart was known to wander and was supposed to have been checked every hour.

State inspection records indicate a worker at the home — identified in court records as Catherine Forkpa 31 of Ankeny — was assigned to check on Stewart throughout the night.

The center’s records showed that Stewart exited the building about 9:40 p.m. triggering an alarm. By that time a separate alarm attached to the door of Stewart’s room had already been tripped. The two alarms triggered a series of alerts that appeared on a desktop computer used by the care facility’s staff and on the portable devices carried by each of the workers.

But on the night in question Forkpa was the only person working Stewart’s area of the building and surveillance video allegedly showed that instead of responding to the alarms she “walked around” the memory-care unit for hours.

The temperature outside meanwhile was dropping and eventually dipped to 11 degrees below zero state inspectors later reported.

For three hours of her shift Forkpa was allegedly off-camera and unaccounted for although police would later say the cameras trained on Stewart’s room showed that during her entire shift Forkpa made no effort to enter Stewart’s room and check on her.

Executive director slept through phone alerts

At 5:30 a.m the video showed Forkpa grabbing some breakfast for herself and walking to the dining room where she sat and ate. At 6:10 a.m. a worker who had been assigned to another area of the building looked at the nursing staff’s desktop computer and saw the door-alarm alerts for both Stewart’s room and the exit door at the end of Stewart’s hallway.

She immediately alerted Forkpa and the two quickly located Stewart outside on the ground with her body wedged against the exit door. An ambulance was summoned and paramedics rushed Stewart to a nearby hospital. Stewart they later reported was so stiff and cold they initially couldn’t record a body temperature. She had “ice freezing on her” the paramedics reported and there were abrasions on her head and hands.

Before the ambulance reached the hospital Stewart went into cardiac arrest. Paramedic Tim Huff and his crew tried to restart her heart but they were unsuccessful. Stewart was pronounced dead at the hospital.

Forkpa who had worked at Courtyard Estates for seven months was fired and four other employees were given written warnings for their failure to respond to the door alarms according to state records.

During the subsequent state investigation the facility’s executive director told inspectors that when she is at home she receives text-message alerts when doors alarms are triggered at the facility. She said that on the night in question she received a long series of alerts triggered by the two door alarms but she didn’t hear them as she slept.

Screenshots of the executive director’s phone indicate she received the first alert on her phone at 9:44 p.m. and continued to receive them every five minutes throughout the night inspectors alleged.

The facility’s on-call registered nurse received a similar series of alerts on her phone. She allegedly told inspectors she had noticed the recurring alerts but failed to respond to them because she was at home with her family and because she went to bed around 9:30 p.m.

The nurse reportedly told inspectors that in the past she had ignored alerts that were specific to Stewart’s room because of mechanical defects that caused that particular alarm to trigger constantly. Other employees including Forkpa reported the same problem to inspectors.

Caregiver charged with murder

The state fined Couryard Estates $10000 and cited it for having failed to give Forkpa the required 8 hours of dementia training during her first month on the job instead giving her only 4.75 hours of training. Courtyard Estates acknowledged the problem and later reported to the state that the training issue was corrected by having Forkpa fired.

Forkpa now faces a charge of second-degree murder by dependent adult abuse. If convicted on that charge she faces a term of imprisonment not to exceed 50 years and would have to serve 35 years before becoming eligible for parole.

Forkpa who immigrated to the United States from Africa in 2004 said she doesn’t believe the criminal charge is warranted. “I know in my heart I would never do anything to hurt anyone” she told the Iowa Capital Dispatch.

Polk County Attorney John Sarcone declined to comment on the case. A trial is scheduled for Nov. 14.

Police reports indicate that even before Stewart exited the building that night there were signs unnoticed by the staff she was preparing to leave.

According to the police Stewart appeared to have spent some time collecting her clothing and other belongings and carrying them down the hallway to the exit. She set a bag of personal items next to the door and draped some clothes over a nearby railing before walking out into the cold night air with the door locking behind her.

She had done this sort of thing in the past according to state inspectors telling the staff at Courtyard Estates that she was packing up her things and “going home.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vd2l6YXJkcy92aWRlb3MvY29yZXkta2lzcGVydC14LW1lZGlhLWRheS0yMDIy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corey Kispert x Media Day 2022,"Copyright © 2024 NBA Media Ventures LLC.

The cruise line industry has seen some unprecedented twists and turns over the last few years but it's started to rebound now that pandemic-related headwinds have lessened. Carnival (CCL -0.89%) and Royal Caribbean (RCL -0.49%) are two of the biggest players in the space and investors might be wondering which of these companies is the better investment now that trip demand is rebounding.

Read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors have very different takes on the question of whether Carnival or Royal Caribbean is the better buy.

Resiliency is key

George Budwell: Carnival's management painted a fairly optimistic picture about its ongoing recovery efforts from the COVID-19 pandemic when it reported 2022 second-quarter earnings back in June. During the three-month period cash from operations turned positive revenue rose by a healthy 50% from the prior quarter and booking rates on Carnival's leisure cruises were up substantially quarter over quarter.

Best of all Carnival was sailing into the busiest part of the year for the industry -- the third quarter. Even so Carnival's stock is still trading near its pandemic low. The cruise ship's equity in fact isn't far removed from its 52-week low right now.

Why are investors not buying into this turnaround story? The culprit behind Carnival's failure to launch so to speak on its overall positive Q2 report is the weakening global macroeconomic environment. Inflation is stubbornly high interest rates are on the rise and global supply chains are far from peak operating efficiency. In short Wall Street is concerned that these macroeconomic headwinds will spill over into the leisure cruising industry in the form of lower bookings and shrinking revenues in 2023. Unfortunately this key risk factor is hard to ignore given the stark warning signs that the U.S. and European economies are indeed headed for a slowdown.

Does this mean that investors ought to avoid cruise stocks altogether? Quite the contrary. The bottom line is that Carnival is the largest operator in the space and it has the liquidity necessary ($8.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at last count) to push through yet another hardship. So if you're looking for a value stock that could double or triple in value within the next two to three years Carnival should definitely be on your list. That being said investors will probably want to slowly build a position in this beaten-down cruise ship stock over the next six to 12 months as the company works through these ongoing challenges.

Royal Caribbean has been less dilutive and has less debt

Keith Noonan: While Royal Caribbean still has a major issue with debt on the heels of pandemic-related challenges it's taken a much lighter approach than Carnival to selling new shares in order to raise funds.

Both cruise stocks have seen huge sell-offs over the last year but dilution has been a contributing factor in Carnival posting the worse performance of the two and I think it remains a key risk factor for investors going forward.

On the other hand Royal Caribbean has been selling convertible notes and refinancing debt at relatively high interest rates recently and some of these notes will likely be converted into stock. With revenue for both companies still well below pre-pandemic levels I think Royal Caribbean's financial positioning and corporate governance have looked stronger than Carnival's lately. But it's clear that debt cash flows and the threat of continued dilution are risks for both cruise stocks.

Royal Caribbean has been increasing revenue per customer and recently posted its best-ever results along those lines. The company's high-end Celebrity and Silversea lines in particular look capable of driving high-margin sales as demand continues to improve. Both Royal Caribbean and Carnival saw cash from operations turn positive in the second quarter but both posted big losses due to high capital expenditures. There are signs that each business is on the path to recovery but Royal Caribbean's financial position and greater focus on the high-end market makes me think it's the better buy.

Which cruise stock should you invest in?

Both Carnival and Royal Caribbean are investment plays characterized by somewhat shaky financials rebounding sales and the potential for explosive turnarounds. These stocks seemingly trade at value-level prices but there's uncertainty about whether the underlying companies will be able to bounce back to pre-pandemic performance and pay down high levels of debt.

Carnival's business has higher levels of debt but it currently has more liquidity to navigate the turnaround and its beaten-down stock could have more upside if the company manages to improve its financial position. Royal Caribbean looks more sound in terms of fundamentals but it's also possible that this will be confounded by the company taking on more debt or pursing new share offerings to raise funds.

If you see the cruise industry making a strong recovery over the long term investing in both stocks could be the right move. Otherwise it's probably best to consider each company's financial position and business strengths to determine which has the more attractive risk-reward profile.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhhd2FpaW5ld3Nub3cuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjQvZWstZmVybmFuZGV6LW5vLWxvbmdlci1vZmZlcmluZy10aHJpbGwtcmlkZXMtZ2FtZXMtc2Nob29sLWNhcm5pdmFscy_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYXdhaWluZXdzbm93LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzI0L2VrLWZlcm5hbmRlei1uby1sb25nZXItb2ZmZXJpbmctdGhyaWxsLXJpZGVzLWdhbWVzLXNjaG9vbC1jYXJuaXZhbHMvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,E.K. Fernandez no longer offering thrill rides games at school carnivals,"HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Next year’s Punahou Carnival will not have any E.K. Fernandez thrill rides or games.

And neither will carnivals at other schools. Iolani and Mililani High have also been informed of the change.

In a letter sent out to families Punahou School said the highly anticipated carnival will be open to the public next year but rides will be limited to kiddie rides.

In a statement E.K. Fernandez President Scott Fernandez told Hawaii News Now that their “capacity to produce the Punahou Carnival at the same size and pace is no longer available” and not in their control. He said they are only able to provide to the school what is within their current capacity.

“In the past 24 hours after this story broke we have received many inquiries from the public expressing concerns about our reduced footprint at the Punahou Carnival” Fernandez said. “And our response is these are the consequences of governmental action over the past two years.”

Fernandez said the company along with other “non-essential” businesses that were shut down at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic saw a lot of business fallout including insufficient revenue resulting in layoffs.

“If the government doesn’t do more to help companies like ours recover this new normal will become permanent” Fernandez said.

Fernandez rides or games. The return of the carnival comes after two years of being limited mostly to students and their families.

What You Need To Know For 2023 the Punahou Carnival will welcome everyone again following two years of modified carnivals due to the pandemic



Most of the carnival’s staples will be back including malasadas jams and jellies haku lei the art gallery kiddie rides the Variety Show a musical put on by seniors and the White Elephant where used items are sold



However the E.K. Fernandez thrill rides and games will not be part of 2023's carnival

This year’s event will be held on Feb. 3 and 4. The theme is “Pun Prix ’23: Pedal to the Metal” and is inspired by the racetrack according to an email announcement from Punahou School.

Last year the carnival was a one-day event only open to current Punahou students faculty staff and their families. The Variety Show which is a musical put on by seniors was viewable online and the art gallery and auction had online sales. The carnival’s theme was “Back in Time to ‘99.”

The decision to limit last year’s carnival was made in Jan. 2022 after COVID-19 cases began to rise on Oahu due to the omicron variant.

In 2021 as the pandemic was in full swing the carnival was reimagined as a drive-thru with Punahou families picking up pre-ordered malasadas Portuguese bean Soup mango chutney lilikoi butter gyros and other carnival classics on campus. There were also pickup stations for plants Punahou gear and other online purchases. A drive-up movie was held on Punahou’s Middle Field where the Variety Show was screened.

For students there were kiddie games and a Carnival-themed scavenger hunt held during the school day. The cafeteria served carnival-inspired meals.

The theme for 2021 was “A Carnival Out of This World.”

In 2023 the Punahou Carnival will welcome everyone again. While most of the carnival’s staples will be back — the malasadas the games jams and jellies haku lei the art gallery the Variety Show and the White Elephant where used items are sold — rides will be limited to kiddie rides.

“Unfortunately E.K. Fernandez has advised us that they will not offer Punahou use of their thrill rides or games this year” Punahou said.

The president of E.K. Fernandez Shows Scott Fernandez told Spectrum News in an email that the state's actions during the pandemic which forced ""non-essential"" businesses to close has caused them to have insufficient revenue to pay longtime employees resulting in layoffs.

""Our capacity to produce the Punahou Carnival at the same size and pace is no longer available. Of course this is not in our control and now we can only provide to the School what is within our current capacity"" Fernandez said.

""E.K. Fernandez Shows has survived for 120 years in the State of Hawaii including WW l the 1918 pandemic 'the most deadly pandemic in modern times' WWll 'the deadliest war of all wars' and at no time during those catastrophic events had we ever been prevented from opening to the public. Only in the year starting in 2020"" Fernandez said. ""In fact every other state in our nation opened long before the State of Hawaii. Therefore the damage to so many businesses and traditional events lays at the feet of Hawaii's Government.""

The E.K. Fernandez rides are still part of other events such as the 50th State Fair which returned this summer after closing for two years due to the pandemic.

According to the Punahou website the Punahou Carnival has been a traditional event on campus that dates back to 1932 when students hosted the Oahuan Campus Carnival to fundraise for the yearbook. Their efforts garnered $240 for the Oahuan. Today the Punahou Carnival is a community event that’s spearheaded by the junior class along with hundreds of volunteers made up of students parents faculty staff and alumni. The annual event helps the class learn leadership skills and bond while also raising funds for the school’s financial aid program.

Correspondent

The life cycle of Lepidopterans the collective term for all butterflies moths and skippers is one that many of us were exposed to at an early age. These insects utilize the process of complete metamorphosis that begins with an egg that hatches into a larval stage known as a caterpillar. The caterpillars spend several weeks munching on their preferred host plant before transforming into a pupa called a cocoon or chrysalis where they will completely transform their bodies and emerge as a winged adult form. This feat is the subject of many early science lessons and teachers often bring living examples into their classrooms so their students can witness this incredible journey first-hand.

From an observation standpoint the adult stage is one most people are familiar with since butterflies and to a lesser extent moths are more visible simply due to their flying behavior making them more easily spotted. The caterpillars on the other hand tend to stay well hidden among the leaves of plants or way up in the canopy of trees where people rarely venture. There are some exceptions that I’ve discussed in this column before including the brown and black woolly bears that become prevalent each fall and the famous yellow white and black-striped caterpillars of the monarch butterfly but most other larval lepidopterans live in relative obscurity.

While I have heard many nature enthusiasts disagree over what they think is the “best” butterfly or moth I have found there is a general consensus regarding the most impressive caterpillar. To phrase it another way if we use the word “awesome” under its official definition as: inspiring great admiration apprehension or fear; then there is no caterpillar in Ohio that is more awesome than the one belonging to the Regal Moth (Citheronia regalis) aka the Royal Walnut Moth.

Most caterpillars are simply referred to as “butterfly/moth name” caterpillars with only rare exceptions such as the previously mentioned Woolly Bear (Isabella Tiger Moth) along with Tomato Hornworm (Five Spotted Hawk Moth) and a few others. The larva of the Regal Moth also falls into this category and if you’re unfamiliar with this species the name alone may give you some idea of what to expect – Hickory Horned Devil.

The Regal Moth belongs to the group known as royal or giant silkworm moths and most of its companions in this group have pretty impressive larvae that may reach the size of an average adult human thumb. The hickory horned devil however would fit more readily into a split-top bun opposed to a glove as they regularly reach the size of the hotdogs found in your local grocer’s deli. But hickory horned devils didn’t get their name based on size alone. These six-inch-long behemoths carry an imposing array of thorns and horns jutting out from various points around its body. The most formidable of these are two pair of arching orange and black barbed horns that sprout from just behind the caterpillar’s head.

Despite this dramatic display and staggering size the hickory horned devil is entirely harmless and the spikes are just for show. By this point in the year only a few stragglers can be found clinging to the twigs of walnuts sumac persimmon and their namesake hickories as most have already burrowed into the soil to overwinter in the pupal state. If you’re fortunate to find one of these monster moth larvae there’s no mistaking it for anything else. They truly are awesome creatures.

1984 was a major transitional year for music one that allowed hard rock party acts like Van Halen and new wave titans like The Police to rub elbows with pop stalwarts like Michael Jackson and Madonna. If you were a rock band especially one that fits into the English new wave scene then you had a real chance at superstardom. Unless of course you were The Cure.

The Cure were in a state of transition in 1984. The previous two years had seen the band abandon their goth roots (and most of their members) in favour of embracing the emerging synth-pop sound. Tracks like ‘Let’s Go to Bed’ and ‘The Lovecats’ were major hits in their home country but Robert Smith was still a cult figure in America. He was also a full-time member of Siouxsie and the Banshees taking away some of his commitment to The Cure.

That year saw the release of The Top a more explicitly psychedelic record than The Cure has ever produced before or since. Smith was largely on his own assisted only by drummer Andy Anderson and very occasionally by bandmate Lol Tolhurst. Without any major hits and a noticeable change in style The Top remains a bit of an enigma within The Cure’s discography. The same year that numerous rock bands went mainstream also saw The Cure completely uninterested in doing so.

Just take one look at the band’s live appearances at the time and you’ll understand why The Cure weren’t quite ready for middle-of-the-road MTV success. With a setlist that included psychedelic trips like ‘The Catepillar’ doom-laden goth rock like ‘The Hanging Garden’ and pop hits like ‘Let’s Go to Bed’ the version of The Cure from 1984 was eclectic but certainly not cohesive.

‘The Caterpillar’ remains the best illustration of this era of the band. Played frequently in 1984 and then rarely until the 2010s the song is a goofy lark that finds Smith chattering away and improvising on a violin an instrument he clearly didn’t know how to play. It’s not an unpleasant track by any means but it’s a bit too light and airy for The Cure who didn’t quite know how to make similar sunshine pop songs like ‘In Between Days’ and ‘Friday I’m In Love’ just yet.

The tides would once again after 1984. Bassist Simon Gallup would return Anderson would be fired and The Cure’s most commercially successful incarnation would take shape for 1985’s The Head on the Door. Hit singles like ‘Just Like Heaven’ and hit albums like Disintegration would be produced with this lineup and thanks to those successes The Cure would become an unlikely arena rock band towards the end of the 1980s.

Check out a performance of ‘The Catepillar’ down below."

Mike Johanns. Earlier in her career Anderson was a broadcast journalist.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9uZXdzLzQxMTI1OTMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asia Pacific Hotels & Hospitality Market Continues to Grow as Travel Demand Returns,"Confidence in Asia Pacific’s Hotels & Hospitality market continues to grow as borders reopen investment appetite increases and operating performance approaches pre-pandemic levels according to the latest research from CBRE.

The recovery is being largely driven by domestic travel demand particularly in North Asia and Pacific markets with overall tourist arrivals to Asia Pacific expected to reach pre-pandemic levels by 2024. While international arrivals to the region continue to rise they remain well below pre-pandemic levels. Markets that were quicker loosening restrictions for vaccinated travelers (Australia Singapore India Thailand) are seeing a much more pronounced return of tourists than those that retain stringent entry or testing policies (Korea Indonesia) or mandate quarantine periods upon entry (Japan mainland China Hong Kong SAR Taiwan).

“As borders reopen confidence is returning to the Asia Pacific hospitality sector confirming that when people can travel they will travel. The re-opening across the region has been fragmented with uncertainty around the opening of mainland China Hong Kong SAR and Japan borders somewhat weighing on tourism sentiment in the region” said Henry Chin Global Head of Investor Thought Leadership & Head of Research Asia Pacific.

Average Daily Rate (ADR) Occupancy and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) is trending higher in all Asia Pacific markets with a regional recovery to pre-pandemic levels expected by 2024. With the supply pipeline remaining limited in most Asia Pacific markets the risk of new hotels saturating the market is low putting less pressure on room rates and revenue. Operating expenses have increased significantly across all revenue streams particularly for labour costs and utilities.

Investment in Asia Pacific hotels rose to US$10.1 billion year-to-date as of August 2022—an increase of 17 percent year-over-year. Cross-border capital flows into Asia Pacific hotel assets have reached US$932 million since the beginning of 2021 driven predominantly by institutional investors. Investment was spread across a range of Asia Pacific markets with Korea accounting for the largest share at US$2.8 billion in the first half of the year followed by mainland China Australia Japan and Singapore.

“In an evolving economic climate daily pricing structure and flexibility of rate changes means hotels can provide an inflationary hedge. The loosening of border controls rising tourist sentiment and investors’ strong capital reserves are underpinning increased appetite for operational real estate with well-located high-quality hotel assets in key markets keenly sought after” said Steve Carroll Head of Hotels & Hospitality Capital Markets Asia Pacific for CBRE.

For samples with tetragonal symmetry as the one studied here the stripes order itself breaks the rotational symmetry of the ab-plane and therefore stripes with two different orientations show up related by a 90-degree rotation around c-axis. It has been found by neutron diffraction that incommensurate SDW at the lowest momentum transfer occur at wave vectors (1 − ε 0 0) where ε is a temperature dependent incommensurability value. CDW reflections can be detected separately in the k-space at (1 − q h  0 L) where q h = 2ε and L is odd. In this work we have investigated a La 1−x Sr x NiO 4 sample with a doping level of nominal Sr concentration x = 0.28 In previous X-ray diffraction studies on CDW in superconducting cuprates it has been found that both the correlation length as well as the reflection intensity decrease as superconductivity arises for T < T c 110. These results have been interpreted as evidence for competition between superconductivity and CDW order. However a recent study20 on SDW order in the same insulating nickelate as studied here shows that the SDW order decreases below 70 K while there is no onset of superconductivity. In this context it is also important to know the behavior of the CDW in particular at low temperatures. Thus we have measured the low temperature time fluctuations of the CDW peak with wavevector q CDW = (1 − 2ε)a* + c* by using resonant XPCS illuminating the sample by soft coherent X-rays with the X-ray energy tuned to the Ni 2p → 3d (L 3 ) resonance. The sketched experimental layout is shown in Fig. 1a. XPCS measurements have been performed at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. We collected time series of coherent X ray diffraction images of the CDW peak at different temperatures (see Fig. 1b and “Methods”). Thanks to the coherence of the X-ray beam the resonant CDW peak shows many speckles due to the disorder of the charge order domains in the coherently illuminated sample volume. The temporal evolution of the speckles reveals the dynamical behavior within the CDW order. To quantify this evolution we have determined the intensity autocorrelation function g 2 which leads to the modulus of the intermediate scattering function |F(q t)| through

Coherent X rays hit the sample placed at the 2θ angle of the CDW peak. A time series of X-ray coherent diffraction images allows to study the development of the speckle spatial correlations. The region of interest ROI inside the square where the intensity is more intense and stable has been used for analysis. (b) Images of speckle data recorded at T = 35 K T = 50 K and T = 65 K in the selected ROI at different times. The larger the delay time the more the speckle pattern differs from the initial one. (c) Autocorrelation function vs. delay measured at the indicated different temperatures. Experimental data are indicated by full circles along the solid lines fits obtained by using the stretched exponential model of Eq. (2). (d) Time delay τ extracted by fitting the |F(qt)|2 using Eq.

where <…> τ denotes the integration over the whole set of frames recorded for one temperature. We restrict our analysis to the central part of the Bragg peak indicated by the black square where peak intensity is high and more stable. We report no significant indications for different temporal behavior in different regions of the peak. We collected several time-series in the temperature range from 35 to 105 K; the square of |F(qt)| is shown for each of these temperatures in Fig. 1c. All curves show a characteristic exponential decay. We can distinguish two temperature ranges: in the first one (left panel) heating the sample up to 65 K the characteristic decay time increases (i.e. the curves shift to the right) while in the second regime for T > 65 K the dynamic behavior is inverted and the characteristic decay time decreases in agreement with previous works14. In order to quantify this behavior we fitted the autocorrelation function by a stretched exponential Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts (KWW) model:

$$ \left| {F(t)} \right|^{2} = e^{{ - (t/\tau )^{\beta } }} $$ (2)

where τ is the characteristic decay time of the dynamics β is the so-called stretching exponent. The results of least-squares-fits to the data for τ are summarized in Fig. 1d. The value of β scatters around 1.1 (1.1 ± 0.1). For decreasing temperatures the decay time τ grows down to 100 K in the yellow region by more than a factor ten. Then τ stays fairly constant in the 50–100 K range (grey region) and decreases again below 50 K. Thus we can clearly distinguish quasi-static (or ‘strongly pinned’) CDW puddles namely hard CDW in the 50–100 K range from more dynamical (or ‘weakly pinned’) CDW puddles namely soft CDW at both higher (T > 100 K) and lower (T < 50 K) temperatures.

In order to shed light on the correlation between the decay time τ and the in-plane correlation length ξ a we have plotted τ and ξ a  as a function of the temperature in Fig. 2a. The in-plane coherence length is given by \({\xi }_{a}=1/2\pi \Delta (H)\) where \(\Delta (H)\) is the full width at half maximum of the CDW peak (see “Methods”). The data show that soft CDW (small τ) occur in the presence of shorter correlation lengths (small ξ a ) at both low and high temperatures. It is known that the relation between the fluctuation times temperature and correlation length can be described by the activated dynamical scaling (ADS) model2122. In this model the competition between different interactions is controlled by the distribution of the energy barriers which typically evolve as a power of the length scale which characterize the process22. The model is appropriate to describe the glassy freezing of charge and spin stripes below 50 K as shown by measurements of temperature dependent dielectric responses31323334. In the ADS model the fluctuation time obeys to τ ~ exp(Cξz/T) where ξ is the correlation length and z the so-called dynamical critical exponent which is typically around 2 and C is a constant. The term Cξz times k B  the Boltzmann constant is an effective energy barrier height for activated fluctuations. We have developed our computer code for the ADS model introducing a constant correlation length \({\xi }_{a}^{0}\) to take structural defects of the sample into account. The dashed line in Fig. 3a shows the fitting curve to the measured characteristic decay times τ obtained by the modified ADS model

(a) Characteristic decay times τ of CDW (black full circles) along the fit (dashed line) extracted in the modified Activated Dynamical Scaling (ADS) model described by Eq. (3) as a function of temperature in logarithmic scale. The behavior of τ is compared with the (full diamonds) in plane coherence length ξ a . We observe how lower delays correspond to lower coherence lengths that is to smaller domains in both low temperature (light blue) and high temperature (yellow) regions.

The fit of τ as a function of T and ξ a extracted from the ADS theory is represented by the black dashed line. (c) The correspondence between time delays τ and domain size ξ a  for CDW has been compared with time delays and domain size in SDW measured in the same sample as reported in ref. 20.

Values of each single pixel have been obtained recording the CDW peak in a specific (x y) position of the sample. In order to reconstruct the spatial maps the sample has been scanned over an area of about 66 × 100 μm2 in steps of 2 μm in both directions. The scale bar shown in the upper frame corresponds to 20 μm. We can observe the narrow fluctuations of η that decays in few microns. On the other hand ξ a form puddles of about 10 μm of radius.

with \({\xi }_{a}^{0}\) = 7.56 nm z = 2.2 and τ 1 is an offset. The ADS model allows us to fit our experimental data fairly well in Fig. 2b where we plot the decay times τ and coherence lengths ξ a  as a function of the incommensurability η = 14/H where H is the CDW wavevector along the a* direction (see “Methods”). One key result of this work is that the soft CDW signal with short coherence lengths occurs both with lower and higher incommensurability values. The CDW behaviour alongside the ADS model has been compared with SDW behaviour described in20 in Fig. 2c. The full circles represent the experimental data while the dashed lines represent the fit of τ as a function of ξ a extracted from the ADS theory. The maximum values of τ and ξ appear at intermediate temperatures (50 K < T < 100 K) while we observe decreasing values of both τ and ξ a at low (T < 50 K) and high (T > 100 K) temperature range which provides compelling evidence of the non-monotonic temperature dependence. We observe that the maximum values of the decay time τ of SDW is around two times the maximum values of τ of CDW. At the same time also the coherence length ξ a of SDW domains are around two times the coherence length of CDW domains. This shows that larger domains (larger coherence length) present slower dynamics (larger decay time). Therefore the larger SDW puddles show slower fluctuations with larger characteristic decay times. The different coupling of spin and charge with lattice fluctuations could be at the origin of the different shape of τ(T) in SDW and CDW.

In order to unveil the differences between the spatial inhomogeneity of CDW in nickelates and the inhomogeneity observed in cuprates10 we used SµXRD to probe the local charge order via the mapping of the CDW superlattice peak. Above we have shown that there are two types of CDW in the nickelates: fast fluctuating CDW puddles with short coherence length soft CDW and slower fluctuating CDW puddles with longer coherence length hard CDW. Therefore we investigated how these two types of CDW are distributed in space focusing on the low temperature region where quantum fluctuations are expected for domain walls in incommensurate CDW.

We performed SµXRD measurements on the P10 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron. The spatial distribution of the CDW peak incommensurability η1935 and the in-plane coherence length ξ a  have been calculated as described in “Methods” and visualized over areas of 66 × 100 μm2 in steps of 2 μm in both directions. Maps collected by scanning over the same sample area in the low temperature region at T = 30 K T = 50 K and T = 65 K are shown in Fig. 3a. In the spatial maps red (blue) areas correspond to a higher (lower) CDW peak incommensurability and coherence length. We clearly observe a different texture made of larger domains in the coherence length maps. Figure 3b shows a statistical analysis of the CDW incommensurability and coherence length spatial distribution in terms of the probability density function PDF. At all temperatures the incommensurability distributions follow a narrow normal distribution attesting the good quality of our sample. The PDF are normally distributed but fluctuations of coherence length are larger over a factor 100 respect to the incommensurability fluctuations. This is confirmed by the spatial intensity correlation function G(r) (Fig. 3c) where r = |R i − R j | is the distance between x–y positions R k on the sample G(r) function shows that the spatial correlation of incommensurability decay quite fast inside the resolution limited distance of 2 µm while the spatial correlations of coherence lengths decay slower outside distances of r = 10 μm. Details on the G(r) calculations have been described elsewhere in44.

In Fig. 3d we show the reconstructed map for the decay rate given by τ−1 calculated point by point using the ADS model of Eq. (3) at each temperature T = 35 K 50 K and 65 K. The spatial inhomogeneity of the CDW rate fluctuations τ−1 has been quantified by studying the connectivity in the maps of τ−1 using standard cluster 2D percolation analysis50. We consider two adjoining pixels to belong to the same cluster if they are connected along the horizontal vertical or diagonal direction and have rate below a threshold values (τ−1)*. We have calculated all the forming clusters picking out the cluster with the largest extent as a function of (τ−1)*. When we find a spanning cluster with size equal to the system size the system percolates. Thus in each map of τ−1 measured at the three different temperatures in the low temperature regime we have calculated the percolation threshold p(τ−1) the spanning cluster size and the number of clusters formed. As found in XPCS measurements at T = 35 K and T = 65 K we got soft and hard CDW respectively given by the minimum and maximum value of time decay τ. The soft CDW with smaller coherence length ξ a and τ show a largest percolation threshold of the fluctuations rate τ−1. As CDW become hard with larger coherence length ξ a and τ the percolation threshold of the τ−1 rate fluctuations decreases as shown in Fig. 3e. In addition in the hard regime we find a larger number of forming clusters at low fluctuations rate τ−1 as reported in Fig. 3f. Thus this cluster analysis provides a further criterion to characterize the soft and hard CDW dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vc3RhdGV0ZWNobWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMi8wOS9ob3ctbWlzc2lvbi1jcml0aWNhbC1vcGVyYXRpb25zLWNlbnRlcnMtaW1wcm92ZS1wdWJsaWMtc2FmZXR50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Mission-Critical Operations Centers Improve Public Safety,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='statetechmagazine.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/2022/09/how-mission-critical-operations-centers-improve-public-safety (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026740166DA0>, 'Connection to statetechmagazine.com timed out.

Demi Busatta Cabrera collected more than $103000 between Aug. 1 and Sept. 9 — her best round of fundraising by far to defend the seat representing House District 114 that she won handily two years ago.

Her prior best round of fundraising this election cycle was last September when she amassed $67000.

A month and a half before the Nov. 8 election the freshman Representative from Coral Gables held about $372000 between her campaign account and political committee People Above Politics to fend off her comparatively underfunded challenger Democratic lawyer Adam Benna.

Several political committees donated to Cabrera’s campaign over the last month including the lobbying arms of the Everglades Water Trust Capital City Consulting and Florida Justice Association which each gave her $5000.

A Stronger Florida a political committee chaired by Rubin Turnbull and Associates Director of Operations Celeste Camm gave $4500.

In terms of sheer numbers no industry donated to Cabrera more since Aug. 1 than the health care sector. She received $3000 from Nashville-headquartered company Wellpath $2500 from Centene Management Co. and Orange Park Nursing LLC $2000 from Davita and insurance giant Humana and $1500 from pharma mammoth Pfizer.

Miami-based Independent Living Systems Florida Ambulatory Surgical Centers South Florida Vision Florida Medical Association Dade County Medical Association Council of Florida Family Practitioners and Florida Society of Anesthesiologists donated $1000 apiece.

Other non-medical trade groups and unions chipped in as well. Dade County Firefighters Local 1403 gave Cabrera $6000 her second-biggest contribution over the period. The Florida Engineers Political Action Committee gave $1000.

Cabrera’s largest check was for $7500. It came from Tampa-based holding company TECO Energy a subsidiary of Canadian multinational company Emera Inc.

Other noteworthy contributions included $5000 form Dosal Tobacco $4000 from Associated Builders and Contractors $4000 from companies belonging to Clewiston agriculture behemoth U.S. Sugar Corp. $3500 from NBCUniversal Media $2500 from Anheuser-Busch and $1000 from American Airlines.

Cabrera got ample help from the Republican Party of Florida which gave nearly $11000 worth of in-kind aid for campaign staff and research costs.

She also spent about $8500. Of that $1000 went to the campaign of Ivette Arango O’Doski who is running for the Coral Gables City Commission. Cabrera gave another $1000 to the failed judicial campaign of Renier Diaz de la Portilla younger brother to Miami City Commissioner Alex Diaz de la Portilla and former state Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla.

The preponderance of Cabrera’s spending $4300 went to Tampa-based campaign communications and consulting firm SimWins one of several companies and individuals Coral Gables City Commissioner Jorge Fors Jr. named in a defamation lawsuit he filed with the 11th Judicial Circuit Court Thursday.

Fors is suing Cabrara’s husband Kevin Marino Cabrera among others for partaking in a “civil conspiracy” to malign his public image ahead of the Nov. 8 election. The two men are competing in a runoff for the District 6 seat on the Miami-Dade County Commission.

Benna meanwhile raised just over $12000 between Aug. 1 and Sept. 9 through his campaign account and political committee Sunshine Priorities thanks to a blend of grassroots and organizational gains.

He also got a boost from the Florida Democratic Party which contributed $12400 worth of in-kind aid for campaign staff salaries payroll taxes and research costs.

He had more than $85000 remaining as of Sept. 9.

Nearly 40 people donated to Benna’s campaign with some checks coming in for as low as $1. Matthew Lonk senior director of sales at Orlando-based solutions company Stax Payments donated $1200. Former Miami Herald publisher David Lawrence founder and Chair of The Children’s Movement of Florida contributed $150.

He also accepted $2000 from government affairs firm DC-SOFL and $1000 each from Miami-based Affiliated Healthcare Centers and Tallahassee-headquartered political committee The Ballot Box PC.

Benna appeared to take a break from campaign spending throughout August and in early September. He reported spending just over $300 all of it on fundraising fees.

HD 114 covers part of Miami-Dade’s southern coast including portions of Palmetto Bay Pinecrest and a large chunk of Coral Gables.

The number of new Monkeypox cases is trending downward in the Houston area as vulnerable residents continue to get vaccinated.

As of Sept. 13 the 14-day rolling daily case average dropped by over 50% over the span of two weeks according to Dr. Ericka Brown health authority for Harris County Public Health.

“Fortunately it is behaving in the same manner that we are accustomed to seeing in African countries meaning the mode of transmission has not been different. The severity of illness has not been different” Brown said. “We are seeing a less severe illness which is what we would have expected in investigating what has happened in the African countries over the course of the last decades.”

As of Sept. 17 the county has seen 773 cases in total — with 593 of those cases specifically within Houston city limits according to the county’s Monkeypox dashboard.

Local health experts have pointed to an uptick in vaccinations as a major reason for the limited outbreak. As of Thursday the county had administered 5060 doses of the vaccine and the Houston Health Department administered just under 8000 total doses of vaccine according Dr. Janeana White the city’s deputy health authority.

Earlier this year a shortage of Monkeypox vaccines was a cause of concern for local health officials. However White said the concern has since been eased as the number of positive cases decrease each day and as supply of shots from the federal government increases.

“We as well as the county have no limitations right now on vaccine availability for individuals calling to make an appointment. There’s no long wait” White said. “We just urge anyone that meets those criteria for vaccination to please make an appointment to get vaccinated.”

The city is also currently taking samples from the city’s 39 wastewater treatment plants and testing them for Monkeypox.

White said they are currently reviewing limited data that only stretches back to the middle of September. She added that they hope further samples will help them identify any potential upticks in the spread of Monkeypox just as it has helped foresee future waves of COVID-19 cases.

“Right now we don’t have the ability to really assess the concentration which is what we’re going to need to be able to really monitor trends ” White said. “So we’ll have more to come as we get more information after looking at the concentrations.”

A massive backlog is responsible for slowing the process of getting those systems connected to the grid.

Brian Hiatt is one of those people as he looks at an elaborate stand-alone solar array next to his Waller County home ""I'm really curious and excited to get the chance to turn it on."" The project has been built for months designed to provide more than 21 kilowatts of electricity on a sunny Texas day.

RELATED: Home solar power installations quadrupled in Houston

Despite all that potential power production ""I'm getting zero right now"" he says. ""I do not have permission to operate from CenterPoint at this moment.""

The Public Utility Commission of Texas set rules for connecting solar systems to the grid and CenterPoint is responsible for inspecting and greenlighting each project in its coverage area. There are a lot of projects. Texas has the second-highest solar capacity behind California according to an industry analysis. CenterPoint has been unable to keep up leaving some customers like Brian Hiatt losing money.

""I'm actually paying for a system that's providing no value. So I'm basically paying double my monthly electric bill right now"" he says.

In a statement to FOX26 CenterPoint says in part ""...that processing time for solar panel installations has increased due to the growth in the number of applications... by more than 100% since the start of 2022.""

To address the problem CenterPoint says it's hiring more people to handle the load using an updated process that allows applications to be approved more quickly and trying to quickly resolve any problems that may be identified with a project.

Brian Hiatt hopes it works soon. He's getting tired of waiting ""I'm already 12 weeks post-installation. That's considerably outside the two to four week expectation that I had when I started this process back in March.""

Despite some complaints from frustrated solar customers who've emailed FOX 26 who believe there's an incentive for the approval process to go slow because it takes money out of the grid CenterPoint insists that it supports renewable energy including the installation of solar panels. It could just be that solar 'popularity' is moving faster than 'capability' for now.

""Some of the best use cases for electric vehicles are in places like Texas places where people spend more time in their vehicles where you drive longer distances than in a dense coastal city and therefore spend more money on gas and therefore would save more money provided you can afford an electric vehicle which is why we're fighting to make electric vehicles cheaper"" Buttigieg told a crowd in a wide-ranging interview at the Texas Tribune Festival.

The $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law which Buttigieg helped usher through Congress last year includes $7.5 billion for electric vehicle charging infrastructure and $7 billion for supply chains related to the minerals necessary for electric cars.

An extensive charging station network will be necessary in Texas the second-largest state in America with about 3400 miles of interstate highways.

CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRIC CAR MANDATE COULD SPREAD TO OVER A DOZEN STATES

Multifamily homes which are common in large metro areas like Dallas Houston San Antonio and Austin present their own challenges due to a lack of at-home charging but Texans in rural areas may not have the same problem.

""In rural areas you have a higher proportion of people living in single family homes. Remember it's considerably easier to solve the charging puzzle if you have the benefit of living in a single-family home"" Buttigieg said. ""You just plug it in here plug it into your garage.""

Texas' overtaxed power grid could also be a barrier for the transition to electric vehicles with extreme weather events in the winter and summer making the availability of electricity hit-or-miss at times.

The Texas Department of Transportation noted that a February 2021 winter storm shut down the power grid for days in some parts of Texas. More recently the Electric Reliability Council of Texas called on residents to conserve power in July during a heat wave that stretched the grid thin.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO SPEND $3 BILLION ON BATTERY PRODUCTION TO MEET BIDEN'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE GOAL

Buttigieg noted that some electric vehicles can actually reverse-charge and act like a generator.

Dr. Christopher Yang a urologist based in Austin actually used his Rivian R1T pickup truck as a backup power source to perform a vasectomy at his clinic earlier this month according to WGLT.

""I’m not sure that this (vasectomy) should be planned use of the truck"" Yang told the local news outlet. ""But it’s definitely great to have that as a backup just in case.""

The Inflation Reduction Act which Congress passed last month added a $7500 tax credit for consumers who purchase an electric vehicle but only if the car's final assembly takes place in North America.

Texas also already offers a $2500 rebate for purchasing an electric vehicle."

We're living in Robinhood's world now.,"The old way a financial brokerage made money was to charge a fee whenever someone bought or sold stock. A company like TD Ameritrade or Charles Schwab would charge $4.95 or $6.95 (or whatever) in exchange for facilitating the buying and selling. That was a big cost of trading and it was in addition to the user paying fractionally more than the last price to buy or getting fractionally less than the last price to sell. Maybe this was a good thing to some extent. Maybe it discouraged people from trading too often and maybe that was useful because buying and holding stocks has often been a sound strategy. Putting a cap on trading by making it a pain for a lot of people was useful.

This isn’t how it is anymore though. There are still trading methods that require a commission like if you ask a human for help but the Schwabs and Ameritrades of the world stopped charging those fees for standard online trades in 2019 or so. This shift was a long time in the making but the firm most credited for pushing the industry over the edge to commission-free trading is Robinhood. The company says its mission is to “democratize finance” and while that’s brandspeak it’s a fair reflection of how it has operated. More people are going to be more inclined to do something if they aren’t paying a fee. Robinhood helped to build that world.

Something has to replace commissions because brokers still have to make money. What Robinhood settled on was a practice called payment for order flow. It works because Robinhood doesn’t actually hold stocks. Robinhood connects a person who wants to trade stocks with a market-maker who actually has the stock or can quickly get it. The market-maker makes its money by buying stocks for a tiny hair less than it sells them and pocketing that spread many millions of times on many millions of trades. The market-makers need trades for this to work and Robinhood provides them en masse. The companies pay Robinhood to fill those trades—for that order flow—and that makes up most of Robinhood’s revenue. It was about 63 percent of Robinhood’s receipts in the second quarter of 2022 and it was closer to 80 percent in recent quarters in which the stock and crypto markets were not careening into a crater according to a recent federal filing. Payment for order flow for crypto is slightly different but mechanically similar; Robinhood calls it “transaction rebates.”

For the past year a cloud has hung over Robinhood and to a lesser extent the rest of the online brokerage industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been skeptical of payment for order flow and its chairman Gary Gensler said in August 2021 that the SEC might ban the practice. Robinhood argued against that pointing out that the lack of commissions made trading more accessible particularly in small amounts. Robinhood is now a public company so it has to be bracingly honest with investors about risk factors and it has been clear in its filings that anything bad that might happen to payment for order flow would also be very bad for Robinhood. Even negative publicity around it would be bad. But now that cloud has just about lifted. The SEC will not ban payment for order flow the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. It could yet curtail it in ways that would make it less profitable the paper said.

It’s great news for Robinhood which avoids the evaporation of most of its business model. But more than that it entrenches something fundamental about how stock trading will work for retail investors in the United States for the foreseeable future. We’ll have more freedom and access to the stock market than ever. We’ll also be subject to a range of negative forces that Robinhood for instance has exerted on its users before. There’s good in it and there’s bad in it. But mainly there’s no going back from it.

Before legacy brokerages followed its lead into the zero-commission world Robinhood arguably had as much in common with Facebook or Visa as it did with E*TRADE. Facebook and Visa make their users the product by selling their huge communities of social networkers and credit-card holders to advertisers and merchants respectively. Robinhood does the same by way of payment for order flow. Its main customers aren’t the people who download its app but the market-makers who fill those people’s orders. (Robinhood does have a subscription product that makes up a minority of its revenue it’s worth noting.)

This is good for many people who want to trade stocks. They don’t pay any money to trade instead of paying $5 increments (or whatever) that add up over time. The technology on these apps is mostly good I think although I have never done anything more than thumbed around on Robinhood. Some have argued that it’s too good even for how attractive it makes it to trade. Payment for order flow sounds slimy because you can imagine (and actually don’t even need to imagine) a company like Robinhood sending trades to a market-maker that wasn’t offering the best prices for its users and then taking payments that smell a lot like kickbacks. Robinhood says that the private market-makers it uses tend to offer better prices for users than a public stock exchange would. On the whole it usually does not seem to be that insidious. Trading has a cost for the user and this structure lowers it a lot even as it makes a fortune for a market-maker and keeps Robinhood’s entire business afloat. The SEC not banning payment for order flow means that trading will remain cheap if you want to trade for cheap.

There are uncomfortable conflicts though even beyond cases where a brokerage might be tempted to take sides between a market-maker and someone trading on an app. Robinhood has not gotten in any trouble on that front for a few years now. The more fundamental conflict is the one between Robinhood’s interests and those of the actual users—or between users and any other brokerage relying on payment for order flow. Robinhood calls payment for order flow “transaction-based revenue” because that’s what it is: money that Robinhood makes when users trade even if it doesn’t take it in commission form.

Robinhood wins when you trade more. Of course that would also be the case under a commission structure. But a commission is a natural brake pedal on trading a ton and Robinhood has something more like the opposite: no fees a platform that the company designed to look almost like a video game and a parade of features and bugs that have over the years encouraged users to trade trade trade and trade again leading to a $70 million fine that the company paid shortly before going public in 2021.

If it turns out that it is good for retail investors to be relentlessly encouraged to trade stocks and crypto rather than to buy and then hold for long periods then this will be a situation in which everybody wins. Robinhood has in the past declined to talk about how its users’ portfolios perform. Several academics released a paper in the Journal of Finance in 2020 that found that Robinhood users did worse than the market. They acknowledged that the platform draws inexperienced traders but wrote that the gap was driven in part by the app’s features. It’d be interesting to learn how that compares to freelance stock-pickers who try to beat the market on other platforms. It would also be nice to get comprehensive data on how investors in payment-for-order-flow environments do compared to market averages.

None of this is to say that the SEC needed to ban payment for order flow. Gensler the boss of the SEC knows quite a lot about financial markets and has a regulatory aggression that has annoyed Wall Street. (That seems like a useful trait in an SEC chairman.) His agency spent some time on the issue and isn’t banning it. Meanwhile it would be infantilizing to say that retail investors need to be saved from themselves aren’t smart enough to use apps like Robinhood safely and would be better off paying commissions. But the pendulum shouldn’t swing too far in the other direction either. Apps like Robinhood can be a good place for people to make their money work for them in a less burdensome and expensive way than ever. They can also be a way for a company to guide its navy of users directly into a bank of rocks while getting paid to do it. Whatever the larger truth of Robinhood is we’ll all get to find out likely in perpetuity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lcmR3YWxsZXQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaW52ZXN0aW5nL2NyeXB0by1yb3RoLWlyYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can You Hold Cryptocurrency in a Roth IRA?,"Owning cryptocurrency directly in your Roth IRA is possible but to do it you’ll need to open an account with a niche platform that offers it as an option.

The advantage of investing in a Roth IRA instead of a standard brokerage is the tax savings: You won’t pay capital gains taxes on the sale of any investments that increase in value. Given the upside associated with high-risk investments the savings could be significant though the risk of loss is also high.

Although major Roth IRA account providers also called custodians typically don’t offer direct investing in cryptocurrency they often have alternative crypto-related investments including coin trusts futures and stocks with crypto exposure.

Pros

Potential to make big gains and not pay taxes on them.

Could be a way to increase your portfolio’s diversification.

Cons

Returns aren’t guaranteed and high-risk investments aren’t appropriate for everyone’s retirement timeline or goals.

Direct ownership probably requires working with a small relatively new custodian.

Fees can take a bite out of your holdings. Expect at least 1% to 2% for every purchase and sale for crypto IRAs; by contrast most major custodians don’t charge trading fees.

If you work with a financial planner they might not be equipped to advise on crypto.

» Crypto and taxes: Don't let tax season catch you by surprise

Cryptocurrencies and Roth IRAs

First a few basics about Roth IRAs and what the IRS allows:

A Roth IRA is a retirement account in which you can add after-tax dollars and make investments with those contributions. You are not taxed on any investment gains your investments might have. If you take withdrawals before retirement age you’ll be penalized.

The Internal Revenue Service issues rules that govern how these types of accounts work including what types of investments you can make within them. You can’t for example hold artwork or a coin collection. Holding virtual currencies in these accounts is allowed however.

New contributions to your account must be made in cash; you can’t transfer cryptocurrency you already own into a Roth IRA.

The IRS does not review approve or endorse investments. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission which regulates U.S. derivative markets has warned investors “to be cautious of sales pitches touting ‘IRS approved’ or ‘IRA approved’ virtual currency retirement accounts.”

Owning cryptocurrency directly: What you should know

Major platforms don't offer this option

It’s important to distinguish between what’s allowed in Roth IRAs and what various custodians offer.

Just because IRS rules allow cryptocurrency to be held in a Roth IRA doesn’t mean that custodians must offer the option to their customers. Many popular custodians including Vanguard and Charles Schwab don’t.

However there are custodians that do allow you to hold crypto in a Roth IRA including Bitcoin IRA Bit IRA and iTrustCapital. These firms focus almost exclusively on cryptocurrency investing; you won’t have a list of stocks mutual funds ETFs or other investment types available to you as you would with a traditional financial firm.

Transaction fees apply

Fees when buying crypto can be high and in some cases they're not transparent compared to traditional investment firms. You might also see additional fees like startup fees that are uncommon with traditional IRA custodians.

It’s common for crypto platforms to charge 1% to 2% on each transaction. What does that look like? If you bought $1000 in crypto and later sold it for $2000 you would be charged $30 to $60.

Most major custodians don't charge transaction fees. Investment funds such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds have expense ratios but it’s common to find low-cost options. For example if you bought $1000 of an index fund that had an expense ratio of 0.02% and the value increased by $100 each year for 10 years you would pay a total of $29 in fees for the entire decade.

You might need a separate IRA for traditional investments

You might consider cryptocurrency to be one component of a diversified portfolio alongside traditional investments. But crypto IRAs typically don’t allow you to hold traditional investments. So how can you hold both?

One option would be to open Roth IRAs at two or more custodians. The IRS sets limits on the amount of new money you can add each year to the Roth IRA accounts you own but there isn’t a limit to the number of accounts you can have. For example you could set up a Roth IRA for traditional investments and add $1000. You could then open a second Roth IRA with another company — one that accommodates cryptocurrency — and add $500.

If you already have a Roth IRA account another option would be to roll over a portion to a new account dedicated to crypto.

Alternatives to owning crypto directly

If you’re willing to be flexible you can gain financial exposure to cryptocurrency without owning cryptocurrency directly. Many established custodians like Charles Schwab and Fidelity offer crypto-related investment products.

Stocks

Publicly traded companies create much of the physical and digital infrastructure used in the crypto world. Coinbase for example is a popular crypto trading platform and also a publicly traded company. Payment companies like Block (parent company of the Square brand) and PayPal are building crypto lines of business. Chip manufacturer Nvidia is closely associated with crypto miners. If you don’t like picking individual stocks ETFs like iShare’s Blockchain and Tech ETF bundle many crypto-adjacent companies into one investment product.

Trusts

The closest you can come to owning cryptocurrency in a Roth IRA with a traditional custodian is through a crypto trust. Crypto trusts are crypto-holding legal entities that you can invest in. Like other publicly traded securities they have ticker symbols and shares that can be purchased.

Trusts make owning crypto easily accessible through conventional means but it also results in a product that doesn’t always track volatile prices with the fidelity that investors might want. Nevertheless it’s a relatively easy way to track the movement of a specific cryptocurrency without actually buying it.

Futures

Crypto futures are another product created to mimic the price of select cryptocurrencies. Unlike crypto trusts these products do not hold any cryptocurrencies. Instead managers trade futures — time-limited contacts that give the right to buy or sell a product at a certain price — to attempt to capture the price of a cryptocurrency or group of cryptocurrencies.

The costs associated with futures trading and the inherent uncertainty in futures trading mean the price might lag the actual price of the underlying coin. You can trade futures directly which is complex or you can buy an ETF that uses this strategy.

The result of the PoC will enable Charter to see and manage all of the devices behind the customer premises equipment/gateway in the home connected to a wired network. ""That doesn't exist today"" Manish Jindal group VP of wireless research and development at Charter said this week at a Light Reading-hosted session focused on the cable industry's network and service convergence activities.

Figure 1: Charter's 3GPP PoC strives to ""show the art of the possible"" Charter's Minish Jindal said.

The general idea is to ""show the art of the possible"" said Jindal a former Ericsson and Nokia exec who joined Charter in 2017.

Update: As a current 3GPP does not have the capability to handle wired networks that's the area in which Charter (and others) are working with CableLabs to enhance the standards.

That idea was one of several Jindal made note of during a keynote presentation pertaining to Charter's approach to convergence. That convergence activity is percolating as Charter seeks ways to bridge and manage the services it's offering on its existing and expanding wired networks along with mobile services underpinned by a hybrid platform. That hybrid approach includes Charter's MVNO relationship with Verizon and the development and deployment of Charter's own wireless infrastructure including Wi-Fi access points and the emerging use of CBRS small cells deployed in concentrated high-use areas.

Today's wired and wireless networks are fairly disparate and work independently. ""That's not exactly what the customer eventually wants"" Jindal explained. The customer he said wants applications and services that are seamlessly available on any network and on any device.

It's a tall order but Jindal said Charter is exploring that through several areas such as a common policy engine and a converged core that enables ""service persistence"" as the customer moves from one access technology to another whether that's on DOCSIS fiber Wi-Fi or cellular.

""Our vision the long-term vision is for fixed/mobile convergence to deliver ubiquitous wired and wireless connectivity to our customers anywhere on any device"" he said.

Four 'pillars' of convergence

He noted that Charter and other elements of the cable community are working with CableLabs to get there. Part of that work has pinpointed four ""pillars"" that will drive that convergence: common identity converged core access convergence and a common policy engine.

The common identity piece will ensure that the service is correlated to the head of the household but also account for other individual users on the account.

The converged core strives to align the application policy and regulatory requirements for a common network as users access services via fiber Wi-Fi mobile and DOCSIS. A converged core provides an ""anchor"" to ensure that the connectivity of an app doesn't break as a user moves from one network to another Jindal explained.

The access convergence piece ties partly into the use of small cells that are connected to the cable network taking advantage of its power space and backhaul capabilities. Marrying small cells to the HFC plant illustrates a ""perfect example"" of how those worlds can come together Jindal said.

As envisioned the common policy engine will enable Charter to provide a common set of services across different access technologies. ""When you install a service it should be enabled for all access technologies so you don't have to develop the same services the same set of features multiple times for multiple access technologies – that's what convergence looks like"" Jindal said

He admits that these ideas have been tried before with limited success but believes that the tech ecosystem is now ready to support them. Taking advantage of key elements such as virtualization disaggregation and the use of open standards puts Charter and other operators in position to build a common core that can control both wired and wireless technologies he said.

""The more aligned we are as an MSO community the better it is for our vendors also because then they know that this is going to see the light of the day"" Jindal said.

Jindal also put forth several convergence use cases including automated wireless backup an idea that CableLabs subsidiary Kyrio is already focused on.

And other use cases are already making it into the market. Charter for example has introduced Spectrum Mobile Speed Boost a feature that lets Spectrum Mobile customers receive faster speeds on their mobile device when connected to the home Wi-Fi network.

Jindal said that policy engine idea could be taken to the next level pointing to an example in which a Charter customer taking the company's home broadband/mobile bundle could also get a speed boost when accessing a Charter Wi-Fi access point located at another customer's home.

""We're just scratching the surface at this point in time but we do think [convergence] will drive very powerful opportunities for us"" Jindal said.

More convergence chat

A follow-up panel also explored the cable industry's evolving convergence play. Here are a few nuggets from that:

CableLabs has teamed with Red Hat and other partners on a 10G Lab focused on a virtualized access network architecture featuring virtual converged cable access platforms (vCCAPs) virtual RANs and cores. More than 20 vendors have been integrated on the HFC and 5G side of the equation according to David Debrecht VP of wireless technologies at CableLabs. The current setup includes six different vRAN vendors running on a unified platform based on OpenShift chips and Kubernetes.

Red Hat has been focused on ensuring that the environment is not only scalable secure and multi-tenant but can support disparate apps from disparate ecosystem partners without them competing for resources. ""The orchestration engine behind it pays attention to all of that for not only for the ecosystem partners but also in this case CableLabs as an operator to make sure that everything runs nice and harmoniously"" Rob Wilmoth chief architect of Red Hat's North America service provider team said.

Thuy Nguyen GM of Intel's cable segment noted that his division is focused on communication service providers with expertise in wireless RAN and cable and PON infrastructures. The broad idea is to understand how those workloads can be optimized to run on chips that can operate on generic platforms he said.

Victor Esposito VP of architecture and engineering at GCI said the Alaskan operator runs both wired and mobile networks. Its 3G 4G and 5G cores are all different today. ""We're really looking at taking advantage of convergence in all the areas where it makes sense"" he said. Consumers Esposito added ""just want to get on a device and get it to work.""

Editor's note: The headline and summary of the story was adjusted to note that the proof-of-concept underway is not focused on a 3GPP core that can manage wired networks but a common or converged core based on 3GPP than can manage wired networks. That the story added is where Charter and others are working with CableLabs to enhance the standards.

Or so it appeared.

What You Need To Know In the final days of his last big league season Albert Pujols joined Barry Bonds who had 762 homers Hank Aaron with 755 and Babe Ruth at 714 in one of baseball’s most exclusive clubs





Pujols’ historic homer was a three-run shot against reliever Phil Bickford





Pujols took extra pleasure in making his mark at Dodger Stadium where he said he regained his joy for the game while with the Dodgers last season





Before the game the Dodgers honored Pujols and catcher Yadier Molina both of whom are retiring at season’s end

Now showing the pop of his youth in the final weeks of his career the 42-year-old slugger got there with two long shots.

Pujols hit his 700th home run connecting for his second drive of the game and becoming the fourth player in major league history to make it to the milestone as the St. Louis Cardinals routed the Los Angeles Dodgers 11-0 Friday night.

Pujols joined Barry Bonds (762 homers) Hank Aaron (755) and Babe Ruth (714) in one of baseball’s most exclusive clubs.

“Don’t get me wrong I know where my places stand in this game but since Day One when I made my debut I was never about numbers never about chasing numbers"" Pujols said. ""It was always about winning championships and tried to get better in these games.”

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gushed about Pujols' accomplishment.

“This is like the Mount Rushmore of sluggers so to reach that 700 home run mark it’s remarkable” Roberts said.

A man wearing a blue Dodgers shirt with Hideo Nomo’s No. 16 on the back snagged the 700th homer ball. He was whisked under the stands as he clutched a black glove containing the historic souvenir ball to his chest. Prolonged negotiations went on before the man was escorted out of Dodger Stadium flanked by 10 security personnel and into a waiting SUV.

“Souvenirs are for the fans” Pujols said. “I don’t have any problem if they want to keep it. That's why the fans come here to have a special moment of history.”

Stirring up images of his dominant days as a three-time NL MVP Pujols hit No. 699 in the third inning then launched No. 700 in the fourth.

A 37-year-old Los Angeles man Cesar Soriano snagged No. 699. He turned the ball over to security after being told he could meet Pujols.

It’s been a remarkable and resurgent run for Pujols. This was his 14th home run since the start of August for the NL Central-leading Cardinals and his 21st of the season.

Roberts marveled at the improbability in July of Pujols making history in late September.

“I wouldn’t doubt him but the stars seem to kind of have to align for it to play out like this” Roberts said. “I don’t think Albert even thought it was a possibility.”

Now no one needs to wonder whether Pujols would've come back for a few extra swings next year had he finished this season at 699 or so.

Pujols took extra pleasure in making his mark at Dodger Stadium where he said he regained his joy for the game while with the Dodgers last season.

“It’s pretty special especially with the Dodgers fans to do it here” Pujols said. “And you get to see both sides they get to enjoy this and to do it in a Cardinals uniform is really special.”

Pujols’ historic homer was a three-run shot against reliever Phil Bickford. The ball landed in the first couple of rows of the left-field pavilion the same location his two-run shot touched down the previous inning off left-hander Andrew Heaney.

“At first I was upset ... and then when the crowd reacted and seen all the smiles it was a very special moment for MLB” Bickford said. ""Albert Pujols is one of the most amazing people I’ve ever met.”

Pujols jogged around the bases smiling all the way. After crossing the plate and pointing his fingers skyward Pujols went over to greet fellow Dominican Republic and former Dodgers star Adrian Beltre. They high-fived through the protective netting.

Then he was off to the Cardinals dugout getting hugs and congratulations every step of the way.

Pujols received a prolonged standing ovation from the crowd — he finished out last season while playing for the Dodgers. He took a curtain call raising his cap in acknowledgment.

The crowd of 50041 chanted “Pujols! Pujols!” The fans finally sat down after being on their feet in anticipation of seeing history.

Later in the Cardinals clubhouse his teammates “gave me a little shower a little toast” Pujols said.

Pujols' 700th homer gave him a couple of other nice round numbers too — he has hit 500 home runs off right-handers and 200 off lefties.

His achievement was celebrated beyond Chavez Ravine.

At Chase Field in Phoenix the San Francisco Giants were meeting on the mound when the 700th homer was shown on the videoboard prompting veteran third baseman Evan Longoria to applaud along with the Diamondbacks’ crowd.

At Target Field in Minneapolis Shohei Ohtani pitched the Los Angeles Angels to a win and then said through an interpreter: “I’m really glad he got to 700. ... It was an honor to be a teammate of his. He’s raking this year so it feels like he’s got a lot more left in the tank.”

Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martinez tweeted about his fellow star from the Dominican Republic: “You are the man!!”

Pujols connected twice on the same night New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge remained on deck for home run history. He remained at 60 homers just short of tying Roger Maris’ AL mark of 61 in 1961 in a win at Yankee Stadium.

Lars Nootbaar Juan Yepez and Alec Burleson also homered for St. Louis.

Pujols struck out swinging in his first at-bat against Heaney and grounded out to short in the sixth. He was replaced in the eighth by Burleson who added a pinch-hit homer.

José Quintana (6-6) got the victory. He scattered five hits over 6 2/3 innings and struck out six.

Cardinals outfielder Corey Dickerson pitched the ninth. With the bases loaded he retired Trayce Thompson on a flyball to end the game.

Heaney (3-3) was tagged in the most-lopsided loss this year for the NL West-leading Dodgers.

Pujols snapped a tie with Alex Rodriguez for fourth on the career list when he hit career homer No. 697 against Pittsburgh on Sept. 11.

Batting .189 on July 4 Pujols started to find his stroke in August swatting seven homers in one 10-game stretch that helped St. Louis pull away in the division race.

Pujols has enjoyed a productive season after returning to St. Louis in March for a $2.5 million one-year contract. It’s his highest total since he hit 23 homers for the Angels in 2019.

He plans to retire when the season ends.

Pujols began his career in St. Louis. He was selected by the Cardinals in the 13th round of the 1999 amateur draft and won the 2001 NL Rookie of the Year award.

He has hit at least .300 with at least 30 homers and 100 RBIs in each of his first 10 seasons. He helped the Cardinals to World Series titles in 2006 and 2011.

He set a career high with 49 homers in 2006 — one of seven seasons with at least 40 homers. He led the majors with 47 homers in 2009 and topped the NL with 42 in 2010.

Pujols left St. Louis in free agency in December 2011 signing a $240 million 10-year contract with the Angels. He was waived by the Angels in May 2021 and then joined the Dodgers and hit 12 homers and drove in 38 runs in 85 games.

Trainer's room

Dodgers: All-Star RHP Tony Gonsolin (forearm) will throw two innings in a rehab assignment Tuesday for Triple-A Oklahoma City. ... LHP David Price (wrist) will throw to live hitters again in a couple days.

Honoring Pujols and Molina

The Dodgers honored Cardinals teammates Pujols and catcher Yadier Molina both of whom are retiring at season’s end.

The players were greeted by a standing ovation when they strode to home plate before the game. Their career highlights were shown on the stadium’s big screens.

Both players were presented with white golf bags before Pujols took the mike and thanked his former teammates and fans for treating him well during his lone season in LA last year.

The past year has been painful for stock investors. The S&P 500 index which tracks 500 of the largest U.S. stocks is down 11% at this writing on Sept. 21 and over 19% below its 52-week high. Every single sector is down at least 4% from its high. The only stock sector that's delivered blowout returns so far this year is the energy sector; the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF is up 70.5% in total returns with almost 7% of those gains due to dividends.

Needless to say this has investors -- especially those looking for dividends -- very interested in energy stocks right now. Two in particular are getting a lot of attention: Chevron (CVX 0.22%) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.59%). This makes sense considering they're both cash-cow giants with strong dividends yielding 3.6% and 7.2% respectively at recent prices. But before buying either of these two giants investors should also take a close look at Phillips 66 (PSX -1.44%) another diversified giant with a 4.6% yield and a better record of growing its payout.

What makes Phillips 66 different

While both Chevron and Enterprise Products are strong companies (I own Enterprise Products too) there are some characteristics of Phillips 66 that are very compelling. Most importantly they're things that can make it a strong investment across the energy cycle supporting its dividend when we go from today's high oil prices to periods of oversupply that send prices -- and profits for oil producers -- down.

Like Chevron Phillips 66 is a diversified integrated oil and gas company. Its operations include midstream operations to gather pipeline and store oil gas and natural gas liquids; refining and petrochemical operations; and a downstream marketing business to sell and deliver those products to market. Its operations are international giving it access to oil and gas from some of the largest and lowest-cost oil and gas fields on earth.

But where Phillips 66 differs from Chevron is that it does not have any upstream operations meaning it does not produce any oil or gas. There's obvious downside to not being a producer as it means missing out on the upside of high oil prices. You can see how Chevron's free cash flow has essentially tracked oil prices up and down over the past decade:

Cash flows at Phillips 66 and Enterprise Products have also moved up and down with oil prices but not nearly to the extremes that Chevron's has; that's by and large because its fixed costs to produce oil don't fall when the market price for crude does but they also don't go up when oil prices are higher.

So while it benefits from higher prices it also feels the impact of falling prices on its bottom line in a way that Phillips 66 and Enterprise Products don't. And over time that lack of downside exposure to falling prices makes Phillips 66's dividend more secure in my book.

The counter-argument is that since it doesn't produce oil it has to buy it to refine it meaning it pays higher prices when oil prices are up so that's bad for its bottom line. That's only partly true. Yes it does pay the higher price but since refined products like gasoline and jet fuel are priced based on crude prices Phillips 66 isn't really hurt by that. To the contrary one of its advantages is its advanced refineries. Since not all crude oils are the same chemistry not all oils can be processed at any refinery. Phillips 66 has a long history of being able to buy lower-cost crudes other refiners cannot process boosting its refining margins.

On the other end of the spectrum is Enterprise Products. And while it's a wonderful company it's less diversified and very focused on the midstream space where all the logistics of oil and gas happens. It's proficient at it having generated a 12% return on invested capital on average over the past decade. This focus on the midstream has been very good for slow and steady distribution growth but it hasn't made for a great total return investment. Both it and Chevron have underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the past decade.

Phillips 66 on the other hand has actually performed modestly better than the market. It was a rare strong-performing energy stock during the tech stock boom of the past decade.

A massive part of that higher return has been Phillips 66's superior dividend growth. Since becoming a stand-alone public company in 2012 Phillips 66 has increased its dividend almost fivefold while Chevron's and Enterprise Products' payouts have grown 58% and 50% respectively. It's also made some serious moves to position itself as a leader in biofuels something that should pay off as we transition away from fossil fuels in the coming decades.

Why Phillips 66 is especially attractive now

In recent months falling oil prices and economic worries have caused investors to send even energy stocks down; of this group Phillips 66 shares are down more than 25% and are actually down more than 30% from their pre-COVID highs. I think Mr. Market has once again overreacted due to near-term concerns creating a wonderful price point to buy this long-term winner at a great price. With a dividend yield well above 4.5% and a long record of stellar dividend increases Phillips 66 looks like a better buy than Chevron or Enterprise Products right now."

People should be conscious of the dangers “both economic wise leading to unemployment and the moral issues” connected to Artificial Intelligence or AI according to Catholic leaders in Nigeria.

Bishop Felix Femi Ajakaye of Ekiti on Sunday told leaders in the country to avoid legislation that would give AI the power to hurt the welfare of people in Africa’s most populous nation.

“While we approve of the good things that technology have brought to us we should be conscious of the dangers both economic wise leading to unemployment and the moral issues that go along with it” he told the congregation at St. Patrick’s Catholic Cathedral.

“We still have a high rate of unemployment in Africa by the time we allow this artificial intelligence AI to take control of us and be everywhere a lot of people and the rate of unemployment would be higher or triple or more” the bishop said.

“The artificial intelligence as we know the rate at which the technology is going a lot of jobs ordinary being done by human beings are simply being taken over by machine and if these continue there is going to be a serious rate of unemployment in Africa and other nations” he continued.

“Technology is very good but at the same time we have to be weary that God made us to know Him Love Him and Serve Him so that through this means we have the salvation of our souls. Artificial intelligence has no thinking no conscience where those two things are lacking there is danger. Otherwise the future of the world is very bleak” Ajakaye said.

“Our world is in bondage today look at the level of unemployment in Nigeria all the technological giants are reducing the workforce with AI human beings are only looking for financial gain and it is a direct affront to God. Let us raise our voice against artificial intelligence; there should be restrictions to areas where to use it. It would cause a lot of confusion in our world” the bishop said.

The Catholic Church in Nigeria dedicated Sunday the last day of World Communications Week to the discussion over AI.

The Vatican dedicated the whole Church to look at this issue when it announced last year it was dedicating World Communications Day to Artificial Intelligence.

In a statement published last year the Vatican said the evolution of artificial intelligence “makes it ever more natural to communicate through and with machines so that it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish computation from thought and the language produced by a machine from that generated by human beings.”

“Like all revolutions this one based on artificial intelligence too poses new challenges to ensure that machines do not contribute to a large-scale system of disinformation” the statement said.

The Vatican also cautioned against the risk of increasing “the loneliness of those who are already alone depriving us of the warmth that only communication between people can provide.”

“It is important to guide artificial intelligence and algorithms so that there is in each individual a responsible awareness of the use and development of these different forms of communication that go hand in hand with social media and the Internet. It is necessary for communication to be oriented towards a fuller life of the human person” the Vatican statement said.

In his homily at St. John Catholic Church in Mararaba Bishop David Ajang of Lafia said AI is transforming the world of information and communication and is “affecting everyone not just professionals.”

“We must acknowledge the excitement and confusion that comes with rapid innovation and take necessary precaution” he said.

“The Church recognizes the power of media as gifts that can foster human progress and development but also warns of their potential risks if not approached with discernment and responsibility” Ajang continued.

“Starting with the heart Pope Francis emphasizes the importance of the human heart symbolizing freedom decision-making integrity and unity. We must engage our emotions desires and dreams and encounter God in the inward place of our heart” the bishop said.

“As Artificial Intelligence advances we must not lose sight of our humanity. Rather we must engage AI with openness and sensitivity starting from our humanity and strive to become a new kind of human being with deeper spirituality freedom and maturity” Lafia said.

Archbishop Ignatius Kaigama of Abuja said people cannot run the risk of becoming rich in technology but poor in humanity.

“Our actions guided by modern technology should begin from the human heart” he said on Sunday.

“We cannot run the risk of becoming rich in technology but poor in humanity. Our actions guided by modern technology should begin from the human heart. Communication is about building relationships fostering understanding and sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ. In a world filled with noise and distractions it is essential for us to reflect on how we communicate with one another and with God” the archbishop said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmR5c3Rhci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDI0LzA1LzEyL2ZpcnN0LWNodXJjaC1vZi1jYW5uYWJpcy1pbmRpYW5hLW1hcmlqdWFuYS1jaHVyY2gtd2hhdC10by1rbm93LWhvdy10by1qb2luLXN0b25lcnMtd2VlZC1pbmRpYW5hcG9saXMvNzM2Mzg2OTIwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indianapolis has a marijuana church.

Sign up to receive the newsletter in your inbox each Wednesday night.

Utah will be home to 30 of the 350 temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints once construction is complete on all announced temples. The Deseret News recently spoke to the church’s Utah Area president Elder Kevin W. Pearson to talk about the state and temples after the media open house tour for the Taylorsville Utah Temple.

“Utah’s really still the breadbasket of the church” he said in an interview that touched on membership growth and activity and temple covenants and blessings.

Elder Pearson helped lead the media tour which kicked off a public open house that ends on May 18. The Taylorsville Temple will be dedicated on June 2.

Elder Pearson 67 who earned a Harvard MBA and was the CEO of a health care information technology and research company has a broad perspective on the church having served as a General Authority Seventy since 2008 when he was called while serving as president of the Washington Tacoma Mission. He previously served as president of the Pacific Area president of the North America West Area counselor in the Europe East Area presidency and area assistant in the North America Southwest Area.

Deseret News: What is the “State of the Union” for the Utah Area?

Elder Pearson: You’ve got roughly 2.2 million members of the church here. You’ve got some of the most active members in the church here. We have 645 soon to be 650 stakes in Utah. So there’s a tremendous amount of strength in Utah. I’m working with some of the strongest membership of the church.

This is really still where the bench strength is in terms of leadership. Probably still 52-plus percent of all senior couples that serve in the world come out of Utah. About 28-29-30% of all the young missionaries come out of Utah. So Utah’s really still the breadbasket of the church. It is a global church to be certain but the church globally is facilitated by the faithfulness of the members of the church.

Now 21 temples operate in Utah of 30 that are announced (for the state). Where do you think that comes from? It comes from the fact that members of the church have been so faithful in keeping the commandments that they have been blessed and prospered. They’ve prospered in the land to use Book of Mormon language and because of that their faithfulness in paying tithings has created extraordinary opportunity now. You think about April 6 1830 and the organization of the church then with six members to where we are today and what it took in terms of sacrifice to build Kirtland (Ohio) and Nauvoo (Illinois) and now the extraordinary abundance that the church has been blessed with is a direct function of the faithfulness of members of the church. It is extraordinary to go from location to location and witness that.

Almost every stake you go to you think ‘This has got to be the most faithful stake on on the earth’ but it’s just over and over and over. Now having said that there are struggles there are challenges for members of the church. The Salt Lake Valley is sort of declining in membership as people move out to the southwest and to Highland and on the other side of the lake and other places. So there are challenges but there are areas where the church is just exploding. We cannot possibly build buildings fast enough. And there are other areas where it’s like ‘OK this used to be an enormously strong area. Now it’s it’s changing.’ So Utah’s very dynamic is the point I’m trying to make. The church is very dynamic in Utah. It’s not monolithic in terms of the experience you have in any given stake or ward but it still continues to be the stronghold of the church. And it’s just a joy to serve here.

Deseret News: During the April general conference many of the talks were about temple covenants about finding stillness about following Jesus Christ’s teachings about the two great laws of loving God and loving others. What did you take away from conference?

Elder Pearson: If members listened carefully with all of these temples being announced and built — there seems to be one open house after another in Utah — I just hope that the members of the church don’t get casual about the extraordinary significance of having a House of the Lord.

We want to make sure that people are less excited about the architecture of a new building and ‘Boy I wonder what the color scheme is in this temple’ and a lot more focused on ‘What promises am I making what are those covenants?’ — the covenants of obedience and sacrifice and chastity and the gospel and consecration. We make very real promises to our Heavenly Father and the Savior and they are absolutely serious about those.

We’re hoping that members of the church will be ever more increasingly serious and focused on their own covenants. What we’re hoping is that these new temples will help members become ever more focused on putting the Savior and their covenants at the very center of their lives and not just having those an aspect of their lives. We hope the increased proximity of temples will help them with that. The proximity we hope will increase significantly the frequency that people get to the temple. The hope is that there will be a transformational mindset that whenever people see or think about the temple they’ll think about the Savior and they’ll think about the sacred promises they’ve made and they’ll be even more determined and committed to keeping them in every aspect of their life. We hope that members will come to cherish and honor those commitments and covenants above any and all other commitments in their lives. I think that’s the essence of the messages you would have heard over the weekend in conference.

We’re going to teach that. We’re going to continue to teach that everywhere we go at President Russell M. Nelson’s behest so that children will grow up knowing what promises are and what they mean and that they’ll be increasing in their capacity commitment and determination to make and keep sacred covenants in the temple and keep them all their lives.

Deseret News: What are the blessings that come from keeping those commitments in that focused way and making them central and making Christ central in one’s life?

Elder Pearson: My wife’s parents would be an example of this. They were Norwegian and they sold everything they had to come to the U.S. so they could be sealed in the temple. The blessing they wanted was an eternal family. First and foremost that is the blessing. For my wife June and I it’s to be sealed together for forever. The blessing is it changes the way we live our lives it changes the way we think about our marriage that we’re in it for the long term. We don’t let short-term roadblocks or bumps in the road upend us. That is a blessing. It shapes the way we live our lives. For many of members of the church in the past they would get to the temple once in their life and that was it but they went for that one blessing and that assurance.

For us in our day and time the blessing of the temple is that you can come and you can you can rise above the noise. You can rise above the lack of civility. You can rise above the disregard for sacred things and you can come to a space where you are literally a guest in the house of the Lord and you can feel more powerfully the influence of the Holy Ghost. You can feel a sense of peace and assurance in your life. Life is not perfect and there are many challenges that people face but they can come here and feel the blessing that because they’ve made covenants with the Savior in the end all will be well.

That is a day-to-day week-to-week month-to-month blessing that people can have in their lives that’s different than coming for the one blessing of being sealed for time and all eternity and never having an opportunity to go to the temple again.

In addition to that the temple is a place of revelation and a place to feel close to the Lord and to get the answers to challenges or questions or difficulties that you’re facing to gather up strength. All of those things are available in the temple. If you’re listening to our prophet in the days to come we are going to need that more than ever before. So I think the blessings available in the temple are constant but they’re also changing in terms of the times in which we live.

That’s something we hope we can help communicate effectively to the members of the church. Now you can come for daily blessings and weekly blessings and not only the singular hope of eternal families.

Former BYU athlete Courtney Wayment focuses on ‘faith over fear’ in preparation for U.S. Olympic trials

The road to the top is often long and winding. Just read about this journey to the top of professional baseball.

When I saw this headline — “How a forgotten basketball icon revolutionized the NBA and blazed a trail for Nikola Jokic” — I immediately thought of the late BYU star Kresimir Cosic. And sure enough he was in the story."

Earlier this week it was revealed that District of Columbia Judge Carl Nichols would allow the merger to move forward. But that sealed opinion has now been released in full. In it Nichols writes that the feds failed to prove that UnitedHealth would misuse data gained as part of the deal and that its competitors would be less innovative as a result.

The crux of the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) challenge to the merger is that it would make Optum privy to data on UnitedHealthcare's competitors in the insurance market which it could use to gain an advantage. UnitedHealth Group executives countered that Optum already has access to data on competitors and misusing it would deal a major financial blow to the company's multiplayer strategy.

Nichols weighed the government's case across both horizontal and vertical consolidation concerns. For one he said that while Optum's services and Change Healthcare both include claims editing the latter has agreed to divest its claims editing business called ClaimsXten to close the deal. Nichols ordered that the divestiture be made in his opinion.

""The evidence demonstrates that the divestiture will restore the competitive intensity lost because of the acquisition"" he wrote.

Change Healthcare has already found a buyer for its ClaimsXten business: TPG Capital. Nichols notes in the opinion that TPG has significant experience in the healthcare market and has indicated that it plans to invest in expanding ClaimsXten once that acquisition closes which would preserve that competition in the market.

Nichols wrote that the feds also failed to prove the deal would be anti-competitive from a vertical consolidation perspective. He noted that no payer industry witnesses including executives at major competitors Cigna Aetna and Anthem argued that they would be less innovative out of fear that UnitedHealth would access their data and the government put forth no evidence to prove that UnitedHealth Group would misuse those data.

""The evidence adduced at trial established that for it to be likely that the proposed acquisition would substantially lessen competition United would have to uproot its entire business strategy and corporate culture intentionally violate or repeal longstanding firewall policies flout existing contractual commitments and sacrifice significant financial and reputational interests"" Nichols wrote.

For example UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty testified that it would be ""nonsensical"" for Optum to develop tools that are only of use to UnitedHealthcare and spurn other potential payer partners. Optum does pilot some of its programs with UnitedHealthcare members with the goal of building scale down the line Nichols said.

Witty added that using Optum as a tool to make UnitedHealthcare more profitable ""would be a destruction of my whole fiduciary responsibility"" at the helm of UnitedHealth Group.

While Nichols' ruling puts the case to bed for now the DOJ hinted in a statement that it may consider an appeal of the case. Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter said in a statement that the agency was ""reviewing the opinion closely to evaluate next steps"" as officials at the DOJ ""respectfully disagree"" with Nichols' ruling.

UnitedHealth Group said in a statement that it plans to begin combining with Change ""as soon as possible.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Selain pemuda mahasiswa juga kaum intelektual yang harus punya nalar kritis.

Tetapi sekali lagi tulisan ini tidak sepenuhnya menyadur pikiran-pikiran Soe Hok Gie karena berbeda era tetapi paling tidak judul di atas akan menjadi ingatan kita tentang story and history apa yang pernah di lakukan oleh Soe Hok Gie. Setidaknya kita kagum dengan sosoknya yang punya nalar kritis di tengah sistem pemerintahan dan politik yang despotis.

Tulisan ini sesungguhnya mengingatkan kita kepada sosok seorang aktivis mahasiswa yang menghabiskan waktunya naik gunung yakni Soe Hok Gie penulis muda yang kritis yang menyukai seni sastra dan budaya hingga menulis sebuah puisi sehalus kabut Mandalawangi. Ini membuktikan bahwa Soe Hok Gie adalah sosok yang memahami seni dan budaya sesuatu yang universal tanpa batasan.

Nah berangkat dari judul tersebut di atas sepertinya ini disematkan kepada sosok-sosok aktivis saat ini yang masih menyandang predikat sebagai mahasiswa. Pertanyaan awal adalah siapa itu mahasiswa dan apa perannya?

Pertanyaan tersebut sesungguhnya cukup menggelitik sekaligus menampar ”muka” bagi mereka yang tidak memahami esensi sebagai mahasiswa apalagi bagi (mereka) yang masih menganggap dirinya sebagai mahasiswa. Terjemahan secara harfiah mahasiswa adalah mereka yang terdaftar di perguruan tinggi dan sedang mengikuti proses belajar mengajar—jelas berdasarkan Undang-Undang Perguruan Tinggi.

Tetapi memahami mahasiswa tidak cukup dengan pengertian secara gramatikal. Kenapa? Karena pada diri mahasiswa melekat pembeda dengan masyarakat lainnya. Jawabannya sederhana mahasiswa adalah masyarakat ilmiah.

Menyandang predikat masyarakat ilmiah bukanlah hal yang mudah sebab di dalamnya ada kata ”ilmiah”. Dan ini butuh pertanggungjawaban serius bagi mereka yang ”berani” menyandang predikat ini. Sebagai masyarakat ilmiah tentu di harapkan basis-basis pikiran setidaknya beralaskan pada pengetahuan selain tanggung jawab yang lain sebagai agent of control.

Frasa tentang ”mahasiswa” memang tidak mudah sebab peran dan fungsi mahasiswa menjadikan mereka sebagai kelas sosial yang tinggi. Tetapi sebagian kita bisa melihat bagaimana peran dan fungsi mahasiswa saat ini. Dan sekali lagi apa itu mahasiswa? Pertama student activity. Mahasiswa atau kelompok mahasiswa ini lebih memilih jalur akademik—yang sibuk dengan urusan kuliah dan berjibaku dengan tugas-tugas kuliah dan berpikir bagaimana selesai tepat waktu—dan bisa kerja (work oriented).

Kedua mahasiswa gentlemen C. Mahasiswa model ini terjebak pada aliran filsafat ”lebih baik daripada”. Artinya mereka bangga kalau sudah memperoleh nilai C ketimbang tidak lulus sama sekali. Tetapi kelompok ini sedikit kritis ia meyakini hope itu adalah kemerdekaan walau sedikit cuek dengan kondisi yang ada.

Ketiga mahasiswa 5K (kampus kamar kos kampung kawin). Mahasiswa model ini sedikit tidak memiliki sense of crisis sulit diterjemahkan ia mengambil peran sebagai apa.

Mahasiswa 5K (kampus kamar kos kampung kawin). Mahasiswa model ini sedikit tidak memiliki sense of crisis.

Keempat mahasiswa isolasi (ibadah sosial dan demonstrasi). Kelompok ini tentu lebih memilki kepekaan (sense of crisis) karena peran sebagai mahasiswa melekat dengan kuat pada pribadinya. Peran sebagai kontrol sosial tak cukup tetapi ia memainkan peran-perannya secara pikiran dan politik baik sebagai agent of change agent of modernize atau agent of development.

Konsep Tri Dharma Perguruan Tinggi (pendidikan penelitian dan pengabdian kepada masyarakat) sebagai kewajiban bagi mahasiswa tetapi peran-peran sosial jangan diabaikan seperti bersuara lantang di jalanan menolak kebijakan pemerintah yang tidak prorakyat seperti kenaikan harga BBM. Dan perguruan tinggi memberi ruang untuk itu sebagai sarana tumbuh berkembangnya pengetahuan.

KOMPAS/HERU SRI KUMORO Unjuk rasa mahasiswa di depan Gedung Parlemen Senayan Jakarta Kamis (7/10/2021). Mereka antara lain menyuarakan agar Pancasila menjadi hukum tertinggi. Selain itu mereka juga menyuarakan berbagai kondisi terkini seperti mulai adanya usaha pembungkaman terhadap kebebasan berpendapat.

Simbolisme pengetahuan

Perguruan tinggi adalah simbolisme dari pengetahuan karena di sana proses transaksi pikiran terjadi. Dialektika pengetahuan terus-menerus dilakukan untuk menemukan esensi manusia berpikir dan itu ada di kampus.

Dalam sejarah disebutkan bahwa perguruan tinggi itu dibangun oleh beberapa soko guru (penopang) di antaranya pertama mimbar akademik yang merupakan sarana bagi sivitas akademika untuk menyampaikan pendapat saran kritik sebagai bentuk kebebasan pengetahuan dan menjaga atmosfer akademik.

Kedua kebebasan akademik yang merupakan sarana bagi sivitas akademika untuk terus-menerus mengembangkan potensi diri yang bukan hanya pengetahuan itu diperoleh secara kognitif tetapi juga dengan empirisme. Kebebasan akademik sebagai bukti bahwa kampus itu tak terbelenggu dengan kekuasaan apalagi dengan kepentingan politik tertentu.

Ketiga kebebasan keilmuan. Ini sarana bagi sivitas akademika untuk secara kontinu mengembangkan pengetahuan tanpa harus dibatasi.

Menjadi aktivis tidak cukup dengan suara lantang di jalanan tetapi harus dialas melalui pikiran-pikiran yang bersumber dari pengetahuan tentunya dengan banyak membaca buku.

Me-review ketiga variabel tersebut di atas maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa sejarah perguruan tinggi adalah sejarah tentang kemerdekaan kebebasan dan pengetahuan. Hanya saja sering kali kita menjumpai sosok yang mengatasnamakan diri sebagai mahasiswa plus aktivis tetapi berjauhan dengan buku. Ini kemudian menjadi aneh sebab menjadi aktivis tidak cukup dengan suara lantang di jalanan tetapi harus dialas melalui pikiran-pikiran yang bersumber dari pengetahuan tentunya dengan banyak membaca buku.

Buku politik pesta dan cinta kalau dipahami secara mendalam sesungguhnya frasa ini tersematkan kepada kaum intelektual (mahasiswa). Penyematan ini bukan tanpa alasan bahwa peran politik mahasiswa dari era ke era memang berbeda bukan hanya pada isu termasuk juga dengan penguasa yang di zamannya. Termasuk tragedi ”cinta” yang dialami mahasiswa walau sesungguhnya cinta itu tak selamanya manis tetapi cinta itu adalah kemewahan bagi mereka yang memilikinya.

KOMPAS/FERGANATA INDRA RIATMOKO Mahasiswa mengikuti upacara penerimaan mahasiswa baru di Lapangan Pancasila UGM Yogyakarta Senin (1/8/2022). Pada tahun ini UGM menerima 9.833 mahasiswa baru. Menjadi mahasiswa berarti masuk kelompok masyarakat ilmiah yang diharapkan tidak hanya menimba ilmu tetapi juga kritis menyikapi kondisi di sekitarnya.

Politik heroisme bagi mahasiswa adalah sesuatu yang wajar ketika mahasiswa berhadapan dengan moncong senjata dan tindakan represif penguasa. Walau kadang kita menemukan mahasiswa digebuki oleh penguasa saat demonstrasi mungkin karena pelanggaran kode etik di jalanan kode etik pikiran adalah yang terbebaskan—ini miris ketika negara despotis terhadap generasinya.

Karena itu mahasiswa paling tidak dibekali literasi yang kuat agar terus membaca buku menulis sehingga tidak terjebak pada kejumudan dan kehilangan momentum dalam kehidupannya sebagai mahasiswa. Subastian Tito (mantan Presiden Partai Komunis Uni Soviet sekarang Rusia) pernah mengatakan ”Mahasiswa tanpa idealisme sebaiknya dikubur hidup-hidup.” Ini sarkasme tetapi penting bagi seorang mahasiswa agar lakon-lakon sosialnya tetap diperankan.

Sebab di beberapa negara termasuk Amerika Latin kaum civil society begitu kuat dalam melawan hegemoni kekuasaan—dan saya kira di bangsa ini (Indonesia) memiliki sejarah panjang dalam pergolakan politik di mana peran mahasiswa tak terabaikan. Mahasiswa tak memiliki kekuatan politik dalam bentuk regulasi sebagaimana posisi DPR dan presiden tetapi mahasiswa memiliki pikiran kritis walau jalanan menjadi sajadah panjang bagi mereka untuk berjuang atas nama rakyat. Maka tentu kita rindu teriakan “Hidup mahasiswa!”

Pesan penutup: ”Kemiskinan sejatinya bukanlah semalam tanpa makan melainkan sehari tanpa berpikir” (Ali Syariati).

In the 25 years since it was founded inclusiveness has been at the core of Cisco Networking Academy. Networking Academy’s global reach is amazing with students in 190 countries and nearly 12 thousand academies offering over 30 courses in up to 27 languages. But making the program available is only half the challenge: making the demand inclusive is another matter. This is why in 2014 we introduced the Women Rock-IT initiative.

The World Economic Forum predicts that it will take another 136 years to close the global gender gap this number is greatly impacted by the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data differs by country but women globally are generally underrepresented in Science Technology Engineering Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) education and employment. Deloitte Global found that large global technology firms will reach female representation in their workforces of nearly 33 percent in 2022 up slightly more than 2 percentage points from 2019. The Deloitte report acknowledges that “tech companies may need to work even harder to improve these numbers” to recruit hire retrain and promote women especially in technical roles.

Women Rock-IT was conceived to show young women that there are exciting careers for women in tech across all industries and to highlight inspiring and successful women who are innovating with tech and serving as great role models.

I’m thrilled to report that since our first Women Rock-IT event the initiative has seen more than two million participants and 870000 course enrollments.

Streaming over social media channels attendees view live presentations and can take free introductory tech courses to earn digital badges and entry certification-aligned courses offered through Networking Academy such as: Introduction to IoT Introduction to Cybersecurity Entrepreneurship Linux Python and Networking Essentials.

The importance of seeing successful women present at Women Rock-IT cannot be overstated but was maybe best summed up by Chaylee Reeve a university student majoring in Space Engineering in Australia: “It’s the power of seeing other women succeed. There’s nothing that can replace that.”

And Women Rock-IT doesn’t only inspire it can change lives. Agnes Chege was laid off from her customer service job at an electronics company in Nairobi Kenya early in the pandemic. After joining a Women Rock-IT virtual event Agnes was inspired to take a free Introduction to Cybersecurity course from Cisco Networking Academy. Before long she was approached by a cybersecurity company offered an internship and now works as a Level 1 Security Operations Centre (SOC) Analyst.

“Honestly if Cisco Networking Academy didn’t exist I wouldn’t be in cybersecurity right now. I had very little knowledge of it before I took the Introduction to Cybersecurity course” says Agnes.

Agnes is now also actively involved in cybersecurity user awareness training to different clients and has taken her passion to see more girls join the field a notch higher by involving herself in mentorship programs for girls in high schools. She is also taking a free Python Essentials course on Skills for All to improve her programming skills.

Women Rock-IT is an ongoing program. Breaking down the barriers to women’s success in tech is an ongoing challenge but there are signs of improvement. We started from a low base and that gives me hope — the more women who pursue STEAM courses and progress into tech jobs the more role models there are for young women to be inspired to study STEAM subjects like Agnes.

Who doesn’t like a virtuous cycle?

Six leading banks — Citi Crédit Agricole CIB ING Societe Generale Standard Chartered and UniCredit — will measure and disclose their steel-related loan emissions via the Sustainable STEEL Principles (SSP) the first climate-aligned finance agreement for the steel industry.

New York – September 23 2022

Under RMI’s leadership six top lenders to the global steel sector — Citi Crédit Agricole CIB ING Societe Generale Standard Chartered and UniCredit — today announced the signing of the Sustainable STEEL Principles (SSP) the first Climate-Aligned Finance (CAF) agreement for lenders to the steel industry.

The SSP are the turn-key solution for measuring and disclosing the 1.5°C alignment of steel lending portfolios. Designed to support the practical achievement of net-zero emissions in the steel industry they also provide the tools necessary for client engagement and advocacy.

The Principles were carefully designed over the course of a year by a working group facilitated by RMI led by ING and co-led by Societe Generale with participation from Citi Standard Chartered and UniCredit. The resulting framework positions lenders to facilitate the net-zero transition of the steel industry — the largest source of industrial emissions globally. Signatories to the SSP represent a combined bank loan portfolio of approximately $23 billion in lending commitments to the steel sector for a market share of over 11% of total private sector steel lending according to RMI research.

The SSP provides a methodology for banks to measure and report the emissions associated with their loan portfolios compared to net-zero emissions pathways. In doing so the framework informs banks of how emissions-intensive their steel loans are relative to the net-zero pathway needed to stay within our planet’s remaining carbon budget — a metric known as climate alignment.

Steel is used in everything from cars and fridges to buildings and planes. However because of the sector’s reliance on coal it contributes 7% of CO 2 emissions globally. With demand for steel projected to grow 30% by 2050 emissions are set to rise significantly if we continue with business-as-usual.

This innovative voluntary agreement is based on the model of the groundbreaking Poseidon Principles in shipping. Launched in 2019 The Poseidon Principles now include 28 banks representing over 50% of global shipping finance. Following a similar logic the SSP enable lenders to signal their expectations for emissions reductions across hard-to-abate industries and to engage their clients to identify the financings available to support their decarbonization. Similar frameworks for aviation and aluminum are also in development.

Signatories to the Sustainable STEEL Principles commit to the following five principles:

Standardized assessment – A methodology to measure portfolio emissions Transparent reporting – A framework to disclose progress annually Enactment – Instructions to obtain credible high-quality data Engagement – Signatories are encouraged to engage clients on net-zero transition plans and available financial products Leadership – Signatories are encouraged to utilize the framework for advocacy in the interest of the decarbonization of the steel industry

For banks with net-zero commitments the SSP provide ready-made implementation guidance to help achieve them. This includes a steel-specific measurement and disclosure framework for banks to help set targets and assess their own climate progress in accordance with guidance from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA).

RMI’s Center for Climate-Aligned Finance convened banks to create this first-of-its-kind framework to help solve the sector’s funding needs. Steel finance could soon emulate trends in shipping where signatories to the Poseidon Principles are closing over a billion dollars of Poseidon-based sustainability-linked loans annually.

The SSP was established by leading lenders to the steel sector and is ready for adoption by banks around the world. The NZBA steel sector working group comprising over 16 financial institutions plans to consider the SSP methodology as one avenue for achieving a bank’s NZBA commitment for the steel sector.

Metals and mining teams from the working group banks in consultation with industry asset managers and RMI developed this framework over more than a year of intensive collaboration. Over 80 stakeholders reviewed and informed the Principles including representatives from the financial sector industry leaders and climate NGOs.

The design was informed by a close collaboration with the Net-Zero Steel Initiative a project of the Mission Possible Partnership as well as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative. RMI participated on the SBTi Expert Advisory Group on steel and the Climate Bonds Initiative Technical Working Group for steel in an effort to align standards wherever possible. The SSP Association the SSP’s governing body plans to continue collaboration with several organizations and will explore signing an MOU with ResponsibleSteel in the near future.

Law firm Allen & Overy provided legal counsel and CRU provided cutting-edge steel sector data. SSP’s Secretariat is staffed by RMI’s Center for Climate-Aligned Finance and led by Lucy Kessler and Sam Kooijmans. Additional RMI staff that contributed to the design of the Sustainable STEEL Principles include James Mitchell Lachlan Wright Estefania Marchan Tamara George and Shravan Bhat.

The SSP counts banking signatories from North America and Europe with steel clients all over the world. Other banks committed to decarbonizing the steel sector are encouraged to join. To learn more visit steelprinciples.org or email Lkessler@rmi.org.

Quotes from the Founding Signatories

William Husband Global Head of Metals and Mining Corporate Banking at Citi: “Given the high level of greenhouse gas emissions emitted by the global steel sector decarbonising the steel production process is among the biggest challenges the industry faces today. As a leading lender and arranger of capital to the steel sector Citi is proud to join this working group to support our collective journeys to net-zero and to facilitate the financing of our steel clients’ decarbonization efforts.”

Jérôme Bernard Global Head of Metals and Mining Crédit Agricole CIB: “Credit Agricole CIB is a very active bank in the steel sector one that is crucial to the economy. We are also totally committed to our Net Zero policies. The Sustainable Steel Principles are a fundamental tool to deliver the best of both in the most efficient way. They will enable our clients in the steel sector to standardize their carbon emissions reporting and will enable the bank to monitor the evolution of the carbon emissions of its steel portfolio. This will allow us to continue to serve the steel sector during its decarbonization journey in the manner we have been consistently providing.”

Arnout van Heukelem Global Head of Metals Mining & Fertilizers ING: “We are proud to have led this multi-stakeholder effort to provide the first climate aligned finance agreement for the steel sector. The decarbonization of this industry will require very significant investments over the next thirty years. Banks will have a large role to play in providing part of the funding required to realize this. The SSP is a methodology that allows banks to not only disclose their climate alignment but also to benchmark their clients and use this data to engage with them to further stimulate decarbonization.”

Lenaig Trenaux Global Head Mining Metals & Industries Societe Generale: “As a founding member of the UNEP-FI Net Zero Banking Alliance Societe Generale is committed to work with its clients and partners across sectors to achieve net-zero no later than 2050. By launching the Sustainable STEEL Principles our ambition is to further support our clients as they innovate and invest for a low carbon future in the steel sector.”

Richard Horrocks-Taylor Global Head Metals & Mining Standard Chartered: “We are committed to sustainable social and economic development through our business operations and communities. We are proud to work with RMI as a founding member of the SSP Working Group to lead the way in supporting the steel industry’s decarbonisation journey.”

Frank Biburger Global Head of Producer Finance Natural Resources UniCredit: “UniCredit is strongly committed to supporting its clients in achieving their ESG targets as a core part of our efforts to drive a just and fair transition to a low carbon and more inclusive world economy. With steel production representing the largest source of industrial carbon emissions globally the Sustainable STEEL Principles are a key step in the journey towards Net-Zero. As a founding signatory we look forward to deepening our dialogue with clients and industry peers to promote a greener future.”

Additional quotes

Nicola Davidson Vice President Sustainability and Corporate Communications ArcelorMittal “ArcelorMittal has a net zero by 2050 target. Efforts such as the Sustainable STEEL Principles are important to enable steelmakers and their financing partners to make long-term planning and investment decisions to achieve net-zero targets such as these.”

Lucy Kessler Steel Lead Center for Climate-Aligned Finance at RMI “This groundbreaking standard was carefully designed by leading lenders to the steel industry and has been thoroughly vetted by finance industry and civil society. By signing onto this agreement lenders can accurately measure their steel-related emissions and have the transition-relevant data needed to engage their clients. In doing so together banks can signal their expectations and demonstrate collective impact.”

David Trafford CEO CRU Group “CRU is delighted to be the third-party provider of the steel industry’s emissions data for the Sustainable STEEL Principles Association. This is a natural role for us as this is how we see that CRU’s standardised transparent and broad-reaching data can add tremendous value to sustainability strategies and decision-making for participating banks.”

Peter Levi Industry Lead Energy Technology Policy Division IEA: “The global average direct CO 2 intensity of steel production needs to fall by more than 30% between 2020 and 2030 to align with the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE). It is encouraging to see lenders to the steel industry consider the NZE trajectory under the Sustainable STEEL Principles – the Principles and Scenario should serve as drivers for industry players to assess and disclose their climate alignment.”

Annie Heaton CEO ResponsibleSteel: “The Sustainable STEEL Principles fill a missing link in the efforts to decarbonize the steel industry by providing a platform for lenders to set clear expectations of their clients and accelerate the flow of funds to near-zero GHG steel production. ResponsibleSteel and the Sustainable STEEL Principles intend to work together to build synergies and coordination on steel emissions reporting standards and activities going forward.”

Remco Fischer Climate Lead United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative: “For members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance sector-specific pathways metrics and methodologies are crucial not only for setting but also importantly for implementing credible decarbonisation targets. The steel-specific methodology in the Sustainable STEEL Principles offers banks a valuable and NZBA-aligned framework for effective net-zero client engagement in the steel sector.”

Richard Fruehauf Senior Vice President Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer U. S. Steel “The Sustainable STEEL Principles promote improved transparency in the financial sector while giving companies the ability to enhance their commitments to the environment. Collaborating with likeminded companies is essential to make meaningful progress on our decarbonization journey and execute our Best for All® strategy to get to a more sustainable future faster.”

Clare Broadbent Head of Sustainability worldsteel: “A key focus for the steel industry is to significantly reduce our carbon emissions. We cannot achieve this alone. The Sustainable STEEL Principles are a very welcome tool to enable lenders to more effectively support their clients in decarbonizing the emissions from their steel production processes.”

Staff writer with CNA





The heads of three major US banks on Wednesday pledged that they would withdraw from the Chinese market if Washington imposed sanctions on Beijing in response to an invasion of Taiwan.

JP Morgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan and Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser told lawmakers at a hearing of the US House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services in Washington that the three banks would follow the guidance of the US government to exit China if necessary.

The three bankers made the pledge after US Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer asked the three if they would pull their investments out of China should the Chinese Communist Party follow through on its threat to invade Taiwan.

The US lawmaker spoke of Beijing’s continual threats toward Taiwan and its military exercises around Taiwan last month.

Citing the military actions of Russia against Ukraine Luetkemeyer said there was a great risk in investing in “volatile nations with dictatorial governments” as financial institutions have played a significant role in supporting these regimes’ economies.

Moynihan said Bank of America had followed the government’s guidance to “work with China” in the past few decades but if the US position changed “we’ll immediately change it as we did in Russia.”

Dimon and Fraser agreed with Moynihan’s comments on following the government’s lead.

“We very much hope it doesn’t happen” Fraser added.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February the security situation across the Taiwan Strait has drawn increasing interest in the international community.

Fears over a possible invasion of Taiwan have been growing in particular after US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a 19-hour visit to Taipei early last month which China strongly opposed.

Pelosi’s visit prompted China to launch several days of large-scale military exercises around Taiwan.

In a prerecorded interview with CBS’ 60 Minutes program that aired on Sunday US President Joe Biden told host Scott Pelley that the US would defend Taiwan “if in fact there was an unprecedented attack.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vcmVhci13aW5kb3cvY2FtLXNtaXRoLWFuZC1jaXRpLXN1Y2stYXQtdGhlLXNhdWRpLXRlYXQtMjAyMjA5MjItcDViazE00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cam Smith and Citi suck at the Saudi teat,"Sponsorship involves putting your own political capital at risk something Citigroup would know all too well given the extensive array of recipients of the institution’s gratuity such as Taronga Zoo Paralympics Australia and awards for finance journalists (including those won by this writer).

Then Samantha DiMarco steps down the aisle with a plastic tub full of popcorn boxes balanced on her head.

Fans look up. Some call out to stop her. She has a sale.

Philadelphia’s stadiums these days are largely free of the colorful hawkers of yore vendors who developed a following. Charles “The Doggie Man” Frank cracked wise while touting his “hot daaaags” at the Palestra Connie Mack and Veterans Stadium. Seymour “Pops” Steinberg roamed the Vet crying out “Cotton candy here!” in a distinctively nasal singsong. Sometimes you’d buy just so he’d pipe down for a minute.

DiMarco 26 sells popcorn at the ballpark as a supplement to her day job as a physical therapy aide with Premier Orthopedics. She started working for Crown Foods a subcontractor of Aramark in 2015. Her first product was lemonade sold out of wire racks. The melting ice on a hot day was not fun and “I said ‘I’m not doing this again.’”

Popcorn is much cleaner and lighter. The tub accommodates 30 boxes with a total weight under five pounds.

But why the balancing act?

“Truth be told I got bored at work” DiMarco said. “The 2015 Phillies weren’t the greatest team. I was walking back to my stand to get more popcorn and the bin was empty. It’s big so it’s hard to carry in front of me. I put it on my head. I took a couple of steps and then it fell and then I picked it back up and I just kept doing that over and over. I realized it was easier to carry when it’s full. I just practiced practically every home game.”

After about a month she said “eventually one day I just put it on my head and it didn’t fall off. When it’s on my head it stays. I am very attentive to everyone around me.”

Some people ask if she has suction cups or magnets to keep it on. But a spot-check showed no sign of that or even an indentation in the tub bottom. DiMarco shrugs. “I don’t think it stays on because my head is particularly flat” she said.

Windy days are the enemy as you might imagine. “It is just paper boxes in an open plastic tub. I do have to hold it then” she said. “My two biggest fears are me falling or dropping popcorn on the field. Then I’d be on SportsCenter.”

The teams notice — “the guys in the bullpen especially the opposing teams” she said. “They joke around or just think I’m faking it. This season it’s the Phillies’ bullpen every game. They wave to me and I wave back.”

DiMarco starts on the lower level on the first-base side and works her way toward third before heading to the outfield.

“People cheer for me all the time and give me high-fives and take my picture” she said. “I do this as a side job in the summer because I love baseball. I love the Phillies and it’s fun. But also the money is nice.”

You should know the economics. Hawkers are not hourly workers. “If you buy it I get paid” she said. Tips keep her going and the balancing act helps.

A box was $4 when she started and then rose to $4.25. Two seasons ago the rise to $5 cut into her “keep the change” tips but that has recovered she said.

“Last week I had a Mets fan who stopped and said ‘We don’t want popcorn but we all chipped in’ and he handed me like $6 and said to keep it. Well thank you very much — for a Mets fan.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGNpdGl6ZW4ub3JnL2VuL2NvbnRlbnQvbWlhLW1vdHRsZXktdW5nYS1kZWJ0LXJlbGllZi1zcGVlY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Barbados PM Mia Mottley Passionately Calls for Debt Relief and Fair Financing to Fight Global Crises,"Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley called on the international finance system to relieve and suspend crushing national debts and unlock trillions of dollars in new financing to help countries navigate and overcome multiple overlapping crises in a speech Thursday during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).

Mottley criticized the unfair interest rates and financial blockades imposed on developing countries and called on multilateral finance institutions banks and lending countries to restructure debt repayment programs in response to the climate hunger energy and poverty crises.

She invoked historical examples of debt relief to show that the same approach can and should be taken today especially if humanity wants any hope of accomplishing the UN’s Global Goals.

“When disaster strikes there is a moment when the world rallies grants and concessionary funds flow” said Mottley. “Yet we know that a dollar spent on building resilience before saves seven or eight dollars and many lives later.

“So it makes sense to offer limited access to concessionary finance for climate-vulnerable countries so they can adapt and build resilience and sustainability” she said.

Mottley said that Barbados in particular would have access to 18% of its national income to fight disasters if it wasn’t tied up in existing debt repayment. Rather than paying back banks and countries that can afford to wait the money could instead be used to ease poverty in Barbados help communities adapt to climate change fund the transition to renewable energy and bolster its public health system she explained.

Barbados like many island nations has contributed very little to climate change is uniquely vulnerable to climate impacts such as rising sea levels and extreme storms and lacks the resources to effectively mitigate its risks and adapt to the changing environmental conditions.

Over the past seven years extreme storms have economically impacted Caribbean Island states six times more than larger countries according to the UN. Recovering from these escalating disasters leaves less money for basic government services and poverty reduction measures.

The prime minister highlighted the unique role that the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) can play in unlocking finance for developing countries. SDRs are a special source of funding that the IMF taps during periods of financial instability. During the COVID-19 pandemic $650 billion was disbursed through SDRs.

However this financial scheme is structured in a regressive way — rather than going to the countries that need funding the most they mostly go to wealthy countries that then sit on the funds indefinitely.

Alongside partners and other advocates Global Citizen has been calling on wealthy countries to redistribute their SDRs to help low-income countries deal with the pandemic climate change and other challenges.

""All we are asking is that we do what we know we can do — now"" Mottley said.

Mottley also urged lenders worldwide to incorporate “national disaster and pandemic clauses” in debt packages to provide temporary relief in emergencies so that all available funds can be allocated to overcoming the crisis.

In recent years Mottley has emerged as one of the most eloquent impassioned and ingenious advocates for a new global order that would address the inequities of the past and present and establish a new foundation for global fairness and flourishing.

While she’s an advocate for reparations the measures she called for in her UN speech wouldn't burden wealthy countries with colonial pasts; they would simply allow developing countries to have access to their money and get a fair slice of the international financing pie.

On Friday she explored this topic further and railed against inequities in a speech for an inaugural lecture series hosted by the Kofi Annan Foundation Open Society Foundations and International Crisis Group.

""Trust is not created when countries pledge $100 billion per annum for climate finance and then deliver a fraction to developing countries"" she said. ""Or commit to 0.7% of GDP as ODA but we don't see it or get it; when the countries that stop others from exploiting newfound fossil fuels are historically the world’s largest producers and polluters.

""From the embers of the COVID and climate crises from the inadequacies and failings of the existing international system from the desire of the global family for inclusion"" she said. ""From the need for capital investment health care systems and technological access which put people at the center of development we are now challenged to look at what we have so far built to consider what is and to craft what must be.""

Mottley's speech at UNGA on Thursday invoked the visionary poets Rumi and Derek Walcott as she urged world leaders to wipe away their biases to clearly see the status quo and choose a better future.

“These few things will change the color of money will bypass the country-versus-country deadlock will build a new and real internationalism for all rich and poor North and South East and West” she said.

“So who dares write their names on history’s page?”

Mottley echoed these sentiments in a speech at Global Citizen Festival: NYC in Central Park on Saturday Sept. 24.

She brought up recent examples of poor nations paying the price of wealthier nations' actions such as the flooding in Pakistan as well as Hurricane Fiona's impacts on Puerto Rico Guadeloupe Turks and Caicos Islands and Bermuda.

""My friends this is proof that the climate crisis is real and it is — yes — manmade"" Mottley said to the crowd of 60000 Global Citizens and more watching from home. ""We have to convince world leaders to take action to help the countries that need it most. I said last year that this is a death sentence for us. And the crises are only going to multiply.

""So I stand here today speaking directly to the leaders of wealthy nations but through you because you have the power.""

Usually we picture meat or eggs--especially the latter for Salmonella—but plenty of other foods can cause foodborne illnesses. Think potato salad some fruits and surprisingly raw sprouts.

What Sprouts Cause Food Poisoning?

In fact the CDC includes raw alfalfa and bean sprouts among the foods most likely to cause food poisoning and sprouts have been investigated as the source of past foodborne outbreaks of Salmonella and E. coli.

According to the FDA since 1997 the FDA has investigated over 50 reported outbreaks of foodborne illness associated with contaminated sprouts which resulted in more than 2600 cases of illness. We know sprouts have a history of involvement in foodborne outbreaks but what makes these seemingly benign garnishes so potentially dangerous?

Why Are Sprouts Dangerous?

Sprouts grow best in warm humid conditions which can also lead to the growth of germs; when they are eaten raw (as they often are especially in sprouts sandwiches) it can lead to food poisoning from Salmonella E. coli or Listeria. Cooking sprouts thoroughly can kill any harmful germs reducing the chance of food poisoning though sprouts are rarely served that way. Plus ""Contamination in these cases generally tends to come from the seeds"" says Travers Anderson R&D Group Manager at Clorox.

According to Anderson sprouts are grown hydroponically in clear water with seeds brought in from fields. If the seeds are contaminated the sprouts grown from them will be contaminated too (yes even if you grow your own sprouts at home from purchased seeds).

What can be done about this common cause of foodborne illness?

How to Prevent Food Poisoning

First Clorox is working with the EPA to develop a protocol for treating alfalfa sprout contamination by sanitizing seeds in a dilute bleach solution before rinsing them with water and using them to grow sprouts. This can help prevent the growth of potentially contaminated sprouts. If you're still concerned there's an easy step you can take at home as well. ""You can create a very dilute bleach solution for rinsing your fruits your veggies your sprouts anything like that"" Anderson says. ""You can look on [a Clorox bleach] label and find the instructions for how to do that.""

If you choose to play it safe with your raw sprouts you're not the only one—dilute bleach solutions are often used to sanitize fruits and vegetables. ""It's a practice that's used all through the agriculture industry to make sure your food is safe"" says Naymesh Patel vice president of R&D at Clorox. However the CDC and FDA recommend washing produce in just water if you're cleaning it yourself at home.

If you're dining out and concerned about the potential risk of getting sick (which is unlikely but possible) carefully consider what you're ordering. If you're immunocompromised or especially cautious you might want to order something else.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Only one insomniac was shuffling through the hotel lobby at 5:00 a.m. on Friday when Lauren Coughlin marched out the elevator with her golf bag over her shoulder primed and ready for the first round of the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship presented by P&G.

“My coach is here and I was picking him up and then heading to the golf course so he didn't have to take the shuttle over and everything” Coughlin said. “I got here about 5:35 and ate breakfast. I started warming up an hour ten minutes before my tee time.

In the dark.

“It was very dark” she said. “Didn't really start seeing the ball-flight until I was hitting my drivers. That’s when it finally got light enough that I was seeing the ball go. So very dark.”

Luckily the 29-year-old Virginian enjoyed being in the first group out at Pinnacle Country Club. Getting her opening tee shot airborne flushed out a knot of nerves.

“I was pretty anxious and nervous to start the week” Coughlin said. “I kind of knew that it was more the waiting game and once the week got going and I got into the golf that's my happy place. I knew once I got in the groove of (the first round) it would go away and it did.”

Her early anxiety had little to do with Pinnacle Country Club or the event itself.

Coughlin entered this week 94th in the Race to the CME Globe with only three more full-field events after the Walmart. While a lot of attention will be paid to the top 60 and the largest winner’s check in women’s golf at the CME Group Tour Championship the drama between numbers 85 to 110 in the next month is the story within the story. Players in that range are walking a tightrope between exempt status for 2022 and a winter trip to Q Series.

In addition to the early start Coughlin’s anxiety was calmed by the way she played during the first round in Arkansas. She rolled in a 28-footer for eagle on the final hole to shoot a 7-under par 64 the lowest individual round of her career (she has posted lower in a team event The Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational).

“I putted really well today” Coughlin said. “I took advantage of some of the shorter holes on the front nine 1 and 5 and then I had a really good par save on 8. I hit it left and was really blocked out. Got up and down from about 30 yards. That kept me going.”

She made birdie on 11 and bogey on 12 her only bogey of the day.

“But then rolled in about a 30-footer on the next hole for birdie to keep it going. I was just seeing lines really well and had really good speed on a lot of putts so they just kept seeming to go in.”

Though Coughlin knows where she stands not just going into Saturday’s second round but in the overall LPGA Tour standings she’s embracing the pressure that comes with life on the bubble.

“I think I learned over the years or I’m starting to finally learn that leaving it in and bottling it up doesn't help” she said. “Getting it out and talking about it even just saying ‘I'm anxious I'm nervous’ can kind of make it go away.”

Thankfully she has the perfect listener to vent those feelings.

“I had a big long talk with my husband about it on Monday” Coughlin said. “We talked for like an hour on the phone. He always seems to have really good words of wisdom for me. I think it’s because we've been together ten years and married four and a half.”

Pond is not a professional sports psychologist. He’s better than that. He’s an athlete. Pond was a 6’3” 330-pound offensive lineman for the Virginia Cavaliers which is where he and Lauren met.

“He gets sports and I think really he gets me” she said. “That is what it is.

“And he's very smart intelligent good with words. He just always seems to know what to say to get me to calm down.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2Z4bmV3c2dyb3VwLmNvbS9mb3JleC1uZXdzL2luc3RpdHV0aW9uYWwvbmV4LXNlZi10by1pbXBsZW1lbnQtY2hhbmdlcy10by1pdHMtc2RyLXJlcG9ydGluZy1tZXNzYWdlcy1jb25zaXN0ZW50LXdpdGgtY2Z0Yy1ydWxlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NEX SEF to implement changes to its SDR reporting messages consistent with CFTC rules,"NEX SEF is working on implementing the necessary changes to its SDR reporting messages consistent with the CFTC Technical Specifications for December 5 2022 the Compliance Date.

The Laser Digital Holdings a venture capital division specialising in crypto assets was announced on Wednesday by Nomura Holdings a Japanese financial holding firm and the main member of the Nomura Group. Nomura made its move this year after a string of financial titans entered the Bitcoin industry.



Nomura Holdings a major player in Japanese investment banking is entering the market for crypto assets and will introduce several new services and product lines in the upcoming months. Nomura is one of the biggest and most established investment banks in Japan.

The new Laser Digital Holdings a holding company with Swiss corporate status intends to launch three vertical product lines: investor products venture capital and secondary trading. Jez Mohideen will serve as the new company's CEO and Steven Ashley will serve as Laser Digital's chairman.





CEO Kentaro Okuda and the investment bank's president stated ""Staying at the forefront of digital innovation is a key priority for Nomura…This is why alongside our efforts to diversify our business we announced earlier this year that Nomura would be setting up a new subsidiary focused [on] digital assets.""





The venture capital offering from Laser Digital Laser Venture Capital will concentrate on Web3 blockchain and centralised and decentralised financial infrastructure investments. Laser Digital claimed that in the 'coming months' it would introduce further goods and services geared toward investor and secondary trade.





Nomura has been releasing new crypto services since the beginning of the year. However the business made its initial step into the crypto market in 2020 when it provided institutional investors with custody services for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptos. This service which Nomura called 'Komainu' included key market capitalisation currencies including Bitcoin Ethereum (ETH) and others.





The business disclosed in May 2022 that it is expanding its crypto services to fulfil the needs of institutional clientele. It said that it has started supplying its Asian clients with Bitcoin derivatives. Nomura worked with CME Group to use its derivatives services platform to achieve this.





Nomura intended to establish a crypto subsidiary with a board of directors of Japanese expatriates until it could hire local expertise. The subsidiary would be situated outside Japan and invest in crypto and non-fungible tokens.

This London headquartered fintech which is a post-trade processing platform is also now leveraging its India-based teams to deliver and support its solutions such as ClientLink ETD which comprehensively addresses the current problems of speed and accuracy of trades in the global futures market Davies told businessline here.

Well established service

OSTTRA has a well-established ETD post-trade service used by many global banks and investment managers.

ClientLink ETD — which automates post trades for exchange traded derivatives (ETDs)—provides coverage across executing and clearing brokers so that clients can see ETD trades in real time. It gives buy-side clients end-to-end visibility of each trade. A visibility of cleared trades means clients can increase the window to trade more with the financial resources they have available. Also there will be clarity of commissions to be deducted on the trade date.

OSTTRA was formed in 2021 through the combination of four businesses that have been at the heart of post trade evolution and innovation for the last 20 plus years —MarkitServ Traiana TriOptima and Reset. OSTTRA has been primarily focused on institutional post trade solutions for the global OTC markets across interest rate FX equity and credit asset classes.

300 employees in Gurugram

Davies who was visiting India also said that all innovation around forex and securities products portfolio is now being built out of India. OSTTRA has a centre of excellence in Gurugram with about 300 people.

On the status of integration of OSTTRA’s Tel Aviv operations—which this scaled fintech intends to close—with its India unit Davies said that it was very much on track and nearly all products earlier housed in Israel will now be out of India.

“The integration of our Tel Aviv operations has been a very well executed programme of work. By the end of this year we will be complete. OSTTRA had 25 different services in Tel Aviv across all asset classes” she added.

Building India footprint She also said that the migration (Tel Aviv operations) has been deliberately phased over 18 months and that is what is happening. “Our great intention of building India footprint continues and are on track to have 450 people in 2023 and 600 by 2024. We will grow in India as the talent pool in India is the right one for us to grow” Davies added. In the next couple of years the number of people in the Indian operations catering to forex and securities markets may even double from the current level of about 150 professionals.

Davies also said that the geo political events (Russia’s conflict with Ukraine) this year has enhanced OSTTRA’s business model. “We thrive off volatility. The Ukraine invasion attempt has created volatility that financial markets thrive off and we have been able to leverage that volatility in the same way as Covid-19 helped volumes (in derivatives market) go through the roof” Davies said.

“We have leveraged that volatility to extend our footprint in the futures markets. We tap into growth of global futures market. It (ClientLink ETD) is more so a global product for us. We do now see more interest from Indian institutions for this product. We are leveraging Indian operations for the global market while keeping a keen eye of Indian market. We are a global business transacting for global institutional investors”."

""New partners will be announced at a later stage.""Kaabi said that the French giant would also help to finance the extraction of gas from North Field South. He said the French firm would take on an ""enhanced strategic"" role in Qatar's gas expansion.In June TotalEnergies agreed a $2 billion deal to take part in the giant North Field East project that will help Qatar increase its liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) production by more than 60 percent by 2027.With European nations scrambling to find alternatives to Russian oil and gas LNG from North Field is expected to start coming on line in 2026.Qatar is already one of the world's top LNG producers alongside the United States and Australia.State-owned Qatar Energy estimates that North Field holds about 10 percent of the world's known natural gas reserves.The reserves extend under the sea into Iranian territory where Tehran's efforts to exploit its South Pars gas field have been hindered by international sanctions.South Korea Japan and China have become the main markets for Qatar's LNG but since an energy crisis hit Europe last year the Gulf state has helped Britain with extra supplies and also announced a cooperation deal with Germany.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy9zdGVybGluZy13aWxzb24td2lucy0xLTUtYmlsbGlvbi1zb2xhci1wbGFudHMtb3JkZXItZnJvbS1uaWdlcmlhbi1nb3Z0L2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk0Mzk1OTM0LmNtc9IBkwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy9zdGVybGluZy13aWxzb24td2lucy0xLTUtYmlsbGlvbi1zb2xhci1wbGFudHMtb3JkZXItZnJvbS1uaWdlcmlhbi1nb3Z0L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NDM5NTkzNC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sterling and Wilson Solar to set up solar plants in Nigeria for $1.5 billion,"

Ms. Stoichkova joined Coca-Cola Bulgaria in 2004 and was most recently the president of the company’s Eurasia & Middle East division a role she has held since 2021. She was also president of Coca-Cola’s former Turkey Caucasus & Asia unit from 2017-2020.

In her new role Ms. Stoichkova will focus on globally scaling brands and acquisitions such as Costa Coffee.

Scotland and Wales will include aluminium glass plastic and steel containers in their DRS systems but England and Northern Ireland will exclude glass.

Julian Hunt is Coca-Cola Euro Pacific Partners’ vice president for public affairs communications and sustainability in Great Britain Norway and Sweden. He said he was “kept awake at night” by the potential of the UK ending up with four different schemes.

This he said would lead to “suboptimal” outcomes for the environment businesses and consumers.

Mr Hunt also suggested Northern Ireland would want its DRS aligned with the Republic of Ireland leading to the need for a “five nation approach”.

“It is a devolved matter. It needs five governments to work together to get a similar approach that works for all stakeholders to get the right outcomes for the environment” he said.

“We’ve seen there’s been a lot of upheaval in Westminster and I think that has been the really worrying development because we’ve had a lot of delays to the clarity we’ve been seeking.”

DRS

Mr Hunt was speaking on 20 September at an event on “powering the successful implementation” of the DRS at One Aldwych in London organised by data standards organisation GS1 UK.

The other speakers on a panel chaired by Anne Godfrey GS1 UK’s CEO were John Kane director of programme management at food wholesaler Booker and Howard Davies plastic policy manager at the Welsh Government.

At the event one source told letsrecycle.com that the new government under Prime Minister Liz Truss will not scrap the DRS though it may do away with regulations relating to products high in fat salt and sugar.

However the source said the government would not release the legislation on the DRS until October at the earliest and perhaps not even before Christmas.

Supply chains

During the panel Mr Kane expressed concerns that the launch of the Scottish DRS was “just 47 weeks away”. Booker offers a range of more than 20000 products including beverages such as Coca-Cola.

Mr Kane said there were “unanswered questions” about how prices should be displayed on products and how the scheme would work across borders between nations. Products could require different SKUs – numbers displayed on barcodes that retailers use to differentiate products and track inventory levels – in Scotland and the rest of the UK he suggested.

Mr Kane said this would cause a “massive challenge” and could lead to supply chain issues. “We haven’t got elasticated walls at our warehouses.”

He added: “It is complicated and it is unnecessarily complicated because what we should have done is encouraged everybody to do the same thing at the same time.

“I do applaud the Scots for taking the lead because it is important and we’ve got to get something delivered but it actually makes the whole industry tie themselves up in knots about how to do this efficiently and cost-effectively whilst maintaining consumer choice.”

Wales

Later Mr Davies explained that the Welsh Government was working on a joint programme with Westminster and Northern Ireland with the intention of introducing a scheme with a single administrator covering each of the three nations. “The phrase we’ve coined in our team is ‘you can buy a can in Bristol and take it back in Bangor or Belfast’” he said.

However Mr Davies acknowledged there were to be differences across the UK even excluding Scotland. “There has been a policy divergence which is England decided to take glass out of their scheme from a previously agreed position. That’s up to English ministers to decide that.”

Mr Davies also said they were planning to introduce elements of “flexibility” to the DRS. This includes flexible levels of deposits “so the scheme administrator can pitch the level depending on product type product size multipacks whatever.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkY29mZmVlcG9ydGFsLmNvbS9MYXRlc3QvTmV3cy8yMDIyL1NlcHRlbWJlci9Fdmd1ZW5pYS1TdG9pY2hrb3ZhLWFwcG9pbnRlZC1QcmVzaWRlbnQtb2YtQ29jYS1Db9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Evguenia Stoichkova appointed President of Coca-Cola Global Ventures,"Get the week’s news highlights straight to your inbox

Stoichkova will take leadership of scaling Coca-Cola's acquisitions and brands around the world including Europe’s largest coffee chain UK-based Costa Coffee

Coca-Cola's Global Ventures division will operate under new leadership in 2023 after the US beverage giant announced Evguenia Stoichkova as President.



Outgoing President Jennifer Mann was named as President of the Coca-Cola's North America operating unit in August 2022.



Mann had overseen Coca-Cola's Global Ventures division since 2019 after the US company acquired coffee chain Costa Coffee for £3.9bn ($4.8bn).



Most of Coca-Cola's Global Ventures division’s revenue is generated by Costa Coffee with the organisation also responsible for the Monster beverages Innocent juices and smoothies and Dogadan Tea brands.



Stoichkova currently serves as President of the company’s Eurasia & Middle East operating unit a position she has held since 2021. Stoichkova begins her new role on 1 January 2023 and will report to President and Chief Financial Officer John Murphy.



In July 2022 Coca-Cola credited the continued recovery of the coffee chain in the UK as well as the expansion of the brand globally as positively impacting its 12% second-quarter rise in revenues. In the previous quarter Costa Coffee contributed to a 28% rise in revenues for its Global Ventures division.

The net proceeds of the green bond will be allocated toward projects which meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the group’s Green Finance Framework.

They will accelerate progress of the company’s NetZeroby40 and Mission 2025 commitments. These include circularity energy efficiency water stewardship biodiversity and community programmes innovation in sustainable packaging and support of sustainable agriculture and procurement.

Coca-Cola HBC said this latest step is “further evidence” of its determination to “remain a leader” in sustainability.

Coca-Cola HBC’s chief financial officer Ben Almanzar said: “This milestone demonstrates that sustainability is embedded in every aspect of our business including our financing strategy.

“The issue of the green bond reinforces our position as Europe’s most sustainable beverage company. Most of all it was made possible by the unmatched commitment of our teams to achieve net-zero across our entire value chain by 2040.”

Green bond boom

Coca-Cola is not the only food and beverage giant to launch green bonds.

In July PepsiCo issued a new $1.25bn green bond with proceeds set to fund programmes scaling regenerative agriculture reducing emissions and packaging waste and improving water stewardship.

The multinational announced the closing of the ten-year bond on Wednesday 20 July. It is the second green bond to have been issued by PepsiCo within three years; it closed its inaugural green bond priced at $1bn in late 2019.

And earlier this month Compass Group announced it had raised proceeds of £250m and €500m respectively from the two bond packages.

Both were listed on the London Stock Exchange Main Market appearing in a sub-category called the Sustainable Bond Market.

The bonds will replace an existing Eurobond from Compass Group that will reach maturity in January 2023.

Green bonds raise funds for new and existing projects which deliver environmental benefits and a more sustainable economy.

‘Green’ can include renewable energy sustainable resource use conservation clean transportation and adaptation to climate change.

According to Linklaters the amount of sustainability-linked bonds issued globally in 2021 was ten times higher than in 2020 with a total of $110bn raised. 2022 it is predicting will be even stronger. $26bn was raised globally in the first quarter and a further $27bn in the second quarter. Linklaters has recorded that companies in Europe are the leading issuers of sustainability-linked bonds.

According to PwC there has been an “ever-increasing” call from investors for greater transparency disclosure and standardisation of green bonds to ensure proceeds are correctly used and requirements of end investors are met. At the same time there is a concern that too onerous a level of requirements will deter investors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjMvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hcHBsZS1uZmwtc3VwZXItYm93bC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple to Sponsor the Super Bowl Halftime Show (Published 2022),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjMvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hcHBsZS1uZmwtc3VwZXItYm93bC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267439116F0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

England-Chisholm caught two passes — the first of them being a 71-yard touchdown in the first quarter the other being the 98-yarder in the fourth — to help the Blue Raiders (3-1) seal the upset.

Cunningham completed 16 of 25 passes for Middle Tennessee State including a 69-yard scoring throw to Elijah Metcalf. Cunningham and Frank Peasant also ran for scores for the Blue Raiders and defensive end Zaylin Wood returned an interception for a touchdown.

Key’Shawn Smith returned a kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown for Miami (2-2) which turned the ball over on its first three possessions and never escaped the early hole it dug. Quarterback Tyler Van Dyke — the Atlantic Coast Conference rookie of the year last season — was pulled in the third quarter and replaced by Jake Garcia.

Van Dyke completed 16 of 32 passes for 138 yards one touchdown to Henry Parrish Jr. and two interceptions — those coming on Miami’s first and third plays from scrimmage. Garcia completed 10 of 19 passes for 161 yards for the Hurricanes who heard plenty of boos from the fans who showed up to what was not even a half-filled stadium; most were long gone before the final whistle.

Garcia entered midway through the third quarter and brought an immediate spark. He engineered a five-play 72-yard touchdown drive — fueled by passes of 39 and 23 yards Miami’s two biggest gains of the day to that point — and got the Hurricanes within 31-17 on a 1-yard rush by Thaddeus Franklin.

That was the first of two touchdowns by Franklin the other coming from a yard out with 6:05 left to get the Hurricanes within 45-31.

The win was a long time coming for MTSU coach Rick Stockstill who played his college football at Florida State — Miami’s rival. The Seminoles went 0-2 in games that Stockstill played against the Hurricanes in 1980 and 1981.

Those games were close. This one wasn’t.

And while a blowout might have been expected with Miami entering as a 25.5-point favorite few if anyone would have dared to say it would be the Blue Raiders doing the romping. It even had oddsmakers scrambling; MTSU actually became the betting favorite to win by the midpoint of the second quarter according to FanDuel Sportsbook.

It was 10-0 before Miami got on the board 24-3 early in the second quarter when Cunningham scored on a 9-yard rush. The Hurricanes never got closer than 14 points the rest of the way.

Miami had a chance to get within a touchdown on a 4th-and-goal from the Middle Tennessee 1 on the opening play of the fourth quarter; Garcia’s pass couldn’t be controlled by tight end Will Mallory causing a turnover on downs.

The next play England-Chisolm got loose down the left sideline for the biggest pass play ever allowed by the Hurricanes two yards longer than the 96-yard pass Maryland’s Darrius Heyward-Bey caught from Sam Hollenbach in 2006.

From there it was only a matter of time before MTSU could truly start the celebration.

THE TAKEAWAY

Middle Tennessee State: The Blue Raiders went to the upper level of college football now called FBS in 1999. Entering Saturday they were 0-20 against opponents that were ranked in the AP Top 25 poll when those games were played and outscored by 585 points — 868-283.

Miami: According to SportRadar the Hurricanes became the first Power 5 school this season to commit three turnovers in a first quarter. The last Power 5 school to achieve that ignominious feat was ... Miami last season against Florida State.

POLL IMPLICATIONS

It’s over for Miami for now. The Hurricanes were No. 25 and will fall out of the poll Sunday. At 2-2 it’ll be difficult for the Hurricanes to be considered again by many voters anytime soon.

NEVER LED

MTSU is now 3-0 all-time against Miami with the other wins coming in 1931 and 1932. The Hurricanes never held the lead in any of those games.

It was Tennessee's second win over Florida in the last 18 meetings and snapped a six-game losing streak in the series. The win gave the Volunteers their first 4-0 start since 2016.

Tennessee (4-0 1-0 Southeastern Conference) took control in the fourth quarter when it traveled 87 yards for a TD after a fumble by Gators (2-2 0-2) quarterback Anthony Richardson.

Richardson had a career-high 453 passing yards and two touchdowns and ran for 62 and two scores in a raucous Neyland Stadium.

Tennessee led 17-14 at halftime following a first half loaded with big offensive plays on both sides.

Hooker who shook off what was reported as an upper-body injury threw for 248 yards including a 70-yard connection with Bru McCoy for the Vols' longest play from scrimmage this season.

A 99-yard drive that ended with a one-yard pass from Hooker to McCoy gave Tennessee the lead 7 seconds before the break.

Richardson had a career-high 220 passing yards by intermission and connected with his first TD pass of the season. Keon Zipperer broke three arm tackles on his way to a 44-yard score.

MISSING (OR NOT) IN ACTION

The left leg injury that forced Tennessee WR Cedric Tillman to miss a good deal of the Akron game caused him to be held out. ... Vols WR Jimmy Calloway couldn't play in the first half against the Gators because of a team suspension after being ejected last week for punching an Akron player. ... Florida OT Michael Tarquin (lower leg injury) and long snapper Marco Ortiz did not play. .... LB Ventrell Miller who missed last week's game with a right foot injury started.

FACTS & FIGURES

Tennessee QB Hendon Hooker had a string of 14 consecutive pass completions including 12 against Akron before a misfire. ... In back-to-back second-quarter plays Richardson threw his first TD pass of the season for 44 yards to Keon Zipperer before Hooker's 70-yarder to McCoy. ... Midway through the second quarter Richardson had thrown for 207 yards a career high. ... Florida had just three sacks in its first three games. It had three Saturday. ... RB Jabari Small's 16-yard TD reception was his first. ... Florida was four of five in fourth-down conversions.

THE TAKEAWAY

Florida: In order to have success in the remainder of their SEC games the Gators will need to add a dimension to their offensive attack. Once defenses focus on containing Richardson in the pocket the variables in the offense are limited. Richardson was able to avoid the pressure and has been sacked just twice this season.

Tennessee: Getting WR Cedric Tillman (leg) healthy is imperative if the Vols plan on competing against the elite in the SEC. Having that weapon available is key to giving LSU Alabama and Kentucky something to game-plan against.

Yves Briantais

VP of marketing APAC

Colgate-Palmolive

Hong Kong

Member since 2021

Reclaiming a spot in Campaign Asia-Pacific’s Power List for the second time in a row Yves Briantais marketing chief for Colgate-Palmolive in APAC has reinvigorated the brand by stepping up its marketing game and championing inclusivity and diversity.

The company has been going through what Briantais calls “massive digital transformation” and he is leading the restructuring of both its marketing and agency teams to deliver purpose-driven results and more innovation.

In 2020 he headed the development of a new brand-equity campaign 'Smile strong' in APAC which tells inspirational stories of everyday heroes who overcome immense challenges to get to where they are. Other noteworthy campaigns are ‘Smile out Loud’ earlier this year for the Hong Kong market featuring Thai and African influencers which promotes authenticity over ‘perfect teeth’ as well as the #SmileStrongBersama campaign created with Ogilvy Malaysia and Red Fuse. Briantais is the reason that Colgate-Palmolive’s stand on diversity inclusivity and positive reinforcement is crystal clear.

Forthright about the use of plastics in his company and the entire FMCG sector Briantais has committed to a zero-plastic approach. In fact Colgate has developed—after five years of effort—what it claims is the world's first recyclable toothpaste tube. The brand’s parent company has also publicly pledged to use 100% recyclable packaging for all its products by 2025.

A highlight of his marketing career is signing an MoU with Shopee to potentially grow Colgate’s digital commerce business by more than 20 times across Southeast Asia and Taiwan by 2025. Briantais is also a frequent jury member at the Effie Awards and Festival of Media APAC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWNvcmRlci5jb20vbmV3cy80MDE5OTE3N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colgate-Palmolive (Pakistan) Limited - BR Research,"Colgate-Palmolive Pakistan Limited (PSX: COLG) was set up in 1977 as a public limited company by the name “National Detergents Limited”. It was renamed to what it is now in 1990 when it entered a Participation Agreement with Colgate-Palmolive Company USA. The company manufactures and sells detergents personal care and other related products.

Shareholding pattern

As at June 30 2022 59 percent shares are held under the associated companies undertakings and related parties. Majority of the shares are owned by SIZA (Private) Limited and SIZA Services (Private) Limited. Over 35 percent shares are held under the category of “others” followed by 4.5 percent shares owned by the directors CEO their spouses and minor children. Within the latter the chairman Mr. Iqbal Ali Lakhani is a major shareholder. The remaining 1 percent shares is with the rest of the shareholder categories.

Historical operational performance

The company has consistently experienced a growing topline over the years. While operating and net margins have more or less remained stable gross margin has seen a slight decline between FY17 and FY22.

Revenue growth in FY18 stood at 6.6 percent to cross Rs 31 billion in value terms. Oral care was a major contributor to total revenue however personal care division also exhibited double-digit growth especially in the shampoo and soap bars category. There was significant competition in the detergent powder category with the entry of a number of local players that spent considerably on media and promotions. However the higher topline did not translate into a higher gross margin as cost of production increased to nearly 67 percent of revenue versus 62.5 percent in FY17 due to currency devaluation. In addition international oil prices created an adverse impact on gross margins. But net margin recorded at 10.4 percent did not fall drastically as distribution expense reduced as a share in revenue.

In FY19 revenue increased by over 18 percent to reach close to Rs 37 billion as a result of a rise in selling prices as well as sales volumes. The company saw an increase in its market share in the Oral care category whereas local production of Palmolive shampoo also helped profitability. On the other hand the fabric care category faced competition from the unorganized sector. But with continuous currency depreciation and a rise in global commodity prices profitability could not be raised as net margin was recorded at a lower 9.5 percent for the year.

The company remained on its growth trajectory in FY20 as it witnessed a rise of nearly 18 percent toreach Rs 43.5 billion. This was again attributed to a rise in sales volumes and prices. In addition the second half of the year saw the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic that led to strict lockdowns. As a result the population resorted to panic buying for hygiene products that provided a further boost to the company’s sales. While cost of production was largely maintained that kept gross margin stable at around 29 percent net margin improved to 11 percent due to considerably higher interest income that raised total other income.

In FY21 revenue grew by 16 percent to crossRs 50 billion in value terms as selling prices were adjusted and sales volumes increased. The company also made some changes to its product mixes to ensure improved profitability. Moreover the company launched and relaunched a number of products while in the low-price segment the unorganized sector continued to give stiff competition to the company. With a marginal decline in production cost as a share in revenue gross margin remained flat at around 29 percent. With little changes in other elements net margin was also only slightly elevated at 11.23 percent for the year that was recorded at an all-time high while bottomline stood at Rs 5.7 billion.

Recent results and future outlook

Topline witnessed the biggest growth in FY22 by over 23 percent to reach an all-time high of over Rs 62 million in value terms. This was partly attributed to a rise in selling prices. The soap bars and shampoo continued its growth momentum but the toothpaste segment saw increases in raw material prices while the home care category saw significant competition. However the higher topline did not reflect in profitability as cost of production grew to its highest of over 74 percent causing gross margin to slide to 25.7 percent due to rising commodity prices energy costs and currency depreciation.But net margin that fell to 9.4 percent did not see a huge slump due to a decrease in operating expenses as a share in revenue. Additionally other income largely coming from dividend income provided considerable support to the bottomline that reached a peak of Rs 5.8 billion.

While topline has been growing maintaining and growing profit margins have remained a challenge as inflationary pressures have adversely impacted disposable incomes. Moreover political instability and depleting foreign exchange reserves have also led to currency depreciation that further impacts profit margins for businesses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWduYXNpYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9lbWJyYWNpbmctdnVsbmVyYWJpbGl0eS1ob3ctYnJhbmRzLWFyZS1hZGRyZXNzaW5nLXRoZS1zdGlnbWEtYXJvdW5kLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdC80ODE0ODTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Embracing vulnerability: How brands are addressing the stigma around mental health in APAC | Partner Content,"This is part of an article series for the Power List 2022 created in partnership with Twitter as part of their global #LeadersforGood initiative.

While the discourse around mental health has been steadily growing momentum in recent years the far-reaching impact of the pandemic in every aspect of life has thrown the importance of mental wellness into sharp relief. Within the professional sphere dialogues around mental health remain at an all-time high propelled by the rapidly changing working conditions brought on by Covid-19. As burnout prevails — a situation not unique to adland — workers are questioning their priorities and hustle culture at large. Consumers too are demanding more of brands showing a clear preference for companies that take a stand on relatable issues to forge a deeper emotional bond.

Optus and Colgate-Palmolive are two major brands that have taken the plunge to lead the conversation around mental health. We sit down with marketing leaders Melissa Hopkins and Yves Briantais — both honoured on the 2022 Asia-Pacific Power List — to learn more about the responsibility marketers have towards their audiences how to better address the public stigma surrounding mental health and that change really does start from within.

Doing away with public stigma

Mental health has traditionally been a subject most companies skirted around especially in conservative Asian cultures but the events of the pandemic have lifted the curtain on well-being allowing for more freedom to tackle taboo topics in public conversations.

“We should not be afraid of talking about mental health challenges” insists Yves Briantais marketing chief of Asia-Pacific at Colgate-Palmolive. “Brands should talk about it. If brands don’t do it who will?” After all companies are powered by humans and market to humans and it’s this simple yet profound connection that he finds most valuable. “Brands need to become citizens again” he urges “and go beyond the financial aspect of your products” as part of the mission to bring compassion to the discussions surrounding mental health.

Melissa Hopkins vice president of marketing at Optus agrees that “it’s a big job and a sensitive job for brands to do.” Conversations need to not only be tailored to each specific market for maximum effect but also be supported by substantial innovative policies to ensure authenticity and align with brand messages. It’s a balancing act that requires trust creativity and a keen sense of understanding. “Any brand in their diversity and inclusion programmes need to ensure that they’re representative of diversity and inclusion across all of their advertising [and] also how they act in the market” she notes.

The changing tides are evident on Twitter Campaign Asia-Pacific’s Power List partner where brands and individuals alike are engaging in meaningful discourse about mental wellness. Rishabh Sharma head of core business Twitter Next — the platform’s in-house creative team — in Asia Pacific said “The ongoing pursuit of happiness is inspiring more honest conversations. Recognising the need to take care of one’s mental health has opened up the dialogue around self-esteem and self-love empowering people to have frank discussions about their everyday struggles.”

Acknowledging that “people believe brands have a role to play” Sharma counsels brands to use their influence to “empower honest conversations share critical resources and always encourage improvement — no matter how small.”

Factoring in the influence that brands have in their reach and resources they are uniquely positioned to move the needle and “help societies to improve.” Briantais believes brands have a strong responsibility to do right by their audience and illuminate the way in “showing courage” and “[making] sure we tell people [to] feel free to speak about it.”

Choosing the right brand partners

Fortunately destigmatising mental health is not a battle that is fought alone. Hopkins points out that one of the most honest ways to stand behind your campaign is to choose the right brand partners who stand behind the same message. “Good things can happen if you have that commitment and optimism” she says recalling an Optus campaign that highlights the power of positivity and uplifts the talents of an indigenous Australian violin player.

“As an individual I don’t want to see myself portrayed in an ad in a negative sense but I do absolutely want it recognised that people go through ups and downs” she continues.

Collaborating with the right individuals can “[make] a big statement about what our brand stands for.” She cites that Optus is part of the Unstereotype Alliance  an empowerment platform that champions diversity in media and advertising content which counts Chaz Mostert — the VH supercar driver who advocates against bullying with No Social Hate — and Australian Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe amongst its ambassadors.

Change starts from within

Fostering mental wellness should not only be a surface-level initiative to simply further a marketing campaign — it must start from within the company as a foundational pillar to support its own people. Optus’s own chief of optimism Formula One driver Daniel Ricciardo is a powerful force in promoting “a positive mindset and how to change your point of view” praises Hopkins “because the biggest challenge with mental ill health is probably self-stigma.”

Providing the right resources in the workplace such as subsidised psychological care is crucial to help workers feel their best so they can perform their best. It also creates a safe environment to uplift mental wellness. “There is no way you can deliver if you’re not feeling well” emphasises Briantais. “Making it a priority that the team feels good is critical. And it’s something that is obvious and [we] always should have done even without Covid.”

In addition allowing room for trust and independence to grow is essential for companies to adapt to employees’ evolving needs. Briantais remarks that “demanding from our people to deliver in the way they used to deliver is impossible. You need to provide flexibility.”

Along that line Hopkins details how a shift in office policies following Covid-19 allowed Optus to show up for its people. “We have a rule where there are no meetings after 3 pm on a Friday. 3 pm to 5 pm is about clearing up your week” she explains. Even something as small as giving people permission to work according to their own needs — such as outside of traditional office hours and on weekends — and encouraging team members to respect the boundaries of others demonstrates a human-first approach in the workplace.

While demonstrating “what wellness means to the brand” is all well and good Sharma emphasises the importance of openly sharing the actionable ways that brands are incorporating healthier internal practices and “encouraging wellbeing amongst their employees.”

While these improvements might manifest as “better healthcare and more accessible technology” Sharma notes that “strong community support” can also take the form of “simply lending an ear” and inspiring people to speak up about their mental health journeys.

Eliminating feelings of shame embracing vulnerability and modelling the right behaviour from the top further helps businesses walk the walk. “Leaders [who are] vulnerable enough to share their own mental ill health stories [...] normalise it for everybody else” says Hopkins.

Briantais concurs. Brands are duty-bound to lead by example and guide the way to a better mindset: “Covid made us even more aware of the need to take care of the well-being and mental health of each other. All of us together as a company we need to take care of each other.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVudGl2YS5jby5pbi90cmVuZHMvdG9wLTEwLWJlc3QtZm1jZy1jb21wYW5pZXMtaW4taW5kaWEtaW4tMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Best FMCG Companies In India In 2023,"Fast-moving consumer goods ( FMCG ) are inexpensive and easily sold. They may also be referred to as CPGs (consumer packaged goods). Packaged meals beverages toiletries candy cosmetics over-the-counter medications dry goods and other items with short shelf lives are a few examples. In uncertain times FMCG stocks are seen as protective investments. This is so because companies that sell consumer discretionary goods see fewer share price declines. Investors might thus think about including equities in this sector in their portfolio from this standpoint.

FMCG stands for fast-moving consumer goods. These items are often provided at prices that are convenient for most consumers to purchase and the majority of people use them every day. Processed food home care goods grocery items and drinks over-the-counter medications including aspirin fruits vegetables technological devices and personal hygiene products are among the most popular FMCG products.

Fast-moving consumer items have a high inventory turnover rate. Specialty products on the other hand have lower sales and greater carrying costs. Numerous establishments including hypermarkets big-box retailers and warehouse clubs solely offer FMCGs. Because they only have a few shelves and must stock them with items that sell rapidly small convenience stores also stock items that sell rapidly.

Vegetable foods and dairy items which are often offered on a smaller margin are the most popular FMCG goods. The Indian FMCG market has a value of 110 billion dollars in 2020 and is anticipated to grow to over 615.87 billion dollars by 2027. Since the advent of the internet people have employed the research online purchase offline (ROPO) strategy. To compete with their rivals FMCG businesses have reduced their profit margins and invested in better machinery to produce better products.

Due to their desire to get the greatest discounts Indian consumers are less likely to remain brand loyal. Therefore FMCG businesses are always attempting to persuade consumers to purchase their goods through discounts and promotions. To encourage customers to buy their products several businesses offer package discounts. The majority of FMCG firms don’t require large sums of capital to invest in their factories machinery equipment and other fixed assets.

The amount of money earned at a fully improved manufacturing facility is typically five to eight times what was invested. Because the majority of commercial transactions are still made with cash or credit companies have low capital intensity.

The FMCG sector is dominated by a limited number of large enterprises in the US whereas it is made up of numerous small businesses in India. Companies are finding it increasingly challenging to get a larger market share as competition rises. The significant upfront investment is needed for marketing and advertising product development expenses market compatibility testing market research and most importantly the product launch itself.

The three major categories of consumer goods include both long-lasting and short-lived products. Things like furniture and vehicles only last three years. The number of money consumers spends on durable goods is a common metric used by economists to gauge the state of the economy. Products with a short shelf life are consumed rapidly and have a lifespan of less than a year. Products that consumers buy and use rapidly fall into this category. Last but not least services can also include items that are invisible or immaterial like haircuts or vehicle washes.

India’s FMCG History

The fourth-largest sector of the Indian economy is the powerful FMCG industry. Between 2011 and 2018 the growth rate skyrocketed rising from $30 billion to a predicted $74 billion. The industry is distinguished by the significant presence of multinational corporations; the fierce rivalry between organized and unorganized firms; and an advanced distribution system. The Indian FMCG industry is given a major boost by the availability of essential raw materials cheaper labor and a pervasive presence throughout the whole value chain.

Due to the low purchasing power of Indians and the government’s support of small-scale industries this sector did not experience considerable expansion during the 1950s and 1980s. One of the few businesses that persisted and developed into market players was HUL and Amul. Amul transformed India’s dairy industry. Amul which was founded in 1946 helped India experience a “white revolution” by organizing the previously unorganized dairy industry. They invented items like infant food made from buffalo milk and milk powder. Every year the company sells over 3960 tons of milk products and is only growing.

HUL another well-known player at the time concentrated primarily on the urban market which at the time represented a very small portion of the Indian population. When NIRMA entered the market and rocked the FMCG industry it was a moment that changed the rules of the game. It was the first business to adopt the idea of “Value for Money” and turn FMCG into a staple good for the average person.

The wheel yet another household item for many families came along when MNCs focused on the urban and middle classes woke up to new market realities and spotted the latent rural market. With the liberalization of the Indian economy both indigenous and foreign options have increased. The ever-increasing 1 billion-plus population prompted MNCs to invest more because of the decline in trade barriers. As a result companies introduced anything from low-end detergent to high-end sanitary napkins as a result of rising living standards in metropolitan regions and the purchasing power of rural India.

Over the past ten years their strategy has evolved into a two-pronged approach: first they invested in extending their distribution network throughout India to increase their market. Second upgrade current customers to value-added premium items and encourage them to use the current product lines.

As a result you could see that practically all businesses—whether they were HUL Godrej or Marico—were competing with one another to reach rural consumers first. Their retail footprints in mid-sized towns and villages have each significantly increased. Some people who couldn’t accomplish it on their own have benefited from the distribution networks of other significant FMCG companies (P&G and Marico for example).

As a result businesses that ventured into rural India witnessed an increase in sales and profits. For instance HUL is presently one of the greatest winners because 50% of its total sales originate in rural India.

The “sachet” revolution was one of the largest shifts to affect the FMCG sector. Detergent shampoo hair oil cookies chocolate and a variety of other businesses have produced items in smaller container sizes at lower price points during the past three years. This is the one significant innovation that will help value-added goods in urban India (particularly tier II and tier III cities) and conventional FMCG items like detergents soaps and oral care in rural India reach new customers and increase market share.

The FMCG industry has gone a long way from being a luxury to becoming a necessity. It has significantly impacted our lives and overrun us with options.

These most recent changes have significantly changed how this industry looks.

First emphasizing creating delicious yet nutritious meals virtually became a guarantee of success. The megatrend of health and wellness is influencing customer choices and purchasing behaviors and FMCG firms are paying attention. Leading international and Indian food and beverage companies have embraced this trend and are concentrating on developing fresh up-and-coming brands in wellness and health.

Second event-driven advertising has begun to be threatened by the decline of traditional advertising the growth of digital media and new viewing platforms like Netflix HotStar and Jio Movies. Even Nestle used Snapdeal to prelaunch its noodles demonstrating the reach of e-commerce.

The kids of today love speed. They desire packaged things that are more efficient quick and intelligent. In a world where the differences between products are eroding the “desire for speed” trend emphasizes the significance of speed as a deciding factor for packaged goods items.

Some FMCG companies are now going back to their Indian roots. Whether it was Paperboat’s breakthrough into the Indian beverage business Chedda Foods’ introduction of banana/tapioca chips or Balaji Wafers’ victory in the extruded snack market competitors with an ethnic focus as opposed to say Kellogg’s or Domino’s have taken market share from incumbents.

The future of this industry looks bright with the introduction of GST because in addition to enhancing supply chain efficiency GST will level the playing field for the bigger more established participants in the industry by bringing previously untaxed firms into the tax net.

From US 49 billion in 2016 to US 103.7 billion in 2020 the FMCG market in India is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 20.6%. The Indian rural FMCG market is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 14.6% during the same period from US$29.4 billion in 2016 to US$220 billion in 2025.

India’s transition to a cashless economy and the ever-increasing spread of e-commerce aided by the GST and demonetization are two of the most talked-about subjects at the moment. You may be sure that the Indian FMCG industry is going through some very interesting and turbulent times. Despite this FMCG will continue to underpin the Indian economy and have a profound impact on all aspects of life.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL)

One of the earliest FMCG firms in India is HUL. It is a division of the British-Dutch business Unilever. The business was founded in 1933 and Mumbai serves as its corporate headquarters. In over 87 years more than 2 billion clients have been served by HUL.

Amul

When it comes to FMCG firms in India Amul doesn’t require an introduction. Amul which has great brand value and outstanding FMCG stocks is known for providing fast-moving consumer goods most dairy products such as milk ice cream curd butter cheese and ghee.

NBCUniversal’s claw-back of programming rights from Disney’s Hulu has resulted in the removal this week of dozens of past seasons of popular shows on the streamer — including the entire run of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” — as those have now flown over to NBCU’s own Peacock.

Seasons 1-20 of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” which originally aired on E! expired on Hulu as of Sept. 18. They’re now available to stream only on Peacock in the U.S. Hulu however has all-new material for fans of the celebrity clan: “The Kardashians” reality series returned this week for Season 2.

In addition multiple seasons of Bravo’s “Real Housewives” franchise are no longer on Hulu. Those include “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” Seasons 1-15; “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” Seasons 1-13; “The Real Housewives of New Jersey: Seasons 1-11”; “The Real Housewives of New York” Seasons 1-12; “The Real Housewives of Orange County” Seasons 12-15; “The Real Housewives of Potomac” Seasons 1-5; and “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” Season 1.

Popular on Variety

Also leaving Hulu were “Life of Kylie” the reality series following Kylie Jenner that ran for just one season along with Bravo’s “Vanderpump Rules” Seasons 1-8 (a spinoff of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills”) and “Top Chef” Seasons 1-18. Also gone from Hulu as of Sept. 18 are “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” Seasons 1-8 now exclusively streaming on Peacock.

The purge of past seasons of the NBCU-owned shows comes after Hulu also lost next-day access to current seasons of NBC series effective Sept. 19 as those will now be available on Peacock Premium. NBCU had already reclaimed next-day episodes of Bravo shows earlier this summer.

NBCU execs clearly hope that their reclamation of “KUWTK” and other popular shows will boost Peacock’s viewing hours — and subscribers. In the second quarter Peacock’s paid customer based was flat at 13 million and Peacock’s overall active accounts dropped by 1 million.

Meanwhile Disney is in the midst of trying to buy out the 33% stake in Hulu owned by Comcast’s NBCU.

As of July 2 2022 Disney recorded Comcast’s interest in Hulu as being worth $8.6 billion implying a valuation of $25.8 billion. Under the agreement that gave Disney operational control over Hulu Comcast in January 2024 has the right to require Disney to buy its Hulu ownership stake (and conversely Disney has the right to force Comcast to sell it).

Disney CEO Bob Chapek at an investment conference earlier this month signaled again that he wanted to reach a deal with Comcast to own 100% of Hulu prior to the January 2024 date spelled out in the agreement. Full ownership of Hulu Chapek said would be necessary for Disney to introduce a “hard bundle” that integrates Disney+ Hulu and ESPN+. Later at the same conference Comcast chief Brian Roberts suggested his company would be interested in buying out Disney’s 66% stake — and that an auction-style sale of Hulu in its entirety may fetch more than Disney’s implied valuation.

Despite losing many top-tier titles to Peacock Hulu will continue to offer some NBCU shows for several more years. Those include past seasons of “Law & Order: SVU” “This Is Us” “The Mindy Project” “30 Rock” “Parenthood” and “Will & Grace.” (The full NBCU live TV channel lineup — including NBC E! Bravo USA and MSNBC — will still be available to Hulu + Live TV subscribers.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vYW5uYXJib3JvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vYnVpbGRpbmctYXQtbGFzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Building at Last,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vYW5uYXJib3JvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vYnVpbGRpbmctYXQtbGFzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026740999150>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

It recently announced the debut of the iconic series Cops on Fox Nation which will feature new episodes every Friday.

The first series of Cops an action-packed police series received overwhelming reactions from the audience and Fox expects this season to be a hit as well.

Fox Nation which is an entertainment streaming service designed to complement the Fox News Channel (“FNC”) is further expanding its portfolio with original content like Duck Family Treasure Sharon Osbourne: To Hell & Back (to be streamed on Sep 26) and the upcoming Yellowstone: One-Fifty with Kevin Costner.

Fox also signed Roseanne Barr a comedy icon in America for a comedy show named A Roseanne Comedy Speciala few days ago.

The Fox News Channel has been benefiting from Fox Nation as it increased FNC’s subscriber base by approximately 80% in fiscal 2022. The conversion rate of trialists to paid subscribers has been high and retention rates were above industry averages.

Fox News Channel once again closed August as the best-performing news brand for 18 consecutive months as it reached more than 2.9 billion total multiplatform minutes 1.5 billion total multiplatform views and 77 million multiplatform unique visitors per Comscore data.

Along with this Fox Business is also driving its user base as it achieved 151 million multiplatform views as of last month. Fox Business surpassed CNN Business and Comcast’s (CMCSA) MSNBC in multiplatform views for the fifth straight month.

Comcast’s MSNBC lost 19% of prime-time viewers in the first half of 2022. Per Nielsen datatheir ratings have plummeted ever since The Rachel Maddow show shifted to a once-per-week format from four times per week.

Fox’s investment in Flutter has benefitted its sports business division as well. Together they entered into a national media and sports wagering partnership in the U.S. The partnership offers the FOX Bet Super 6 national free-to-play game which has generated a user base of more than 6 million registered accounts as of June 2022.

However the wagering business will not be easy for Fox given that it faces stiff competition from companies like DraftKings (DKNG).

DraftKings is focusing on its iGaming products as it launched a sportsbook in Kansas at the start of this month. Its Same Game Parlay which allows multiple betting outcomes from the same game into one parlay bet and the feature enhancements like the Web3 strategy has gained significant anticipation among players.

What’s Next for Fox Corp?

Fox’s shares have declined 13% year to date compared with Comcast which fell by 35.5% during the same period. The Zacks Consumer & Discretionary Sectoralso declined 37.2% over the same time frame.

However Fox’s cable TV business faces a serious threat from OTT platforms due to cord-cutting and changing consumer preferences. This cord-cutting does not bode well for Fox.

In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 Cable Network Programming EBITDA decreased 6.8% year over year to $628 million. EBITDA margin contracted 520 bps to 43%.

Fox also faces competition for ad dollars which forms its main source of revenue. This is further intensified by offerings from tech giants like Facebook Twitter (TWTR) Google YouTube and Amazon as they too have been fighting for ad dollars.

Twitter’s initiatives to add features and focus on effectively tackling abuse issues are helping it to expand the monetized user base thereby driving ad revenues.

However Fox remains confident for fiscal 2023 as the financial gains from Super Bowl 57 the early exit of Thursday Night Football the momentum heading into November's midterm elections and the start of its next major distribution cycle are expected to deliver record revenues and EBITDA. Currently Fox carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here

THE BIG BOSS:This 1 directive from new Detroit Tigers boss Scott Harris resonates above all else

ABOUT WEDNESDAY NIGHT:No sweep for Detroit Tigers vs. Baltimore Orioles in 8-1 loss as Jordan Lyles throws CG

Game notes: Finally the Tigers begin their final series against the Chicago White Sox. Though the ChiSox have had a disappointing season as well — picked by most to win the American League Central they’d need an epic collapse down the stretch by Cleveland or one of the three wild-card teams to make the playoffs — they’ve certainly handled their business against the Tigers. Detroit followed last season’s 7-12 record against Chicago with a 4-12 mark entering this weekend’s three games. Sure the Tigers could sweep to match last year’s rivalry mark but it hardly seems likely even as they’re coming off a rare series victory in Baltimore.

Tigers lefty Eduardo Rodriguez is slated to make his third start against the White Sox this season; he took a no-decision on Opening Day after allowing three earned runs over four innings (the Tigers then won on a walk-off single by Javier Báez to infuse the city with hope) and then pitched arguably his best game of the season Saturday night. That game an eventual 4-3 loss at Comerica Park saw Rodriguez strike out seven over 6 1/3 innings while allowing just two runs on two hits and two walks. But the Tigers bullpen folded in the 11th inning.

White Sox righty Lucas Giolito meanwhile has struggled all season posting a 4.03 ERA in four starts against the Tigers. That’s a bit misleading as it includes four scoreless innings on Opening Day though Giolito was solid in his last start against Detroit holding the Tigers to one run over 4 2/3 innings last Friday at Comerica Park.

The two teams wrap up their season series with a night game Saturday and a 2:10 p.m. start Sunday. The Tigers have Monday off before hosting Kansas City for three games next week while the White Sox have a day to travel to Minneapolis for a set against the Twins.

Today there are plenty of gluten-free products available on supermarket shelves. But if you're crafting gourmet sandwiches for a family picnic or looking to jazz up your office lunches sometimes a basic loaf of regular sliced bread just doesn't cut it.

The good news is more and more specialty gluten-free breads have been hitting shelves as of late—think buttery croissants begging for a pat of jam or dense and chewy bagels that toast like a dream. If you're looking to explore gluten-free baked goods beyond the average sliced bread here are the best GF breads to add to your grocery list or shopping cart pronto.

Canyon Bakehouse Gluten-Free Everything Bagels

There's no reason why you need to give up bagels just because you are not eating gluten—not when you can take home a bag of four gluten-free everything bagels from Canyon Bakehouse. Canyon Bakehouse uses 100% whole grains and only all-natural ingredients to make all of its baked goods and these bagels are no exception—and they're soy-free non-GMO and dairy-free to boot!

Although these bagels are free of gluten they're certainly not short on flavor thanks to a savory blend of garlic onion poppy and sunflower seeds. Top them with a schmear of cream cheese tofu spread avocado or smoked salmon—the possibilities are endless.

Canyon Bakehouse Brioche-Style Sweet Rolls

Nothing rounds out a meal quite like a piping hot dinner roll. Soft pillowy Canyon Bakehouse Brioche-Style Sweet Rolls are the gluten-free alternatives to standard dinner rolls that are perfect for sopping up a hearty stew pairing with a sauce-heavy pasta dish or making tasty sliders. In addition to being gluten-free these dinner rolls are dairy-free nut-free and soy-free. Best of all they are 100% whole grain.

Schär's Gluten-Free Croissants

With a flaky texture and rich buttery flavor these gluten-free frozen croissants from Schär are the perfect base for Nutella fresh fruit and honey or an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. With 3 grams of filling fiber and no GMOs or preservatives you can also feel good about eating them. After defrosting the croissants for one hour just pop them in a preheated oven for eight minutes at 390 degrees Fahrenheit—and voilà! You have a hot flakey French treat c'est très magnifique.

Do note that while this product is safe to consume by those with celiac disease it does contain gluten-free wheat starch. Therefore these croissants are not suitable for people with wheat allergies.

Udi's Gluten-Free Baguettes

Whether you're making garlic bread a caprese sandwich or bruschetta Udi's Gluten-Free Baguettes are sure to hit the spot. You get the crusty texture and delicate taste of a traditional baguette without any gluten. As an added bonus these baguettes are also dairy- and nut-free while also containing a noteworthy 4 grams of satiating protein.

Similar to Schär's croissants Udi's baguettes are sold frozen. So just keep in mind that prior to prepping and serving you'll need to warm these baguettes in the oven at 400 degrees for about 10–15 minutes. If you have time to thaw them beforehand you can cut the time in the oven down to between 5–8 minutes.

Van's Gluten-Free Blueberry Waffles

Katz Gluten-Free Rice Challah

Whether you serve it for Shabbat or use it to make a tasty batch of French toast on a lazy Sunday morning Katz Gluten-Free Sliced Challah Bread is a surefire crowd pleaser. Not only is this challah gluten-free but it's also dairy-free nut-free and made without artificial preservatives or additives.

Traditionally challah bread is made with wheat flour. Although this gluten-free challah alternative uses rice flour instead it tastes like the real deal boasting the same tender spongy texture and braided shape. Also it has a subtly sweet and tangy flavor thanks to thoughtful additions like honey brown sugar and apple cider vinegar. Since it arrives frozen just be sure to let this challah thaw for an hour or two before you're ready to serve.

Drones in Oil and Gas – Key Trends

The key trends shaping the drones sector are classified into four categories: oil and gas industry trends technology trends macroeconomic trends and regulatory trends.

Oil and Gas Industry Trends: The key oil and gas industry trends impacting the drones sector are drone-based surveillance and inspection methane emission detection and management safety and emergency response material handling and workforce training and regulatory compliance. Leading oil and gas players have scaled up their drone-based surveillance and inspection practices. This helps the companies to fulfill their requirement of collecting more data to improve asset visibility. Drone-based data collection help ensure infrastructure integrity especially for aging assets.

Technology Trends: The key technology trends impacting the use of drones in the oil and gas industry are testing hydrogen fuel cell technology the need to manage and control drone swarms the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G-powered drones and the miniaturization of sensors. For instance in June 2022 Event 38 the US-based mapping drone manufacturer successfully tested one of its E400 UAVs powered by hydrogen fuel cells. It flew for two hours and could fly for up to six hours with a fully pressurized hydrogen tank. The battery-powered E400 can only fly for 90 minutes. Also fuel cells require far less maintenance than gas engines due to their fewer moving parts.

Macroeconomic Trends: The report analyses macroeconomic trends impacting the drones sector are the Ukraine- Russia conflict effect of COVID-19 pandemic dominance of China in the commercial drone market and ability to operate beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS).

Regulatory Trends: The key regulatory trends impacting the drones sector are US FAA regulations Europe’s U-space program The EU’s Drone Strategy 2.0 the Indian government regulations and Canada’s Drone Strategy to 2025.

FLUSHING Queens (WABC) -- Powerful winds ripped a tree out of the ground crushing several parked cars in Queens and buckling the sidewalk.

It happened just before 5 p.m. Friday in Flushing at 165th and 43rd Avenue.

""Its tires popped from the weight of this massive tree that came crashing down on it"" said Micaela Marin.

The tree also ripped down power lines and knocked out a utility pole.

""All I heard was the shake - the floor shake and vibrate. It was pretty terrifying because you just hear screaming"" said Gulton Rivera.

The tree also ripped down power lines and knocked out a utility pole. Con Edison says dozens of customers in the area are still in the dark.

Crews are working to replace the pole and raise the fallen wires. They are hoping to have power restored overnight.

No one was injured.

Owners of specific sites are understandably keen to have them validated; other owners have less of a vested interest. Moreover in some areas precise boundaries between vineyards have sometimes been difficult to pin down and some vineyards such as Gaisberg in Kamptal belong to more than one village.

Scroll down to see tasting notes and scores for 12 top white wine picks from Lower Austria

Despite all this the growers’ association called the Oesterreichische Traditionsweingüter (Austrian traditional wine estates) has – off its own bat – created a selection of what its members consider the finest vineyards (Rieden) in Lower Austria. The association has no official standing but is widely respected and few would quarrel with its choice of some 90 sites as Erste Lagen (first growths).

Not many are household names but the same might well be true of the premier cru vineyards of Santenay or St Aubin. As with the official DAC classification only traditional varieties win the association’s seal of approval for each site.

The 26-year-old freelance journalist and graduate student was a competitive distance runner in college and even after she graduated logged about 50 miles per week. So she tentatively tried to return to her running routine roughly a week after a probable case of COVID-19 in March doing her best to overcome the malaise that followed her initial allergy-like symptoms. Each time though “I’d be stuck in bed for days with a severe level of crippling fatigue” Zimmerman says.

Months later Zimmerman still experiences health issues including exhaustion migraines brain fog nausea numbness and sensitivity to screens—a constellation of symptoms that led doctors to diagnose her with Long COVID. Though she can’t know for sure she fears those workouts early in her recovery process may have worsened her condition.

“I had no idea that I should try to rest as hard as I needed to rest” she says.

Stories like Zimmernan’s—illness improvement exercise crash—are common in the Long COVID world. And they highlight what many researchers patients and advocates say is one of the most powerful tools for managing and potentially even preventing Long COVID: rest.

The only guaranteed way to avoid Long COVID is not to get infected by SARS-CoV-2. But if someone does get sick “Rest is incredibly important to give your body and your immune system a chance to fight off the acute infection” says Dr. Janna Friedly a post-COVID rehabilitation specialist at the University of Washington who recovered from Long COVID herself. “People are sort of fighting through it and thinking it’ll go away in a few days and they’ll get better and that doesn’t really work with COVID.”

Researchers are still learning a lot about Long COVID so it’s impossible to say for sure whether rest can truly prevent its development—or conversely whether premature activity causes complications. But anecdotally Friedly says many of the Long COVID patients she sees are working women with families who rushed to get back to normal as soon as possible. It’s hard to give one-size-fits-all guidance about how much rest is enough but Friedly recommends anyone recovering from COVID-19 stay away from high-intensity exercise for at least a couple weeks and avoid pushing through fatigue.

For people who have already developed Long COVID rest can also be useful for managing symptoms including fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM) or crashes following physical mental or emotional exertion. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends “pacing” an activity-management strategy that involves rationing out activity and interspersing it with rest to avoid overexertion and worsening symptoms.

In an international study published last year researchers asked more than 3700 long-haulers about their symptoms. Almost half said they found pacing at least somewhat helpful for symptom management. Meanwhile when other researchers surveyed about 500 long-haulers for a study published in April the overwhelming majority said physical activity worsened their symptoms had no effect or brought on mixed results. That may be because long-haulers have impairments in their mitochondria which generate energy cells can use recent research suggests.

Before Long COVID existed researchers and patients encouraged rest and pacing for the management of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The condition’s hallmark symptoms include PEM and serious long-lasting fatigue—diagnostic criteria that many people with Long COVID now meet. A study of more than 200 people with Long COVID published in January found that 71% had chronic fatigue and almost 60% experienced PEM.

For years clinicians tried to treat ME/CFS patients by gradually increasing their physical activity levels. But that practice has since been shown to be not only ineffective but often harmful because people with ME/CFS “have a unique and [pathological] response to overexertion” due to cellular dysfunction explains Jaime Seltzer director of scientific and medical outreach at the advocacy group MEAction. Most people with ME/CFS prefer pacing over exercise-based therapy one 2019 study found.

To pace effectively people must learn to pick up on cues that they’re overdoing it and unlearn ingrained ideas about productivity Seltzer says. “If you’re doing laundry for example there’s nothing that says you have to fold every single item in one sitting” she says. Breaking up tasks may feel odd but it can be crucial for preserving energy.

People with new Long COVID symptoms should keep a log of their diet activity sleep and symptoms for a couple weeks to learn their triggers Friedly says. For those who can afford one a fitness tracker or other wearable can also be helpful for assessing how much exertion is too much Seltzer says. Once someone has an idea of behaviors that improve or worsen symptoms they can use that information to plan their days and divide activities into manageable chunks.

For many people who test positive for COVID-19 however even taking a few days off from work to isolate is a financial and logistical challenge. Many people have no choice but to return to physically taxing work or responsibilities like child care as soon as possible. “Rest is absolutely advice that’s weighted socioeconomically and politically” Seltzer says.

People with Long COVID or ME/CFS may be able to secure workplace accommodations such as working from home taking on a role that can be done sitting instead of standing or applying for disability if necessary. Seltzer also suggests leaning on friends faith groups or mutual aid networks for help with some tasks. Beyond that Friedly recommends looking for creative ways to use less energy throughout the day. When she was living with Long COVID symptoms she bought many pairs of identical socks so she’d never have to waste time and effort searching for a match.

Things like that “may seem small” she says “but if you add those up throughout the day they make a big difference in terms of how much energy you’re expending.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGhza3kub3JnL3NwYWNlL2xhdW5jaGVzLWVzYS1uYW1lcy0xMHRoLWVhcnRoLWV4cGxvcmVyLW1pc3Npb24taGFybW9ueS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Launches: Harmony is ESA's 10th Earth Explorer mission,"Launches: ESA names 10th Earth Explorer mission

On September 22 2022 the European Space Agency announced Harmony as its 10th Earth Explorer mission. Harmony is part of the FutureEO program. This program is a series of missions using the latest sensing technology to make precise measurements of the planet’s ever-changing topography.

According to ESA the mission will provide data needed to respond to the greatest crises now facing humanity. The announcement said:

Pivotal to ESA’s FutureEO program Earth Explorers are pioneering research missions that show how novel observing techniques lead to new scientific findings about our home planet. Advancing science and technology they address questions that have a direct bearing on climate change and societal issues such as the availability of food water energy resources and public health.

Harmony will actually be a satellite constellation. ESA said:

This exciting new mission will comprise two identical satellites orbiting Earth in convoy with a Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite. Each Harmony satellite will carry a receive-only synthetic aperture radar and a multiview thermal-infrared instrument.

Harmony’s goals

The purpose of the mission is to monitor movement on the Earth’s surface to make a high-resolution record of its subtle ongoing changes. Harmony’s lead investigator Paco López-Dekker explained:

Harmony will for example be used to quantify the processes that govern the exchange of momentum heat and moisture between the ocean surface and the air above. These exchanges influence processes in the lower atmosphere drive weather patterns and affect our climate. It will also be used to study deformation and flow dynamics at the rapidly changing ice-sheet edges for a better understanding of sea-level rise.

Harmony will also track the world’s critical fresh water supplies. López-Dekker said:

In addition Harmony will observe the motion of mountain glaciers which are essential in providing freshwater to hundreds of millions of people so the importance of understanding how they are changing cannot be overstated. And Harmony will be used to measure small shifts in the shape of the land surface such as those related to earthquakes and volcanic activity and therefore contribute to risk monitoring.

Bottom line: The latest ESA FutureEO mission Harmony is the 10th mission in the Earth Explorer program. It will monitor small but critical changes to Earth’s shape.

But while the wine trails are worth the trip as are the more recent additions of craft breweries (the Finger Lakes Beer Trail has more than 100 microbreweries and brewpubs) the region's cheese which has been produced here for decades is a star in its own right.

Officially called the Finger Lakes Cheese Alliance this collection of family-run dairy farms features iconic red barns rolling fields where happy dairy cows snack on grass and amazingly fresh cheddars jacks blues chèvres and more. And with proper plotting they can be tackled on a trail.

While you probably can't hit all 12 in a few days you can explore some while getting a taste of this bucolic region including its famed wine and beer.

Here are my suggestions for spending three dairy-filled days exploring the cheese travel highlights of the Finger Lakes region.

Day 1

The charming small town of Corning New York makes a perfect home base with a quaint main street populated by family-run restaurants and antique shops and no big deal the world's largest glass museum.

Kick off your cheese-fueled adventure at Lively Run Goat Dairy and meet the herd of goats producing some of the milk for its stellar lineup of cheeses like the award-winning Cayuga Blue. Even if you miss the goat yoga classes on Saturday and Sunday morning at this family-friendly farm you can still visit with the happy goats and taste the farm's goat and cow cheeses paired with other local products like honey and preserves.

The next stop about 20 minutes southwest toward Seneca Lake is the Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards winery and tasting room. The land has been in the family for more than 160 years with the winery dating back to 1985. Don't let the busloads of wine-tasting tourists or the tiki bar churning out wine slushies discourage you; serious winemaker Michael Reidy is producing top-notch wines. Try the robust velvety Cabernet Franc and the crisp and fruity Grüner Veltliner.

Just a few minutes down the road perched on the side of the hill overlooking beautiful Seneca Lake find Two Goats Brewing. Order one of the IPAs (the New England is a favorite) and snag a picnic table outside. If you're hungry for lunch order the roast beef sandwich made with tender slow-cooked beef from Schrader Farms just 20 miles away. (Honestly order this even if you're not hungry.)

About a 15-minute drive due south find the village of Watkins Glen with a lush state park waterfront and sightseeing cruises and maybe most importantly two ice cream parlors that deserve your attention. Family-run Great Escape has been making ice cream since 1982 and offers homemade ice cream gelato and sorbet plus some vegan flavors and Colonial Pottery and Creamery attached to an inn makes small-batch ice cream on site. Order a traditional or vegan flavor on one of the homemade waffle cones.

Drive another 10 minutes to reach Sunset View Creamery part of the century-old Hoffman's Dairy farm that's producing handcrafted cheeses from their own herd of Holsteins on site. Carmella a cheesemaker who's part of the family's fourth generation can give you a map of the farm for a self-guided tour of the cheesemaking facility (while the farm's resident dogs Ebony and Holly gleefully follow). Meet the dairy cows (including on my visit calves that were born just weeks ago) and return to the shop for a tasting of flavored cheese curds fresh mozzarella or Heritage cheese (a blend of Swiss and Parmesan) among others. While you're there pick up other local products from nearby farms and makers including maple syrup ground coffee and meat.

Return to Corning about 30 minutes away for dinner and yes more ice cream. Try Atlas Pizzeria for brick-oven pies like the house specialty piled with pepperoni sausage ground beef prosciutto veggies and cheeses. Finish the day across the street at Dippity Do Dahs. The ice cream is crafted on site with milk from Upstate Farms a co-op of family-run farms and uses local ingredients for flavors like the seasonal Maple Walnut and Wine Sorbet. Whatever flavor you order make sure to ask for a homemade waffle cone which you can smell being pressed from a block away.

Day 2

Regan Stephens

Drive north again this time to the western shore of Seneca Lake to fourth-generation dairy farm Shtayburne Farm Creamery where you'll find plenty of samples of flavored cheddars jacks and curds in the shop. Try the tomato basil curds the jalapeño or blueberry jack or something more traditional but equally delicious. Afterward head west to Ravines Wine Cellars where the knowledgeable staff will welcome you to a tasting room that's reminiscent of a Tuscan villa. Find one of the wrought iron tables in the back smack in between rows of lush green vineyards and the picturesque Keuka Lake and order a cheese and charcuterie plate with locally produced meats and cheeses and a warm fresh-baked baguette paired with a lineup of stellar dry Rieslings and other varietals from bubbles to reds. Or opt for the wine and chocolate tasting where the wine complemented by artisanal milks and darks takes on new identities.

For a proper lunch drive to the northern tip of Keuka Lake to find Seneca Farms. The retro spot with the red-and-white striped awning has outdoor seating plus a fried chicken plate that you'll remember fondly 'til the end of time paired with corn fritters mac and cheese and salads made from old family recipes. Save room for ice cream — either the rich frozen custard in myriad homemade flavors (get the peach if they have it) or hard ice cream made in-house using a 16% butterfat base with homemade chocolates and candy mix-ins.

Regan Stephens

After a 20-minute drive south down the western shore of Keuka Lake you'll find Steuben Brewing. Head brewer and Finger Lakes native Chad Zimar makes excellent IPAs and lagers and his brown ale just won best in New York State at TAP New York craft beer festival. The five-year-old brewery supports local farmers and doesn't allow tour buses in an effort to keep the vibe family-friendly which it manages with live music a stack of board games free-flowing popcorn and plenty of outdoor picnic seating with a prime view of the lake. It will be hard to leave this idyllic setting but a 15-minute drive will take you to the southern tip of Keuka Lake where you'll find the delightful little Depot Park. There's kayaking in the harbor a small pier for fishing and a roped-off area for swimmers. If you have time walk around the town of Hammondsport — home to quaint shops festivals and only about 700 residents.

For dinner make a reservation at the chef-owned Pleasant Valley Inn located just outside of downtown. A charming four-room bed and breakfast the historic inn is also home to an excellent restaurant that utilizes the region's best produce meats and cheeses. The chef makes homemade pasta (try the seasonal crab in spicy red sauce or flavorful corn pasta with a little kick of garlic) locally sourced pork and lots of farm-grown vegetables. Don't miss the board of local cheeses (the Lively Run blue is often featured) and the salmon appetizer smoked in-house using wood from a nearby vineyard.

Day 3

Continue your journey at Hemlock Ridge Farm (it's a good idea to call or text Jessie one of the owners first. Her number is listed on the website). The certified organic farm offers a selection of cheddars (hot pepper sharp or garlic) plus chicken beef and pork tons of veggies pure maple syrup and bouquets of fresh blooms. For an early lunch stop into Crooked Lake Ice Cream back in downtown Hammondsport. Though the ice cream isn't local (it comes from a small-batch maker in Maine) it's delicious and the charming little restaurant serves salads and sandwiches for lunch and breakfast like the sausage gravy and biscuits all day.

A 30-minute drive west find Stewart's Family Farm. At their farm stand each member of the Stewart family produces a different ardently made product. There's goat cheese (sold in containers of soft chèvre some flavored with dill or garlic) fresh sourdough baked goods shelves of maple syrup skeins of colorful lamb's wool and maple frozen custard also made with goat's milk. Alongside the items produced by the family you'll find local goods like handcrafted jewelry and pottery and a selection of jack cheeses from nearby Heaven Scent Farm.

Return to Corning for dinner this time at Cugini Cafe. The Italian market and café is owned by Marco Hickey who also owns the larger cheese manufacturer and retailer Golden Age Cheese. Hickey's family has been making cheese for over three decades and the café sells hand-pulled mozzarella plus a selection of other Golden Age cheeses including the naturally smoked cheddar and provolone. Try one of the Italian heroes or wind down your cheese expedition on a high note with the Super Cheesy Melt Panini pressed with the hand-stretched mozz plus cheddar and provolone. Afterward head to Liquid Shoes Brewing a few doors down on Market Street and finish strong with one of brothers David and Eric Shoemaker's fresh-brewed ales while you plot your return. There are plenty more cheesy destinations you have yet to explore here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYW1zdW5nLmNvbS9zZy9oYXZpbmctYS1yb3VnaC1kYXktcG93ZXItdGhyb3VnaC13aXRoLXRoZS1zdHJvbmdlc3Qtc2Ftc3VuZy1nYWxheHktZm9sZGFibGVzLWV2ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Having a Rough Day?

At least some people will give an affirmative answer. Yu Chengdong Executive Director of Huawei recently introduced Kunlun Glass used in the Mate50 Pro Kunlun version to fix this pain at the Huawei Mate50 launch conference.

Kunlun glass has the first-ever five-star glass drop resistance certification from Switzerland's SGS and the drop resistance of Kunlun Glass is ten times higher than ordinary glass said Jiang Hong chief scientist of Chongqing Xinjing Special Glass Co. Ltd. and director of the National Key Laboratory of Special Glass.

It is said to be better than Corning glass

Kunlun Glass was developed and manufactured by Chongqing Xinjing Special Glass Co. Ltd. which settled in Liangjiang New Area in 2014 and mainly produced high-alumina and high-lithium silica special glass.

""As a high-end material high-alumina silica glass is widely used in touch panels aviation high-speed rail and rail trains with great market demand"" said Bai Yibo chairman of Chongqing Xinjing Special Glass Co. Ltd. ""In 2020 Xinjing added a production line to produce transparent nano-ceramic glass.""

Two days after the Huawei launching conference Apple debuted the iPhone 14 series on September 8. The series continues to use Apple's exclusive super-ceramic glass panels produced by Corning Inc. in the United States.

""Kunlun glass is also a super ceramic crystal a transparent nano-ceramic glass"" said Jiang. He continued that since Apple has invested in Corning Corning's glass is exclusively for Apple and not sold to Huawei and other Chinese mobile phone manufacturers.

""But now we are fully capable of producing our own Kunlun Glass and some of its properties are even better than Corning's super-ceramic"" said Jiang.

10000 trillion crystals prevent crack propagation

Experiments show that the Huawei Mate50 Pro equipped with Kunlun Glass can be dropped from 4.2 meters without damage because it contains 10000 trillion nanocrystals to prevent cracks.

""Ceramic glass is ubiquitous but it is difficult to make it transparent. The reason for its high resistance is that there are 10-20 nanometer crystallites in the glass which is like mixing stones in cement"" said Jiang.

Jiang continued that the majority of glass-ceramic screens are nano-crystallites. Kunlun Glass has undergone high-temperature platinum precious metal smelting at 1600 degrees nanocrystal growth for 24 hours and 108 processing procedures. Each piece of Kunlun Glass has 10000 trillion high-strength nanocrystals injecting composite particles.

""When glass crack expands it encounters the crystal grain and the crack will bypass"" said Jiang. ""It must bypass many crystals and a long path to break the glass ceramic which resists the crack propagation.""

Ltd. has over 200 patents covering formulations production equipment and processes glass properties and testing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzLWNpdGl6ZW4uY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvaWNwMDI0MDYw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ricardo Sauro Obituary - The Iowa City Press-Citizen,"Ricardo was born in Argentina.

""In terms of membership fees and a possible increase there are no specific plans regarding a fee increase at this time"" Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said during the company's earnings call on Thursday. ""We're pleased with our growth in both top line sales and membership households over the last several quarters and in member loyalty as reflected in increasing member renewal rates.""

Ticker Security Last Change Change % COST COSTCO WHOLESALE CORP. 787.19 +8.15 +1.05%

At the end of the fourth quarter Costco's membership renewal rate came in at 92.6% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.4% worldwide up from 92.3% and 90% in the previous quarter respectively.

The company has 65.8 million paid household members and 118.9 million cardholders as of the end of the fourth quarter both up 6.5% compared to a year ago. Paid executive memberships totaled 29.1 million an increase of 1.2 million compared to the third quarter. Executive members now represent over 44% of Costco's members and just under 72% of its worldwide sales.

SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES AND INFLATION FUEL BILLION-DOLLAR BLACK MARKET

Historically Costco has increased its membership fees about every five and a half years. Galanti noted that the last three increases were on average five years and seven months apart. The company which last raised its membership fees in June 2017 currently charges $120 per year for executive memberships and $60 per year for its Gold Star and business memberships.

""If you look at June of '17 plus five years and seven months you're talking roughly January '23"" Galanti said. ""Now I'm not suggesting it's January '23. I'm just saying it's not there yet anyway. And our view is we are confident in our ability to do so. And at some point we will but it's a question of when not if.""

""Given the headline of inflation and concerns about recession we feel quite comfortable driving sales and earnings the way we are right now and we still have that arrow in our quiver as we go forward"" he added.

Costco reported net income of $1.868 billion or $4.20 per diluted share in the fourth quarter compared with $1.67 billion or $3.76 per diluted share in the same period last year.

Revenue from membership fees came in at $1.3 billion during the quarter up from $1.2 billion a year ago.

The comments come as Walmart-owned Sam's Club is preparing to raise its annual Club membership fee for the first time in nine years and annual Plus membership fee for the first time since its introduction in 1999. Starting Oct. 17 the annual membership fee will be $50 for Club members and $110 for Plus members up from $45 and $100 respectively.

""We are mindful of the financial pressure on wallets right now. So this year’s renewal is on us"" Sam's Club CEO Kath McLay said in a notice to customers. ""We’re giving back $5 in Sam’s Cash to Club members and $10 in Sam’s Cash to Plus members shortly after renewal.""

Earlier this month Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose 8.3% in August from a year ago. Prices climbed 0.1% in the one-month period from July.

Though Galanti said Costco's overall price inflation was about 8% during the fourth quarter due to pressures from higher commodity prices higher wages higher transportation costs and supply chain disruptions he noted that there have been minor improvements in some areas.

""We're seeing some commodities prices coming down such as gas steel beef relative to a year ago even some small cost changes in plastics. We're seeing some relief on container pricing"" Galanti said. ""Wages still seem to be the one thing that's still relatively higher. But overall some beginnings of some light at the end of that tunnel.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL2Nvc3Rjby10by1rZWVwLTEtNTAtaG90LWRvZy1hbmQtc29kYS1jb21iby1mb3JldmVyLWRlc3BpdGUtaW5mbGF0aW9uLWV4ZWMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco to keep $1.50 hot dog-and-soda combo 'forever' despite inflation: exec,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='nypost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/09/23/costco-to-keep-1-50-hot-dog-and-soda-combo-forever-despite-inflation-exec/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026740D66FE0>, 'Connection to nypost.com timed out.

While the beginning of his reign was understandably dominated by the mourning for his mother with the Queen's state funeral having taken place this Monday the new King Charles appears to be settling in to his new position in earnest.

Today Buckingham Palace released a new photo of the King carrying out his official government duties. Taken in the 18th century room at Buckingham Palace last week the photo shows Charles working from The King’s Red Box—a case containing papers for the monarch including documents from government ministers in the United Kingdom representatives from the Commonwealth and other pressing work that might need the crown's attention. Per the Palace ""the documents are sent from the Private Secretary’s Office to The King wherever he may be in residence in a locked red despatch box.""

For longtime fans of the royal family the Red Box may be familiar. The cases have become a famous icon of the working monarch and Queen Elizabeth was often pictured alongside hers while doing her official duties. According to Barrow Hepburn & Gale the British leathergoods purveyor who makes the boxes ""the designation of the Despatch box goes back to the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.""

Fox Photos // Getty Images Queen Elizabeth II working from her red boxes in her study in Balmoral Castle in 1972.

The Queen reportedly received the boxes marked with her cypher almost every day of the year with the exception of Christmas Day. At least as far as 2015 she was still using the ones that were made for her upon her 1953 coronation. The Evening Standard reported that Charles will have his own cypher suggesting that he is likely using new boxes of his own.

In addition to the first appearance of Charles's Red Box the new photo also nods to his family history. In the background appears a portrait of Charles's parents Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip which was given by them to Elizabeth's father King George VI for Christmas in 1951.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vZGV0YWlscy1yb21hbi1yZWlnbnMtYmVhdC1kcmV3LW1jaW50eXJlLWNsYXNoLWF0LXRoZS1jYXN0bGUtcmVwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More Details On Why WWE Had Roman Reigns Beat Drew McIntyre At Clash At The Castle [Report],"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vZGV0YWlscy1yb21hbi1yZWlnbnMtYmVhdC1kcmV3LW1jaW50eXJlLWNsYXNoLWF0LXRoZS1jYXN0bGUtcmVwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2luZC9jdWx0dXJlL3Blb3BsZS90aGluZ3Mtb3duZWQtYnktcXVlZW4tZWxpemFiZXRoLWlpL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2luZC9jdWx0dXJlL3Blb3BsZS90aGluZ3Mtb3duZWQtYnktcXVlZW4tZWxpemFiZXRoLWlpL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unique and exquisite things owned by Queen Elizabeth II,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2luZC9jdWx0dXJlL3Blb3BsZS90aGluZ3Mtb3duZWQtYnktcXVlZW4tZWxpemFiZXRoLWlpL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2luZC9jdWx0dXJlL3Blb3BsZS90aGluZ3Mtb3duZWQtYnktcXVlZW4tZWxpemFiZXRoLWlpL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267409E1330>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

As for accessories the Crown Princess opted for a new pair of shoes which she had not been spotted in before. These were the Gianvito Rossi 105 Hot Pink Satin Pumps which are believed to be retailed at £600. The official Gianvoto Rossi website reads: ""As if finely molded from a thin sheet of gleaming metal the signature Gianvito 105 stiletto pump dazzles all around seductively reflecting the light from every angle step after step. Handmade in Italy."" She opted for diamond jewellery including her wedding tiara which was a gift from Queen Margrethe II and Prince Henrik of Denmark.

(WSVN) - Rescue crews took four train crew members to the hospital after two freight trains collided near Miami International Airport in Northwest Miami-Dade causing a derailment and leading to a major road closure.

Miami-Dade Police and Fire Rescue units responded to the scene of the crash near Perimeter Road and Northwest 15th Street Saturday night.

A statement issued by a CSX spokesperson reads in part “Two CSX rock trains were involved in an incident near Miami International Airport that resulted in a derailment.”

According to a Tri-Rail spokesperson the two trains crashed on an industrial track outside the main line.

MDFR officials said the collision took place at around 7 p.m.

A picture posted to social media by Andy Slater captured the aftermath of the impact. A closer look at the image shows one of the trains is lopsided.

Paramedics transported the injured victims to area hospitals with minor injuries.

The CSX statement reads in part “As a precaution several crew members were transported to the hospital for evaluation.”

MDFR officials said the Miami-Dade County Department of Environmental Resources Management was notified about a fuel spill due to the crash.

The CSX statement reads in part “Preliminary reports indicate that an unknown quantity of diesel fuel spilled from the derailed locomotives. There are no waterways impacted.”

Tri-Rail officials said hazmat crews have responded to the scene.

Since the crash took place outside the main line it has not affected Tri-Rail’s train schedule.

Police said they have shut down the eastbound lanes of Perimeter Road between Northwest 57th and 45th avenues while fire crews and the hazmat unit worked to decontaminate the area.

Officials with MIA said there is currently no access to the airport through Perimeter Road. Drivers are advised to take the Dolphin Expressway as an alternate route.

According to the CSX website the company transports a variety of things including “biodiesel ethanol automobiles and chemicals among other equipment.

The CSX statement goes on to say “CSX is currently investigating the incident and working closely with local first responders to assess the situation as we develop a recovery plan.”

Police have not provided further details about the collision as they continue to investigate.

It is no secret that women’s basketball in Barbados needs a revamp and Infra Rentals is playing its part with the sponsorship of uniforms for the Heat Basketball ladies’ team which were presented yesterday evening at the Young Men’s Christian Association.

A total of 15 sets of jerseys and pants was presented to Kings Basketball Academy under which clubs such as Heat women Pirates men and two young male teams are under. Founder of Kings Basketball Junior Cummins praised Infra and said it is one of the most giving companies in Barbados that does a lot for local sports.

“The fact that Infra has been so instrumental in supporting sports in Barbados I had the desire to have them on board because this is years now I have been doing basketball with various age groups and I felt that the younger age groups would benefit more” Cummins told the media.

He added: “The fact that we are associated now with Infra means the world to me it honestly does and the people at Infra have been nothing more than warm and patient with us and I really appreciate that. But who needs it the most is girls basketball because as you know girls basketball in Barbados is kind of failing so as a basketball community we have come together and try to get as many girls teams as possible and revitalize girls basketball.

“Infra stepped in at the right time at the right moment and they were able to get the gear. When they heard they were getting the gear they were really fussy smiling from ear to ear and were really happy. It warmed my heart to see that too because they played the BABA Summer Jam tournament and everyone commented on how nice the girls looked.”

A longstanding basketball coach of 20 years Cummins stressed that there is a need to have young female basketballers playing in an effort to revive and strengthen the women’s side of the game.

“There have been a lot of times where the same ladies have been making the same national team because there aren’t much younger players to push them out. Not to sound mean or anything but to have that insurgence of youth back into the national team. So I definitely believe that having multiple female basketball teams of a younger age group would be very helpful going forward in the future of basketball especially national basketball” Cummins added.

The last time women’s basketball was contested on island at the Barbados Amateur Basketball Association level was in 2018 when Lady Cougars won the title. Since then there has been no premier league or knockout competitions for women granted the Coronavirus pandemic eliminated two of those years but still with the return to play with men’s basketball nothing has yet been announced for the ladies.

Now that most of the girls are back in school Cummins said the plan will be to continue practising and playing out of season basketball tournaments such as Kings of the Court – which he believes will allow the ladies to play at a more competitive level playing against more senior players.

Group Marketing Manager for Jada Group Inc who are the parent company for Infra Alicia Griffith explained that initiatives and partnerships such as this were important to the development and progress of the youth. She noted that this was the first time the company has sponsored any basketball team and therefore they were happy to do so given their history of supporting sports in Barbados.

“Infra has since the initiation of our adoption of the cause Infra Stars kids are our stars we have been very dedicated to the development of children and providing them with the tools and equipment they need to get them through whether it is school sports arts. We in the past and still are long-time sponsors of different teams but we didn’t have a basketball team so immediately that was of interest to us to expand it to a different sport to be able to touch different kids.

“I think it is important for us to identify those Infra Stars those rising stars and be able to support them throughout their journey whether it is in professional sports or segway into their careers with the assistance that sports would have given them. So what do they need to get there? At this point we don’t know what that is but we are definitely dedicated to leaving that conversation open seeing what is next” Griffith said.

Te Kakenga Kawiti Bishara and Ben Cummins’ collaborative effort brought this classic story to life.

The Battle of the Mountains is a widely known tale across Aotearoa.

They story says there were Māori warriors Tongariro Taranaki Tauhara and Pūtauaki (Mt Edgecumbe) who competed for the affections of the beautiful maiden mountain Pīhanga.

After a long battle Tongariro emerged the winner and the defeated maunga agreed to leave his domain travelling as far as they could before dawn when the rising sun would fix them to the spot.

Ngāti Tūwharetoa descendant Bishara says this is a first for this type of storytelling.

“There is nothing like this to watch for us. When I was younger I grew up with this story of the iwi being shared. So this is for the iwi and for the children.”

The writer of the animation Bishara also says this is a taonga to pass down through the generations.

“Perhaps in 30 years time I can look back and rewatch this animation.”

The power of animation

A descendant of Ngāti Raukawa and animation creator Ben Cummins says animation carries a story in a different way.

“Those stories traditionally have been told orally and passed down. When they’re written down they can lose some of that impact whereas now with the power of animation we can show these stories in a way they’ve never been done before.”

Reaching out to other iwi who also have their own version of the story was one barrier Bishara faced but he still encourages them to come share their stories.

“Reaching out to other iwi was one barrier talking with Ngāti Rangi Taranaki and unable to receive anything back.

“Hopefully soon we’ll be able to reach out again. Don’t be shy come along and share your stories.”

But this isn’t the end for Cummins as he is now looking at the arrival of Māori in Aotearoa.

“Keep an eye out we might be doing something in the coming months on the seven waka with the migration.”"

Specific questions around telehealth and the prescribing of controlled substances threaten the burgeoning crop of digital behavioral health operators that have thrived during the loosened regulations. Further lingering questions about access to care via Medicaid hang over traditional addiction treatment providers as a potentially major threat to revenue and patient access.

Medicaid is the single largest payer for behavioral health services according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

During the COVID-19 pandemic the federal government temporarily lifted the Ryan Haight Act’s mandate that providers facilitate an in-person assessment before prescribing controlled substances as part of the public health emergency declaration (PHE).

Key medications in behavioral health are controlled substances. This list includes buprenorphine a vital treatment in addiction treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD); the brand-named ADHD drug Adderall which is mixed amphetamine salts and a potent stimulant; and alprazolam better known as Xanax. All are listed as controlled substances by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

Companies have prepared for the potential end of the PHE in different ways. San Francisco-based mental health startup Cerebral Inc. for example canned nearly all of its controlled substances following a storm of criticism around its prescribing practices while citing concerns about the end of the PHE.

The end of the PHE opens several questions for telehealth which several executives in the space tell BHB has and will continue to define the behavioral health industry.

Virtual addiction treatment providers struggle with retail pharmacies

Major retail pharmacy operators including Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) and CVS Health Inc. (NYSE: CVS) have tightened the reins on telehealth prescriptions for controlled substances.

These revelations first reported by Fierce Healthcare come at a time when several of these retail pharmacy operators find themselves on the wrong side of judgments and settlements over their handling of opioid painkillers.

On Sept. 20 West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced settlements with CVS Health and Walmart that total $147 million.

“There is a lot of concern and anxiety around what’s going to happen” Emily Behar vice president of clinical operations for Ophelia Health told Behavioral Health Business.

The New York City-based virtual addiction treatment provider has always had a rocky experience with Walmart and discourages its patients from having prescriptions filled there Behar said.

Ophelia Health is a digital MAT provider that operates in 14 states. It was founded in 2019 and that offers subscription services and works in-network with payers.

Recently Ophelia Health has run into Walmart’s in-person assessment requirements for controlled substances.

“Walmart does not have a policy to refuse to fill telehealth prescriptions of controlled substances” Walmart spokesperson Marilee McInnis told BHB. “Walmart requires in-person exams within two years for telehealth prescriptions for controlled substances. Walmart pharmacists are empowered to use their professional judgment when considering whether to fill any prescription.”

This is more stringent than is required presently by federal regulations Behar points out. Virtual addiction treatment providers like Ophelia Health have thrived during the pandemic era regulations and garnered major venture-based investment rounds.

“There is a lot of concern and scrutiny of telehealth providers which I understand and respect. It is good to make sure that … telehealth is not the Wild West” Behar said. “But I think that there are undue fears that can also come with this because we and many other telehealth practitioners have been practicing for a number of years now with a tremendous amount of success.”

CVS Health pharmacies have become more selective over the last few months especially in Pennsylvania Behar said even though they have not been able to get a specific answer on if this is the result of local policies or policies developed by corporate leadership.

A CVS Health spokesperson didn’t answer specific questions about if it has a policy on filling controlled substances prescriptions from virtual behavioral health providers.

CVS Health has previously decided whether to work with telehealth companies on an individual basis. CVS no longer accepts controlled substance prescriptions from Cerebral and the virtual mental health startups Done Global Inc. and Medvidi.

Mike DeAngelis executive director of corporate communications for CVS said it was “[a]s a result of our being unable to resolve concerns we had” in an email.

Both Done and Medvidi market telehealth therapy and medication for ADHD. Done specializes in ADHD treatment while Medvidi treats other mental health conditions.

“We are committed to making mental health services as accessible and convenient as possible” DeAngelis said. “At the same time it is important that medications are prescribed appropriately.”

Both Done Global and Cerebral are reportedly under federal investigation.

Dealing with the uncertainty

Telehealth proponents argue that many patients who seek addiction treatment care virtually do not disclose their condition to primary care providers. About 80% of Ophelia Health’s OUD patients are either not engaged with the health care system or do not disclose their addiction to their provider Behar said adding that simply assuming that people will get in-person exams from a primary care provider is flawed.

“What we want is for pharmacists and pharmacies to be on the same team with us” Behar said. “But they can also prove to be really strong barriers for us.”

The resumption of the Ryan Haight Act’s in-person requirements would require a fundamental shift in Ophelia Health’s operating and clinical model to accommodate office visits.

To deal with the uncertainty Ophelia Health has focused on putting out as much data as possible to try to sway policymakers to enumerate COVID-era regulations and making contingency plans for if the PHE and related regulations end Behar said.

This contingency planning includes plans to connect patients with in-person evaluations Behar said. Ophelia Health CEO Zack Gray told BHB in a previous interview the company would likely partner with local providers especially in rural areas and consider opening offices in more densely populated areas.

Ophelia Health has had some regulatory near-misses at the state level.

“We’ve gone through two fire drills in Pennsylvania where Pennsylvania has said that their ruling is going to expire twice now — requiring in-person exams again. Pennsylvania is one of our largest operating states” Behar said. “We’ve gone up until the 11th hour where they say ‘Oh no we’re extending it.’”

Resolving the uncertainty requires enough political will and capital to get statutory changes to the Social Security Act through Congress and past Pres. Joe Biden Christopher Eades a shareholder with health care law firm Hall Render focused on virtual care and medical staffing told BHB.

What telehealth changes have been enumerated by Congress and executive agencies at the federal level are largely tied to Medicaid and still aren’t permanent.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act 2022 enacted in March allows for compensation for tele-behavioral health for Medicare patients and the origination of telehealth visits in their homes to extend 151 days or about five months after the end of the PHE.

The Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act of 2022 which has already passed the U.S. House of Representatives and is sponsored by outgoing Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Chaney would extend Medicare telehealth flexibilities to the end of 2024.

The uncertainty at the federal level spawns greater variability in regulation across the 50 states and territories adding to the challenges of multi-state operators Eades said.

“At the top of my list is where we will be with Medicare reimbursement across the board — that’s going to drive a lot of everything else we see in terms of reimbursement” Eades said of specific concerns.

He also pointed to the potential problem of the DEA finally coming through with a special telehealth registry for providers that want to prescribe controlled substances that it was mandated to create by October 2019.

“Will the DEA special registration look anything like the current COVID-specific exception that the DEA has put in place for purposes of the pandemic?” Eades said adding that the registry could send telehealth backward if it is based on a pre-COVID world. “That will create significant obstacles in terms of utilizing virtual care to the extent those encounters involve a controlled substance prescription.”

OTPs holding out hope for telehealth changes

While Scottsdale Arizona-based Community Medical Services saw telehealth rates jump to as high as 90% during the onset of the pandemic for behavioral health services it doesn’t have the same reliance on telehealth flexibilities of the virtual startups in the space.

The opioid treatment program (OTP) facility operator a specific type of care provider recognized by the U.S. Substance and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is legally required to have patients come into the office for certain services such as the administration of methadone a highly regulated opioid used to treat OUD.

OTPs have also had some COVID-era flexibilities temporarily extended beyond the PHE.

“There was not much uncertainty around the telehealth piece [for Community Medical Services]” Nick Stavros CEO of Community Medical Services told BHB. “There are not many limitations on us doing telehealth.”

In June SAMHSA announced that OTPs can continue prescribing buprenorphine through telemedicine without requiring patients to come in for an in-person medical visit for up to a year.

The federal government has also allowed OTPs to offer periodic assessments counseling and therapy services via telehealth specifically audio-visual chats and allowed for audio-only chats during the PHE. Post-PHE audio-only calls will no longer be allowed according to the 2022 Physician Fee Schedule final rule.

The greater worry for Stavros is the potential for millions of patients that may be forced off Medicaid plans with the resumption of the Medicaid eligibility determinations the federal government mandated that states pause during the pandemic.

As many as 15 million people nationwide are projected to lose Medicaid coverage post-PHE according to a report by the U.S. Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.

“That’s our biggest fear” Stavros said. “There’s no way to tell for us how many of our patients are at risk of falling off of Medicaid. That’s something we’re trying to understand and play an active role trying to make sure we’re doing our part communicating with patients and helping facilitate them getting coverage.”

For years OTPs have sought clearance from the federal government to conduct initial exams and intakes for methadone via telehealth. Even during the pandemic SAMHSA didn’t make that an option. Making this regulatory change is a top hope for Stavros.

Making it easier to start methadone treatment is especially relevant because of the rise of fentanyl overdose deaths. About two-thirds of the record-setting 108000 drug overdose deaths in the 12 months ending in May involved synthetic opioids like fentanyl.

Methadone is the best understood and arguably the most effective medication in treating OUD according to a study by the University of Washington. It is also the best medication for treating OUD patients using fentanyl Stavros said.

However it doesn’t typically see the same efficacy that it sees with less potent forms of opioids. Buprenorphine another staple of treating OUD also pales in treating fentanyl.

“The two most effective tools we have for fighting opioids are less effective for fighting and fentanyl right now” Stavros said.

The greater worry for Stavros is the potential for millions of patients that may be forced off Medicaid plans with the resumption of the Medicaid eligibility determinations the federal government mandated that states pause during the pandemic.

As many as 15 million people nationwide are projected to lose Medicaid coverage post-PHE according to a report by the U.S. Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.

“That’s our biggest fear” Stavros said. “There’s no way to tell for us how many of our patients are at risk of falling off of Medicaid. That’s something we’re trying to understand and play an active role trying to make sure we’re doing our part communicating with patients and helping facilitate them getting coverage.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Nhbm8tbnlzZWNhbm8tcmlzZXMtYXMtaHVtYW5hLWFuZC1jdnMtdmllLWZvci1hbi1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1kZWFs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cano (NYSE:CANO) Rises as Humana and CVS Vie for an Acquisition Deal - TipRanks.com,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.tipranks.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/cano-nysecano-rises-as-humana-and-cvs-vie-for-an-acquisition-deal (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674032AB00>, 'Connection to www.tipranks.com timed out.

J.B. Pritzker and the University of Illinois System's Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) unveiled the design for the new headquarters in The 78 a vibrant new innovation district along the Chicago River.

In addition CVS Health announced today that it will be an anchor employer for DPI’s new partnership with technology services firm Interapt. Over the next five years the Chicago/Skills apprenticeship program will provide as many as 2500 individuals with tuition-free technology training and paid apprenticeship opportunities with a focus on diverse apprentices. CVS Health has committed to hiring more than 200 successful participants over the next three years.

“The State of Illinois is building a world-class innovation hub in the heart of Chicago on the site of an old railroad yard that has sat vacant for decades” Pritzker said. “Already DPI has helped launch our state’s COVID-testing system is searching for COVID-19 and other viruses in our wastewater and is training hundreds of students for careers in tech – and has a plan to spread the opportunities equitably. This futuristic design from OMA/Jacobs matches our ambitions.”

“This new building is a testament to the innovation and forward-thinking ideas Illinois aims to foster across the state” said Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton. “The future headquarters will also show how much we can do to grow and progress when we invest in infrastructure that pushes us forward. That was the mission of Rebuild Illinois and the funds coming from this plan continue to positively shape diverse communities throughout the state.”

Located on a one-acre site southwest of the Loop the new DPI headquarters will provide more than 200000 square feet of office classroom lab and event space for DPI and its university and industry partners.

The State of Illinois is committing $500 million in capital funding to launch DPI and establish Illinois Innovation Network regional hubs at universities throughout the state. DPI is part of the University of Illinois System.

“Chicago has long been known as a hub for technology and innovation and is home to incredible industry talent” said Chicago Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot. “With this new building DPI will both build on this reputation and be able to draw from our robust talent pool. I look forward to seeing this project come to life and kick off the creation of our city’s new innovation district.”

“Already DPI is working with our many partners – in industry government and across K-12 and higher education – to tackle real-world challenges and create businesses and jobs” said Tim Killeen president of the U of I System. “We are deeply grateful to Governor Pritzker the State Legislature Related Midwest and the Capital Development Board for their investment in our universities and in the collective power they hold to move Illinois forward and ensure it prospers.”

The project is expected to break ground in 2024 becoming the first building to begin construction in The 78 Innovation District. The facility will mark the beginning of a transformation that will connect the South Loop and Chinatown filling a 62-acre void that has long separated them.

The eight-story building – a layered dome of glass and steel – is designed to create strong connections to the vibrant communities on all sides of the building the adjacent riverfront and the future phases of the larger Innovation District at The 78. The base will be populated with space that will be shared with the public — a café auditorium and multipurpose exhibition space/classrooms. The building’s main entry will be located at 15th Street and Wells-Wentworth and a Richard Hunt sculpture will anchor the site’s landscape.

Architecture firms OMA under the direction of partner Shohei Shigematsu and Jacobs are leading the design. The Illinois Capital Development Board oversees design and construction. Related Midwest the developer of The 78 donated the land for DPI and will oversee the continued buildout of the 62-acre property.

“Our architects describe our central atrium as ‘an active collision zone’ and I love that” said DPI Executive Director Bill Jackson. “We’re here to foster new relationships and bring more women and people of color into the tech industry. We can’t wait to have a building that will help us accelerate our growth and make new connections.”

“Today’s unveiling of Discovery Partners Institute’s new and improved headquarters design symbolizes the expansion of their mission to connect underrepresented Chicagoans with quality education and opportunities for employment across various industries” said State Sen. Patricia Van Pelt (D-Chicago). “Further this innovative partnership between DPI Interapt and CVS Health will provide an economic boost that will reverberate throughout the surrounding neighborhoods.”

“The Chicago/Skills apprenticeship program is a much-needed investment for our communities” said State Sen. Tony Munoz (D-Chicago). “Oftentimes people don’t have the means to gain the skills needed to find a job in the labor force. This apprenticeship program will give more people the training they need to be successful.”

“I am beyond excited to welcome Discovery Partners Institute to their new home in the 6th district” said State Rep. Sonya Harper. “The new headquarters means a brighter future for Chicago and the state of Illinois. I look forward to partnering with them to bring growth jobs opportunities and prosperity to our communities.”

“The Discovery Partners Institute is providing one of the most essential things we can give to our kids: opportunities” said State Rep. Lakesia Collins. “In addition to the economic benefits this facility will bring to our community in jobs and commerce the chance to learn at an elite level is invaluable. Building a better future always starts with getting kids a good education so this campus is a big step forward.”

“Chicago has long been a city of innovators and big dreamers and with the unveiling of the Discovery Partners Institute’s new campus right here in The 78 our proud history of lifting up the best and brightest continues” said State Rep. Theresa Mah. “DPI’s new campus is a unique opportunity for the government community and the private sector to come together and lead the U.S. in not only today’s technological marvels but also the next generation of research and development. With thousands of tuition-free training and apprenticeship programs as well as hundreds of job opportunities supported through a design that stirs the imagination the future is being built right here in Chicago. As the state representative for the adjacent 2nd District I am beyond excited to be a part of this achievement.”

“DPI cultivates opportunities for research learning and innovation to diverse communities requiring an architecture that adapts to continued growth of its programs. We wanted to provide a building that fosters interdisciplinary interaction and experimentation” said Shohei Shigematsu OMA Partner. “Programs are organized to maximize efficiency and potential to converge and variegated layouts are configured around a central zone of collisions. A soft transparent form and public ground floor offer an open invitation for the community to the building and its network.”

“Our interdisciplinary team believes strongly in a collaborative approach to design and with a long history of working together we know how to approach the unique and exciting challenges of the project — elevating the process and the outcomes” says Kitts Christov vice president at Jacobs. “OMA/Jacobs and our partners are truly honored to be leading this legacy project that will create enduring social and economic value to our communities the Greater Chicago Metropolitan Area and the State of Illinois.”

“The ambition for the ground level-design is to make this public building a public amenity” said Jim Underwood executive director of the Illinois Capital Development Board. “It’s also designed for scientists students professors entrepreneurs and industry to collaborate and build things together.”

“As an anchor of The 78 and a building with world-class architecture the Discovery Partners Institute will uphold Chicago’s tradition of innovative design” said Ann Thompson executive vice president of architecture and design at Related Midwest and board chair of the Chicago Architecture Center. “Related Midwest is proud to collaborate on this important project and we welcome the way it stands as a prototype for how equitable design transforms communities.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbmV2YWRhY3VycmVudC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yMy9uZXZhZGEtam9pbnMtb3JlZ29uLXdhc2hpbmd0b24taW4tcHJlc2NyaXB0aW9uLWRydWdkaXNjb3VudC1wcm9ncmFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nevada joins Oregon Washington in prescription drug discount program • Nevada Current,"Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak Thursday announced the launch of ArrayRx a prescription drug discount card which he said will help Nevadans save up to 80% on generic prescription drugs and 20% on name brand prescription drugs regardless of income age or citizenship.

Nevada joins Oregon and Washington in ArrayRx Solutions formerly known as Northwest Prescription Drug Consortium which allows the states to negotiate lower prices through aggregating purchase volume. Sisolak announced the program in February at the State of the State address.

ArrayRx Solutions’ origins began in Washington when the state’s legislature wanted to find a solution to rising costs for prescription drugs. In 2006 Washington and Oregon partnered to form the Northwest Prescription Drug Consortium and use the states’ combined resources to lower costs by negotiating discounts with manufacturers and establishing discounts based on volume purchasing.

Nevadans can enroll online to receive their free digital discount card which applies to all Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved prescriptions including insulin psychiatric drugs and asthma medication.

Fifteen counties in the state now have access to the service with efforts underway to have pharmacies in Esmeralda and Storey said Beth Slamowitz the Department of Health and Human Services senior policy advisor on pharmacy.

Pharmacy deserts are low-income communities that either have limited access to cars and are more than half a mile away from a pharmacy or are more than a mile away from a pharmacy regardless of access to a car according to research tying pharmacy access to health outcomes by University of Illinois.

“There are definitely pharmacy deserts that exist in this state as they exist in all states especially in the rural areas” she said. “There are over 50000 participating pharmacies in the United States and the card can be used outside of state borders.”

In Nevada there are more than 40 towns that are more than 10 miles away from the nearest pharmacy several near the border of Oregon according to the state pharmacy desert map by the telehealth company Telepharm.

The interstate collaboration of the program allows individuals living in a pharmacy desert near the border of Oregon to use the discounts there or to use them in Washington state Slamowitz said.

In those 15 Nevada counties currently participating 94% of pharmacies are participating with 11 of those counties having 100% of their pharmacies participating. The ArrayRx discount card can be used at larger pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS alongside independent pharmacies like Refill Pharmacy where the press conference was held she said.

The card can also be used for vaccination and some over-the-counter drugs.

The program will most benefit those with high deductible plans or those who are uninsured or underinsured. It will also increase access to prescription medications for low income families and those who are non-citzens or undocumented Slamowitz said.

While an in-state address is required it can be any Nevada address – allowing more transient and at-risk populations to gain access to prescriptions.

Each time a pharmacy submits a claim to ArrayRx it charges a transaction fee that is less than $2 but that fee is incorporated into the discount that the pharmacy has agreed to in order to participate in the program.

Nevada lawmakers strengthened the Nevada Drug Transparency Program with Senate Bill 380 which mandates the state to track the pricing of prescription drugs over $40. A separate measure Senate Bill 396 allows the state to enter into multi-juridstriction purchasing agreements like ArrayRx to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.

The program allows people to choose the best price between their insurance or ArrayRx. However the price on ArrayRx may not always be the best deal.

During the Aug. 17 Interim Finance Committee meeting the state approved $250000 in funding for public service campaigns in English and Spanish to promote the new service. Those announcements have not been launched yet.

“Between 2003 and 2022 1.2 million participants in Oregon and Washington benefitted from the ArrayRx services” said Donna Sullivan chief pharmacy officer for the Washington Health Care Authority. “We welcome the residents of Nevada to receive the same prescription drug discounts through the ArrayRx Card.”

Each household member does need to enroll for their own card. To enroll in the free program Nevadans can visit arrayrxcard.com

“It’s simple to sign up and then all you gotta do is go to the counter you’re going to see how much the prescription is going to cost and it’s going to cause significant savings for a lot of people” Sisolak said."

Everlane is undergoing a fashion makeover.

Under Andrea O’Donnell who took the CEO reins from founder Michael Preysman last year Everlane is working to build up its style cred. A goal: winning over the “fashion elite” O’Donnell said.

Already Everlane is infusing more color into its clothes. And wedding-perfect dresses formal suiting and even sexy styles are set to hit its assortment by spring. (That’s ”intellectual sexy” versus “sexy-sexy” O’Donnell said.) In marketing it’s shifting its focus to outfit inspiration as well as storytelling that draws on emotion and human connection. It will soon introduce a new cleaner logo which has become a customary move for brands aiming to elevate via a relaunch. And indeed it’s raising its prices.

“We’re going where the luxury craft houses are going” O’Donnell said referencing Hermès. “We’re [establishing] the right design-materials story and giving ourselves permission to play at higher price points.”

O’Donnell listed American designers Calvin Klein Donna Karan and Claire McCardell among her inspirations. And recently she filled the brand’s creative director role with Mathilde Mader who’s worked with Kim Jones and at Marni. A 20-year retail veteran from the U.K. O’Donnell was most recently at Deckers Brands where she’s been credited with transforming Ugg with buzzy campaigns and brand collaborations.

As many brands implement new playbooks conceived in the reflective pandemic era 12-year-old Everlane is striving to strike a balance in what O’Donnell calls “fashion versus planet.” After the brand came to market 12 years ago introducing the concept of “radical transparency” and fueling the rise of the direct-to-consumer model it became known for basics that consumers could feel good buying — though its ethics came under scrutiny in 2020. Now it’s making moves to elevate its fashion profile at a time when high-fashion brands are setting goals to attain Everlane-level sustainability. Timeless styles and sustainability will remain core to the brand but creativity will increase in importance.

“It’s contradictory” O’Donnell said of Everlane’s positioning in the market as new and fast fashion continues to be what sells. But by building its product and brand strategies hand-in-hand under a newly implemented company structure she’s confident the company can retain its values and current customer while also evolving and growing. Along with Mader O’Donnell hired Shu Hung formerly of Nike and Uniqlo who’s owning the brand’s marketing from awareness to voice. Her title is also creative director.

The brand’s marketing will aim to play up the brand’s sustainable practices and quality materials while strategically avoiding “academic and dull” messaging O’Donnell said. In addition “human-focused” “aspirational” marketing that allows people with brand-aligned values to tell Everlane’s story will be leveraged she said. Every month Everlane is now featuring a different “conscious” influencer across its channels letting them choose and style an Everlane product and be photographed wearing it in their own home. The latest was Stephanie Liu Hjelmeseth a Chinese-American mother and fashion influencer who mentions a love for nature in her blog’s bio.

Everlane is also introducing new logos for different product lines. An icon being considered for its collection of backpacks features the Golden Gate Bridge. Along with pointing to the company’s San Francisco headquarters it provides a “sense of place” O’Donnell said. She added that all marketing will be void of any mention of trend.

The fact that the brand’s products are gaining a more distinct point of view will also work to the advantage of its marketing efforts O’Donnell said. “One of the challenges we’ve had is that timeless style doesn’t show off” she said noting that the brand often doesn’t “get credit” when influencers wear its black pants and cashmere sweaters. As with prior collections Everlane’s “The Power of 10” capsule released earlier this month is made up of staple pieces meant to be worn on repeat. But the oxford shirt has a unique boxy silhouette and the suiting features updates like a check print and oversized cut.

Moving forward Everlane plans to invest in sustainability-focused branding activations around moments that are historically “more fashion than planet” O’Donnell said. That includes the holiday shopping season as well as bi-annual New York Fashion Weeks. Hosting a large educational and experiential event around Earth Month is also being considered.

Recently other brands specializing in apparel staples have brought new creative talents into their folds and refocused their marketing efforts to be more compelling. Since 2020 J.Crew has enlisted the creative director duo of Brendon Babenzien founder of streetwear brand Noah and Olympia Gayot. In a recent Instagram post it featured Diane Keaton wearing the brand driving 18000 likes. And in 2020 Gap notoriously signed a 10-year now-defunct deal with Kanye West to sell Yeezy Gap. The brand collaborated with Balenciaga this year.

For Everlane’s part there’s much room for growth. Today the U.S. accounts for 95% of its business and 80% of its sales are made on its e-commerce site. O’Donnell sees opportunity in Europe which is more progressive from a sustainability standpoint; it more effectively combats greenwashing which works to the brand’s advantage she said. At the same time Everlane is exploring partnerships with retailers that share its values shy away from discounting and open the door to new customer acquisition. Finally O’Donnell said she wants to breathe new life into Everlane’s shoe and accessories categories. And she’ll tackle the men’s side of the business in 2024.

“The healthiest brands are the ones that are the most diversified” she said.

Rising to luxury status won’t be quick for the brand; as O’Donnell sees it Everlane’s recently been elevated to the “good” segment within the fashion landscape where it’s set to remain for around the next 18 months. And while elevating and expanding the brand she plans to prioritize offering value and earning customers’ trust to dress them for more aspects of their lives.

Becoming the next Gucci is far from the goal. Instead Everlane is following the lead of iconic American designers. O’Donnell said she and her team were “students” of the year-long “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” exhibit which NYC’s Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted until early this month. It spotlighted local brands’ focus on “function utility ease of wear” and people which has proven more inspiring to the Everlane team compared to European fashion and its focus on designers.

On that note in summer 2023 Everlane plans to celebrate American fashion’s “icon” styles. That will include “the perfect T-shirt” and “the perfect denim” for example. Among inspirations for the capsule were Carolyn Jeanne Bessette-Kennedy Johnny Depp and Steve McQueen.

As for Everlane skewing sexy O’Donnell said it will take time for the brand to earn permission to go there. Its new focus on dresses is a step in the right direction. O’Donnell likened the look of the brand’s upgraded dresses to those worn by Rene Russo in 1999’s “The Thomas Crown Affair.” Some feature animal prints. Eventually she wants to take more direct inspiration from Giorgio di Sant’Angelo who made slinky body-hugging styles in the ’70s. “Why can’t we do that?” she asked.

The company has the money to try things. Earlier this month Glossy sister site Modern Retail broked the news that Everlane had raised $90 million in debt financing. It plans to use the funds to open more stores — building on its 10 — while also developing new products. In 2016 the company’s valuation was around $250 million. Its most recent financing closed on August 26.

“What we’ve already managed to do is nothing short of a miracle” O’Donnell said referencing the recent product changes. “Now we’ve got to learn how to express that; that’s a whole new muscle for us.”

Real estate developers will also find opportunities to build new projects exclusively for the metaverse

As we progress to the next generation of the internet with Web3 and the metaverse several disciplines such as architecture design and real estate stand to change. Technological innovations create exciting new possibilities for digital real estate leasing advertising and anyone building in the metaverse.

For architects the metaverse is a place where they can push formal boundaries and redefine what “space” means. It provides an opportunity for them to share unbuilt designs expand their RFP process to all corners of the earth and increase the value of digital property.

In this guide we’ll explain what metaverse architecture is the role of architects in this economy and how it will affect businesses.

What is metaverse architecture?

Metaverse architecture is the art and technique of designing structures an immersive digital universe where people can interact with 3D models virtually. In the metaverse architects typically reimagine existing structures in the digital realm — be it buildings monuments or your favorite work desk.

In a way it extends what we’re already doing — creating 3D models to guide what we’ll be creating in the real world. The key difference is while traditional architecture focuses on providing shelter and making life as easy as possible metaverse architecture focuses on open-source form geometry and pure creativity — not confined to realism. And with the metaverse these models no longer just sit on 3D software — they are being seen and used by the world.

Who are the creators?

Architects

Architects play a key role in conceptualizing experiences that mirror and improve real-world designs. Physical restrictions like gravity no longer constrain them — we could have movable furniture or a room that expands to a party hall when needed. The possibilities are endless.

Game designers

Game design is one of the most important aspects of blockchain games. Designers are responsible for creating virtual environments and gameplay that users enjoy. This challenge becomes even more complex in the metaverse. Designers need to go beyond gaming and focus on creating stories that unify both virtual and real experiences. For example games where players can interact with virtual avatars of their friends exactly how they do in the real world through virtual reality.

Content creators

With the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) content creators and artists can now take control of their work and connect directly with investors. Introducing the metaverse to this mix could add another dimension to content creation.

For instance musicians could hold virtual concerts in metaverse buildings where the entry pass could be an NFT. Similarly metaverse creators could create NFT art to decorate virtual homes and sell them without any geographical limitations.

Real estate developers

In an economy where land and houses are being sold as NFTs real estate developers stand to benefit from the introduction of the metaverse.

In contrast to traditional real estate ownership in the metaverse is designed to be transferable absolute and involve far less paperwork. Some professionals are considering buying metaverse land in the same vein as the opportunity to buy real estate in Manhattan 250 years ago. Virtual land could very well be a way to invest in a new real estate game ahead of your peers with incredible growth prospects.

With the influx of commercial players and brands such as Nike and Adidas buying plots of land the metaverse real estate economy could grow exponentially.

The technology powering the metaverse

Digital twins

Digital twins represent a physical asset virtually by using connected sources of information such as drone data sensors etc to mirror real-life structures. This data can be used to create immersive open-source cities that emulate and enable advanced decision-making.

The most exciting part of a digital twin is its ability to evolve and adapt based on user requirements on a moment’s notice. Interestingly creators already achieved some aspects of this reality — most recently with replicas of Shanghai and Singapore.

Metaverse creators are increasingly finding ways to integrate this technology into their virtual environments. For example Realio a blockchain based private equity platform plans to launch the realioVerse – a digital twin creatively branded as a fork of the real world. It is an open-source city environment that enables you to buy sell and build on land parcels in all major cities across virtual earth.

It provides new value for collaboration and design for architects around the world.

Using digital twins in the metaverse could radically change how users interact with brands and businesses. For instance consumers could just walk into virtual stores to try on new fashion on their realistic 3D avatars. Similarly workshops can be held in shared virtual rooms where people can interact with the equipment virtually no matter where they are located geographically.

AR cloud technology

Architects can also use augmented reality (AR) cloud technology to interface digital twins with the real world. Through AR data can be overlaid onto real surfaces such as a tablet or smartphone allowing for better visualization. In addition smart glasses could further augment data onto the digital twin to provide real-time updates while interacting with it.

Data visualization

With the growing repository of global data visualizing it becomes increasingly complex. This is mainly due to the limitations of our current visualization and reporting tools — we just don’t have the means to integrate six different data sources and make sense of it.

Using the Web3 metaverse provides the ability to see multiple dimensions of data simultaneously and can be interacted with from standard devices. Users can also opt for virtual reality (VR) headsets to drive a more collaborative environment free from distractions. Deriving actionable customer insights from this level of data visualization can unlock the next level of innovation.

Designing buildings in the metaverse

Building in the metaverse requires a shift in perspective and learning new skills. The metaverse encompasses many different layers of technology such as 3D modeling AR cloud technology character design NFTs blockchain geospatial mapping and so on. This would open up the meaning of “architecture” to a far broader group of new and different specializations and talents.

In a metaverse built specifically for creators the realioVerse encourages architects to utilize unique tools and virtual spaces built for their specialization to make the design and development process more straightforward. Its native decentralized technology allows you to iterate and design quickly while ensuring complete ownership over your creations. You can unlock your imagination and monetize your creations easily and collaboratively.

Companies such as Sandbox and Decentraland have made significant strides in their attempts to create in the metaverse complete with virtual economies and NFTs. These virtual economies are powered by smart contracts usually native to that specific metaverse. However the concept of a metaverse is too vast to be restricted to one particular company or product. That’s where a smart monetization modeling comes in. A good business model would be a multiverse marketplace where NFTs and tokens can be monetized across metaverses.

Metaverse tokenomics

Just as the cost of living in New York City is higher than that of Minnesota land parcels become as valuable as the demand for that specific metaverse.

We know — that’s not very tangible. What happens if Nike decides to sell their land in the Sandbox and move elsewhere? Land value could go down just as fast as it went up.

This is why metaverse tokenomics are important. The realioVerse plans to introduce a new approach that addresses these land price volatility concerns. They will institute what is called the realioVerse Land Bank that backs every parcel of land with a percentage of total land sales. RealioVerse hopes that as this scales with increased activity it will ensure it maintains an intrinsic and consistent value for its land holders.

Metaverse land

Along with the perceived value based on the “locality” of your metaverse land design also plays an important role. Like villas and beachfront properties can demand higher prices land with custom designs can generate higher rental revenue from people who want to extend their lavish lifestyle to the metaverse.

Naturally as there is more demand for land plots in that metaverse the land value would also increase over time. These sales could generate profits for both the land owner and the parent company through royalties.

Building the metaverse one brick at a time

The vision and definition of the metaverse are constantly evolving. While social gamification has been a key component the industry needs real-world applications to scale beyond an audience of gamers. The realioVerse could be one of the first platforms to successfully capture the imagination of architects and provide them with the tools they need to launch a new virtual economy. They are at an early stage of development but have a subscriber list for all announcements and updates. Much of their success and any other attempts at forking the real world depends on the integration of technological advancements in digital twin 3D modeling and the augmented reality cloud.

Speak to people working in the metaverse and one descriptor follows it around: “It’s like the Wild West.” Make of that what you will. Is it a new frontier for people seeking their fortune? A lawless land? A place characterized by the unknown removed from the rest of society? Perhaps all of the above. But one thing’s for sure – people in the Wild West weren’t dropping $650000 in cryptocurrency on a digital yacht.

The metaverse – a growing number of immersive virtual online worlds where users live and play – has become a hotbed of real estate speculation. Investors are betting on it being an integral part of a possible paradigm shift in how we use the internet – a decentralized version called Web3 which its supporters argue will wrest control of the web from big tech companies and distribute power privacy and security back to users.

According to consultancy firm McKinsey corporations venture capitalists and private equity invested $120 billion in the metaverse between January and May 2022 more than double the $57 billion invested in 2021.

But real estate values have had a rocky ride. Land prices in the four major metaverse platforms The Sandbox Decentraland Cryptovoxels and Somnium Space have fallen 50 to 80% this year according to Winston Robson CEO and co-founder of metaverse analytics company WeMeta. He pointed to problems in the real-world economy and the cryptocurrency market as contributing to the decline.

Look beyond the numbers however and you’ll find whole professions being shaken up from architects and designers to developers and real estate agents. And far from being isolated to the metaverse their ventures there are already impacting the real world.

Building for the future

George Bileca CEO of Voxel Architects studied architecture and design and was working towards a career in car design when he was given some land in Cryptovoxels to play with. At the start of the pandemic he used it to build a dealership to sell NFTs (non-fungible tokens) of digital cars designed by his friend. Two years later Bileca has a team of 25 working full time in the metaverse.

Voxel Architects headquartered in Portugal has designed and built over 100 metaverse projects said the CEO including galleries for auction house Sotheby’s fashion week venues and an NFT manufacturing plant for American artist Tom Sachs. Next up: an official Elvis Presley experience in The Sandbox and Decentraland.

Initially the design process for metaverse buildings is much the same as in the real world said Bileca. An architect or designer consults with a client and sketches ideas either on paper or computer. Once a design is agreed upon it is 3D-modeled using traditional design software but conforming to the design spec of the metaverse it will populate (different metaverses use different building blocks and have different texture and color ranges).

Then coding begins. “The build is only an empty carcass” Bileca explained. “On top of that shell we add the functionality like being able to open doors to interact with artworks … to create custom (user interfaces) gameplay quests and many other interactive elements.” Once completed it is deployed into a metaverse.

The studio charges an hourly rate for its work with some projects running into the hundreds of thousands of dollars – the most expensive being close to $500000 for designing building and deploying a development in The Sandbox says Bileca who did not reveal the client.

Brand ambitions

Some are buying properties for recreational use; others are trying to generate revenue from their land. Some are building retail spaces or ticketed experiences; others are renting their land to brands trying to reach consumers in the metaverse. According to McKinsey e-commerce in the metaverse could have up to a $2.6 trillion market impact by 2030.

LandVault claims to be the biggest land developer in the metaverse renting its land to brands and developing campaigns for them. Just don’t call it advertizing insists CEO Sam Huber. “In Web3 … the word actually doesn’t have a place” he said. “What we’re building is not advertizing. It’s brand experiences which is very different.”

He gave the example of playing a game in the metaverse inside an arena bearing a Mastercard logo. “You can still play your game. That is not advertizing. That is not annoying. That is like real life” he argued.

“(Online) advertising as we know it intrusive … compromising user data and so on – that just doesn’t have a place in Web3.”

As with the real world location has a large impact on rental price. Being in an area with high footfall near a much-loved game or close to a prized asset (a celebrity’s house for example) can be important. But some are making the case that good design has value too.

One advocate is Janine Yorio CEO of Everyrealm. The metaverse development company previously known as Republic Realm has received $66 million in funding to date and is backed by celebrities including The Weeknd Will Smith and Paris Hilton. Its luxury projects have generated headlines. In November 2021 Everyrealm bought 792 parcels of The Sandbox (the equivalent of about three square miles) for $4.3 million – still a record purchase. Around the same time it sold the $650000 superyacht the Metaflower complete with DJ booth helipad and hot tub for the discerning buyer.

The company’s latest venture is The Row an upcoming invite-only community of 30 houses. Everyrealm invited artists including Daniel Arsham Misha Kahn and Alexis Christodoulou to contribute designs. Alongside neoclassical buildings and giant cantilevers are alien shapes fulfilling the promise of digital architecture unbound by the laws of physics.

“We really let the artists just have free rein” said Yorio. The driving principal she added was “architecture so important and exclusive that it becomes something that people look to as sort of a high watermark.”

Yorio cites Everyrealm’s Fantasy Island project – in which 100 private islands in The Sandbox sold out in a single afternoon in August 2021 – as an example of how these assets can appreciate. Sold at approximately $15000 each the CEO said they now trade for around $100000 down from $250000 at the height of the cryptocurrency and NFT market boom in late 2021.

Buyers of property in The Row will be purchasing architectural plans in the form of an NFT which can be built and deployed on different platforms.

“We want to adhere to the ethos of decentralization” Yorio said but the sale model also speaks to the uncertainty that hangs over investing in the metaverse. “It’s very difficult to know which metaverse is going to be the most popular in one year or five years” she said.

With the name of the development inspired by Billionaires’ Row in Manhattan Everyrealm has enlisted the services of elite New York real estate brokers Oren and Tal Alexander to oversee sales.

The Alexander brothers are currently screening prospective buyers said Yorio with private sales starting in September. “We want to make sure that art goes to the right type of collectors and not people that are looking to buy and flip and create that NFT hyper-speculation dynamic” she explained. Prices were not disclosed to CNN.

Yorio disputed the idea The Row was an example of the metaverse heading towards social stratification. “This is about owning one of the first seminal works of three-dimensional inhabitable art in a new media. And I think that’s a very different conversation (to) ‘we’re building a country club that only 30 people can join’” she argued.

The search for stability

The long-term value of metaverse property may also hinge on whether users decide to work as well as play there.

Pallavi Dean CEO of Dubai-based design studio Roar is already doing so having bought company space in Decentraland. Dean wanted to showcase Roar’s work to clients and purchased four plots for around $60000 in total in January 2022. “You have to have skin in the game before you convince other people” she said. “I’m writing this off as marketing money.”

She’s already moved some of her business operations into the metaverse hosting client meetings in Roar’s virtual office. In the next couple of months she plans to run a training course from her metaverse meeting room.

Roar is also looking to generate revenue in the metaverse building an NFT gallery a retail space and floating pods which could become a hotel. Although Dean concedes she’s still waiting for her first rental and first NFT sale she remains hopeful of future growth.

Given the short lifetime and rapid acceleration of the metaverse long-term forecasting is hazardous – especially as the property market experiences growing pains. But could real estate in the metaverse ever become as reliable an investment as bricks and mortar? Or could this be Web3’s equivalent of the dot-com bubble?

“It’s hard to know if the real estate inside (metaverses) is going to be stable … Least of all us and we’re deeply in it” said Yorio.

Many on the outside may be viewing its long-term prospects with more than a hint of caution. Understandably some people working in this burgeoning industry remain bullish.

“It’s very possible that real estate in the metaverse is a stable investment in the future” said Robson of analytics company WetMeta in an email.

“This is not a bubble” insisted Huber who distils the metaverse down to a combination of two trends: gaming and the blockchain neither of which could be called a fad. “There is an element of hype if you start zooming in – the price of land tripling over the last six months. It’s obviously driven by speculation. But this is a short blip and now it’s corrected.”

“(On a) short-term basis there’s tons of hype” he added. “But that’s not what I’m interested in. I’m interested in the macro – and the macro is definitely here to stay.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3VzL3NsYWluLWdlb3JnaWEtd29tYW4tZGViYmllLWNvbGxpZXItcmVtZW1iZXJlZC1iZWxvdmVkLW1hdHJpYXJjaC1maWxsZWQtam95LWJlYXV0edIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3VzL3NsYWluLWdlb3JnaWEtd29tYW4tZGViYmllLWNvbGxpZXItcmVtZW1iZXJlZC1iZWxvdmVkLW1hdHJpYXJjaC1maWxsZWQtam95LWJlYXV0eS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Slain Georgia woman Debbie Collier remembered as beloved matriarch 'filled with joy and beauty',"Georgia real estate office manager Debbie Collier’s son is speaking out for the first time after his mother’s shocking death earlier this month as investigators race to find a suspect.

Jeffrey Bearden Collier’s son told Fox News Digital on Saturday that his mother was the kindest greatest influence on his life and asked for ""respect and privacy"" as his family deals with the traumatic news of her murder.

""[I] am writing to request respect and privacy during the darkest and most harrowing time for my family"" Bearden wrote. ""I have been incredibly hurt and disturbed by some of the reporting and information shared regarding the investigation into my mother’s death.""

Habersham County deputies found Collier’s remains down an embankment on Sept. 11 a day after her husband Steven Collier and daughter Amanda Bearden reported her missing from neighboring Clarke County. As of Saturday evening there had been no arrests in the case.

A crime scene report includes gruesome details about her final moments. Investigators found her naked and burned with ""charring"" on her abdomen clutching at a tree down an embankment a quarter mile from her abandoned vehicle a day after police said she sent her 36-year-old daughter a $2385 payment using the Venmo app and a bizarre message that suggested she was being held against her will. Investigators however publicly ruled out both kidnapping and suicide last week.

""I ask that all attention on the tragic story of my mother’s death remain focused on aiding the police investigation"" Jeffrey Bearden said Saturday.

He asked for privacy and for an end to online guesswork until police complete their investigation.

""There is no place for the court of public opinion in the pursuit of justice for my mother and this speculation continues to be traumatic and hurtful for my family during the most difficult time we have experienced"" he said.

His mother he said was an amazing woman.

""I will never be able to fully articulate the loss of my mother and what she meant to me"" Bearden said Saturday. ""She was my longest source of love support and encouragement. My mother was a very vibrant and strong soul. She was a person who valued kindness empathy and understanding throughout her entire life. She went through life recognizing the beauty and grace in everything she saw and experienced around her.""

Collier worked as a real estate office manager with Carriage House Realty in her hometown of Athens Georgia. Reached by text message a colleague deferred questions to the office’s main line where calls went unanswered Saturday.

""Daily life was filled with joy and beauty"" Bearden said. ""She spent her time enjoying and making art. She valued listening to dancing and singing along with her favorite music. My mother consumed herself with the holidays as her focus remained on family and the value of being together over a home cooked meal.""

Collier was generous throughout the holidays he added and each year ""would shower her family with thoughtful gifts and gestures.""

""My mother was persistent in her love throughout my entire life and I will persist until she is given the justice she deserves"" Bearden continued. ""Our lives have been irrevocably changed. Our grief is here and our pain is deep. Again that is why I am asking you to please respect our privacy while we learn to cope and adjust with our loss.""

TO GO WITH ""Botswanan president says to diversify economy reduce reliance on diamonds"" (Cia Pak/UN Photo/Handout via Xinhua)

UNITED NATIONS Sept. 22 (Xinhua) -- Botswana should diversify its economy to reduce its heavy dependence on diamonds President Mokgweetsi Masisi on Thursday told world leaders attending the general debate of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly.

Botswana is facing ""an uphill battle"" to attract investors to diversify its economy away from dependence on diamonds the president said while pointing out the resource is still the ""bedrock"" of its economy.

When Botswana achieved independence 56 years ago it was among the world's poorest countries but now it is an upper-middle-income country Masisi noted adding it was fortunate to discover ""what has turned out to be the largest diamond reserve across the Kimberley Belt.""

The president stressed that Botswana's recovery plan includes strengthening its protection system to ensure the inclusion of vulnerable groups and persons living with disabilities.

As adequate financing is needed to achieve sustainable development an effective mobilization of domestic and international financial resources as well as their prudent use are imperative he said.

The president voiced support for the call of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for a world in which ""power wealth and opportunity are shared more broadly and fairly"" at the international level saying Botswana aims to further broaden conversations with partners including the United Nations governments civil society and the private sector as it endeavors to realize the 2030 Agenda.

On COVID-19 vaccination the president said that many countries in the Global South especially in Africa did not meet the World Health Organization's 70 percent vaccination rate by mid-2022 stressing the urgent need for vaccine equity. ■",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NkYXkubmcvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL3Utcy1jb21tZXJjaWFsLXNlcnZpY2UtYWZkYi1zcG90bGlnaHQtb3Bwb3J0dW5pdGllcy1mb3ItbmlnZXJpYW4taW52ZXN0b3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. commercial service AfDB spotlight opportunities for Nigerian investors,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NkYXkubmcvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL3Utcy1jb21tZXJjaWFsLXNlcnZpY2UtYWZkYi1zcG90bGlnaHQtb3Bwb3J0dW5pdGllcy1mb3ItbmlnZXJpYW4taW52ZXN0b3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EC6A1A0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

(WKBW) — The Chautauqua County Sheriff's Office is looking to speak to anyone who saw or talked with Yolanda Bindics and/or Clarence Carl Carte the night of Bindics' disappearance.

“We have a surveillance video and captured on that is Clarence Carte” stated Tom Tarpley investigator Unsolved Cases.

The sheriff's office said Bindics was last seen leaving a Family Dollar store on Fluvanna Avenue in Jamestown around 8:10 p.m. on August 10 2004. Around the same time Clarence Carl Carte the father of Bindics' youngest child walked out of the Kwik Fill store on Fluvanna Avenue.

The Unsolved Cases team recently stepped in to find out who killed the mother of four 18 years ago.

Tarpley tells me the surveillance video now gives new evidence in this case showing carte at this Kwik Fill store — directly across the street from where Bindics was last spotted.

“He is captured on that videotape moments before the victim left her job that night and we are looking for someone who may have seen some interaction between at that location or also down the street at the Arby’s on Fluvanna Avenue which is where her vehicle was located” explained Tarpley.

According to the sheriff's office its Unsolved Crimes Unit would like to speak to anyone who saw or talked with Bindics or Carte between the hours of 7 p.m. on August 10 2004 and 6 a.m. on August 11 2004. If you saw or talked with either of the individuals you're asked to call the Chautauqua County Sheriff's Office Unsolved Crimes Unit at (716) 753-4578 or (716) 753-4579 or email investigators at unsolvedchautauqua@sheriff.us.

The murder of Bindics remains unsolved almost two decades after she disappeared. Her skeletal remains were found in September 2006 in a wooded area in the Town of Charlotte. Her death was ruled a homicide.

“We’re hoping that maybe somebody might have known them might have been driving by — might have seen some type of an argument — might have seen some interaction that they remember that they just didn’t report at the time they didn’t think anything of it” explained Tarpley.

Tarpley says carte is “not” a person of interest at this time. Tarpley also confirmed for me that carte now lives in Florida and does have a “criminal past”.

Members of this Jamestown community that I've spoken with say it’s very sad that this case still remains unresolved.

“I think it’s terrible that things can’t be settled for the family — that just breaks my heart” remarked Joan Larsen.

Tarpley says they have a lot of new information in this case and are now at the point where they are “in the process of briefing the Chautauqua County district attorney.”

In August Tom Tarpley of the Unsolved Crimes Unit spoke to 7 News and said “we feel we've made significant progress. We feel that the answers to this case are close at hand.""

The Dollar Tree in the Baywick Plaza on Rt. 9. It's been there for years and every time I was there it seemed busy why would they be closing this location?

What's replacing the Dollar Tree in Bayville NJ?

I originally wrote about Family Dollar was to replace the Dollar Tree but I guess I was wrong. Both stores are going to be there in one location. It seems a little bit weird but it might work. We already had a Family Dollar for several years in Bayville then that closed about 2 years ago.

From this picture it looks a little weird to see these two stores connected. One door and Family Dollar on the left and Dollar Tree on the right. It looks like while building and putting these stores together it looks like they knocked down a possible wall to the old Rite Aid. Do you remember that being there in that plaza next to the Dollar Tree.

I would always choose the the Dollar Tree because everything was always $1 Family Dollar was and is The Dollar Tree was great everything was $1. Cards birthday stuff like wrapping and paper plates that was the perfect spot for some great cheap stuff. I don't think I ever went to Family Dollar so I'm not too sure about it. There is no opening date as of yet for these two stores or one store?

Is this a new trend? Dollar Tree and Family Dollar in one store.

Utilities stall and limit climate action by establishing controlling and funding front groups to spread climate misinformation through advertising on social media.

Utility front groups have spent thousands of dollars on disinformation advertising that target people of color and historically marginalized groups mislead the public on the impacts of gas bans highlight false concerns regarding the reliability of renewable energy and promote “renewable natural gas” and hydrogen despite multiple studies showing these fuels are not viable substitutes for building electrification.

Utility front groups advertise for preferred candidates in elections including Seniors Across America promoting Governor Ron DeSantis followed by a slew of anti-solar advertisements costing up to $60000.

Federal commissions legislators and utility regulators can take action to improve the transparency of utility advertising and limit the spread of disinformation.

Gas and electric utility front groups have spent over $2.4 million over the past 4 years on social media advertisements many of which include targeted messaging to mislead customers on critical climate and energy concerns including the impact of power plant retirements the reasons behind high utility bills and the viability of “renewable natural gas” and hydrogen.

Using data from the Meta Ad Library and existing code developed by Brown University the Energy and Policy Institute launched a new tracking tool that exposes up to $2.4 million in spending by 14 utility front groups in the last year and shows the specific regions that the groups are targeting with the advertisements. The tracker does not show advertising spending by the groups on other social media platforms such as TikTok Twitter or YouTube.

Utility front groups are organizations that appear independent but are established controlled or funded by a gas or electric utility or trade association. These front groups advocate on behalf of utility interests often by amplifying misinformation about distributed renewable energy or electrification while masking or obscuring the utility’s involvement. Just over the last year gas and electric utility front groups spent tens of thousands of dollars spreading misinformation through targeted advertising on the platforms of the social media giant Meta such as Facebook and Instagram. In some cases the front groups have promoted specific candidates over others to influence voters in the weeks before primary elections.

Social media networks expedite the spread of misinformation through algorithms that recommend new connections to people with similar views and then promote content within the network based on engagement with previously viewed material. Additionally research shows people are more likely to trust information from others in their social network propagating “echo chambers” and severe polarization of people uniting around disparate positions.

Social media companies are under scrutiny for promoting misinformation as are the companies using the platforms to spread falsehoods furthering their interests and influence.

In September 2022 the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee Subcommittee Oversight & Investigations led by Rep. Katie Porter examined the role of public relations firms in preventing climate action for their fossil fuel clients.

Other members of Congress are also investigating the firms and fossil fuel companies for their role in the decades-long campaign to mislead the American people about the industry’s role in climate change. Rep. Carolyn Maloney the Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform and Rep. Ro Khanna the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment recently released a report of initial findings that show how oil companies “focus on unproven technologies the companies admit are decades away from implementation” and “[rely] on accounting gimmicks tricky language and delay tactics to claim the mantle of climate leadership while continuing to be a primary cause of an ongoing climate catastrophe.” The report comes nearly a year after the Committee on Oversight and Reform held a hearing to examine the fossil fuel industry’s disinformation campaigns.

Like the oil industry the utility industry knew about the risks that burning fossil fuels posed to the climate for decades before the general public was broadly exposed to the same science. . In the late 1950s the oil industry was studying carbon dioxide in the atmosphere through their trade association the American Petroleum Institute. Several years later a science advisor to President Lyndon B. Johnson warned the utility’s trade association the Edison Electric Institute about the threat that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels could one day pose to the climate. Together the utility and oil industries were told of the climate risks of their products and actions but used doubt and denial in various ways including advertisements to erode public understanding of the science and quell government action. The industry then transitioned to deflecting focus onto the emissions of other countries and sectors and in recent years have “uplifted approaches such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) that have proven unviable to date in the power sector distracting attention from the energy transition” according to a recent study.

Left: A print advertisement from the Information Council on the Environment (also known as Informed Citizens for the Environment) which was formed in 1991 to “reposition global warming as theory (not fact).” Right: A Facebook advertisement from Natural Allies for Clean Energy Future which has a media campaign plan to “redefine the role of natural gas in fighting climate change and protect the social license to operate.”

Today most utility companies have publicly committed to some type of “net-zero” climate goals but they continue to block meaningful climate reform and invest in fossil fuel infrastructure. EPI’s new tool shows that utilities continue to stall and limit climate action by funding front groups to spread climate and energy misinformation through advertising on social media networks. Below are a few examples of recent utility front group advertisements.

Front groups targeting people of color and historically marginalized groups

Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future is a 501(c)(4) front group with ties to some of the largest utilities in the country including DTE Energy Duke Energy and Southern Company. The front group has spent more than half a million dollars on Facebook and Instagram advertising since 2018 and is among the highest spenders of any utility front groups tracked by EPI.

The non-profit investigative news outlet Floodlight first reported on Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future’s advertisement campaign targeting young liberal and Black and Latino voters to convince them of the benefits of fossil gas in addressing climate change. Internal documents revealed that the campaign had a plan to “redefine the role of natural gas in fighting climate change and protect the social license to operate” and “success for the natural gas industry will be rooted in whether we can message to the left and the Democratic base of Black and Latino and age 18-34 voters as effectively as we have messaged to the right.”

More details from the documents detailed how the front group has a specific focus on Black voters: “Black voters- the core of President Biden’s Democratic coalition – are more likely to support affordability over disruptive changes in energy and climate policy. Black voters also register lower support for the Green New Deal when informed of the practical effects of such policies on energy affordability and reliability.”

The ads for the campaign included the same video with the message that fossil gas is “accelerating the world’s clean energy future” despite the fact that methane is accelerating the climate’s warming with a heat-trapping potency 84 to 87 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. The recent UN IPCC report clearly states that cutting methane emissions is critical to having a chance to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Yet methane emissions are on the rise and U.S. oil and gas drilling is a major contributor to the increase. Rob Jackson a Stanford University scientist who leads the Global Carbon Project which published two studies in July 2020 on this topic said “Natural gas use is rising quickly here in the U.S. and globally. It is offsetting coal in the electricity sector and reducing carbon dioxide emissions but increasing methane emissions in that sector. As a result we’re emitting more methane from oil and gas wells and leaky pipelines.”

Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future’s video for a $10000 campaign to target Black and Latino voters to convince them on the benefits of fossil gas.

Between February and May of this year Natural Allies spent up to $10000 on ads featuring the video created for its advertising campaign.

The Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA) which calls itself “the voice of the energy consumer” but in reality is an advocacy front group for some of the country’s largest utilities fossil fuel corporations and trade associations has spent even more than Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future on Facebook and Instagram advertising. Since May 2018 CEA has spent nearly $700000. It has also deployed similar tactics as Natural Allies dropping up to $8000 on an ad touting two women “running a business in a male-dominated field” and struggling in the face of rising fuel prices.

Seniors Across America is a front group that spent thousands of dollars on Facebook advertisements that urged Floridians to support an anti-rooftop solar bill. Text of the legislation HB 741 was sent to state senator Jennifer Bradley’s staff from a Florida Power & Light (FPL) lobbyist. FPL’s parent company NextEra Energy contributed $10000 to Bradely’s political committee just days after the legislator received the legislation and an additional $10000 weeks later. As the bill moved through the legislature Seniors Across America ran advertisements promoting it targeting those aged 55 and over and claiming that the “stealth solar tax” disproportionately hurt senior ratepayers by forcing them to subsidize customers who could afford to purchase solar for their homes. In fact the bill would have authorized utilities to charge all customers for the recovery of its lost revenue creating the very subsidy Senior Across America claimed solar was causing. Solar allies opposing the bill presented thousands of comments establishing the fact that no solar “cost shift” currently exists in Florida;Governor Ron DeSantis vetoed the bill saying that it would have forced rate increases among FPL’s captive customers. Seniors Across America continues to advertise warnings against “shady solar salespeople.”

Seniors Across America advertised warnings against the “stealth solar tax” to promote FPL’s anti-rooftop solar legislation.

Utility front groups spending thousands fighting against bans on fossil gas

Gas utilities and associated front groups are targeting regions where policies to electrify and prohibit fossil gas in buildings are advancing.

The Affordable Energy Coalition a front group created in March 2021 to attack building electrification policy in the Seattle region spent up to $2500 on an advertisement that ran through May 2022 focused on the Seattle City Council decision to ban fossil gas in new buildings. The front group used another advertisement to suggest vague and dangerous repercussions with no corroboration had the gas ban been in effect during Seattle’s record cold temperatures this past February.

Affordable Energy Coalition’s advertisement stokes unfounded fears on the impacts of building electrification.

Affordable Energy Coalition’s advertising stokes fears that electric heat pumps cannot perform in cold weather. However technological advances to new models of electric heat pumps disprove this concern. For instance a recent study in Maine found that heat pumps perform well in below-freezing weather without fossil-fueled backup. An analysis of the technology’s performance in Minnesota came to the same conclusion.

New Yorkers for Affordable Energy used similar tactics in response to a failed attempt to ban fossil fuels from newly constructed buildings in the near future. The front group is supported by the utilities Dominion National Grid and National Fuel Gas according to LittleSis. The front group focused on a campaign with the false narrative that banning gas appliances would require New Yorkers to spend thousands on retrofitting spending up to $8000 on ads falsely claiming that a gas appliance ban would cost homeowners $30000. However the ban was only for newly constructed buildings and an analysis from the Rocky Mountain Institute found that all-electric homes have lower costs than new mixed-fuel homes with savings on upfront costs and utility bills.

A study published by Stanford University researchers found that even when not running gas appliances release an annual amount of methane equivalent to 500000 cars. Further the nitrogen dioxide emitted from gas stoves inside homes far exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency’s outdoor air quality standards significantly increasing the risk of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease especially in children.

New Yorkers for Affordable Energy makes false claims about the financial impacts of building electrification.

Consumer Energy Alliance made a similar claim concerning costs in support of a bill that almost passed in Virginia that would have prevented municipalities and counties from banning new gas infrastructure and hookups. According to a Rocky Mountain Institute study many residential electrification scenarios for new buildings would reduce the cost for homeowners over the lifetime of the appliances as compared to fossil fuel-burning appliances and cost savings are also possible in retrofitting scenarios. Further with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act the federal government is lowering the energy costs of energy efficient appliances by providing $14000 in direct customer rebates.

Consumer Energy Alliance makes false claims about the financial impact of a gas ban in Virginia.

Advertisements from front groups make false claims concerning the reliability of renewable energy and energy security

Citizens for Energizing Michigan’s Economy (CEME) a 501(c)(4) organization that has received more than $43.5 million from Consumers Energy has spent on advertisements including misinformation about renewable energy and the electric grid. When Michigan legislators introduced a bill in 2021 to lift a cap on utility distributed generation programs CEME ran a misleading ad that falsely claimed “out-of-state special interests” – implying solar companies – caused widespread blackouts on the Texas grid earlier that year. Versions of the advertisement appeared on Facebook feeds in the districts of members of the Michigan House Energy Committee which held hearings on the legislation. Utility companies in Texas – specifically Calpine Vistra and NRG Energy – all have said natural gas shortages affected their ability to operate their power plants. Additionally the Texas Railroad Commission didn’t mandate winterization to prevent oil and gas wells from freezing and failed to ensure that gas producers and pipeline operators sought priority status for power during emergency outages which occurred when the grid operator ordered utilities to perform rotating outages. Coal-fired power plants also failed to operate during the extreme weather event.

Voices for Cooperative Power a front group funded by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association the trade association for electric cooperatives used Facebook ads in an attempt to urge people to call on the Michigan Public Service Commission to “not to allow the premature retirement of power plants unless the utilities demonstrate new operational alternative power plants first.” The ads are likely referring to the J.H. Campbell power plant owned by Consumers Energy. The ads claimed Michigan “can’t afford to go dark” suggesting renewable alternatives could not maintain reliable power or would be too costly. But expert analysis shows that switching to renewables would be the safest and most cost-effective option and modeling by Consumers Energy and environmental groups demonstrated Campbell’s retirement and the plan to purchase the Covert Generating Station accelerating the addition of 8000 megawatts of solar power and 550 MW of battery storage by 2040 with interim targets through this decade improve reliability in the service territory. Testimony filed by Consumers Energy also revealed that electric cooperative Wolverine Power Supply’s competitive business stood to benefit financially if Campbell remained open.

Affordable Energy for New Jersey spent its largest sums on attacks against Governor Phil Murphy’s Energy Master Plan. The 2019 plan outlines a statewide strategy to reach 100 percent clean energy by 2050 which prioritizes the rapid electrification of buildings. In response the front group has deployed a steady onslaught of low-cost frequent advertisements since the beginning of 2022.

The group’s ad topics range from attacks on the viability of electric vehicle batteries to blaming “radical environmentalists shouting down US LNG exports” for Germany’s reliance on coal in the midst of Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The front group also focused on blackouts in June 2022 advertisements in attempts to convey the message that only “base load” can prevent the blackouts. Utilities and groups typically reference coal gas and nuclear as baseload plants. Yet these fuels have no magical reliability properties and are responsible for their own outages. In Colorado during a summer heat wave Xcel Energy averted a crisis by taking control of customer thermostats to relieve demand after the coal plant Comanche 3 “went down quickly.” A year earlier a different Colorado utility Mountain Parks Electric warned customers to conserve energy because wind turbines “iced up” when in fact the causes of the supply crunch were complex and included how the winter conditions also impacted the supply of gas and Wyoming coal plants.

Affordable Energy for New Jersey’s ad touts baseload plants like coal gas and nuclear despite the reliability issues of these plants.

Gas utility front groups promoting RNG hydrogen and “clean” “natural” gas

Partnership for Energy Progress is a 501(c)(4) front group with ties to multiple utilities including Avista Cascade Natural Gas NW Natural and Puget Sound Energy all in the Pacific Northwest. The Guardian reported that the utilities created the group to convince consumers that “natural gas is part of a clean energy future.” The Seattle Times also reported that the group had prepared a $1 million media strategy campaign that would feature paid advertisements focused on “key audiences in Washington and Oregon” mobilize allies in policy debates and create a “positive” message about gas.

The front group has spent over $60000 in 2022 on Facebook and Instagram advertising. Part of the advertisement campaign focused on promoting technologies that gas utilities are bolstering but are false solutions for the purposes of building decarbonization. One of the messages promoted “renewable natural gas” as clean reliable and affordable and capable of being delivered in the existing gas infrastructure and reducing emissions. “Renewable natural gas” or biomethane is non-fossil methane generally captured from agricultural sources or landfills. The other message promoted hydrogen in the same light as renewable natural gas – as a practical solution for gas utilities to reduce emissions. Similar to utilities that have promoted carbon capture and storage even though it remains unworkable to date in the power sector Partnership for Energy Progress advertisements ignore the facts that biomethane and hydrogen while plausibly playing a role in decarbonizing other sectors are not viable alternatives to building electrification. Ample evidence shows both fuel types would lead to higher costs for customers are not available at the necessary scale could be climate intensive due to methane leakage exacerbate air pollution and cause safety risks.

Front groups frequently deployed ads that refer to fossil gas as a “clean” fuel source implying that it is critical to achieving emission reduction targets. The Alliance for Michigan Power used Facebook and Instagram advertisements to encourage that misleading message. The Alliance for Michigan Power is a front group with connections to monopoly utility company DTE Energy which provides both electric and gas service to customers in Michigan.

Alliance for Michigan Power calls on lawmakers to support a mix of power sources to meet net zero carbon emissions – including fossil gas.

Utility front groups involved in advertising for elections

Citizen’s Energizing Michigan’s Economy the front group funded by Consumers Energy ran Facebook ads for eight candidates – seven Republicans and one Democrat – ahead of their August 2022 primary elections. The ads for the Republicans focused heavily on advancing a right-wing agenda promoting “election integrity” gun ownership police “Christian values” and “fight[ing] China.”

In the weeks leading up to Florida’s August 2022 primary elections Seniors Across America spent hundreds of dollars supporting Governor Ron DeSantis who had no Republican primary challenger. DeSantis appointed the Florida Public Service Commissioners who approved Florida Power & Light’s rate hike earlier this year and has passed a host of legislation friendly to FPL and its parent company NextEra. In 2018 DeSantis received $25000 from a dark money non-profit funded by FPL. Despite his veto of the anti-rooftop solar bill written by FPL and supported by Seniors Across America DeSantis has remained silent about FPL’s connection to election scandals criminal trials and ongoing investigations. The ads from Seniors Across America praising DeSantis were followed by a slew of messaging campaigns one warning against “greedy solar companies and their door-to-door salesmen” on which the front group spent up to $30000 and another suggesting the “Top Five Scams” of rooftop solar salespeople which cost up to an additional $30000. These ads ran simultaneously with several ads encouraging primary voting.

Utility front groups also deploy tactics outside of Meta platforms to influence elections. Leading up to Nevada’s 2022 primary election Southwest Gas Corporation – one of the largest gas utilities in the country – gave $10000 its largest contribution at the time to Assemblywoman Lesley Cohen’s Democratic primary opponent Joe Dalia. Residents in Cohen’s district in Clark County also began receiving political mailers smearing Cohen and demanding she return “dirty money” from fossil fuel and energy companies ahead of the primary. The mailers were paid for by the front group Nevadans for Economic Opportunity (NEO) a 501(c)(4) “pro-growth public policy” coalition financially backed by the Retail Association of Nevada (RAN) and the Associated Builders and Contractors of Nevada among others. The address of RAN is also the same one for NEO in the state’s campaign finance disclosure database.

In 2021 Cohen introduced AB380 legislation that would require gas utilities to employ a more rigorous planning process before expanding infrastructure. To combat the legislation Southwest Gas built a coalition of affiliated interest groups. This included the creation of a now-disbanded front group Coalition for Cleaner Affordable Energy. The group sponsored Facebook content to “Stop AB380” and featured RAN’s Senior Vice President Bryan Wachter falsely framing the climate bill as a fossil gas appliance ban.

Appeals to state and federal regulators for greater transparency

Utilities form front groups to intentionally deceive customers and advance their own interests. By utilizing social media for advertising utility front groups rapidly disseminate disinformation without disclosure to viewers about the utilities’ involvement. Meanwhile even if utility involvement is revealed to customers through news sources or watchdog organizations customers are unable to opt out of paying their bills for electricity or gas both necessities of modern life.

The Federal Trade Commission exists to protect consumers from these kinds of deceptive and unfair business practices. Earlier this year 230 groups including the Energy and Policy Institute requested the FTC investigate the utility industry for widespread abuses including political corruption dark-money campaigns and unfair anti-competitive practices including denying customers access to renewable energy.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) could amend the accounting system that all utilities use in rate cases the Uniform System of Accounts to require that utilities record the millions paid in industry association dues as presumptively non-recoverable for rate recovery purposes. This action would at the very least force utilities to justify efforts to recover payments to trade associations engaged in political activities and would reduce costs for wholesale transmission customers who would no longer be required to pay those expenses. FERC can also require more granular disclosure of expenses made by utilities through their annual filings specifically in the accounts where utilities routinely place political expenses. This additional reporting requirement would help discourage utilities from booking the consulting costs of creating a front group and charging it to customers as Southern California Gas Company did several years ago when it formed the front group Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions to advance the utility’s pro-gas position in a California Public Utilities Commission proceeding.

Members of Congress can also include the utility industry in their investigations of the fossil fuel industry. The same questions and requests for documents sent to oil companies from the House Committee on Oversight and Reform could be sent to many in the utility industry as part of an ongoing investigation on climate disinformation. The House investigation included a request for companies to provide documents and communications related to involvement in supporting disinformation and misleading the public to prevent climate action.

State regulators are also capable of intervening on behalf of utility customers. Commissioner Sandra D. Kennedy of the Arizona Corporation Commission demanded that Arizona’s utilities provide comprehensive lists of political contributions lobbying expenses advertising and marketing expenses “Corporate Giving” and a list of compensations for employees and consultants engaged in those activities. In the filing Kennedy indicated that some utilities have “veered off the path of their core mission and instead have focused on solidifying their positions of power” and said that “the level of transparency called for in this letter is essential to maintaining the public’s trust.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYXRoYW1zdGFydHJpYnVuZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlXzQ4Y2Q4YTgwLTNiNDEtMTFlZC1iYmQ1LWFmOWI4ZWU5NTkwNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PittCo terrain location attractive to solar developers | News | chathamstartribune.com,"Chatham VA (24531)

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 486.27 points or 1.62% to 29590.41. The S&P 500 slid 1.72% to 3693.23 while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.8% to 10867.93.

The Dow notched a new low for the year and closed below 30000 for the first time since June 17. The 30-stock index ended the day 19.9% below an intraday record flirting with bear market territory. At one point the Dow was down more than 826 points.

The major averages capped their fifth negative week in six with the Dow giving up 4%. The S&P and Nasdaq shed 4.65% and 5.07% respectively. It marked the fourth negative session in a row for stocks as the Fed on Wednesday enacted another super-sized rate hike of 75 basis points and indicated it would do another at its November meeting.

“A good ranking in a priority rating such as the DJSI is important because it is an indication that we are not only a sustainable company but a shaper in this field” said Line Hestvik Chief Sustainability Officer. “We will continue the intensive work in this area and will analyze our scores and use it as a learning for our further sustainability efforts.

In general sustainability ratings track the sustainability performance of companies in terms of environmental social and governance criteria (ESG) and provide information on where they stand compared to the theoretical optimum and to peers.

In a year when all three of the major stock indexes in the United States have declined by 15% or more there are plenty of dividend stocks out there with high dividend yields. However a large number of these are low-quality companies with declining fundamentals where the dividend yield isn't sustainable making them best to avoid.

Yet investors looking for eye-popping dividend yields from high-quality companies are in luck. What if I told you that there is a Dow Jones Industrial Average stock with a yield north of 6%? Dow Inc. (DOW -0.07%) a maker of various chemical products and one of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 30 components fits this description.

Let's take a look at it and why it looks like a buy right now.

An exclusive club

Dow Inc. is a $30 billion company that primarily engages in the commodity chemicals business. Its three business segments are packaging and specialty plastics industrial intermediates and infrastructure and performance materials and coatings. The company came into its current incarnation as the result of a 2017 merger between and DuPont de Nemours and a subsequent move that saw the company split into three separate companies which birthed Dow Inc.

The exclusive Dow Jones Industrial index essentially screens out low-quality companies as it is an index of 30 of the top blue-chip stocks in the United States. S&P Global the company that now compiles the Dow Jones Industrial Average says that companies in the exclusive index must be profitable at the time of admission must meet all of the criteria for being in the S&P 500 and can make it into the club ""only if the company has an excellent reputation demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors.""

While those criteria are admittedly somewhat vague and Dow components are by no means infallible investors can at least feel good about the fact that Dow Inc. is considered worthy of this membership among some of the top blue-chip companies in the world.

Rock bottom valuation

Shares of Dow Inc. trade at a rock bottom valuation. To be clear Dow is not without its challenges -- the surge of oil and natural gas prices is not great for companies like Dow as these are key inputs for making plastics. The company also has a lot of debt as a result of the spinoff. Chemical companies are viewed as cyclical and investors who are worried the economy could be heading into a recession are reluctant to own cyclical stocks.

But Dow has been paying down debt while oil and natural gas prices have fallen from their highs this summer and at a valuation of just five times earnings these challenges seem to be more than accounted for in the stock's inexpensive valuation.

A cheap valuation can often be a sign of a stock with declining earnings but since the spinoff Dow has grown earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from $8.2 billion to $9.3 billion on a three-year average basis and also increased free cash flow while reducing debt and the number of shares outstanding (through share buybacks).

Monster dividend

Dow Inc.'s dividend yield of 6% trounces the market average and is an attractive proposition for income investors. Since the spinoff Dow's dividend has remained steady at $0.70 a quarter. While the dividend has not grown since then the company also deserves credit for maintaining this dividend during a challenging 2020 and 2021 that saw many companies cut or suspend their dividends.

Furthermore the $2.80-per-share annual dividend is well covered by the company's $8.93 per share in earnings which gives Dow Inc. a dividend payout ratio of just 31%. This is very sustainable payout ratio and also means that Dow has the flexibility to increase its dividend payout in the future.

Is Dow Inc. a buy?

Dow Inc. is a large diversified business with a global presence and operations across a variety of business segments and end markets. While it is contending with some challenges it is rare to find a high-quality Dow Jones component trading at this low of a valuation and with this high of a dividend yield. Dow's inexpensive valuation and dividend yield of over 6% which is sufficiently covered by the company's earnings make it an attractive buy for income investors."

After a 12-year absence actor Roark Critchlow is back in Salem reprising his role as Dr. Mike Horton on “Days of our Lives.” His first air date is set for Tuesday October 4.

Critchlow’s return was first revealed earlier this month when Peacock released a fall trailer teasing what’s to come on the drama series which recently moved to the streaming service after spending more than 56 years on NBC. Critchlow joined the cast of the series in 1994 and remained a full-time cast member until 1999. He reprised the role again in 2010 for a few episodes to honor the late Frances Reid who played Alice Horton Mike’s grandmother. Details about the actor’s return up to that point had been kept under wraps. Now in an interview with Soap Opera Digest on newsstands news Critchlow is speaking out about his return to the series including who he shares his first scenes with why he’s back in town and how his return to the canvas came to be.

First things first: Critchlow will first appear on-screen alongside Susan Seaforth Hayes and Bill Hayes (Julie and Doug Williams). His visit will be a short one. “I was nervous. You get back in there and you just feel … it’s not like a heavy weight but it’s a heritage” says Critchlow of working with the legendary actors. “To be able to work with people who have been at it as well and as long as they have? We actually had a couple of lovely scenes. It was like the people that you knew from 20 years ago or whatever. It was not just the characters going “Oh hi. Hey Mike you’re back. It’s good to see you too.’ It was so genuine because they were both coming from a human place. It wasn’t just the actors and the characters. It really enjoyed those scenes.”

As for how his return came to be Critchlow credits the writers for thinking of him as the offer came as a surprise. “I’m not really sure how it evolved” he tells Digest. “They just contacted my agent. He was like ‘Hey. They’ve got a couple of episodes. Do you want to go?’ I was like ‘Hell yeah. That sounds good.'”

In addition to the Hayes Critchlow also worked alongside Cady McClain and Matthew Ashford. The former plays a recast Jennifer Horton Critchlow’s on-screen sister and the latter plays Jack Deveraux Jennifer’s husband. During Critchlow’s initial time on the soap another actor played the part of Jack the actor points out. “When I was on it it was Mark Valley [ex-Jack]. That was actually kind of fun because he and I shared a whole bunch of stories. Now we’re both in the same spot in our careers.”

Meanwhile working with McClain for the first time became natural for Critchlow despite another actress playing his character’s sister during his initial run. “She and I dropped in really easily I felt” said Critchlow of his experience. “It was a very nice natural care for each other. It wasn’t difficult that’s for sure. Obviously Missy [Reeves ex-Jennifer] is a super-duper person. But you don’t compare people. Cady and I chatted. We got on good. In terms of story I thought we pulled it off nicely as being people who’ve known each other their whole lives.”

During his return to the Los Angeles area for taping Critchlow was able to spend time catching up with friends his kids and his ex-wife Maria as he primarily spends most of his days in Canada more specifically Summerland British Columbia where his parents live and where he went to high school. “I came back because mom and day are getting older” Critchlow tells Digest. “I thought ‘I’ll come back home take a break and gather myself.”

Since his initial departure from the soap in 1999 Critchlow has gone on to star in such shows as “V” and the original “Pretty Little Liars” series. He’s also appeared in episodes of “Drop Dead Diva” “NCIS” “Supernatural” “UnREAL” and “Arrow” among others. He reunited with former “Days of our Lives” co-star Alison Sweeney (Sami Brady) in the 2016 TV movie “Murder She Baked: A Peach Cobbler Mystery.” He can next be seen in the Christmas TV movie “My Favorite Christmas Tree.”

Algae came to the limelight in the world’s fight against climate change about a decade ago for its vast benefits in industrial production. It can synthesise large volumes of oil (20 times more than that of mustard per acre) grow fast (10 times quicker than terrestrial plants) and capture carbon dioxide (CO2).

Since then big industries and startups around the globe have been working to commercialise algae-based biofuel processes to reduce dependence on conventional fossil fuels like petrol and diesel.

But as of today in 2022 have we really come up with any algae biofuel industry?

India’s Reliance Industries Ltd recently released a short video on social media platform Instagram highlighting the cutting-edge algae-to-fuel technology it has developed. The company has been successfully running large algae raceway ponds the last five years at their facility near Jamnagar to convert sunshine CO2 and seawater into bio-oil.

It also displayed the utilisation of catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction technology to convert algae biomass to oil. Under this process water is used as solvent under high temperature and pressure to extract oil from the biomass.

The benefits of this technology include direct utilisation of wet biomass without any need for drying and conversion of every organic fragment of biomass into oil and without any wastage.

At the global level oil and gas giant ExxonMobil partnered with Viridos (formerly Synthetic Genomics) to commercialise algal biofuels.

“Microalgae are excellent at converting CO2 and sunlight into oil-rich biomass especially when compared to land-based crop plants like oil palm and soy” the company wrote on its website adding:

By adapting microalgae to function as cell factories producing energy-dense oils that can easily be refined into renewable diesel and jet fuel we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 per cent.

Eneos Holdings Inc — a Japanese multinational petroleum corporation — Honda Motor Co Ltd and Chitose Bio Evolution Pte (headquartered in Singapore) are collaboratively planning for mass-scale algae production in Malaysia.

A pilot run over five hectares will be performed at Borneo Island of Malaysia starting 2023 with monetary support from Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization.

In 2021 TotalEnergies a global energy company tied up with French company Veolia to demonstrate an algal biofuel production facility at TotalEnergies’s La Mède biorefinery near Marseille France. The project aims to harness the potential of CO2-absorbing microalgae and transform it into oil by 2025.

Earlier in 2022 Turkish airlines partnered with Bogazici University to build an algae-based jet fuel demonstration plant at Istanbul. The company received 6 million euros in funding from the European Union.

Rocky past

These however are not the first initiatives to prove the value of algae biofuel. Reports on “algae oil bubble” point to a disappointing reality.

Over 25 companies worldwide who initially pitched in to make algae biofuels have either gone bankrupt or moved to other algae products.

Algenol one of the first algae-based biofuel companies that was pumped in trillions of dollars from public-private funds and promised to deliver 8000 gallons of algal fuel per acre per year had to completely shut down its biofuel business in 2015.

It now markets algae-based personal care ingredients food supplements and other non-fuel products.

Shell and Chevron the leading multinational energy industries halted their algal biofuel R&D programs long back declaring it a failure.

The major challenges associated with algae biofuel include large water requirements high cost of growth nutrients expensive biomass harvesting and difficult oil extraction from algae cells. Producing a kilogram of biodiesel requires 3.73 tonnes of water 0.33 kg of nitrogen and 0.71 kg of phosphate according to estimates.

Moreover to replace just 5 per cent of the diesel that the United States consumes algal biofuels will require a minimum of 123 billion litres of freshwater which is equivalent to fulfilling the demand of 400000 households for a year.

Additionally the energy cost of extracting oil from algae biomass is 10 times higher than the energy cost of extracting soybean oil.

Techno-economic studies on algae fuels demonstrate that the cost has a large variability because of inappropriate assumptions including those related to the products cultivation methods biomass productivities oil contents production capacity and conversion technologies.

The results of the cost estimation were directly impacted by an overestimation of the combined biomass yield and lipid content.

Additionally a significant portion of the assessments were made by extrapolating data from laboratory settings which frequently do not match actual conditions on a commercial scale.

Energy return on investment (EROI) an indicator of sustainability assessment is the proportion of energy produced by a given source to the energy required to produce it. When the EROI is less than 1 more energy is needed to create a fuel than is found in the fuel and coproducts.

For algal biofuels produced in open ponds or photobioreactors the predicted EROI ranges from 0.13 to 0.71. For a fuel to be a sustainable energy source it should have an EROI greater than 3.

To combat these challenges researchers around the globe are working hard to make algae biofuels a reality.

Scientists from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory United States have illustrated a novel integrated technology that paves the path for improved productivity and lower prices of algae biofuels.

The process uses medium temperature and low pH to more readily extract available lipids from the algae biomass to further process them into biodiesel.

This method can reduce per-gallon fuel expenses by up to 33 per cent compared to a standard lipid extraction-only method.

Phycobloom a Cambridge and Oxford alumni startup have developed an engineered algal strain that produces oil very efficiently without the requirement of any costly downstream machines.

A group led by Peter Ralph professor at University of Technology Sydney is working to tackle commercialisation barriers in the algae cultivation. One of the interesting projects that the group is working on includes ‘industrial CO2 sink using microalgae’. This has been funded by Siemens Germany.

To substantially reduce the algae biomass harvesting cost a research group led by Anushree Malik at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi has designed different models of biofilm reactors to cultivate microalgae.

Algal biofilm reactors offer a robust cultivation system promising high biomass productivity low harvesting cost and the ability to handle complex industrial effluents said Malik Anushree has been working with algae over a decade. “These have emerged as important tools for efficient resource recovery from waste streams in terms of algal biofuels.”

Though algae has not been able to perform well in the energy sector rising fuel prices and constant pressure from international environmental bodies to find alternate green fuels have drawn researchers technocrats and big investors towards it.

It will be interesting to see algae biofuels future journey with a hope to power our engines one day."

We have a little bit of something for everybody"" said Comic Expo administrator Matt Bredestege.

Bredestege says this is Cincinnati's largest comic and pop culture expo and that he and a friend started the convention after traveling to other comic conventions.

""There was nothing like this in Cincinnati. We had to go to Chicago New York to see anything like this. and it was time that Cincinnati finally had one of its own"" he said. ""So we planned ahead and we looked ahead and there's a lot of people that wanted to do something like this.""

One of the fun exhibits this time is ""Roxy the Rancor"" made to look like the Rancor in the Star Wars Return of the Jedi movie. The owners travel around the country showing the 700- pound 17-foot-long statue.

""It takes a whole team so we come in with a 53-foot tractor trailer; we bring in volunteers to unload reload"" said Roxy co-owner Matt Paisley.

The convention is open 10 a.m.-7 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m.-5p.m. on Sunday.

While the MBNA name may no longer exist after being acquired by Bank of America in 2006 for $35 billion its impact on Delaware’s banking industry continues to linger with local leaders at Bank of America JPMorgan Chase PNC Bank Goldman Sachs College Ave Student Loans and more having spent time at the company. That legacy is due to the fact that in the late 1990s MBNA was the largest private employer in the state with more than 26000 associates.

Many of those former MBNA associates gathered in the Gold Ballroom of the Hotel DuPont on Thursday to watch former Chief Operating Officer John Cochran and Chief Administrative Officer Lance Weaver receive the annual Freedom Award – it was the first time the award had been given to a company rather than an individual.

As a legacy of the late Gov. Pete du Pont the Pete du Pont Freedom Foundation is a nonprofit that promotes and supports entrepreneurism in the state and nation. Thère du Pont son of the late governor and chair of the foundation’s board said it wasn’t just the financial success of the company that warranted its honor.

“Maybe even remarkable and more instructive for the entrepreneurs in this room is the conscious effort that team made early on in their work to create a culture” he said. “They were practically just a startup with about 150 people in a renovated A&P Supermarket in Ogletown when the leaders wrote down the precepts as they’re called. They weren’t goals for new accounts or loan growth. They were a statement of expectations of how MBNA people would treat each other how they treat their customers and how they wanted their operation to run.”

In his remarks Cochran recalled just how intertwined the MBNA story was with Gov. du Pont.

In 1981 the company was still a $100 million loan portfolio of the Baltimore-based Maryland National Bank with a more than 20% prime lending rate and an operation that lost $7 million on the bottom line. They sought interest rate relief from the Maryland legislature but were rebuked. Management at the bank were advised to begin seeking a buyer for the credit operation.

“It was going to be a fire sale. But then the Financial Center Development Act was signed into law by Pete du Pont in February 1981. The timing was perfect. It couldn’t have been any better for our credit card program and Charlie Cawley” he said.

It famously moved to the 19000-square-foot former grocery store with about 50 people turning a profit in the first year. Within 10 years they would employ 10000 people and occupy 5 million square feet of space largely on the back of affinity cards or branded credit cards issued with universities organizations sports teams and more.

MBNA was led by the late Cawley a tenacious and gifted leader and board chair and CEO Alfred Lerner whose legacy continues in Delaware through the business college named in his honor at the University of Delaware.

Cochran recalled Cawley’s undying devotion to customer service creating the nation’s first 24/7 customer service hotline for a credit card and consistently challenging company leaders to cut through red tape to improve a customer’s experience. It was spurred in part from one letter from a Maryland National Bank executive about the troubles his wife had in contesting a charge that made its way to Cawley.

“The management team was called to a conference room to listen to Charlie read all of the customer service dispute letters he could get his hands on and at the end of each reading Charlie would say ‘Think of yourself as this customer. How would you feel?’ The meeting went on for several hours and continued at 7 a.m. the next morning and many mornings after that” Cochran said.

Afterward customer service was rebranded customer assistance phones were required to be answered within two rings and all paychecks were branded with the line “Brought to you by the customer.”

Weaver concurred with the customer focus and recalled a time when then-DuPont CEO Jack Krol called the company to seek a credit line increase while he was out Christmas shopping. Unsatisfied that the hotline told him it would take a few days Krol called Cawley.

“Then Charlie gets us all into a room and tells the story John just told him. So Charlie said ‘You idiots don’t seem to understand that this is a customer calling in and they want more of our product. Our product is credit. They want more of our product and you’re telling him we’ll get back to him in a few days?” Weaver said.

After that incident near-instant credit checks and approvals became the norm for MBNA and today is an industry-wide standard.

MBNA and DuPont would cross once more in the late 1990s when Krol called Weaver about the prospect of selling its Louviers property near Newark. After much negotiation – and Cawley’s unexpected demand to also acquire the neighboring DuPont-owned golf club – Weaver closed the $14 million deal creating what is today known as the Deerfield office complex and golf course.

Weaver noted that MBNA also worked to serve all of its employees with the company building a hiring program for people with cognitive disabilities after Cawley was approached by some local advocates. When they later came back to inform Cawley that the benefits package offered by the company wasn’t meeting their needs the founder demanded that leadership tailor a new package to do so.

In the end the memory of MBNA lives on beneath Delaware’s still growing banking industry but for one night it was back in the spotlight.

“I often get asked what the magic of MBNA was and the magic was its people” Weaver said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2RhdmlkLWdsYXNzY29jay1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjYwMTI3MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Glasscock Obituary (2022) - North Wilmington DE - McCrery & Harra Funeral Home and Crematory - Concord Pike,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/david-glasscock-obituary?id=36601272 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2RhdmlkLWdsYXNzY29jay1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjYwMTI3MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL25ld3MuZHVwb250cmVnaXN0cnkuY29tL3dhdGNoZXMvYmVsbC1yb3NzLXJlbGVhc2VzLWl0cy1jb21pYy1pbnNwaXJlZC1ici0wMy05Mi1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLXdpdGgtdW5jcmF0ZS14LXdheW5lLWVudGVycHJpc2VzL9IBigFodHRwczovL25ld3MuZHVwb250cmVnaXN0cnkuY29tL3dhdGNoZXMvYmVsbC1yb3NzLXJlbGVhc2VzLWl0cy1jb21pYy1pbnNwaXJlZC1ici0wMy05Mi1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLXdpdGgtdW5jcmF0ZS14LXdheW5lLWVudGVycHJpc2VzLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bell & Ross Releases Its Comic-Inspired BR 03-92 Collaboration With UNCRATE x Wayne Enterprises,"Limited to 100 serial-numbered pieces worldwide the newest Bell & Ross fits in to the Dark Knight’s luxury lifestyle.

Global Biodegradable Plastics Market Dynamics

Growing use of biodegradable plastics particularly in food packaging is a key factor in the market's growth during the coming years. The finest plastic substitutes biodegradable polyesters are largely responsible for this rise. Therefore factors predicted to boost the global biodegradable plastics market expansion in the forecast period include rise in usage of food packaging bottles and disposable tableware as well as government support for biodegradable materials with stringent controls on plastics consumption to prevent environmental pollution. To reduce plastic waste nationwide the German government for instance declared in 2020 that it will outlaw the sale of single-use plastic products like cutlery straws food containers and other similar products starting in July 2021. The German Association of Local Utilities predicts that trash from popular plastic items is increasing by 10% to 20% year primarily due to single-use plastic products.

Further because of increased efforts to reduce the use of conventional plastics and growing consumer awareness of eco-friendly plastic alternatives the market for biodegradable plastics is expected to grow. Traditional petroleum-based plastics deteriorate slowly over a long period of time and end up in landfills. Biodegradable polymers are quickly broken down and returned to the environment. Additionally biodegradable polymers break down more quickly than traditional plastics. Biodegradable polymers break down 60% more quickly and in as little as 180 days than conventional plastics which take over a thousand years to break down.

Biodegradable Plastics Market: COVID-19 Impact Analysis

The pandemic has disrupted the routine manufacturing operations of companies in the consumer goods sector. The Institute for Supply Management Research estimates that 75% of firms reduced their revenue targets as a result of supply chain disruptions.

The consumer sector is going through a mixed economy with certain industries—like frozen foods and household cleaning—seeing a boost in consumer demand and others—such as retail sales and foot traffic in stores seeing major declines. To keep up with the shift in customer demand toward e-commerce these companies must adapt. Thus the consumer products industry as a whole has been forced into the digital era.

Segmentation Analysis

The global biodegradable plastics market is segmented based on product type end-user and region. On the basis of type the market has been segmented into PLA starch blends PHA and biodegradable polyesters. Due to its widespread use in a range of industries such as packaging automobiles and agriculture the starch blends segment led the global market for biodegradable plastics. Plastics for PLA products are also quickly gaining ground on the market. A significant industry driver is PLA's low cost as compared to other products.

On the basis of end-user the market has been segmented into packaging consumer goods textile and agriculture & horticulture. Because of the movement in consumer choice from artificial to bio-based products in response to increased environmental consciousness the packaging segment dominated the global market for biodegradable plastics. Biodegradable plastic is used in many different applications and has the potential to be useful in food packaging. The need for biodegradable plastic in packaging applications is directly impacted by the rise in packaged food options as a result of demographic and lifestyle changes.

Subscribe to the newsletter here.

No recycled content. No take-back program. Destined for landfill incineration or (worse yet) the environment.

This probably doesn’t sound to you like a recipe for success in sustainability. It didn’t sound great to two veterans of the beauty products industry either. Mia Davis is vice president of sustainability and impact at Credo Beauty and Victor Casale is cofounder and CEO at MOB Beauty. They saw the problem in the beauty packaging space and decided to do something about it by starting Pact Collective.

As its website describes it ""Pact exists to share information transparently and educate industry stakeholders effectively so we can take responsibility for the waste we create."" The collective consists of more than 130 member companies from all parts of the beauty value chain. Notable members of the collective include Sephora and Eastman Chemical and Pact is working to add several multinational beauty brands this year to further amplify the scale of its impact.

I had a chance to sit down and chat with Davis a couple weeks ago to talk about Pact’s origins goals and early progress.

Why Pact Collective? Why now?

Let’s start with a basic understanding of the scale here. An estimated 120 billion beauty and wellness packages are produced each year. That is a lot of packages more than 27 per global consumer.

Davis comes from a background in safe ingredients for beauty products. It goes all the way back to her days as organizing director at the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics from 2007 to 2011. I know as well as anyone though that you can start by looking at the chemical hazards of ingredients and it quickly snowballs to include where and how those ingredients are sourced where waste exists in the system and what can be done to improve packaging.

An estimated 120 billion beauty and wellness packages are produced each year. That is a lot of packages more than 27 per global consumer.

""Beauty product packaging is often too small to be caught and sorted by standard material recovery facility [or MRF] equipment"" Davis said. ""And shockingly few of those small jars caps and tubes have resin ID codes or disposal instructions. Without this basic information both customers and hand sorters at facilities like Pact's cannot quickly and easily determine what material they're holding.""

So what’s needed to increase packaging sustainability in this industry? Pact Collective’s theory of change is based on four key principles.

1. Sourcing

Pact’s founders understand that if there were a one-size-fits-all solution to the beauty product packaging challenge then the collective would not have to exist. The key to Pact’s sourcing guidance is relatively simple: Choose the best material set for the application and choose the material most likely to be reused or recycled within that set.

2. Design

This (to me) is where the real innovation lies. Pact delivers eight suggestions for designers. Some of my favorites:

Design for reuse

Reduce the amount of packaging

Use the highest possible post-consumer recycled content (PCR)

To me design is the most exciting space we can focus on when it comes to packaging. As architect designer and author William McDonough often says ""Design is the first signal of human intention."" I’m not generally an optimist but I do believe there are folks out there creative enough to design a sustainable future if brands are willing to try new things and experiment.

3. Education

If you’re anything like me you start thinking about whether something can be recycled before you even buy it. You look at the thing and say ""Yeah I’m sure this can be recycled somewhere."" I’m usually wrong due to the huge chasm between theoretical and practical recycling. Pact is pushing for more transparency in labeling so users of products don’t have to guess.

One way to improve education though is to label better. ""Suppliers need to make packaging that is accurately labeled and we immediately need to stop buying packaging that is not [labeled for recycling]"" Davis said. ""The idea that it is 'too hard' to put a resin code on a beauty package is so limited a poor excuse. When we mandate truth in labeling through regulation and market policies then we will see packaging suppliers making materials that can actually be recycled in MRFs.""

4. End-of-life

What actually happens between our curbsides and the next life of a piece of packaging? For most beauty and wellness packaging it is landfill or incineration. So not really much of a next life at all.

What dictates this? First and foremost material selection. So much of this packaging uses materials that either can’t be recycled or don’t have a market for recycling. Second is size. As mentioned earlier most MRFs have great difficulty separating small packages and keeping them in the recycling flow. That means that even if beauty and wellness packaging is recyclable and marked as such much of it is literally falling through the cracks and ending up in landfills incinerators or (worse yet) the environment.

The idea that it is 'too hard' to put a resin code on a beauty package is so limited. It's a poor excuse.

Pact Collective is addressing this problem to some degree by creating take-back programs and hand separating materials to learn what’s in the packaging mix. This take-back sorting and eventual sale directly to recycling markets will allow Pact members to gain invaluable data as they work to innovate packaging solutions for the future. Hand sorting is clearly not a scalable model in North America due to labor costs though so this should be seen as a transitional solution to get us to the next step.

Collectives such as this hold promise for entire industries to become more sustainable if they can engage the whole supply chain and expect real change from their members. I look forward to following Pact as it grows and evolves. With any luck it’ll build a movement in the beauty industry that can increase circularity and provide a template for other industries to improve as well.",,,,,,

Prosecutor Marty Votel presented commissioners with the finalized agreement and said there would be some “punch list” items left to complete including working with County Auditor Lavon Wright to create line items and accounts and other things. Votel had previously gone over a draft of the agreement during the commission’s Monday Sept. 12 meeting.

Per the agreement NSR will close the crossings on Oxford Gettysburg Conley and Daily Roads in exchange for compensation. Oxford-Gettysburg Road will be closed at-grade crossing “per a mutually agreed upon timetable but in no case later than 15 months from the date payment is made by the company” the agreement noted.

NSR will remove any siding presently blocking Crawfordsville-Campbellstown Road and any siding presently blocking West Florence-Campbellstown Road no later than the formal closure of Oxford-Gettysburg Road.

Conley and Daily Roads were permanently closed effective Thursday Sept. 15.

In exchange the county will receive $2400000 to fund the infrastructure upgrade at Toby Road between Ohio 122 and U.S. 35.

Because the agreement was signed before Sept. 15 NSR is paying the county an additional $100000 per closure as a bonus ($300000.) The county will present a grant application for an additional $300000 to the Ohio Rail Development Commission and NSR will support it according to the agreement.

Prior to the permanent closure of Oxford-Gettysburg Road the company at its sole expense will construct two appropriately-sized hammerhead turn-arounds north and south of the Oxford-Gettysburg crossing.

“I need to do some research to determine what if anything needs to be done to legally vacate those little sections of road and have them removed from the plat” he noted. “I don’t know if that’s something I’m going to have to do or not. So there are some punch list items after the execution of this but the heavy lifting has been done. The only other agenda item that you can expect in the near future is a proposed written agreement from the ORDC regarding their $300000 I was presented with.”

The additional agreement with the ORDC will be reviewed with County Engineer Kyle Cross and then presented for commission approval.

About the Up & Running Grant Program

In April 2020 eBay announced Up & Running a $100 million small business accelerator program to address the devastating impacts of COVID-19 to small local retail businesses. Built on eBay's long-standing commitment to ""enabling economic opportunity for all"" the program sought to help small businesses without an e-commerce presence transition to online selling.

In November 2020 – to expand on its ""Up & Running"" pledge – eBay introduced the Up & Running Grant program in partnership with Hello Alice. Now in its third year the program has received more than 45000 applications from entrepreneurs sharing details of their small business and how they plan to use the grant to fuel their growth. Following a comprehensive review 50 sellers are chosen annually to each receive $10000 in cash along with premium access to eBay Academy — eBay's e-learning platform — as well as direct training Q&A sessions and mentorship from ranking eBay sellers. See the 2022 winners in this video here .

At most tennis events 'RF' caps are a regular feature among the crowd in a number of different colours.

That's been the case at the 2022 Laver Cup too with a special edition hat quickly selling out earlier in the week. The merchandise stores held a small number of black 'RF' hats that had Laver Cup written on the side.

With Federer announcing the tournament this week would be his last before retirement fans descended on the capital to grab what merchandise they could. Retailing at £36 fans quickly snapped up the hats before they sold out with fans now turning to eBay to make a huge profit on their initial investment.

There have already been some sold for £300 and £250 with more up for sale at closer to £400.

Preferred Region How does this work?

By Glenn Hendry Published September 23 2022 at 10:19 am

A lacrosse card from the 1966 Oshawa Green Gaels national champion lacrosse team has shown up on eBay – listing at $2500 US – the only example of a period lacrosse card which has surfaced from the post WWI era through the 1960s.

The card depicts Neil Armstrong (no not the man who landed on the moon or the Hockey Hall of Fame linesman) who won four Minto Cup junior titles with the Green Gaels and added a Mann Cup senior championship with the Brooklin Redmen in 1969.

Don Gibson uncovered this little tidbit and posted it on the Vintage Oshawa Facebook page noting that lacrosse trading cards were practically unheard of and the only reason the 1966 series was issued was thanks to the influence of the team’s coach the legendary Jim Bishop.

Bishop who led the Green Gaels to a record-smashing seven straight Minto Cup championships between 1963 (the team’s inaugural season) and 1969 was the sports director of Oshawa radio station CKLB at the time and on the heels of a successful trading card co-promotion of the 1965-66 Oshawa Generals featuring the great Bobby Orr Bishop decided to have CKLB and Crown Life Insurance sponsor his Oshawa Green Gaels lacrosse card set for the 1966 season.

This card is the only one from that season that has appeared on the market though there about two dozen players honoured including lacrosse icons like Gaylord Powless Jim Higgs Don Stinson and Peter Vipond.

If they had made a set featuring the 1964 team it would possibly have included the very first card of any kind featuring Bobby Orr who played four games with the Green Gaels that year as a 16 year-old.

As to the card itself it is in Very Good (VG 3) condition with minor wrinkles and measures 4.25 inches by six inches in size. If you have $3348.63 (the Canadian dollar equivalent) or like to strike a hard bargain check it out on eBay.

He was in his prime when he made that comment known internationally for his music and collaborations with for example Le Corbusier. Yet the search never stopped and Xenakis managed to stay elusive until his death in 2001 along the way building a legacy that is being observed this year the centennial of his birth.

The premiere of “Metastaseis” in 1955 in Germany put Xenakis in the company of the era’s respected composers. Admirers and opponents alike were struck by the work’s sheer violence of the masses of sound which were constructed not by notes but by ever-changing glissandos going up and down and landing briefly into visceral clusters of pitches.

It was something new and exciting. The composers of the Darmstadt School then the powerhouse of avant-garde music had been focused on serialism and the belief that every aspect of composition should be under control measured and organized in a highly abstract manner. But Xenakis in an article titled “The Crisis of Serial Music” took issue with the likes of Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen essentially accusing them of leading music into an impasse.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jYS9uZXdzLzkxNTQyMTAvYi1jLW11c3F1ZWFtLWhpc3RvcnktaGVyaXRhZ2UtYW5kLWN1bHR1cmUtc2hvd2Nhc2VkLWluLWZpZmEtMjMv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9nbG9iYWxuZXdzLmNhL25ld3MvOTE1NDIxMC9iLWMtbXVzcXVlYW0taGlzdG9yeS1oZXJpdGFnZS1hbmQtY3VsdHVyZS1zaG93Y2FzZWQtaW4tZmlmYS0yMy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,B.C.

I couldn’t go more than a few minutes without hearing people discussing the new law or seeing a sign at a booth about how the IRA makes a company’s products more attractive. I attempted to attend one IRA-related educational session but the room was packed to overflowing and the panel had more questions than answers. The entire industry is awaiting the Dept. of Treasury guidance that will clarify many of the bill’s provisions with no clear timeline for when that guidance might come.

In the inverter and power electronics space manufacturers showed off the products added to their lineups to serve all residential solar + storage + EV charging needs with one brand — giving customers the option to purchase cohesive systems that communicate well and allow for one phone call to troubleshoot a system. Other companies showed products and software meant to simplify and automate project permitting O&M and more.

Here are the new releases I checked out on the floor at RE+ 2022.

Enphase’s IQ8 microinverter

For the first time in my solar reporting career Enphase invested in a booth at RE+. The company showcased its microgrid-forming IQ8 microinverter a product that has gotten tons of hype since its announcement. This inverter is capable of forming a microgrid during a power outage during the day using only sunlight — providing backup power even without a battery. It may look like any other microinverter but the custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip gives it those special microgrid capabilities.

SolarEdge’s smarter C&I power optimizers

SolarEdge has been emphasizing its whole-home DC-optimized smart energy ecosystem over the past year so the company brought all the pieces and parts to RE+. One product from the line was a smarter C&I power optimizer that can sense thermal events and send the system into safety mode. In addition to residential products SolarEdge will be releasing a 330-kW string inverter for community solar applications with plans to even enter the utility-scale space in 2023. SolarEdge reps acknowledged that an optimizer-paired inverter may be a tough sell for the utility-scale market but said SolarEdge’s unique topology will be a good fit for the market.

Growatt’s numerous residential solar + backup configurations

Growatt’s booth displayed numerous solar + storage configurations to fit different residential needs. The company has a whole-home backup solution with 9.9-kWh batteries that can be connected in parallel for nearly 40 kWh of power; a smaller “critical load” backup system designed for just a few essential circuits and an off-grid system for remote areas.

SMA America’s residential inverters with Backup Select

SMA America’s string inverters with “Backup Select” capabilities can provide power to anything plugged into its integrated critical loads panel even without a battery as long as the sun is shining. This feature is familiar in the inverter world with Enphase IQ8 microinverters providing a similar function through the company’s “Sunlight Backup” capability. Still SMA’s next-generation string inverter is meant to be paired with energy storage and has been redesigned as a DC-coupled hybrid inverter. This model is tested to work with BYD batteries for now with plans for more in the future.

Sungrow’s power-dense utility-scale inverter skid

Sungrow prioritized installer requests in its new all-in-one SG4400 utility-scale inverter skid. The new product is four different inverter modules so if one goes down the whole plant isn’t affected. This inverter packs almost doubles the power in the same footprint as its model from five years ago. Engineers added plenty of space in each inverter module for installers to comfortably work on wiring.

GoodWe/GE’s hybrid inverter with direct EV plugin

GoodWe has a licensing agreement with GE and was showing off its GE-branded hybrid inverter the GEH US which allows an EV charger to be plugged directly into the inverter and eliminates the need to add another breaker for an EV charger hookup. The GEH is a split-phase inverter that’s compatible with high-voltage batteries and offers up to four MPPTs.

APsystems’ 4-module C&I microinverter

APsystems’ new most powerful QT2 4-module C&I microinverter comes in 208- and 480-V options for less losses and higher output. Both this commercial and the company’s residential DS3 dual-module microinverter are designed to work with the latest high-power modules. The company likely won’t go higher than four modules per micro but found this solution decreases costs and increases install speed for contractors.

Fluke’s new six-in-one solar measurement tool

Fluke’s new Solar Multifunction Tester combines the functions of six different solar O&M tools into one. The tester has a built-in IV curve tracer that displays on-screen rather than the old method of displaying it on a separate PC screen. It comes in a kit with the company’s solar irradiance meter both of which fit snugly in the included custom backpack.

CPS America’s PCS energy storage inverter

CPS America’s AC-coupled PCS energy storage inverter is rack-mountable in 1-MW stacks and includes the DC voltage range to work with many different battery brands. These inverters designed for C&I and utility-scale installations can perform load-shifting demand charge reduction ancillary grid support services and more.

EPCpower’s Made-in-America energy storage inverters

EPCpower’s utility-scale and large commercial energy storage inverters are Made in America at a factory in Poway California and soon in Greenville South Carolina. The inverters come in a stainless steel version to withstand salty air and other harsh environments. The company has plans to expand its line to include solar inverters but has focused on the battery market for its 12 years in business so far. A recent acquisition from Goldman Sachs and Cleanhill Partners should help with expansion.

SenseHawk’s workflow automation software

SenseHawk is dedicated to automating as many steps as possible in both solar construction and asset management. The software includes detailed maps of solar sites checklists and manuals so techs spend less time getting oriented and solving problems at sites. The solution works offline and syncs when re-connected to the internet for workers at remote project locations.

Transect’s environmental permitting solution

Transect has released a data-aggregating solution to expedite the typically tedious and long-term environmental permitting step of the solar development process. The company takes both publicly available data and proprietary datasets related to environmental permitting including endangered species waterways and more and condenses the information into an easy-to-read web format. At a glance developers can see the environmental problems they may face with a site and decide if mitigation will be plausible or if it’s a non-starter.

Morningstar’s off-grid inverter in new power classes

Morningstar Corp. has expanded its line of tried-and-true SureSine off-grid inverters to meet higher-power needs. The company stuck with the same core technology and passive cooling in new options with some enhancements to communications. The SureSine inverter line will connect seamlessly to the company’s new DC system controller which has also been updated to provide broader system visibility in the same user interface.",,,,,,,,,

For Immediate Release

Entergy Louisiana Entergy New Orleans and Diamond Offshore Wind seek to evaluate offshore wind

09/23/2022

Companies partner on the future development of offshore wind power to serve Louisiana customers

JEFFERSON La. – Entergy Louisiana Entergy New Orleans and Diamond Offshore Wind a subsidiary of Diamond Generating Corporation today announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding regarding the evaluation and potential early development of wind power generation in the Gulf of Mexico. The agreement could put Entergy in a position to deliver another source of clean power to customers while also strengthening the region’s economic development.

“This is an important first step to possibly bring wind power to our Louisiana shores” said Phillip May Entergy Louisiana president and CEO. “While there remains work to be done before that happens we are excited by the opportunity to begin this process. We aspire to help our communities thrive for generations to come and this marks yet another milestone in honoring that mission.”

“Clean and affordable power is a driver of economic growth resulting in increased investments and good paying green jobs in our communities” added Deanna Rodriguez Entergy New Orleans president and CEO. “Entergy New Orleans understands the importance of serving customers with clean energy to reduce the impacts of climate change and doing so in a way that keeps service affordable to families and businesses in New Orleans. This agreement creates another possible avenue to meet those demands.”

The MOU provides a legal framework for Entergy and Diamond Offshore Wind to work toward the development of potential offshore wind demonstration projects located in Louisiana state waters and will focus in the near term on the evaluation of grid interconnection to determine the optimal size and locations of future offshore wind development.

Earlier this year Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards submitted the Louisiana Climate Action Plan which offered a series of recommendations that can lead Louisiana to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 – a key action from that plan is to achieve five gigawatts of offshore wind generation by 2035. Development of wind energy in the Gulf of Mexico will accelerate the state’s role as a leader in renewable energy development and drive collaboration between state and federal agencies utilities the private sector and our states colleges and universities. Entergy is proud to be a leader in this exciting future for Louisiana.

“Diamond Offshore Wind is pleased to announce our partnership with Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans to explore building the first offshore wind project in Louisiana state waters and in the Gulf of Mexico” said Chris Wissemann CEO of Diamond Offshore Wind. “Louisiana has a tremendous opportunity to develop an offshore wind industry that services the entire country and through this project we hope to accelerate its development create jobs provide a renewable source of power to Louisiana customers and help Louisiana meet its climate goals.”

Entergy Louisiana currently has approximately 280 megawatts of renewable resources including the Capital Region Solar facility which began delivering power to the grid in October 2020. Along with nuclear generation nearly 30% of the company’s portfolio comes from renewable resources. In addition the LPSC recently approved 475 megawatts of solar power with an additional 2000 megawatts in the queue.

Entergy New Orleans’ diverse generation portfolio includes the 20-megawatts New Orleans Solar Station and the soon to be completed Iris Solar and St. James Solar projects which will add an additional 70 megawatts of clean energy. In addition the company has 5 megawatts of solar installed on commercial and residential roofs. Together with nuclear these carbon-free resources account for nearly 40% of the company’s generation capacity and will continue to decrease Entergy New Orleans’ carbon emissions which today are already nearly 40% below the national average.

Entergy Corporation has been an industry leader in voluntary climate action for more than two decades. In 2001 the company was the first U.S. electric utility to commit to voluntarily stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions. That goal has since been accelerated with a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

As a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation Diamond Offshore Wind its parents and affiliates bring decades of experience successfully developing constructing and operating major energy assets both domestically within the U.S. and internationally including seven commercial scale offshore wind projects and 13 offshore wind transmission projects.

Palisades Power Plant should not be eligible for the Civil Nuclear Credit Program a $6 billion fund created through the bipartisan infrastructure law the groups argued in a Friday letter addressed to U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and Department of Energy officials.

That's because Palisades shut down permanently in May according to its new owner Holtec International and former owner Entergy Nuclear. The federal program states nuclear power reactors must be projected to cease operations because of economic factors — which the environment groups argue doesn't include Palisades because it is no longer producing or selling electricity.

""It is unequivocally clear that the (program envisions) subsidizing only operating reactors under the Civil Nuclear Credit Program"" the letter from environmental groups states. ""The program simply does not contemplate funding a closed reactor that has terminated operations.""

The Michigan Sierra Club Michigan Wildlife Conservancy Northern Michigan Environmental Action Council and anti-nuclear groups across Michigan and the United States signed on to the letter.

Returning Palisades to the grid ""would be a major success story"" for Michigan and the U.S. because it would supply carbon-free power said Nick Culp Holtec senior manager of governmental affairs.

""We remain committed to working with our federal state and community partners throughout this process"" Culp said in an email. ""For the time being our employees at Palisades remain focused on the safe and timely decommissioning of the site allowing for potential reuse.""

The Civil Nuclear Credit Program was designed to help existing nuclear plants with subsidies that help them overcome the economic challenges nuclear power has faced since the price of natural gas dropped. To qualify for credits plant owners must demonstrate their plants are closing because of economic factors that the closures will result in increased air pollution and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must be able to provide ""reasonable assurance"" that the reactor can be operated with its current license and pose no significant safety hazards.

The prospect of returning Palisades to the power grid gained traction early this month after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's office announced Holtec had applied for Civil Nuclear Credit program funding in July. The company warned it also would need state funding to restart operations which Whitmer said she is prepared to support.

Whitmer a Democrat running for reelection normally is on the same side as environmentalists on many issues. But they have diverged on Palisades.

There are hurdles to reopening. Palisades shut down more than a week early in May as a ""a conservative decision based on equipment performance"" U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Public Affairs Officer Prema Chandrathil said at the time. The control rod drive mechanism had a degrading seal.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission transferred Palisades' license from Entergy to Holtec ""for the purpose of decommissioning Palisades"" on June 28 the NRC said. All fuel was removed from the reactor on June 13.

The NRC has never received a request to return a nuclear plant to the grid after it was permanently defueled so it is unclear what is in store for Holtec should it pursue a reopening of Palisades NRC Senior Public Affairs Officer Viktoria Mitlyng said.

""If the NRC receives such a formal request for reauthorizing operation of a nuclear power plant after the operator has formally notified the NRC of permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel – as is the case with Palisades – the agency will determine a path forward accordingly based on whatever facts and rationale are provided to ensure the highest standards of safety"" Mitlyng said in an email.

People gathered virtually and in South Haven on Thursday evening for a public hearing about Holtec's original plan for Palisades which was to decommission the plant. Although the meeting agenda was supposed to be tailored to a decommissioning plan the company filed in 2020 many attendees voiced their support or disdain for the company's recent effort to reopen.

Lynne Goodman who introduced herself during the hearing as a southeast Michigan resident and nuclear decommissioning consultant said reopening Palisades would reduce carbon emissions and other pollution that comes from coal- and natural gas-powered plants.

""My health is being impacted by that"" Goodman said. ""I really think that the plant should be considered for restart so we are putting less polluted air into the state of Michigan.""

Kevin Kamps a radioactive waste specialist with the anti-nuclear group Beyond Nuclear said regulators and the public had been swindled by Holtec which took over Palisades with the promise to decommission it.

""It's too bad we had to find out on Sept. 9 that Holtec had made application on July 5 for this federal bailout and is demanding a state bailout"" Kamps said. ""We're going to challenge all of this. We're going to challenge the bailouts. We're going to challenge the license.""

The Houston-based oil company — formerly known as Enron Oil & Gas Company before its separation from Enron in 1999 — just signed a renewal lease at Heritage Plaza that’s almost twice the size of the original lease it signed in 2007 according to the Houston Chronicle.

When EOG first settled at Brookfield Properties’ 52-story office tower at 1111 Bagby Street the company occupied about 200000 square feet. With the latest renewal the firm is set to occupy more than 375000 square feet of space Brookfield said.

Brookfield Properties has overseen several other large-scale efforts to upgrade existing office properties including a skybridge connection to the C. Baldwin hotel in the Allen Center campus. Skybridges were also a feature of Brookfield’s Houston Center development which is still under construction but already landed two big time tenants.

EOG Resources is one of the rare downtown firms requiring employees to come into the office full time as it transitioned from a hybrid schedule to a full-time.

Though leasing volume in the Bayou City remains below pre-pandemic levels gas and oil companies like BW Energy USA Management and Cheniere Energy — and now EOG — have all increased their office space by signing big-time leases in renovated facilities.

An affiliate of Sabet a Los Angeles-based and New York-based multifamily development firm led by Andre and Edward Sabetfard paid $14.3 million for the 0.5-acre property at 1600 Northeast Second Avenue records show. The site currently houses a 10700-square-foot commercial building that was completed in 1950.

The seller Miami Cash Register managed by President Eileen Myers Soler paid $410000 for the property in 1985. Miami Cash Register an office and point-of-sale equipment repair shop was headquartered in the building.

Ruben Ruban and Ashley Bloom with SVN Commercial Partners represented the seller. The property received seven offers since hitting the market in January and sold at the asking price Ruban and Bloom said.

The site has city approvals for a 25-story residential project with 250 units. It is in an Opportunity Zone which allows investors to achieve tax breaks by reinvesting capital gains into development projects in underserved neighborhoods. The site is also near a Miami-Dade Metromover station so the developers could seek bonuses for projects close to public transit. The property could also be redeveloped into an office building or hotel under the current zoning Ruban said.

Sabet is a family-owned commercial real estate development and management firm with more than 35 years of experience according to the company’s website. Sabet’s portfolio is mostly multifamily but the firm is in the “concept planning phase” of deciding what to build on the Arts & Entertainment District property Ruban and Bloom said.

“This is their first project in Miami and second in Florida” Bloom said. “Sabet is a family owned entity out of California and New York so this represents another sale where owners from those states are shifting to Florida.”

Sabet owns a multifamily project in Lake Mary Ruban said.

South Florida’s multifamily market has seen an influx of developers from other states looking to capitalize on the region’s booming rental demand and record rents.

During the first half of this year South Florida multifamily sales hit $5 billion the second-highest amount in a six-month period on record according to a Cushman & Wakefield report. Many buyers of multifamily projects and development sites are first-time buyers in South Florida Cushman found. “Out-of-state private capital investors will continue to dominate the market” the report states.

Berwyn Pennsylvania-based LCOR is among the new multifamily players setting up in the Arts & Entertainment District. In May the firm paid $49 million for a 1.1-acre vacant lot at 1775 Biscayne Boulevard where LCOR plans to build a 540-unit apartment tower.

Also in May Clearline Real Estate a New York-based developer led by former Kushner executive Jenny Bernell bought a 0.9-acre property at 1550 Northeast Miami Place for $19.8 million. The site has city approvals for a 240-story apartment project with 427 units but the height could be doubled as a bonus through a city public benefits program.",,,

The developers of the new apartment tower rising over the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul saved the best views for everyone.

The tenants were already moving into One Cathedral Square EQT Exeter’s new luxury apartment tower overlooking Logan Square when the developers and property manager The Bozzuto Group cut the ribbon on August 24th. But work crews were still in the midst of work on the most attractive feature of this 23-story tower.

Specifically its amenity floor.

Solomon Cordwell Buenz’s design for this building put the amenities on the top floor which means that every tenant in the building no matter where their apartment is located will be able to enjoy this view of the square:

That view can be had from the open-air terrace on the amenity floor.

The clubroom next to it shares the view.

So does the demonstration kitchen next to the clubroom which can accommodate a dinner party of 20.

Fitness center patrons will have a great view to the south and east that also includes the Ben Franklin Bridge — and even William Penn who rises just above Three Parkway.

The only amenity that lacks these great views is the co-working center which sits just up a slight ramp from the lobby. This makes sense — that view would be awfully distracting.

Instead the co-working center which includes a conference room looks out on a landscaped garden between this building and the back of the cathedral.

Gianni Parente regional investment officer at EQT Exeter explains that the garden is part of his firm’s master plan for the site which will envelop the cathedral. One Cathedral Square is the first of two apartment towers the company plans to build on land it has leased from the Archdiocese of Philadelphia for 150 years.

“The church thinks in centuries” says Parente. “We think in days and weeks.”

The apartments themselves are also very nicely outfitted. Most of the studios have an L-shaped floor plan that allows the sleeping area to function as a space apart from the main living area and kitchen.

All of the apartments have open main rooms that combine the living dining and cooking spaces. They also have nine-foot-high ceilings kitchens with quartz countertops and stainless-steel appliances smart entry systems and full-size in-unit washers and dryers. The building also offers ’round-the-clock concierge service and an Amazon package hub.

This tower sits where the cathedral’s rectory used to stand. The next one will occupy what’s now a parking lot between the cathedral’s chapel and the Holy Family Center. The plan is to surround the cathedral and chapel with a landscaped garden path that will also connect with Sister Cities Park across 18th Street. The company even used the same landscape architect who designed Sister Cities Park to do the Cathedral Square landscaping.

As part of the project the company is also landscaping a private prayer garden for the cathedral’s priests that will be locked gated and accessible from both the outside and within the cathedral.

EQT Exeter sees Cathedral Square as fitting a missing piece into the Parkway jigsaw puzzle. “The Mormon Church did a great job with the north side of Vine Street” says Parente “and this really felt like a critical piece to add more life to the lower Parkway.” Parente also notes that the building’s commercial space at the 17th and Vine intersection will bolster the activity that Victory Brewing Company Asia on the Parkway and Federal Donuts bring to the Parkway’s lower reaches.

“We have a couple of really exciting retail tenants interested in our space” he says.

EQT Exeter expects the amenity floor to be finished in early December. The co-working lounge is already ready for use.

Consumer Reports calls on credit bureaus to make free credit reports a permanent benefit for consumers.

By Lisa L. Gill

Update Sept. 23 2022: The thee major credit bureaus have now extended free weekly credit reports through 2023.

Original article: The three major credit bureaus Equifax Experian and TransUnion said in a joint statement that they will continue to offer consumers free credit reports on a weekly basis until April 20 2022 because of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Before the pandemic credit bureaus by law had to provide a single free report annually and could charge you about $20 each additional time you needed one.

The still-present need for consumers to have the key to their financial information is the reason for the extension. “None of us could have foreseen that the pandemic situation would last longer than a year” Frances Creighton president and CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association which represents the three credit bureaus told CR.

Credit reports which show whether you made on-time mortgage credit card auto loan or student loan payments are used by lenders to determine whether you’re a good credit risk. Even potential landlords cellular service providers and employers can review your report with your permission.

The information in them is also used to calculate your credit score that three-digit number that is meant to represent your creditworthiness.

Because changes in the report can happen almost daily getting a free report on a regular basis can help consumers monitor their information says Syed Ejaz a financial policy analyst at Consumer Reports.

Consumers can obtain copies of each of their reports via the AnnualCreditReport.com portal.

The credit reporting industry’s move comes on the heels of an unprecedented wave of consumer complaints made to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over errors found on credit reports Ejaz says.

According to CR’s recent analysis of the CFPB’s complaint database problems around credit report errors accounted for almost two-thirds of total complaints in 2020—up 23 percent from a year earlier.

In fact more people complained last year about the credit bureaus than they did about perennially problematic debt collection firms says Ed Mierzwinski senior director of federal consumer affairs program at U.S. PIRG a consumer advocacy and policy organization. Problems with debt collectors were just 12 percent of complaints the CFPB collected last year.

Errors are common: A 2012 Federal Trade Commission report found that up to one-quarter of credit reports contain at least one mistake. A CR nationally representative survey of 2223 U.S. adults in January 2021 (PDF) found that 12 percent of Americans who have ever checked their credit report say they found at least one error in their report the last time they checked.

Errors can include everything from incorrect address information to more serious problems such as loans that are listed multiple times paid-off loans that appear as still open or information about other people’s accounts that show up on your report Ejaz says.

In a separate CR panel of consumers last year participants described a range of mistakes on their reports: One man discovered his mortgage was listed twice—something his bank promised to fix but hadn’t after months. Another said his report showed his son’s account information. Yet another learned an unpaid cable bill had gone into collections in Georgia—a state that person had never lived in.

All such errors can negatively affect a person’s credit score Ejaz says.

Errors could be a particular problem for people who deferred loan payments with lenders or credit card companies says Bruce McClary a senior vice president at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling a nonprofit organization that helps consumers rebuild their credit.



The Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act passed last May required companies providing federally backed mortgages and student loans to offer deferrals while still reporting to a credit bureau that the loan is current. Voluntarily some credit card companies and auto lenders also offered deferrals. But in some cases deferred loan payments were still reported as being late—all the more reason to keep a close eye on your credit information Ejaz says.

Making Credit Reports Free Forever

Some consumer advocates believe credit reports should be permanently free. “There is no good reason consumers should be charged at all to access their own data” Ejaz says.

“There’s nothing I can think of that would legally or logistically prevent the Big Three credit bureaus from making free weekly reports permanent” says Chi Chi Wu an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center who focuses on consumer credit issues.

CR advocates yesterday called on the credit bureaus to make free credit reports permanent and to take steps to improve the accuracy of credit reports. One potential fix Ejaz says is for the agencies to ensure that any supporting documentation a consumer submits in an automated dispute filing is also considered in the bureau’s review of their case.

“Credit bureaus are supposed to look at all accompanying documents when a consumer files a dispute but they very often don’t” Ejaz says. That’s because the task of reviewing disputes is often outsourced and the bureaus typically accept the results of the outsourced investigation without questioning the accuracy of the findings he adds.

Another way to avoid errors Ejaz says is for credit bureaus to be required to ensure that all nine digits of a Social Security number associated with a payment or loan match the Social Security number on a person’s credit report. Currently bureaus typically match only seven of the nine digits Wu says.

How to Dispute Errors in a Credit Report

File a dispute with each of the three credit bureaus. That’s because Equifax Experian and TransUnion are separate companies that don’t communicate with one another.

Send a letter via certified U.S. Postal Service mail. And keep copies for yourself. The idea is to create an old-fashioned paper trail to make it easier to confirm that the credit bureaus follow the lawful time lines. Avoid filing disputes online experts says because often credit bureaus have standardized forms that might force you to oversimplify your situation.

Include any evidence. Account statements or information on payments made can protect you from a credit bureau dismissing your claim because of a lack of sufficient backup information. If you resubmit a claim with the evidence later on it can be denied if the claim is considered similar to previous ones.

If your dispute is denied consider hiring an experienced attorney to file suit. The Fair Credit Reporting Act provides consumer protections around lawsuits against credit bureaus. If a company is found to be in violation of FCRA law your legal fees will be covered.

Consider adding a personal statement to your report. You can do this at any time and doing so can be help explain your situation to a potential lender. McClary says banks and other institutions will typically read and consider these while making a decision about your creditworthiness and having one can be a good idea especially if you’ve lost a dispute and have a negative item that remains on your report.

Did you win your dispute? Ask the bureau to send out updated credit reports. These go to anyone who has checked yours in the past six months if you request it.

“The bidding wars created a sense of panic” says Thomas who works in human resources at Amazon Web Services. “Then mortgage rates started to go up and now [in July] we have a greater sense of urgency to buy before rates go higher.”

Like other prospective buyers Thomas and Shekhar a market researcher for AARP face a good-news/bad-news sit­ua­tion. While higher rates lowered their price range from $1.8 million to $1.4 million they face less competition and aren’t as likely to see exponential price escalations.

Home sales in the Washington region slowed in recent months as higher mortgage rates and economic uncertainty pushed some buyers out of the market. While there’s not an overabundance of homes for sale the limited inventory that created a hot seller’s market appears to have bottomed out. Prices continue to rise but at a more moderate pace.

“While some pockets of the area will still be hot we’ll see a more normal market this fall” says Suzanne DesMarais a real-estate agent at Compass in DC. “It won’t be a buyer’s market but we’ll start to see some normal things happening like offers contingent on a home inspection.”

Quick Market Shift

The gap in inventory gave sellers almost complete control over the housing market for years says Bic DeCaro an agent with eXp Realty in Great Falls: “Almost overnight that just stopped when mortgage rates went up. It went from multiple offers to a few offers to often just one.”

DeCaro points out that this is healthy though sellers may need to readjust to home inspections and other contingencies. “This abrupt shift from a really crazy market isn’t that scary for people who have been in real estate a long time” she says “but it feels that way to people who only know the way the market has been the last few years.”

Homes still sell quickly often within days she explains if priced to their value.

“As soon as the market shifted buyers began to get really picky about the condition of a home” says Melinda Estridge an agent with Long & Foster in Bethesda. “Now that rates are higher a lot of buyers had to lower their price range a little bit and that makes them more concerned that they get the best value they can.”

Homes in the $600000-to–$1.2 million range continue to receive at least a few offers if they’re in prime condition says Estridge: “Now buyers can circle back if a property hasn’t sold in a couple of weeks because they know it won’t sell for above the asking price. This market offers an opportunity for buyers once they adjust to a 5- or 6-percent mortgage rate.”

The slight softening in the market means that those with older homes may have a harder time selling them especially if they’re not updated says DesMarais: “It used to be that buyers wanted a middle-priced house to improve but now those are so hard to sell. But in some neighborhoods like Chevy Chase we’ll still see escalation clauses for very high-quality homes that are in excellent condition.”

Thomas who is working with Caroline Aslan of the Melinda Estridge Group part of Long & Foster Real Estate in Bethesda says she and her husband want to stay in Chevy Chase and are relieved to see that homes are now receiving a few offers instead of more than a dozen.

Buyers Who Are Also Sellers Benefit

For Paul Sathrum and Franco Russo the slightly slower housing market in the spring made it easier for them to transition from a condo in Columbia Heights to a single-family home in North Brentwood between Hyattsville and Mount Rainier.

“Even though we bought after rates went up we probably got a better price on the house than we would have because there was only one other bid” says Sathrum a teacher.

Russo a senior program officer at the World Bank says they received a quick full-price offer for their condo. The couple worked with DesMarais and her team for both transactions and purchased in the $750000-to-$800000 range.

Strength in the DMV

While the market can differ from one neighborhood to another DeCaro points out that our region continues to have job opportunities and a limited supply of homes which will keep values steady.

“The DC market is active and well situated with the government and businesses” says Estridge. “It’s not likely to take a hit unless mortgage rates go up to 7 or 8 percent but that’s not likely to happen.”

Estridge anticipates that the spring 2023 market will be a good time to sell because buyers will have adjusted to higher mortgage rates and prices should be steady.

Says DeCaro: “This isn’t like it was in 2008 and 2009 when lending was irresponsible and people were buying property without a down payment or any loan documentation. Now people have home equity and lenders are more cautious so we’re not likely to see steep price drops.”

While first-time buyers are typically the hardest-hit by higher mortgage rates DesMarais says higher rates are also causing residential investors to hesitate. That could free up more inventory for other buyers.

“This isn’t a buyer’s market—it’s just a normal balanced market” says De­Caro. “The big change now is just that buyers aren’t getting the bad end of the stick anymore.”

New data from marketing and technology company WPIC shows brands including Estée Lauder Olay and La Mer have been longtime front-runners on the platform while CeraVe is a newer entrant having only entered the top 10 following a significant push in the middle of 2021.

Dr. Jart which Lauder acquired in 2019 as one of the beauty giant’s first acquisitions of Asia-based beauty brands recently fell out of the top 20 ranking while Lauder-owned Too Faced shut down its storefront on the platform in July.

According to Jacob Cooke chief executive officer and founder at WPIC this list could look significantly different in the next five years. Because Chinese consumers are becoming increasingly interested in clean beauty large manufacturers who don’t invest in such offerings will struggle to compete with smaller indie brands which are increasingly carving out market share said Cooke.

THE DETAILS The beauty company announced price hikes on its higher end products this spring with rising costs threatening profits. However CEO Tarang Amin stated he made a bet to keep prices fixed on the lower cost items.

Speaking to The WSJ he said “We didn’t touch a third of our items.” These included lipsticks mascaras and eyelash wands.

THE WHY? The rising cost of inflation has hit the industry hard however Amin stated that the strategy to keep low-cost items cheaper will remain even in the face of an ongoing rise.

“We wanted to be sure there was an entry into e.l.f. if someone was on a budget constraint” said Amin."

French cable supplier Nexans has secured a contract from Ørsted and Eversource to deliver subsea cable for the Revolution Wind Farm in the US.

This is the second time Nexans has won the contract for the supply of its export cable system to the 704MW wind farm.

In March this year the company received the first order for installing and protecting the export cable link for the wind facility.

Located more than 24km south of Rhode Island and around 51km east of the Connecticut coast the project will link to the US’ onshore grid.

Construction works at the site are expected to start next year and the project is expected to be fully operational in 2025.

The wind farm will generate enough power to meet the needs of more than 350000 homes and offset nearly one million tonnes of carbon pollution.

Purdue University and Duke Energy will host the next installments of the “Understanding Tomorrow’s Nuclear Energy” lecture series during October.

Maria Korsnick president and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute will present “A New Landscape for New Nuclear” from 3:30-4:30 p.m. ET on Oct. 5 in Stewart Center’s Fowler Hall.

Director-General William D. Magwood IV of the Nuclear Energy Agency will present “The 21st Century Nuclear Resurgence: Opportunities and Challenges” from 3-4 p.m. ET on Oct. 24 in the Purdue Memorial Union’s North and South Ballrooms.

Both events will be livestreamed and registration is required for both in-person and virtual attendance.

Maria Korsnick and “A New Landscape for New Nuclear”

Drawing on her engineering background hands-on experience in reactor operations and a deep knowledge of energy policy and regulatory issues Korsnick aims to increase understanding of nuclear energy’s economic and environmental benefits among policymakers and the public. Before joining NEI she was senior vice president of Northeast Operations for Exelon Corp. responsible for overseeing operation of the Calvert Cliffs 1 and 2 R.E. Ginna and Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 nuclear power plants.

Korsnick’s “A New Landscape for New Nuclear” will look at how world leaders across the political spectrum are recognizing that adding reliable scalable carbon-free nuclear energy generation is crucial to addressing climate and energy security needs. As demand for the technology grows nuclear is now on the same playing field as other carbon-free sources like wind and solar — ready to reduce emissions and support the clean energy grid of the future.

William D. Magwood and “The 21st Century Nuclear Resurgence: Opportunities and Challenges”

With extensive experience in both the regulatory and developmental aspects of nuclear energy including at the international level Magwood has served in his current role at the NEA since 2014. He previously was one of the five commissioners to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and was director of the U.S. government’s civilian nuclear energy program at the U.S. Department of Energy.

Magwood’s “The 21st Century Nuclear Resurgence: Opportunities and Challenges” will review the factors and considerations that have led to a surge in interest in nuclear energy around the world the likes of which has not been seen since the beginning of the nuclear energy era more than 60 years ago. He will highlight the issues that could lead to failure if not quickly and adequately addressed and to the structural barriers that will require new thinking by regulators and policymakers in many countries if success is to be within our reach.

Purdue University and Duke Energy are jointly exploring the feasibility of using advanced nuclear energy to meet the West Lafayette campus community’s long-term energy needs. The study is focused on whether power produced through Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) could be a potential fit for Purdue’s energy needs.

They are allowed to go out during this period but they cannot visit high-risk places such as bars and restaurants.

Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu announced the lifting of hotel quarantine on Friday afternoon scrapping some of the world’s toughest travel restrictions. The new measure is set to begin on Monday.

Some residents on Friday told the Post that they had already reserved visits to Japan and Singapore ahead of the long-awaited move amid rumours of the policy change last week despite a recent surge in flight ticket prices while others said they had faced technical issues on Cathay’s website after news of the measure broke.

Eager Hong Kong travellers are scrambling to book overseas trips while the city’s flagship carrier Cathay Pacific has planned more flights after the government announced that it would end mandatory hotel quarantine for arrivals.

Inbound travellers will also no longer be required to obtain a negative result on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test 48 hours before boarding. Instead they will be allowed to take a self-administered rapid antigen test (RAT) within 24 hours of their departure.

Currently travellers follow a “3+4” arrangement under which they spend three days in hotel isolation and four at home under medical surveillance.

Travel sites reported an increase in searches and bookings before and after authorities announced the lifting of curbs which came as popular destinations like Japan and Taiwan also unveiled plans to remove most of their border control measures from mid-October.

Searches for flights increased by almost 100 per cent on Trip.com’s local website compared with last week according to Eddy Yip Cheuk-ming the platform’s e-commerce lead for Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Yip said Tokyo was the top destination for Hong Kong residents as bookings increased 650 per cent as of Friday afternoon compared with last week. Other popular places included Bangkok and Singapore which saw a 200 per cent and 100 per cent increase in bookings respectively.

He added the number of users viewing flights from midnight to 3.45pm on Friday rose 120 times compared with the same period last week overlapping with when the government revealed details of its latest measure.

Lavinia Rajaram Asia head of public relations for the Expedia Group said average daily searches to Taiwan on the travel website grew by 55 per cent in the last seven days compared with the average for the last 28 days.

She added that searches to Taiwan also grew by 175 per cent on Thursday when it revealed plans for border relaxation compared with the previous day.

Flight searches for Japan on Expedia’s site surged close to 966 per cent on Thursday when the country announced visa-free entry for individual travellers from October 11 in comparison to the previous 14-day average Rajaram said.

After the government revealed details of its latest plan to remove hotel quarantine Cathay Pacific experienced high traffic on its website with an estimated wait time totalling more than 20 minutes on Friday evening.

A spokesperson for the airline said the carrier intended to add more than 200 pairs of passenger flights in October to both regional and long-haul destinations.

Daily flights to Tokyo’s Haneda airport will also re-start from November 1 while flights to Sapporo will resume at a frequency of four times weekly from December 1 the spokesperson added.

Among the travellers who booked trips in advance was 29-year-old Sindy Lam who will spend one week in Tokyo.

She paid around HK$7000 for round trip Cathay Pacific tickets in November higher than the average HK$4000 before the pandemic.

She said the city’s policy change was a pleasant surprise as she was previously preparing for a three-day hotel quarantine.

Estel Marquino 23 who is from Spain and works in marketing booked a last-minute trip to Taipei for October several hours after city leader Lee’s announcement.

“I wanted to travel before the announcement but because of [the three-day hotel quarantine] I couldn’t” said Marquino who has lived in the city for almost two years. “It’s not worth it if I have to pay for the three-day quarantine myself.”

She added it was her first weekend trip since moving to Hong Kong as she never got a chance to visit nearby cities due to pandemic restrictions.

But a 40-year-old resident who works in the banking industry said he gave up on booking a flight to Tokyo on Cathay Pacific’s website while the announcement was ongoing.

“I logged onto [Cathay’s website] at 3.45pm and spent an hour trying to book a return flight to Japan before giving up. [The] payment was never authorised” said the resident who wished to remain anonymous. “[It’s] very frustrating because seats are available.”

Tommy Tam Kwong-shun chairman of the Society of IATA Passenger Agents a coalition of the largest travel agencies in Hong Kong said he expected an up to 30 per cent increase in outbound travel by the end of 2022.

“Quite a number of foreign carriers like All Nippon Airways British Airways and our home-based carriers have already introduced or are planning to resume or increase their flights to and from Hong Kong” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50b2RheW9ubGluZS5jb20vc2luZ2Fwb3JlL3RyYXZlbC13ZWJzaXRlcy1maXJtcy1zZWUtc3Bpa2UtZW5xdWlyaWVzLWZvbGxvd2luZy1qYXBhbnMtbW92ZS1lYXNlLXRvdXJpc3QtcmVzdHJpY3Rpb25zLTIwMDE3MzbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travel websites firms see spike in enquiries following Japan's move to ease tourist restrictions,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50b2RheW9ubGluZS5jb20vc2luZ2Fwb3JlL3RyYXZlbC13ZWJzaXRlcy1maXJtcy1zZWUtc3Bpa2UtZW5xdWlyaWVzLWZvbGxvd2luZy1qYXBhbnMtbW92ZS1lYXNlLXRvdXJpc3QtcmVzdHJpY3Rpb25zLTIwMDE3MzbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EB49000>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

You know the facts: Homeownership has been replaced by rental agreements flatshares are more common than family units and suburban homes have given way to (very) small city apartments. “Today square footage is at such a premium the idea of having a guest room feels like a luxury from the Gilded Age” Sarah adds. When you get less space for your money prioritization becomes key. It’s something design advisor and WeIncontro founder Helena Agustí knows all too well. Her unique eye for decoration has made the homes she’s lived in real Instagram candy. When she searched for a new rental last year a space to host guests was at the top of her want list.

“I wanted a place that felt cozy and warm and had outdoor space” Helena says. “My current apartment ticked all the boxes except for the guest room but I realized that the other priorities were more important. You can’t have it all! My home feels perfect for me right now—but if there was an extra room even if really tiny I would never ever move again.”

Until last year Helena lived in a gorgeous apartment that doubled as the headquarters for her agency. Guests would sleep on a comfy sofa in the living room. Photo: Helena Agustí POV: You’re a guest in Helena’s old apartment and you’re sleeping in her colorful living room-cum-dining room-cum-guest room. Photo: Helena Agustí

But those who have that luxurious second room often find uses for it that are far from the traditional guest room especially as a consequence of the pandemic lifestyle shift. “Even post-pandemic we’re doing lots of things at home: Making art and playing music exercising working cooking from scratch—and we need storage for all the gear that goes with that” Sarah explains. “In my experience that often means space for guests gets sacrificed.” We’ve not only brought the office home but also the leisure: From glam rooms to sex rooms private recreational spaces are also the new normal. It’s an idea that permeates not only small city dwellings but also bigger ones.

Alex Delaunay founder of architecture firm Sabo has worked on all types of projects from small apartments to bigger ones with a focus on spaces that can be transformed. In one of his most recent commissions for a place of 3000 square feet the designated guest room was meant to be more than that: “It’s conceived as a multipurpose room. The client also wanted to use it as an art room so we designed a Murphy bed that flips up. The use of the space is not scripted; it’s more flexible and less purpose-driven which makes it more appealing.”

A view of Helena’s tiny penthouse. “Although there’s no space for a guest room my place is so cozy that when friends stay over they never want to leave!” Photo: Helena Agustí

Giving a spare room a fun use might actually be a bonus for guests to sleep there. “An extravagant art room or retreat can be a quite special place to sleep in as a guest and even more attractive than a standard bedroom—especially if you’re also thinking of renting it occasionally on Airbnb” Alex adds. At the end of the day what counts is not so much where the guests sleep but how welcome they feel. As Helena who shares her bed when a guest comes over says: “We’ve become more flexible with our expectations as guests and more transparent with what we can offer as hosts. My place is so tiny but it feels like a real home so when people visit they don’t want to leave! It’s about making them feel cozy.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2Jlc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjMvd2FyZWhvdXNlcy1maWxsZWQtdG8tY2FwYWNpdHktYXJlLXRoZS1uZXctbm9ybWFsL9IBWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2Jlc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjMvd2FyZWhvdXNlcy1maWxsZWQtdG8tY2FwYWNpdHktYXJlLXRoZS1uZXctbm9ybWFsLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warehouses Filled to Capacity Are the New Normal,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='store.globest.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /Registration/Login.aspx?mode=token&ucid=94221e3f-a910-47e5-a4b0-5240a57bd10b&source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.globest.com%2F2022%2F09%2F23%2Fwarehouses-filled-to-capacity-are-the-new-normal%2F%3Fslreturn%3D20240413061836&debug=lawDomainIPWithRefRedirectAnon (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EAE1180>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2Jlc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjMvd2FyZWhvdXNlcy1maWxsZWQtdG8tY2FwYWNpdHktYXJlLXRoZS1uZXctbm9ybWFsL9IBWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2Jlc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjMvd2FyZWhvdXNlcy1maWxsZWQtdG8tY2FwYWNpdHktYXJlLXRoZS1uZXctbm9ybWFsLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUva2l0Y2hlbi1vcmdhbml6YXRpb24tcHJvZHVjdHMtdW5kZXItMjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,25 of the best kitchen organization products on Amazon for under $25,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUva2l0Y2hlbi1vcmdhbml6YXRpb24tcHJvZHVjdHMtdW5kZXItMjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EAE2BC0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Oil and gas companies may commit to net zero goals in public - but internal emails tell a different story.

A US congressional investigation into climate disinformation has revealed over 200 pages of in-house messages between lobbyists and Shell Chevron and ExxonMobil employees.

In these internal memos personnel question their own environmental commitments and joke about climate collapse.

Politicians and campaigners have slammed the companies for their “deception.”

“These revelations are the latest evidence that oil giants keep lying about their commitments to solve the climate crisis and should never be trusted by policymakers” said Richard Wiles president of the Center for Climate Integrity.

“If there is one thing consistent about the oil and gas majors’ position on climate it’s their utter inability to tell the truth.”

So what do the emails reveal? Here are four questions that the documents answer.

Are oil companies committed to the Paris Agreement and net zero?

Exxon is publicly committed to the Paris Agreement to keep global heating under 1.5 degrees Celsius.

But in August 2019 Exxon’s chief Executive Darren Woods sent out a memo urging an industry lobby group to remove a reference to the climate treaty from a draft sustainability announcement.

Such a reference “could create a potential commitment to advocate on the Paris agreement goals” the executive warned.

The trove of emails also throw Shell’s net zero commitments into question.

Please do not give the impression that Shell is willing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels that do not make business sense. Shell PR Guidance slide 2019

The oil major has pledged to become net zero by 2050. But internal 2020 PR guidance calls on employees to frame a net zero goal as “a collective ambition for the world” rather than a “Shell goal or target”.

“Please do not give the impression that Shell is willing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels that do not make business sense” reads a Shell PR guidance slide.

“Shell has no immediate plans to move to a net-zero emissions portfolio over our investment horizon of 10-20 years.”

Shell BP and Exxonmobil have all had internal emails seized as part of the investigation. AFP

Do oil companies believe in their own sustainable technology?

Exxon has promoted algae-based biofuels as a key tool in the energy transition.

The multinational company has spent $70 million (€70 million) on research and advertising for the fuel which would be generated from genetically modified algae species.

One 2021 advert claims “we want something that will grow really fast so that we can make a lot of fuel.”

However a leaked 2018 presentation conceded the technology is “[s]till decades away from the scale we need.”

After discussing using the word ‘abundant’ in algae advertising a public affairs manager warned that it could create “angst” with researchers.

Other fossil fuel companies have invested heavily in carbon capture and storage a technology that pulls emissions from the air and injects them deep into the earth.

A Shell executive told colleagues “we want to be careful to not talk about CCUS [carbon capture utilisation and storage] as prolonging the life of oil gas or fossil fuels writ large.”

But for BP the main goal of this technology is to “enable the full use of fossil fuels across the energy transition and beyond” the captured emails reveal.

What do oil companies think of climate activists?

In 2019 Shell invited prominent climate scientist Peter Kalmus to speak at a conference.

But after they viewed his presentation the invite was rescinded.

After negative coverage Shell’s climate change adviser David Hone said those who invited a climate scientist “didn’t do their due diligence.”

Also in 2019 Shell’s press officer Curtis Smith sent an email wishing ‘bedbugs’ upon the Sunrise Movement a youth-led US climate group.

Why are oil companies getting rid of some of their most polluting plants?

Shell has sold off many of its worst emitting facilities.

“No one in the company has said this but the pattern is pretty clear” Shell employee Steve Lesher wrote in a 2021 email.

ADVERTISEMENT

“If you’re a major greenhouse gas emitter and particularly if you operate in a GHG-sensitive area like (California Washington) or (Canada) your days in the Shell family are probably numbered.”

However the emails suggest that this sell-off approach isn’t applied worldwide.

“Where we DO own high GHG (Greenhouse gas) intensive things it’s in areas where they aren’t that politically sensitive about such matters: China Singapore Malaysia Louisiana” Lesher wrote.

Speaking to the Guardian an Exxon spokesperson slammed the “selective” publication of emails and reiterated the company’s commitment to the 2015 Paris climate deal.

A Shell spokesman said it was making “extensive efforts” to take part in the energy transition and was committed to becoming a “net zero energy business.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMi0wOS0yMy9sZWFrZWQtc3R1ZHktc2F5cy1leHhvbi1wYXJ0bmVycy1vdmVyc3BlbnQtYnktMTM4LWJpbGxpb24tb24tb2lsLWdhcy1wcm9qZWN0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leaked Study Says Exxon Partners Overspent by $138 Billion on Oil Gas Projects,"Why did this happen?

Industry analysts in aggregate predict the S&P 500 will see a price increase of 25.7% over the next twelve months. This percentage is based on the difference between the bottom-up target price and the closing price for the index as of yesterday (September 22). The bottom-up target price is calculated by aggregating the median target price estimates (based on company-level estimates submitted by industry analysts) for all the companies in the index. On September 22 the bottom-up target price for the S&P 500 was 4724.28 which was 25.7% above the closing price of 3757.99.

After falling for six straight months the bottom-up target price has stabilized over the past two months. From January 31 through July 29 the bottom-up target price decreased by 11.1% (to 4727.51 from 5319.28). From July 29 through September 22 the bottom-up target price has stayed within a range of 4720 to 4750.

At the sector level the Communication Services (+37.6%) Information Technology (+31.3%) and Real Estate (+30.8%) sectors are expected to see the largest price increases as these three sectors had the largest upside differences between the bottom-up target price and the closing price on September 22. On the other hand the Utilities (+10.3%) and Consumer Staples (+14.2%) sectors are expected to see the smallest price increases as these two sectors had the smallest upside differences between the bottom-up target price and the closing price on September 22.

At the company level the ten stocks in the S&P 500 with the largest upside and downside differences between their median target price and closing price (on September 22) can be found below. It is interesting to note that only 12 stocks in the S&P 500 had a median target price that was lower than their closing price on September 22. Five of these twelve stocks are in the Consumer Staples sector.

How accurate have the industry analysts been in predicting the future value of the S&P 500?

In recent months industry analysts have overestimated the closing price by large margins. On September 30 2021 the bottom-up target price was 5049.43. Nearly one year later (on September 22 2022) the S&P 500 closing price was 3757.99. Based on yesterday’s closing price industry analysts overestimated the closing price at the end of September 2022 by about 34% nearly one-year ago.

Over the past five to ten years industry analysts on average have been within 1% the closing price of the index 12 months later. Over the past five years Industry analysts have underestimated the price of the index by 0.7% on average (using month-end values). Over the past ten years industry analysts have overestimated the price of the index by 0.1% on average (using month-end values).

Over longer time periods analysts have typically overestimated the closing price 12 months later. Over the past fifteen years industry analysts have overestimated the price of the index by 8.2% on average (using month-end values). Over the past twenty years industry analysts have overestimated the price of the index by 9.7% on average (using month-end values).

The plans will require large increases in government borrowing and have raised expectations that the Bank of England will need to raise interest rates even more aggressively to stop inflation.

Danny Gallagher

The great Hank Kingsley fromonce called being a late night host's sidekick ""a dying art"" but Guillermo Rodriguez the parking lot attendant turned sidekick for ABC'sis bringing it back from the dead.""The show it's fun for me and it's great"" Rodriguez says. ""Jimmy is a great guy. He's a great boss. I'm blessed to have a job working for him.""Rodriguez has been on the show almost since its premiere in 2003. A few months into the late night show former Mighty Mighty Bosstones singer and then-show announcer Dicky Barrett caught Rodriguez who was then working as a parking lot attendant for the studio sleeping in his car. Barrett told Kimmel about it and the host said ""We got to put this guy in the show"" according to an interview with Rodriguez last year inmagazineKimmel has taken his show from his homebase in Los Angeles to his original hometown of Brooklyn for a week of shows at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for three of the last six years. The show frequently sends Rodriguez across the country for remote segments that usually involve drinking and eating the local cuisine.Rodriguez came to the State Fair of Texas on Tuesday to be one of the first to try some of the new foods that are finalists in the Big Tex Choice Awards. It's all part of his weeklong trip on the ""Guillermobile"" a large orange tour bus that has a huge picture of Rodriguez's face emblazoned on both sides.""I get to meet a lot of people I get to eat different types of food and everybody is so nice to me"" Rodriguez says. ""It's nice. It's great. I always gain weight on this trip.""Rodriguez started on the show as more of a correspondent and a co-sidekick to Kimmel's beloved Uncle Frank Potenza a former New York City police officer known for his extreme generosity. As with Rodriguez Kimmel made Potenza famous as he sent him to interview celebrities. Potenza became known as an affable personality who often gave people (including celebrities) cash right out of his pocket. He became so popular that when he died in 2011honored him with a featured obituary with a photo alongside his nephew.""He was really a sweet guy"" Rodriguez says of Potenza. ""He was always making sure you had lunch making sure you ate and that you drank water and had coffee. He used to take me out to eat and I was about to pay and he'd go [imitating Uncle Frank] ""Guillermo no I got it. Don't worry. You have a family. I'm retired. Don't worry. I'll take care of it.""Now Rodriguez stands off to the side of the camera every night during Kimmel's show still in the parking attendant uniform he wore before he became a 21st-century Larry ""Bud"" Melman the lovable cackling sidekick from NBC'sKimmel religiously watched and recorded Letterman's show during his teenage years in Las Vegas.Kimmel usually sends Rodriguez to do the remote segments that he doesn't want to do himself like playing a scary game of soccer on the roof of the show's El Capitan Theater with Brazilian superstar soccer player Neymar Jr.; climbing to the very top of the Empire State Building in New York City; or riding the SkySlide a clear plexiglass slide that projects from the 70th floor of the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles.""It was the show's idea"" Rodriguez says referring to the SkySlide stunt. ""They offered it to [Kimmel] and he said 'Oh yeah Guillermo would love to do that.' He likes to mess with me but it's fun.""One of the show's other annual traditions is to send Rodriguez into the press pit on the other side of the red carpet at the Academy Awards. There he's known to sneak in tequila to the guests and even a kiss with some famous women.""I think my favorite thing I got to do was when I did the red carpet for the Oscars"" Rodriguez says ""and I got to kiss Charlize Theron and Scarlett Johansson.""His most recent remote in Dallas was the third time he visited the city before Kimmel's Brooklyn shows. The first happened in 2018 when he got to sample the epic ribs at Lockhart Smokehouse. He returned the following year to take a taste test of Mariano’s Hacienda's menu Rodriguez says he had no idea what he'd be eating at the State Fair. A bit of fear crossed his eyes when we told him that some of the possible items might be something called the ""Peanut Butter Paradise"" or a deep-fried BLT sandwich.""I think that's too much"" he said with a laugh. ""I gotta pace myself.""Rodriguez notes that it's worth gaining another pound of two on the road because he enjoys the celebrity the show affords him especially ""when some people see me they tell me 'You made my day.'""""This is a blessing"" Rodriguez says. ""This is the American dream. I never thought I was going to be on TV but thanks to Jimmy and all the writers and everybody working at the show. It's just a blessing.""",,,,,,,,,

The rising interest rates — the Federal Reserve upped them again Wednesday — had the legislative budget committee learning “the risk of a recession in the next 18 months” is 50% higher than in June.

That’s according to the economic forecast presented Thursday by the governor’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting. The usual suspects were blamed: fallout from the war in Ukraine ongoing inflation and the Fed tightening its monetary policy even as its chair Jerome H. Powell acknowledges that increasing rates “will also bring some pain to households and businesses.”

There’s always something new each week with the Colorado economy. And we’ll dive into how Coloradans are coping with higher prices below. But first let’s look at how rising mortgage rates are affecting the local housing market.

>> Read the Colorado Economic & Fiscal Outlook report

Colorado houses cost more … or less

If this were 2019 the for-sale housing market in Colorado would be considered booming. Sellers are getting about 40% more than what they would have if they had sold their house three years ago. And even with the market cooling this year the median price of a house sold in August was 10% higher than a year ago.

But higher interest rates did seem to affect potential buyers borrowing money to buy one. Interest rates for a 30-year-fixed loan were 6.62% on Friday up from 6.35% from a week earlier according to Mortgage News Daily. The Fed has raised rates five times this year or a total of three percentage points. That includes three consecutive months of three-quarter point increases a historically high increase for one meeting. In early June the same 30-year mortgage rate was 5.55%.

Bankers had adjusted rates because the increases were anticipated so rates didn’t go up the same percent overnight said Matt Leprino head of real estate brokerage Remingo in Denver.

“I wouldn’t expect that today it’s three-quarters of a point more expensive to buy a house than it was yesterday” Leprino said. “But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t affect buyer confidence.”

Buyers are no longer snapping up houses within 12 days of hitting the market in Denver. They’re waiting 21 days. They’re not paying more than the seller originally asked for. Take a look at the home sales for August between 2017 to 2022:

Leprino being a Realtor sees a bright side.

“I hate it when people say the market is crashing because what I always will respond is: ‘To whom?’” Leprino said. “It’s a great great opportunity. It’s better than it’s been in three years for buyers. Yes interest rates are higher and prices are not as low as they used to be. However people don’t have to pay above asking anymore and so it’s an opportunity for them to get in now. Yes interest rates are higher than they were. But again from a historic perspective five five and a quarter it’s a really good interest rate.”

According to data from the Colorado Association of Realtors the average seller is getting 99% of what they priced the house for compared with 102% a year ago in Denver and the state.

But median sales prices have also dipped each month this year since May according to the organization’s data. Between May and August the median sales price in Colorado fell 4.8% and 4.6% in Denver.

That’s the reverse of what happened in the past two years when prices rose or stayed flat between May and August. But normally Leprino said median prices do decline over the summer as families try to get their move done before school starts.

“It would be irresponsible of me to say (rising interest rates) had nothing to do with it and I’m sure it did to a certain extent” he said. “But looking at it from a historic perspective prices are always lower in August. … It’s just seasonality in our market.”

Gas prices switch gears and go up

Gas prices hit their above $5-a-gallon peak in June before starting to fall back down to something a little more palatable in July. They dropped below $4 a gallon in Colorado. Then someone noticed they were back up again this week ending a streak of declines “just short of 100 days” The New York Times reported.

AAA now has Colorado’s per-gallon prices at $3.753 for regular which is up 8 cents from last week. (Anyone get gas for under $3? I found a service station selling gas for $2.88 — in Greenwood Village no less!)

So what happened? AAA says unplanned maintenance work at refineries on the West Coast and Midwest are partly to blame. That aggravated a tight supply. However if supply returns gas prices could come down the organization said.

So long sub-$3 per gallon of gasoline. The low price was gone a day after filling up at the Shell station in Greenwood Village on Sept. 6 2022. (Tamara Chuang The Colorado Sun)

How Coloradans are coping with inflation

What’s Working asked readers how much does life cost you nowadays. And readers responded!

“Hamburgers at my favorite restaurant went up at least 30%” said one person who filled out What’s Working’s cost of living survey.

“M&M chocolate candies from $2.99 a bag to $3.99 a bag. That is ridiculous” said Terry from Fort Collins. (That’s also a 33% increase which is higher than the rate of inflation.)

“I used to be able to buy milk for around $2.49 now it’s over $3.00” said Debi from Denver.

“Bacon doubled in price all food items have gone up. Even candy has gone up. I can’t afford” wrote Diane Stone.

Notice the trend here? A lot of folks commented about the cost of food. And overall food took a hit if you were to look at the results from our completely unscientific survey taken by 53 people: 47% cut back on eating out and at the grocery store.

In August food prices were up 1% compared to last year according to the Consumer Price Index for Midwestern states which includes Colorado. For the year they’re up 12.9% the largest increase since February 1979 reported the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some food categories that saw the largest increases compared to a year ago:

“Other” food at home which includes sugar sweets oils: up 19.3%

Cereal and bakery products: up 17.7%

Meat poultry fish and eggs: up 11%

Food away from home up 9.3%

“Getting fast food for my teenage daughter and I runs at least $20 now so I can definitely prepare a great meal and have leftovers for lunch for less than that” wrote Erin Hutchinson in Colorado Springs about how she’s dealing with higher prices.

A chunk of folks however said inflation doesn’t affect them. They noticed it — and most cited the rise in gas prices and food — but they didn’t cut back on what they normally buy. Their shopping patterns may have changed a bit.

One guy named Larry who hasn’t cut back said that however he started to “watch gas station prices when you drive by even when you don’t need gas.”

FDX,FedEx,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb2Rlcm5yZXRhaWwuY28vb3BlcmF0aW9ucy9hLWZlZGV4LXByb2JsZW0tYW5kLW5vdC1hLW1hcmtldC1wcm9ibGVtLXdoeS1mZWRleHMtcG9vci1lYXJuaW5ncy1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1tYXktbm90LWJlLWFuLWUtY29tbWVyY2UtYmVsbHdldGhlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why FedEx's earnings may not be an e-commerce bellwether,"In a move that could hint at overall difficulties for the e-commerce industry FedEx withdrew its guidance for the 2023 fiscal year last week citing a “continued volatile operating environment” and announced rate hikes for next year.

FedEx predicted further slowdowns during its second quarter which corresponds with the holiday season.

The shipping giant which released lower-than-expected earnings for the first quarter of its fiscal year on Thursday hopes cutting costs and scaling back operations will help it offset a slump in global demand. FedEx is looking to save $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion in the 2023 fiscal year in part by consolidating operations deferring staff hiring and closing more than 90 FedEx Office locations. Starting Jan. 2 it plans to hike its Express Ground and Home Delivery rates by an average of 6.9% and its Freight rates by an average of 6.9% to 7.9%.

“We’re moving with speed and agility to navigate a difficult operating environment pulling cost commercial and capacity levers to adjust to the impacts of reduced demand” Raj Subramaniam FedEx president and CEO said in the earnings release. “As our team continues to work aggressively to address near-term headwinds we’re meaningfully strengthening our business and customer experience including delivering an outstanding peak.”

While some may see the poor performance and revised forecast as bad news for the e-commerce industry as a whole experts and brands told Modern Retail they aren’t sounding the alarms just yet.

FedEx made up 16% of the parcel shipments in the U.S. by volume in 2020 according to data from Pitney Bowes a tech company focused on shipping and postage. This put it squarely behind competitors USPS UPS and Amazon Logistics in terms of market share. Each service has benefited from the higher volume of e-commerce transactions during the pandemic but has also grappled with a unique combination of a slowing global economy supply chain issues and inflation.

Among FedEx’s divisions FedEx Express bore the brunt of the loss; its operating income declined 69% in the first fiscal quarter “due to an 11% year-over-year reduction in global package and freight volume” the company said. FedEx also attributed the drop to “macroeconomic weakness in Asia and service challenges in Europe.” In contrast to its slower Ground service FedEx Express focuses on delivering packages quickly by a certain time. FedEx hopes to save $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion at FedEx Express by reducing the frequency of flights and parking aircraft in its 2023 fiscal year.

Still FedEx’s reduced outlook should not be taken as a sign that e-commerce is dead Matthew Hertz co-founder of the consulting firm Second Marathon told Modern Retail. When taking into account the growth of competitors such as UPS he sees FedEx’s slowdown as “a FedEx problem and not a market problem.” In a note on Monday Hertz said he sees FedEx as being in need of a “more dramatic operational overhaul.”

Additionally most e-commerce brands that use FedEx end up shipping goods via FedEx Ground not FedEx Express Hertz said. According to FedEx’s earnings FedEx Ground saw its “Home Delivery” daily package volume grow 4% from the same quarter last year. “FedEx and UPS are sort of canaries in a coal mine in e-commerce” Hertz said. “When I read this it’s not certainly all positive but it’s not certainly doomsday.”

Raj Subramaniam -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you Mickey and good afternoon everyone. I'd like to start today by acknowledging our pre-announced first quarter earnings results and updated outlook we provided last week. Our network capacity did not align with the demand we experienced as the quarter progressed. But as communicated last week we have taken swift actions to address what's within our control.

Getting costs out rapidly is my priority and today I will outline why I'm confident in our ability to drive improved performance and profitability through aggressive cost actions. Before providing more details around these actions let me briefly discuss what happened since we last spoke to you in June. We saw a decline in our volumes during the first quarter which accelerated in the final weeks. Our softening volumes in Asia and the U.S.

were predominantly due to the economy while the shortfall in Europe was both economic- and service-related. Therefore we had costs in the system for volumes that didn't materialize. While we immediately took action savings from these cost efforts lagged the volume decline due to the scale of our operations. As a result while revenue was up 6% year over year these dynamics translated to volumes being down year over year at all our transportation segments.

The volume decline directly impacted our bottom line driving total company adjusted operating income down roughly 18% year over year. Now what matters most is what we are doing about it and this brings me to our aggressive and decisive plan to reduce costs. I'll speak to you -- I'll speak to our actions in two parts: first our fiscal year '23 steps to immediately reduce costs; and second our Deliver Today Innovate for Tomorrow transformation strategy to permanently reduce cost and optimize our network. Starting with fiscal year '23 we are prioritizing cost actions to generate $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion of savings of which about $1 billion will be permanent.

Taking each key contributor in turn at FedEx Express we expect to drive $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in savings this fiscal year. The largest single expected contributor in fiscal '23 will be the changes we are making to our express air network as we cut global flight hours. This reduction includes 11% of pan-Pacific daily frequencies 9% of transatlantic daily frequencies and 17% of daily frequencies on the lane between Asia and Europe. As volumes deteriorated later in the quarter we began making these structural changes to our network.

The impact of these initial changes will be fully realized in October and the benefit of our continued actions will steadily increase throughout the fiscal year. We are also evaluating additional reductions to be implemented post peak. Further we're taking steps to enhance our ground efficiency including reducing routes hours vehicle rentals and other on-road expenses. For example in Europe we are altering ground network routes to improve productivity leading to a reduction of approximately 11% of routes in the U.K.

and 12% in Germany. Now turning to FedEx Ground. We expect savings in Ground to be $350 million to $500 million in fiscal '23. Our approach to cutting costs in Ground primarily centers around rationalizing our operations.

We are consolidating sorts which will reduce costs while maintaining service and have canceled several planned ground network capacity projects. And as mentioned last week we're also reducing select Sunday operations in over 170 stations. Mike will provide more details on our capital plans shortly. The final components of our expected fiscal '23 savings will be from overhead expenses as we rightsize our overall cost structure.

These actions include our plans to close nearly 140 FedEx office locations and at least five corporate office facilities. Additionally FedEx Services has stopped all noncritical projects. In total our overhead reduction actions including FedEx services will contribute $350 million to $500 million. We realized nearly $300 million in cost savings from these actions in Q1 and expect approximately another $700 million in Q2 with the remainder of the fiscal '23 savings realized during the second half of the year.

The second part of our cost plan is focused on permanent reductions and we have launched DRIVE a program supporting our Deliver Today Innovate for Tomorrow strategy introduced in June. DRIVE is how we execute on that strategy. Our team has already started implementing cost reductions under this program and this will ultimately enable Network 2.0 the long-term end-to-end trend optimization of our network. Sriram Krishnasamy our newly appointed Chief Transformation Officer will facilitate DRIVE and continue reporting directly to me.

In total we expect to take out an additional $4 billion in costs related to DRIVE by fiscal year 2025. To be clear these are incremental to the fiscal '23 savings I just outlined. These transformational changes will lay the foundation for Network 2.0 which will create an additional $2 billion benefit over the long term. In closing we are focused on actions we can control as we stabilize our near-term performance and execute against our long-term strategy.

I'd like to sincerely thank our highly motivated team for their hard work and dedication to deliver upon the Purple Promise. Now let me turn it over to our chief customer officer Brie Carere to discuss market trends that underpin our outlook and our commercial strategy in some more detail.

Brie Carere -- Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer

Thank you and good afternoon everyone. As Raj discussed during the first quarter manufacturing global trade and consumer spending decelerated particularly late in the quarter and certainly more than we anticipated. As a result our first quarter volumes were lower than we forecasted. Our current expectations for 2022 U.S.

GDP growth and U.S. industrial production forecasts have declined by about 100 basis points since June. Data shows that U.S. consumer spending has slowed as inflation remains a challenge.

Further consumption is skewed toward services demonstrated by the fact that in June excluding auto the real retail inventory to sales ratio fully recovered to its pre-pandemic level. From October to June the real inventory to sales ratio excluding automotive increased 14 basis points which was the fastest gain over an eight-month period in the 25-year history of the series. Also real retail sales including auto after growing 4.6% and 10.8% in calendar year '21 and '22 respectively are now down 3.1% year over year through July and are pacing to have the worst decline since The Great Recession. Turning to our transportation businesses.

I'd like to spend a moment on the dynamics occurring within FedEx Express and most specifically in Asia and Europe. Starting with Asia our results were impacted by macroeconomic weakness. Our lower demand is consistent with the broader market with ocean and air freight rates under pressure in recent weeks. A good indicator of how quickly the market changed in Asia is to review the spot rates coming out of Hong Kong and Shanghai.

In June and July spot rates were between 20% and 40% higher year over year respectively. In early August these rates fell to single digits and by the end of the month Shanghai had plummeted to a 10% decline year over year while Hong Kong rates were flat. Through June which is the latest data available we have had small market share gains in our Asia region. In Europe the economy was weaker than we anticipated and service further pressured our results.

Our network integration was successfully completed in March but it is an incredibly complicated effort to combine two individual networks of this scale. Throughout the quarter we continued to refine our standard operating procedures to improve service levels and create momentum across our European division. Moving now to FedEx Ground. Revenue growth was driven by higher yields from higher fuel surcharges base rate increases and improved volume mix.

Despite volumes being lower than anticipated we have held market share in the United States. FedEx Ground has strong service levels best-in-market transit times and an exciting new picture proof of delivery capability. We are ready to deliver for peak. We will remain nimble in leveraging peak surcharges to balance demand and the capacity of our network as we monitor volume trends.

And at FedEx Freight momentum continues to build. The Freight team delivered another strong quarter marked by 21% revenue growth. The team continues to drive disciplined execution focused on revenue quality and profitable share growth. For the company overall we continue to execute our revenue quality strategy and pursue business that provides attractive yields.

We continue to deliver new pricing capabilities and we've taken recent actions to stay well positioned relative to the market as we approach peak. We have maintained a brisk pace for repricing contracts for the renewals and continue to negotiate strong increases. We just announced a 6.9% general rate increase this coming January in our response to inflationary pressures on our costs. We also announced our new remote area surcharge and peak residential pricing in the United States.

In Europe and Asia we will launch a new handling surcharge as well this January. In August we implemented international fuel surcharge table adjustments for Asia Europe the Middle East and Africa. Fuel surcharges are an important pricing tool. We rigorously monitor fuel prices to ensure that we are appropriately positioned relative to the market.

We're moving with speed and agility to reposition our business model for today's operating environment. As you heard from Raj we had a great -- we have a great opportunity to align costs with volume levels. We are committed to doing this while executing against our commercial strategy and delivering for our customers. Importantly we're still focused on the longer-term opportunity growing in high-value segments driving improved service quality and of course delivering an outstanding customer experience.

I am really pleased with how our teams have responded in this dynamic environment and we are well positioned to deliver during the upcoming peak season. Service is strong and we have a fantastic value proposition. With that I'll turn it over to our chief financial officer Mike Lenz.

Mike Lenz -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you Brie. While revenue was up 6% for the quarter profitability was challenged with operating income down 18% on an adjusted basis and adjusted operating margin down 150 basis points year over year. At Express adjusted operating income declined 72% due to lower average daily package and freight volume and increased expenses as cost reductions lagged volume declines. These factors were partially offset by yield management actions including higher fuel surcharges.

Package yield including fuel grew 16% year over year. Turning to Ground. Operating income increased 3% primarily due to yield improvement and home delivery volume growth. Yield including fuel grew 12% year over year.

These factors were partially offset by higher operating expenses driven by increased purchase transportation and other operating expenses. Freight delivered another strong quarter with operating income increasing over 67% as the Freight team continues to execute. This was driven by yield management actions including higher fuel surcharges. Yield including the surcharges grew 27%.

This was partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits as well as lower shipment volumes. To address the changed environment we're focused on what's within our control and moving with urgency to take costs out of the network. Our team is operating at speed to identify cost-saving opportunities and accelerate for implementation. The $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion fiscal '23 savings we're targeting are relative to our initial plans heading into the year.

The majority of this year's savings will come from Express where the demand change has been most pronounced. We expect about $1 billion of our fiscal '23 savings to be permanent in nature with slight reduction as the largest component along with corporate and back-office costs. These permanent cost reductions were not part of the Deliver Today Innovate for Tomorrow strategy we shared in June which is about how we structurally optimize our networks. These reductions are directly related to flexing in a changed environment with a view to build back differently in the future.

As Raj mentioned we remain committed to the profit improvement objectives we shared at our June investors meeting. We have launched efforts to accelerate initiatives identify incremental opportunities and implement metrics to track progress under the DRIVE program. So next I'll give more details on the targeted $4 billion savings by fiscal '25 enabled by DRIVE. About $1.4 billion of the total will come from the FedEx Express operating expenses.

Four largest areas of opportunity we are actively advancing are: first restructuring the air network by reducing routes and more efficiently deploying crews aircraft and commercial line haul; next optimization of sort surface line haul and on-road design to improve efficiency asset utilization and service; next driving efficiencies of Europe as we've discussed previously; and lastly harmonizing global clearance processes to lower cost. About $1.1 billion of the total will come from FedEx Ground operating expenses via dock productivity initiatives network and line haul efficiencies and reduced liability costs. And approximately $1.5 billion will come from shared and allocated overhead expenses led by procurement savings back-office automation and infrastructure modernization increased deployment of digital self-service and further consolidation of shared service functions. Moving to our capital spending plans.

We've reduced our forecast for capital spend for fiscal 2023 to $6.3 billion compared to our prior $6.8 billion forecast. We're intensely focused on allocating capital to the most attractive ROIC initiatives. Our liquidity remains a source of strength as we ended the quarter with $6.9 billion in cash. And based on our cash flows and liquidity we remain committed to our capital return strategy including our plan to repurchase $1.5 billion of stock in fiscal 2023.

We expect to purchase $1 billion in the second quarter. Our capital return strategy reflects our confidence in our business despite the headwinds we're currently navigating. We have significant flexibility to maintain our balanced capital allocation and preserve a resilient balance sheet. Now turning to second-quarter guidance.

While we continue to drive aggressive cost reduction actions we expect business conditions to remain challenging in the second quarter. As a result and consistent with the update we provided last week currently expecting revenue of between $23.5 billion to $24 billion in the fiscal second quarter and adjusted earnings per share excluding costs related to business optimization and realignment initiatives of $2.75 or greater in the second quarter. For the remainder of the year while we are not providing guidance given current uncertainties our plan is based on an expectation that the weak trends we saw in late Q1 will persist across our major geographies. This is embedded in our guidance for the second quarter and driving our cost takeout initiatives for the fiscal year.

Longer term we remain committed to our fiscal 2025 targets for operating margin improvement return on invested capital and capital intensity that we shared with you in June. We're leaning more heavily into cost actions to get to those goals. The start of the year presented greater-than-expected challenges but I can assure you that we are moving with urgency to address these pressures while remaining focused on creating long-term value by prioritizing revenue quality expanding margins and elevating financial returns through profitable growth and reduced capital intensity. And with that we'll open it up for your questions.

Questions & Answers:

[Operator instructions] And we will take our first question from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.

Tom Wadewitz -- UBS -- Analyst

Yeah. Good. Good afternoon. I wanted to see if you could maybe give us some more perspective on some of the biggest cost reduction actions and just kind of your level of confidence on the execution.

It seems like I guess parking the planes and taking out capacity is something you've done in prior downturns but perhaps rationalizing sorting centers seems like a new thing in Ground. And I guess the labor markets maybe it's a little tougher to take labor market if you think you might need it back. So I just wanted to see if you could give maybe a bit more detail on your visibility to those cost actions and kind of how they come through. Thank you.

Mike Lenz -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure Tom. This is Mike. So you're correct in observing that the biggest order of magnitude of the cost reductions is from flexing down the air network. So that will come into play particularly as we move through into the second half of the year as the flight reductions for the -- take effect in October and into November.

So at Ground you spoke of a facility and sort rationalization. What that does for us is as volumes fell down below expectations that leads to inefficient line haul because load factor's down and so thus you're running more line haul than you need for the volume you have. So by consolidating sorts and rationalizing facilities that's just an example of how we can optimize against the lower volume. I'd also highlight that within the capital spending projections we have deferred a number of planned Ground facilities and we actually canceled a few that we're literally about to initiate.

So we are moving quickly on this and fully acting to realize the full potential there. So we have clear plans to get at all of these. We have a long list and they all add up to a very solid number and the team is focused on execution.

Operator

We will take our next question from Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.

Brian Ossenbeck -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Yeah. Maybe just more basic question. Raj can you just talk about the -- I guess the reason why this is only a FedEx issue at least at this point in time? Why haven't peers called this out? They all seem to sound like things are actually working pretty well in their favor at least not nearly as much of a falloff as you've highlighted. So maybe can you just address that and why you waited a week to talk about the costs which we're all waiting for? And then just because of the significant downdraft in Express can you give us some recent stats in terms of just how quickly it fell and how September is shaping up?

Raj Subramaniam -- President and Chief Executive Officer

OK. Let me start and then Brie can talk about some of the trends you're saying. Listen I can't comment on what our competition is seeing or not seeing. All I can say is the trends that we are seeing in the marketplace and we want to get out ahead of this.

And listen the whole -- at the end of the day the macro is going to ebb and flow. It's really the activities that we do that matters at the end of the day and we want to take control of what we can control. And that's why we are being very aggressive on our cost actions. And again we'll let the economic environment the things that we don't control it'll do what it will do.

We'll just -- we will focus on the issues that we can control in primarily on the cost side. I'll let Brie talk about the revenue trends.

Brie Carere -- Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer

Thanks Raj. Brian just to kind of reiterate what we -- I know we had a lot of opening comments. But when we look at kind of the background we really did break things into three categories. In Asia-Pacific we absolutely believe that this is a market trend and not a FedEx trend.

As I mentioned our market share studies they are a little bit of a lagging indicator. But we do see that through June in our Asia-Pacific region we actually gained market share. And that's why I shared those spot rates and how quickly the market changed in August. And we do believe the entire market is experiencing that in Asia.

In Europe similar story from an economic perspective. We think that the economy got worse throughout the quarter. We however as we acknowledged did not have the improvement in service in the quarter that we had expected. We actually saw some plateau in service levels so that was a FedEx issue.

And as Raj mentioned we're working on it seriously and actually feel good about the momentum there from a service improvement. And then here in the United States as I mentioned through June we can see that we've held market share. If you actually look from a nuanced perspective I would say that the one nuance within the domestic performance is that from a FedEx Ground economy perspective we have prioritized revenue quality and so we have let some volume go. That was very conscious and we have seen that kind of persist throughout the quarter.

So overall we do think that the entire market is experiencing what we had from a macroeconomic perspective. And then for Q2 you've got the revenue range and I would say that September is right in that range.

Operator

We will take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.

Brandon Oglenski -- Barclays -- Analyst

Hey Raj and team. Thanks for taking my question and definitely appreciate the new cost plans. But maybe we're going about this all the wrong way because there's been plenty of cost improvement plans in the past at this company that just haven't delivered. So can I ask a pointed question? Have you done a product review like what is not working in the last 20 years that's driving lower profitability in your network relative to your competitor? Is there a certain product or customer or a region that just isn't working? And I can tell you from the outside looking in TNT seems to have been an unmitigated disaster here that just has been delivering because you guys are coining out European losses again.

And then from our perspective as well dual Express and Ground pickup and delivery networks I get it. I know that Express and Ground have different dynamics. However your asset efficiency is literally half that of your nearest competitor which is unionized if I might add. So I guess why not use this downturn to put more concrete plans in place to exit markets or regions that aren't working? And the $1 billion in permanent costs out obviously a step in the right direction.

But I guess how can you address the deficiencies in the network as you see them?

Raj Subramaniam -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well thank you Brandon. I think we are absolutely fully committed to taking cost levers out. We talked about the three buckets fiscal year '23 the $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion with -- for cost take-out here. We're talking about $4 billion between '23 and '25 and then in the Network 2.0 of $2 billion after that.

So those are significant numbers. We are confident in these numbers. We have identified domains with targets. We have people who are focusing on run the business and people focused on transform the business.

And we are using cutting-edge technology and some of it is already coming on live here. And all of this is in motion as we speak to deliver value as quickly as possible. So we are confident we are committed and this is definitely the focus of the entire team. As far as TNT is concerned since you asked that question you got to go back and look at the -- a little bit of history here.

There's a portfolio gap that we had in Europe that our competition has -- has been in Europe since 1974 and it took -- it's a very important business and profitable business for them. We had to fill that portfolio gap. Now has the integration gone exactly the way we thought it would? No because we had the cyberattack we had COVID we had all kinds of things in the middle. But the integration is now complete and the -- that part of it is done.

We had -- the service issues are getting better. And we have in our portfolio to sell in Europe that's unmatched and sales is getting on the front foot. So this is a starting point if you would call and that's why we are confident of the improvements that Europe is going to deliver for us over the next two or three years. And again on the issue of Network 2.0 it's very easy to say yes put it together and look at the numbers yes that's great.

But the complexity of -- from a technology perspective from a facilities perspective other issues is far greater. And most importantly we have $4 billion of in-network efficiencies we can get relatively easier than that. And oh by the way we're building technology that will enable us to get the Network 2.0. So we think it's the right sequence.

Operator

We will take our next question from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Jordan Alliger -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Yeah. Hi. Sort of question for you in light of what could you have done different in the quarter. I guess the magnitude of the Express drop-off was so sharp and I get that [Inaudible] decelerated.

But I'm just curious like how did it catch you so off-guard? How do you protect against that in the future? And I would have thought that with the contractual customers you've had you might have had more of a heads-up that this deceleration was coming. So maybe you could talk to that. Thank you.

Raj Subramaniam -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Let me talk about the -- talk about timing and then maybe Brie if you want to add about what's up on the customers. But the volume did drop off quite suddenly toward the end of the quarter. As you know we have a complex system form with which multiple constituencies around that. And there's a time lag between the actions we can take on reducing the line haul network.

And that's all it is. So as I said in October you will see the full benefit of those takedowns. In terms of customer trends I don't know Brie if you want to add anything more.

Brie Carere -- Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer

Yeah. What I will say is that from a customer perspective our customers are incredibly sticky. And what we experienced especially in August both in Asia and here in the United States is two things is their demand actually wasn't there and our customers missed their own forecasts. So I think from a customer relationship perspective we are working with them furiously to help them manage their -- the difficulties that they're experiencing in their own business.

But from a customer stickiness perspective this is absolutely a reduction of demand within their own business not a share loss implication.

Mike Lenz -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Jordan this is Mike. We also are very intently focused on identifying these variable costs and shortening the time span of which we can realize the reduction there. So again there's a span and continuum across different lines of business and nature of costs but we are intently focused on shortening that horizon.

Operator

We will take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.

Helane Becker -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Thanks very much operator. Hi team. So just kind of wondering if you could be more specific on flights that you're reducing and parking aircraft to get to this $1.6-ish billion number. Like how should we think about the trade lanes that are going to be impacted and maybe the number of aircraft that are going to be on the ground? Or do you change your Boeing delivery schedule?

Raj Subramaniam -- President and Chief Executive Officer

I'll -- let me hit the trade lanes first and then we'll go to aircraft. I think we have -- we've taken down 11% of Trans-Pacific daily frequencies 9% of transatlantic daily frequencies and 17% of daily frequencies in the lane between Asia and Europe. And we will continue to look at it and we'll see what needs to happen post peak depending upon how the volume we will sold. Mike?

Mike Lenz -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah Helane. In taking that down we're maintaining connectivity and service in the network but there's lower volume so we need less lift. So as a result we identified the need to -- the opportunity to park aircraft just as we have demonstrated in the past the equivalent of about eight narrow-bodies is what we will be idling temporarily. And so as you can appreciate that defers maintenance spending that we otherwise would have had.

And of course you save the operating costs of not flying. So we'll continue to take that approach for how conditions unfold.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please go ahead.

Chris Wetherbee -- Citi -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess I wanted to understand the process of the cost-outs particularly this year.

So I think you guys mentioned that $300 million of cost savings is in the fiscal first quarter another $700 million is realized or expected to be realized in the second quarter. So that's about 40% or so over the full year yet the results are running at a level that is about half of what we expected just a week or so ago. So is this the kind of run rate we should expect as we move into the back half of the year with that extra $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion of costs coming in? Or is there improvement? I guess I'm just struggling particularly with the second quarter with the $700 million of cost savings relative to EBIT for the total company which may be in the neighborhood of $1 billion or a little bit north of that.

Mike Lenz -- Chief Financial Officer

OK. Chris so this is Mike. Let me take that in two parts. First you asked about the second quarter in that.

So as we emphasize we saw the downturn in the demand in the latter part of Q1. And as we expect those trends to persist through all of Q2 while we've accelerated or we'll realize more of the cost savings in Q2 as you highlight we also have three full months of that step change in demand that occurred late in Q1. So that certainly pressures Q2 margins. As we go through the year the savings build and we expect then that the pressures relative to Q2 will mitigate as we go through -- be less as we go through the year.

Operator

We will take our next question from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Ken Hoexter -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Hey. Great. Good afternoon. Just before I get to the question I just wanted to understand why you chose to launch your Q&A with CNBC versus hosting a conference call.

I just want to understand the philosophy of what we can expect of the message going forward and how you plan on distributing it. Obviously you had technical issues today but just to try to understand why you chose that route in getting a message out. But my question is how do you solve the festering Ground contractor issue? It seems like you talked about purchase transportation cost scaling. You mentioned in your statements you've pulled some networks.

Some have turned their routes in. It seems like there's really deep concern. Is there opportunity to use this I don't know whether the cost savings or something to change the structure there to resolve some of these issues that the contractors seem to have. Thanks.

Mike Lenz -- Chief Financial Officer

Ken this is Mike. First as it relates to your question about the prerelease so we felt that was appropriate for the circumstances. That's consistent with market practices and quite frankly allowed us to use more time today to be talking about how we're going to address it and our future plans.

Raj Subramaniam -- President and Chief Executive Officer

As far as the perceived issues on the Ground side let me just assure you first of all that the service levels at FedEx Ground are now reached pre-pandemic levels and we are very well positioned for peak. The 6000 contractors we have 96% of them have signed the peak incentive program. And to put that in perspective this is running ahead of where we were last year. So a lot of those were in the media.

They are all much more of a perception issue than reality and we are well positioned for peak and we have the support from our team.

We will take our next question from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Amit Mehrotra -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Thanks. Hi everyone. Mike I just wanted to ask about the cost-out initiatives this year and if it's a gross or net number because obviously the company has a $90 billion cost structure. If it's not net $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion it may sound like a lot but if you have 3% inflation on that number it wipes out the entirety of the cost savings.

So I want to know how you think about that if that's a fair or unfair way of characterizing it. And then just very simply are Express profits going up from here in the fiscal second quarter or are they going down from here? If you can just answer that as well. Thank you.

Mike Lenz -- Chief Financial Officer

So Amit first as we said the $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion is relative to our cost plans that we had coming into the year. Now as you rightfully observed we as everybody else in the world is experiencing unprecedented levels of inflation and so that absolutely impacts our base costs. I guess the best way I would characterize it for you is on an absolute cost basis the first quarter is the largest of the absolute year-over-year increase. As we move through the year that will mitigate as the cost initiatives take traction here and that will offset the cost inflation down the road.

I'm sorry what was the second question?

Amit Mehrotra -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Well just if you're just giving me a chance to follow up on that. And then the second question was if Express profits are going up from where we were in the fiscal first quarter the 1.7% margin or even just absolute profits are they going up or are they going down in the second quarter? And the way you characterized the answer just now it just seems like there's still no -- if inflation offsets the growth cost takeout then basically all of the revenue decline prospectively drops to the bottom line. And so I just wanted to understand how you -- if you agree with that or how you think about that.

Mike Lenz -- Chief Financial Officer

No it wouldn't drop to the bottom line because of the actions we're taking. We're reducing costs to adjust to a lower-demand environment. So while that doesn't leave us at the expectations that we highlighted -- that we outlined in June it's certainly the case that we're significantly mitigating that as we go through the year. As it relates to Express I would -- as I highlighted earlier the demand downturn particularly in Asia-Pacific and in Europe occurred late in Q1.

So Q2 will be -- we'll see margin pressure again at Express not dissimilar to what we experienced in Q1. But the structural initiatives really gain hold at Express as we move through Q2. So as you think about the overall cost-outs Express has more as we move through the year because just of the timing of the big elements there.

We will take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.

Jack Atkins -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst

OK. Thank you for taking my question. So I guess Raj going back to a comment you made earlier about the team do you feel like you've got the right senior team in place to lead FedEx into the future? There's a clear lack of outside talent on the senior executive committee. Your largest competitor has really benefited from bringing in some outside talent over the last five or so years.

Do you think it would make sense for FedEx to do that as you look forward to really put in some best practices and help drive improved profitability and returns? It seems like that's sort of a missing element to the story here.

Raj Subramaniam -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Jack I think I'm very very confident in the team that we have. There's a lot of experience here. We have several new players in place. The team is very very excited.

Obviously we'll look at external talent. We already brought an external talent on several areas of this company so they're not worse of that at all. It's just that we have a very very good team Jack and I'm very confident that we can deliver.

We will take our next question from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.

Jon Chappell -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Thank you. Good afternoon. Brie I want to ask you about the service challenges that you referenced. I just want to make sure is that strictly in Europe? We're now six months past the finality of the integration of TNT.

Are you confident that those service issues are behind you? And then the final thing is you think about cost cutting across all the regions is there a risk that cost-cutting could exacerbate some of the service issues going forward?

Brie Carere -- Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer

Great question. And let me answer the second part first. The answer is absolutely not. At FedEx one of the things we talk about a lot is quality-driven management and core service actually costs more.

And our teams are completely aligned that we are going to reduce cost and continue to improve service. And I cannot emphasize that enough that these things will move hand in hand and we are very confident in our service at Ground as we head here into the peak season for e-commerce. When we're talking about service in Europe as Raj mentioned the margin integration of the airline was successful. We successfully integrated the airline.

It was very complicated and we did suffer some service challenges in March. As we stood in front of you in June we absolutely had improvement from that March point. We did expect continued improvement in July and August. And what we experienced in Europe was a plateau in that service improvement.

And I want to be really specific. When we get into Europe the international domestic markets when we talk about like our U.K. market or we talk about the France market that domestic service is actually really really strong. And then when we get across Europe on the deferred service offerings it's strong.

We have to elevate the service within our overnight business in Europe and that is our No. 1 focus from a service perspective. And yes I am confident that Karen and her team will continue to improve there. But I just wanted to kind of give you that background of kind of where we're at and what we're looking at moving forward.

And absolutely our entire team knows reduce cost and improve service.

We will take our next question from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Ravi Shanker -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Hi everyone. So regarding the GRI you announced how do you reconcile pushing through your biggest rate increase in history at a time when your volumes are falling double digits? I mean isn't that going to exacerbate the volume decline?

Brie Carere -- Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer

Fair question. I think the answer is inflation. Last year we had a 5.9% increase in post and by the way we have just an incredible insight into our pricing discipline in the market and the commercial tools the team have are just best-in-class. So last year we did a 5.9%.

It was incredibly sticky. We had continued cost increases throughout the year and so we felt that the 6.9% was appropriate for this year's GRI. We will monitor post-implementation stickiness. And of course we're constantly looking to balance the yield and the volume and make sure that we get the right volume levels from a utilization perspective.

But given the inflationary backdrop yes we thought this was the right increase for the year.

We will take our next question from Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Ari Rosa -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Great. Thanks. So Raj as I look at FedEx Freight it's now producing almost four times the operating income of Express. Just could you talk maybe about how you think about the sustainability of the performance on the Freight side particularly as we head into a potential downturn? And then to what extent if we see some of the strength at Freight starting to wane is it possible that starts to eat into some of the gains that you might see from cost savings at the other units?

Raj Subramaniam -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Thank you Ari for that question. First of all let me just say our FedEx Freight team has done -- continue to do a phenomenal job of both managing revenue quality and our operating efficiency to generate fantastic results. And they also form a great piece of our portfolio and also provide synergies on the cost side.

The point that you made is important because -- but we have -- when there's a significant change when we went to our last downturn that we were very much focused on revenue quality and efficiency. And as even through the downturn actually the margins expanded. And so we are very disciplined in this area and we are executing the plan. We'll have to watch how the market conditions change.

Our volumes have actually as you can see have declined and yet the margins have gone up. And the team has done a fantastic job and I expect them to do that going forward.

Operator

We will take our next question from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.

Bruce Chan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst

Yes. Thanks operator. Raj Brie I just want to go back to some of your earlier comments and maybe just ask it bluntly. When you think about the miss how much of the shortfall was volume-related and how much was from those European service issues? And maybe just a follow-up if you can give us some color on what exactly you mean by service issues? I might have missed it but it's not really clear to me what that means.

Was it I guess customer attrition? And if so can that come back? Thank you.

Brie Carere -- Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer

So the short answer is the vast majority of our volume miss was macroeconomic. We talked about it kind of when you think about the miss it really was predominantly at Express with Asia being the largest issue. We believe that was entirely macroeconomic. And then when we get into Europe there was a split between service and the macroeconomic decline.

I will tell you two things. From a service perspective when we say service issues specifically what we're talking about is on the Express portfolio within Europe across the European network is that we are not hitting that time-definite mark at the level that we expect of FedEx. And so we need to kind of increase that service commitment there. What I will tell you is that the sales team and our customer base absolutely wants FedEx participating in this market.

And we have had strong indications that customers are looking for us in their portfolio in Europe. We have great relationships with large globals here in the United States and they want us as part of their portfolio in Europe. So I'm very optimistic about the future in Europe.

We will take our next question from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.

Bascome Majors -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst

Raj you've managed through a lot of change at FedEx since 2016. Just to mention the TNT acquisition the cyberattack the trade war downturn and the pandemic a change in leadership from a founder and whatever we're going to call the cyclical reversal when we look back on it in a few years here. But as you step back and reflect are there any management mistakes that FedEx did make? And if so what can you learn from those mistakes to set your customers and your shareholders up for success over the next three to five years? Thank you.

Raj Subramaniam -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well Bascome I think that's an excellent question. And let me just think about this for a second. You see 2016 was we're primarily in the B2B space. And when you look ahead of the market we thought 90% of the growth for the next five years is going to be e-commerce and 10% B2B.

Well you look back now and look at that time frame we see almost not 90% but more than 100% of the growth came from e-commerce. So we actually expanded our e-commerce portfolio in a big way and expanded our operations. We're very proud of the work we did in creating this portfolio of services in this time frame. We also did one of the most important work in the history of the company especially with Express by delivering vaccines and healthcare around the world and especially in the time of the great pandemic where operating a network like ours around the world was extraordinarily complex with changing circumstances.

So I'm extremely proud of the team for having executed that. So this is the time frame we're talking about. So what we did not anticipate to be perfectly honest with you was the tremendous inflation of costs that hit us squarely last year. And that was what really got us.

And even with that we had tremendous results in fiscal year '22 from an EPS perspective. But we absorbed a lot of costs from the inflation side of the house. And then of course and now that we're dealing with this situation we had to build capacity and now we have more capacity than we need. So could we have timed that a little better? I don't know how you're going to calculate it.

It's like you can't build half a building. So it's just -- it is now we are in a position to -- as we laid out at the investor meeting we are focusing on the things we have control. We are -- our focus is now on improvement of margins improvement of ROIC and improve our capital intensive. That's what we're going to do.

And this -- again the economic upturn or downturn forget about that for a second. Let's focus on the things we can control. And that's why this tremendous cost focus and the structural costs that we are talking about that's going to get us to these targets.

We will take our next question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Todd Fowler -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Great. Thanks and good evening. So I just want to make sure I understand the underlying macro assumptions. Mike is it that the trends that you saw in August that that's kind of the run rate now going into the second quarter? Or do you expect some further deceleration from where we were in August? And then is there a risk that there's contagion or we see weakness in Asia and then that comes into the U.S.? Or just kind of how are you thinking about the geographic piece of it? And then lastly we typically have seen price follow volume.

And so is there a risk on the yield front that as volumes slow that price follows after that? Thanks.

Mike Lenz -- Chief Financial Officer

OK Todd. So yes the basic underlying planning assumptions that we are using is that the demand levels that we experienced in late August will continue through the rest of the year and so that we're taking actions accordingly to react to that. So that's the operating assumption now. I don't have a crystal ball about contagion in that.

But rest assured we are going to be continuing to focus on the things we can control. And if we need to make further adjustments and reductions in the cost structure we will move quickly and decisively.

We will take our next question from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.

Jeff Kauffman -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst

Thank you very much and thank you for the guidance on the cost savings as well. I just wanted to ask because I noticed that the other corporate and overhead part of operating income was about $100 million higher than a year ago. It costs money to park planes and I don't know if you're furloughing pilots or you're reducing those hours. It costs money to reduce routes or consolidate sorts or shut down offices.

Do you guys have any estimate for where those costs are going to be? How much they're going to be? Where are they running through the regular P&L during the quarter? Or was that the $100 million in incremental costs that I saw going through kind of corporate office and other?

Mike Lenz -- Chief Financial Officer

Jeff yeah. Let me just specifically address the $100 million you can put it into two pieces. We had a specific customer bad debt reserve that we booked for $80 million at FedEx Logistics. And so while we are pursuing legal action it was the appropriate reserve to take at this point in time.

And then while we separate it out in terms of our adjusted earnings there's also $24 million of our business realignment is in that corporate/other line. So maybe that gives a little more context for what's there. To clarify as far as any other -- no charges or anything that was specific to the items you were asking about.

Raj Subramaniam -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And there is also no furlough of the pilots. That's not even a thing.

We will take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.

David Vernon -- Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst

Hey good afternoon. So I appreciate the added color on the cost saves but reductions from baseline kind of difficult to book as profitability. Ten weeks ago we were looking at a low $20 -- EPS number going to something in the low $30s. Is there any to think that those targets for earnings power have actually shifted as a result of what's happening in the market right now or are we just pushing those out? And does the $4 billion of extra cost saves just kind of gets you back to that 10% margin level?

Mike Lenz -- Chief Financial Officer

I think David the way to frame it is that we fully recognize that the external environment has changed more than we expected. So we're focused on delivering the margin improvement lowering the capital intensity that we highlighted but it's absolutely the case that a greater emphasis will be put on the cost reductions. And so that's what we're highlighting here today. And we have the specific initiatives and plans in place to go after that and realize that as supportive of the goals that we outlined.

We will take our next question from Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Please go ahead.

Jairam Nathan -- Daiwa Securities -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to clarify. Are there any -- should we account for any cash restructuring expenses or anything of that sort for these cost savings?

Mike Lenz -- Chief Financial Officer

So to clarify for the cost savings that we've identified for FY '23 no there's nothing associated with that. Now previously as we talked about the broader business optimization initiatives over a number of years we scoped that that could be potentially in the $2 billion range but that is over a longer time horizon. But the near-term cost initiatives there is no special charge for that.

That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time I will turn the conference back to Raj Subramaniam for any additional or closing remarks.

Raj Subramaniam -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well thank you very much. And in closing let me just say it goes without saying it was a challenging quarter. This is a real critical moment in time for FedEx to execute and I'm very confident that we will.

The company reported that an existing softness in demand was accelerated by worsening macroeconomic conditions during the last weeks of the quarter ended Aug. 31.

“During the first quarter manufacturing global trade and consumer spending decelerated particularly late in the quarter and certainly more than we anticipated” FedEx Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said Thursday (Sept 22) during the company’s earnings call.

In response to the weaker-than-expected demand FedEx is reducing variable incentive compensation temporarily parking some aircraft closing some sort operations and offices suspending some Sunday operations reducing vendor utilization deferring projects optimizing its network and increasing some rates surcharges and fees.

“We’re moving with speed and agility to navigate a difficult operating environment pulling cost commercial and capacity levers to adjust to the impacts of reduced demand” FedEx President and CEO Raj Subramaniam said in the release. “As our team continues to work aggressively to address near-term headwinds we’re meaningfully strengthening our business and customer experience including delivering an outstanding peak.”

The company had announced some of these measures a week earlier on Sept. 15 when it released an updated outlook for the quarter.

Come 2023 it’s going to cost more for promotional products companies – and essentially everyone else too – to ship through FedEx.

The Memphis TN-headquartered multinational shipping and delivery provider announced on Thursday Sept. 22 that rates for its FedEx Express FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery services will increase by an average of 6.9%. Meanwhile FedEx Freight rates will rise by an average of 6.9% to 7.9% depending on a customer’s transportation rate scale.

The heightened rates go into effect on January 2 2023. The rate jumps are steeper than what FedEx charged to start 2022; then rates rose by an average of 5.9%.

The carrier is hiking prices after its just-reported revenue and earnings came in below Wall Street expectations. CEO Raj Subramaniam blamed a deteriorating macroeconomic environment and predicted a “worldwide recession.”

In addition to the rate hikes FedEx is also undertaking measures to realize cost savings of $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion in 2023.

“We’re moving with speed and agility to navigate a difficult operating environment pulling cost commercial and capacity levers to adjust to the impacts of reduced demand” said Subramaniam.

A full breakdown of FedEx’s rate increases can be found here.

In addition to the average increases mentioned earlier FedEx is also instituting a delivery area surcharge of $13.25 per package that will be applied to domestic package shipments destined to select ZIP codes within the contiguous United States that are designated as “remote.”

Also come January 2 FedEx will increase the late payment fee to 8% for U.S. FedEx Express and FedEx Ground invoices not paid according to approved payment terms. See the FedEx Service Guide for more information about the late payment fee.

It’s been choppy waters lately for FedEx. Beyond disappointing on earnings the delivery provider has faced pushback from some of its Ground contractors over issues like compensation."

Looks like a building has been knocked down and there’s a fence around the area.

— Arnold Saslavsky Naples

A: A former Frantz EyeCare office recently was demolished to make way for a new Fifth Third Bank branch in the Gateway of Naples retail center across from Coastland Center mall. The freestanding 5000-square-foot bank office with drive-thru lanes is targeted to open in late July 2023 in the retail center anchored by the original Food & Thought said Jennifer Auray vice president of regional marketing and communications for Fifth Third Bank in Florida.

In 2020 Frantz EyeCare moved a short distance to a new much larger two-story medical office built by Stevens Construction at 2500 Goodlette-Frank Road in Naples. The Fifth Third banking center under construction on that outparcel lot in front of Dorona restaurant will feature the bank’s next-generation design concept which fosters a consultative atmosphere as opposed to more historical transactional banking said John R. Slavik senior vice president and retail executive for Fifth Third’s Southern market.

“We’re excited for the continued opportunities to bring the Fifth Third next-gen experience to more of our Naples-area customers” Slavik said. “The new innovative design was created with a focus on our customers’ need and preferences fostering a welcoming environment where our bankers are focused on providing a best-in-class experience for our community as well as allowing customers to meet with our bankers in a space they find most comfortable. Fifth Third is focused on building relationships and partnering with our customers to achieve their goals.”

Branching out

Fifth Third plans to open three other next-gen bank offices in the region before the end of this year. The new offices will be in Naples North Naples and Estero.

Fifth Third is targeted to open Oct. 13 in a second-generation space that formerly was an IberiaBank office on the corner of U.S. 41 and Fourth Avenue South in Naples. The bank will have the ground floor of a two-story building owned by the Hoffmann Family of Companies which offers leasable professional office space on the second floor as part of Hoffmann Executive Suites.

Hoffmann Commercial Real Estate acquired the building at 428 Ninth St. S. in February. Following a merger with First Horizon Bank IberiaBank was rebranded First Horizon in early 2022 and closed that location. Orion Bank bought that .29-acre property in 2002 for $1.1 million before it became IberiaBank in 2010.

That Naples address was well known as a drive-thru liquor store decades ago and it was the former home of the Swamp Buggy Lounge a popular local hangout. The Swamp Buggy closed in 2002 and was demolished in 2004.

Fifth Third is moving into this existing bank building instead of razing an old retail strip at Ninth Street and Third Avenue South and building a new office as originally planned. The bank abandoned its original plans after encountering difficulty getting a drive-thru approved by the city.

Two other Fifth Third offices are preparing to open this December. Construction started this spring on a new North Naples branch at Collier Health Park on the northwest corner of Immokalee Road and Health Park Boulevard. The 2800-square-foot full-service banking center is targeted to open Dec. 16 on an out lot that formerly was used for parking at the adjacent retail strip near NCH Healthcare System’s North Naples campus.

Fifth Third also has its Corkscrew financial center scheduled to open Dec. 20 off Miromar Outlet Drive and Ben Hill Griffin Parkway in Estero. The new bank was built on a vacant parcel that formerly was parking spaces just inside that eastern entrance of Miromar Outlets.

Q: Will there be a traffic light added to the Valencia Trails and Twin Eagles entrances to ease up the traffic issues? — Darlene Roddy Naples

A: It’s just a matter of time before a traffic signal is installed at Immokalee Road’s intersection with Twin Eagles Boulevard and Majestic Trails Boulevard the new road into GL Homes’ Valencia Trails 55-plus residential community under construction more than 3 miles east of Collier Boulevard.

“Our Traffic Operations chief engineer has advised that the Valencia Trails developer did a signal warrant study with future numbers which demonstrated that the intersection will meet warrants in the future after the development’s completion” said Connie Deane community liaison for Collier County government. “Its approval was conditioned on a new study to be done by the developer when the actual traffic volumes at the intersection satisfy the traffic signal warrants. The construction of this new traffic signal can take as much as one year due to material supply issues that the industry is experiencing these days.”

Valencia Trails and TwinEagles are two of the largest gated residential communities in Collier County. The 563-acre Valencia Trails eventually will have more than 850 single-family homes extending south from Immokalee Road to the Vanderbilt Beach Road extension a seven-mile county project that broke ground this week. GL Homes the developer of Valencia Trails believes a traffic light at the subdivision’s Immokalee Road entrance will be warranted before less than half of the homes are sold there.

“We think we would meet warrants somewhere between 300 and 350 closed homes. It will hopefully be sometime early to mid-next year” said John Asher land development director for GL Homes. “We’re hoping that once we meet it that [the traffic signal] can be installed pretty quickly. We’ve already ordered most of the materials.”

Asher estimates that GL Homes already has closed on about 200 homes in Valenica Trails. “With the number of closings every month it won’t be another six months until we get there” he said.

The intersection is about two miles east of the traffic light installed last year at the Immokalee Road intersection at Quarry and Woodcrest drives. Other traffic signals are operated during limited day parts in less than 1.5 miles in either direction on Immokalee Road at the entrance into two local charter schools Naples Classical Academy and Collier Charter Academy.

A traffic control signal should not be greenlighted unless an engineering study indicates that installing a traffic control signal will improve the overall safety and/or operation of the intersection according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Vehicular volumes and peak hour traffic are among the factors analyzed to determine the need for a traffic signal.

Valencia Trails eventually will have a second entrance on Vanderbilt Beach Road’s future extension. From an infrastructure standpoint roads and utilities are already being built in the fourth and final phase of Valencia Trails plans to reach the road extension site before the county project does” Asher said. “We should be there ahead of them” he said. “It will provide relief for Immokalee Road.”

The IEA PVSP report found that the volume of end-of-life PV modules is still small but there are appropriate treatment and recycling measures in place in countries and areas with end-of-life regulations.

“However the current low volumes limited available recycling technologies logistics challenges and undeveloped markets for recovered materials result in a high-cost low-revenue scenario for PV module recycling globally” the report said.

The scenario is expected to improve with the implementation of regulations in more countries and investment in R&D for PV recycling.

Around 1.7 million tons of waste volume of end-of-life PV modules are expected by 2030 under the regular loss scenario of a 2016 analysis by PVSP and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) with approximately 60 million tons expected by 2050. If the early loss scenario pans out there could be 8 million tons of PV waste by 2030 and a total of 78 million tons by 2050.

Focus on Europe

PV module recycling has been mandatory in Europe since 2012 under the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive. The directive requires all producers of PV modules in the EU market to either operate their own take-back and recycling scheme or join producer compliance schemes. All EU member states have adopted the WEEE into national law. According to Eurostat statistics 13951 tons of PV module waste were collected in 12 European countries in 2018.

Germany reportedly collected 7865 tons of PV modules in 2018 7708 tons of which were recovered. Of those 6896 tons were recycled and prepared for reuse. The country requires registration and specific end-of-life treatment for all PV modules. Business-to-costumer PV modules are collected without charge for the customers at municipal waste collection points but business customers require a paid take-back/collection service administered by specialized service providers.

Monocrystalline silicon modules are mostly recycled by glass recycling companies and First Solar operates a specific recycling line for thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV panels in Frankfurt. According to IEA/PVPS there will be around 400 thousand tons to 1 million tons of PV waste by 2030 in Germany with this figure increasing to 4.3 million tons in 2050.

France reportedly collected 4905 tons of PV waste in 2019 thirteen times as much as in 2015 when the figure stood at 366 tons. Soren a nonprofit eco-organization has a monopoly on PV module waste management in the country managing both its collection and recycling through private tenders according to the report. In February 2021 it launched a new tender for three new PV recycling facilities in France. One started operations in 2021 and the other two will start in 2022 according to the report. France may see 43 thousand tons of PV waste by 2030 and more than 118 thousand tons by 2040.

Spain reportedly collected 226 tons of PV waste in 2019. Its treatment of waste is still in a “very preliminary stage” according to the report. Producers are obliged to adopt the necessary actions to manage waste according to product design and must bear the cost of the process as well as register the products in the national producer registry of electrical and electronic equipment (RII_AEE). Spain still sees small amounts of PV waste but these are expected to increase in the medium term as its first plants near end of life.

Italy reportedly collected 1350 tons of PV modules in 2018. The Italian energy services manager GSE defines instructions for the disposal of modules installed in plants benefiting from feed-in-tariff schemes. End-of-life modules from plants with less than 10 kW nominal power are sent to a national collection center whereas modules with more than 10 kW are destined to an authorized waste management entity. Italy may see between 140 thousand to 500 thousand tons of PV waste by 2030 with an increase up to 2.2. million tons by 2050.

North America

Various US states have introduced regulations to incentivize the expansion of PV module recycling industrial capacity. Washington was reportedly the first state to introduce a regulation for take-back requirements for PV manufacturers at no additional cost for the PV system owners. California implemented regulations to classify end-of-life PV modules are universal waste at the beginning of 2021 to decrease costs and thereby incentivize a domestic PV recycling industry. North Carolina is considering following suit. PV waste management policies are also being considered in Illinois Hawaii Arizona North Carolina and New Jersey.

“Despite the regulatory developments at the state level there is no US federal regulations specifically designed to regulate PV waste management. PV waste is regulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act which does not contain any specific regulatory requirement for PV waste” said the report.

First Solar the world’s largest PV recycler has a recycling capacity of 150 metric tons/day in the US for its thin-film CdTe PV modules according to the report. The United States has also witnessed an increase in the number of companies dedicated to recycling crystalline silicon PV systems.

“The potential economic and environmental gains from sustainably managing PV waste have motivated the allocation of R&D funds toward accelerating the scaling of startups focusing on recycling silicon PV waste” the report says. There may be 5.5 to 10 million tons of PV waste in the US by 2050.

Asia-Pacific region

There are currently no nationwide PV recycling schemes in the Asia Pacific according to the report. China reportedly does not have any specific policies or regulations on PV module recycling and it also lacks the necessary recycling industrial chain. It recently implemented several PV recycling R&D projects including the establishment of the China PV Recycling Center in 2022.

In Australia only the state of Victoria has mandatory regulations on PV module disposal. Victoria passed legislation banning all electronic waste from landfill sites including PV modules inverters and batteries. The country’s Product Stewardship Centre of Excellence is designing a nationwide extended producer responsibility (EPR) scheme for PV systems which should be implemented by June 2023.

Japan currently includes PV waste under the general regulatory framework for waste management as it lacks specific regulations for end-of-life PV module recycling. The country has published guidelines for promoting the proper end-of-life treatment of solar panels and is developing research on high-value glass and low-cost recycling.

South Korea also lacks mandatory PV waste recycling policies but “PV module waste will be included in the list of items affected by EPR regulations which will be enforced in the PV industry beginning in 2023” said the report. The country may see 9665 tons of PV waste in 2023 up to 112564 tons in 2040 according to predictions from the Korean Environment Institute.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY2Fycy51c25ld3MuY29tL2NhcnMtdHJ1Y2tzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3Nvbm8tbW90b3JzLXJldmVhbHMtc2lvbi1zb2xhci1ldtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,German Automaker Sono Reveals Their Sion Solar EV Van,"German automaker Sono Motors is taking pre-orders for an unusual car with big ambition – the Sion an all-electric car that charges itself through the power of the sun.

Sono Motors founded in 2016 has a mission to ""accelerate the revolution of mobility by making every vehicle solar."" The company works toward that mission along with its goal to establish large-scale smart e-mobility and sharing to make a significant contribution to the reduction of global CO2 emissions. The Sion is its first step toward that future.

To American eyes the Sion looks distinctly European although a bit bulky and awkward. That bulk however hides a secret. The hood fenders sides roof and rear of the vehicle carry solar cells that seamlessly blend visually and physically into the car’s body. These solar cells mean that the Sion can charge its battery from the sun alone! At peak performance these cells can generate up to 1.2 kilowatts and add an additional 112 kilometers or about 69.5 miles of additional range per week.

Sono Motors has dubbed the Sion as the world's first solar electric vehicle or SEV for the masses. The exterior boasts 456 of those solar half-cells that allow German commuters in metropolitan areas to charge their Sion up to four times less than conventional EVs of the same class. These monocrystalline silicon cells produce energy under cloudy skies or in the shade.

The Sion also boasts bidirectional charging technology that is designed to turn it into a sustainable ""power plant on wheels"" allowing it to power electronic devices the home or other electric cars.

How far can you go without the added solar power? The Sion's 54 kWh battery will get you about 305 kilometers or about 189.5 miles on a single charge. The Sion can be charged at home with a standard plug-in for about 12.5 hours at a Type 2 charging station in about 4 hours to 80% or at a rapid charging station in about 35 minutes to 80%.

The three-phase synchronous motor is paired with a single-speed transmission offering 120 kW and 163 horsepower with a top speed of 140 km or 87 mph. The Sion will be offered with front-wheel drive.

The interior is minimalist and boasts one extremely unusual feature –integrated moss. This natural element is meant to ensure a pleasant indoor ambiance. It's unique but I don't see this feature catching on in the States.

Beyond bringing the outdoors in the Sion has a 10-inch touch screen infotainment display along with an additional display for the driver that offers information such as solar range and speed.

Buyers will benefit from the Sono app which can be used for car sharing with no key handover necessary ride pooling and power-sharing.

The Sion will be made in Europe and Sono Motors has no plans to take it overseas. The company expects that all production-related greenhouse gas emissions that cannot be avoided will be fully offset through relevant measures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmcmljYW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjMvc2FmcmljYS10ZWVucy1idWlsZC1zb2xhci10cmFpbi1hcy1wb3dlci1jdXRzLWhhdW50LWNvbW11dGVycy_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZnJpY2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOS8yMy9zYWZyaWNhLXRlZW5zLWJ1aWxkLXNvbGFyLXRyYWluLWFzLXBvd2VyLWN1dHMtaGF1bnQtY29tbXV0ZXJzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S.Africa teens build solar train as power cuts haunt commuters,"For years students in a South African township have seen their parents struggle to use trains for daily commutes the railways frequently hobbled by power outages and cable thefts.

To respond to the crisis a group of 20 teenagers invented South Africa's first fully solar-powered train.

Photovoltaic panels fitted to the roof the angular blue-and-white test train moves on an 18-metre-long (60 feet) test track in Soshanguve township north of the capital Pretoria.

Trains are the cheapest mode of transport in South Africa used mostly by the poor and working class.

""Our parents... no longer use trains (because of) cable theft... and load shedding"" said Ronnie Masindi 18 referring to rolling blackouts caused by failures at old and poorly maintained coal-powered plants.

The state power company Eskom started imposing on-and-off power rationing 15 years ago to prevent a total national blackout.

The power outages known locally as load-shedding have worsened over the years disrupting commerce and industry including rail services.

Infrastructure operator Transnet has struggled to keep rail traffic flowing smoothly since the economic challenges of the pandemic fuelled a surge in cable theft.

By 2020 rail use among public transport users was down almost two-thirds compared to 2013 according to the National Households Travel Survey with many commuters turning to more expensive minibus taxis.

Masindi said they decided to ""create and build a solar-powered train that uses solar to move instead of (mains) electricity"".

The journey has not been without its challenges.

A lack of funding delayed production of the prototype locomotive and the government later chipped in.

""It was not a straight line"" said another student Lethabo Nkadimeng 17. ""It was like taking a hike to the highest peak of the mountain.""

The train which can run at 30 kilometres (20 miles) per hour was showcased at a recent universities innovation event.

For now the prototype can run for 10 return trips on the track installed on the grounds of a school.

It will be used for further research and eventually presented as a model the government could adopt.

Fitted with car seats and a flat-screen TV to entertain passengers it took the students two years to build.

""What we have realised is if we you give township learners space resources and a little mentorship they can do anything that any learner can do around the world"" said Kgomotso Maimane the project's supervising teacher."

Those were the words of Amazon Prime broadcaster Kirk Herbstreit when he saw the Brownie the Elf Browns logo at midfield of FirstEnergy Stadium.

Herbsteit and announcer Al Michaels had a back-and-forth about Cleveland's new 50-yard-line logo in the fourth quarter of Thursday's Browns game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

""Honestly? I’m not a fan man"" Herbstreit said when asked about Brownie by Michaels. ""What used to be at the 50?""

Fans voted to bring Brownie the Elf to start the season.

Cavaliers at the Browns game:Donovan Mitchell Darius Garland serve as Cleveland Browns Dawg Pound captains

""We're super excited about the new midfield logo"" Browns Executive Vice President and Partner JW Johnson told clevelandbrowns.com. ""We really wanted to engage our fans in the process and they are — as I've said multiple times — undefeated. They're the best in the league best in the NFL and candidly some of the best in sports. We really wanted to get their involvement and hear what they have to say. We were able to pull off the new logo with the old school Brownie logo.""

This marks the team's first mid-field logo since 2016. Before that a Browns helmet was at the 50-yard-line.

A version of Brownie served as the team’s primary logo from 1948 until 1969. Starting in 1970 the Browns were represented by a logo-less orange helmet.

Who is Brownie The Elf?

Brownie the Elf was one of three original logos for the Browns when they came into existence starting in 1946. The logo/mascot was phased out after former team owner Art Modell’s reported hatred of it but Brownie has made several appearances after the team returned to Cleveland in 1999.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLWhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yMy9tZW50b3JzLW1pdGNoLXRydWJpc2t5LWRlY2VudC1pbi1yZXR1cm4taG9tZS13aXRoLXN0ZWVsZXJzLWJ1dC1xYi1jaGFuZ2UtY2hhdHRlci1saWtlbHktdG8tcmVtYWluL9IBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLWhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yMy9tZW50b3JzLW1pdGNoLXRydWJpc2t5LWRlY2VudC1pbi1yZXR1cm4taG9tZS13aXRoLXN0ZWVsZXJzLWJ1dC1xYi1jaGFuZ2UtY2hhdHRlci1saWtlbHktdG8tcmVtYWluL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mentor’s Mitch Trubisky decent in return home with Steelers but QB change chatter likely to remain,"Approximately 24 miles separated Mitch Trubisky between Jerome T. Osborne Sr. Stadium his old stomping grounds and FirstEnergy Stadium on Sept. 22.

In a football life that journey probably feels like it has a lot more mileage.

Difficult as it may be to fathom the affable hometown hero Trubisky is a decade removed from being 2012 Mr. Football and one of the premier quarterbacks in News-Herald coverage area lore at Mentor — the rare justified use of the word “star” at the high school level — and where he found himself amid “Thursday Night Football”:

As starting quarterback for the Steelers against his hometown team in the Browns and likely with a ton of proverbial weight on his shoulders trying to maintain his No. 1 role under center.

#NHfootball Mitch Trubisky discusses getting better going forward & being able to play in primetime a half-hour from his old stomping grounds at Mentor pic.twitter.com/JBY6Ovn07f — Chris Lillstrung (@CLillstrungNH) September 23 2022

Not to mention a hungry Browns team that had snatched defeat from the jaws of victory four days prior against the Jets.

Trubisky didn’t necessarily regress but didn’t progress immensely either in a 29-17 loss to the Browns. He was 20-for-32 passing for 207 yards no touchdowns and no interceptions — for a QB rating of 81.1 — and contributed a rushing touchdown.

Pittsburgh has now scored 54 points through a 1-2 start.

“I think a little bit of rhythm and then we just didn’t hit on the plays we needed to” Trubisky said of the difference before and after halftime. “There were plays in the second half that — they were plays that might have made a different story. I think there’s a few more details in there that we’ve just got to watch on the film. But that’s kind of where it felt like in the second half. We needed to hit some plays and we just didn’t.

“We’ve got to watch the film and see where we can get better.”

It wasn’t Trubisky’s first venture onto the gridiron downtown. As a sophomore signal-caller at Mentor in 2010 Trubisky took the field there against St. Edward and there was also a preseason appearance with the Bears.

Suffice it to say this occasion was a much different entity. But playing a half-hour from his old stomping grounds meant a great deal.

“It was cool. It was really cool” Trubisky said. “It’s nice to be back home. It felt good. It felt very welcoming.

“I would have loved to get a win but it was definitely special coming back home and playing in front of my friends and family. It meant a lot but we’ve got to come out with a win.”

The winds were announced as being 21 mph at kickoff as the winds of change potentially awaited with Steelers fans clamoring for touted rookie Kenny Pickett this past weekend after a 17-14 loss to the Patriots.

On the field a few hours later Trubisky’s consistently calm demeanor remained steady.

Trubisky pointed out a blitz to his line evaded pressure from linebacker Anthony Walker Jr. on a rollout to his right and found Diontay Johnson for a 13-yard first-down completion on his first play from scrimmage. Despite the drive stalling before midfield Coach Mike Tomlin gave Trubisky a low-five of encouragement as he jogged to the sideline.

Trubisky stepped up in the pocket against heavy pressure in the second quarter and found a wide-open Johnson for another first-down completion. He later scored on a run toward the Dawg Pound as Pittsburgh took a 14-13 lead late in the opening half.

“I was reading the end and pulled it” Trubisky said. “The O-line did a great job with their blocks. Pat (Freiermuth) had a great block and we got in the end zone.”

#NHfootball Mitch Trubisky discusses half-over-half inconsistency in the Steelers' 29-16 loss to the Browns pic.twitter.com/caijWoQpFk — Chris Lillstrung (@CLillstrungNH) September 23 2022

Trubisky was 9-for-13 passing for 109 yards in the first half including 6-for-7 for 65 yards in the opening quarter.

It’s not to say the emotion wasn’t visible on occasion.

On a designed run late in the third Trubisky felt as if he had more room if he could have avoided an arm swinging out for a trip tackle pounding his hand on the ground three times.

As Trubisky and the Steelers took over down 23-14 early in the fourth the pressure under which the QB finds himself was summarized in one tweet by Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio: “It’s time for Mitch to save his job.”

It’s time for Mitch to save his job. — ProFootballTalk (@ProFootballTalk) September 23 2022

Then came a three-and-out likely intensifying the chatter even more.

Then a sack forcing a punt when the Steelers got the ball back still down nine making the noise louder.

“I just think we missed some plays that we had that could have went either way especially in the second half” Trubisky said.

“It’s only going to get better if we stick together.”

Preceding a drive in the second quarter down 13-7 Metallica’s “For Whom The Bell Tolls” blasted.

Trubisky — who exchanged jerseys postgame with his fellow 2012 Tony Fisher award recipient Kareem Hunt — remains hopeful the bell hasn’t tolled yet on his time as the Steelers’ starter.

“I feel like I’m in a good rhythm with my routine” Trubisky said. “I felt good tonight. We’ve just got to be better in the second half.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlaXJ0b25kYWlseXRpbWVzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGVzLzIwMjIvMDkvbXItYW5kLW1ycy1qb2huLXctdGFyci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mr. and Mrs. John W.

Ninth St. according to a news release.

The 25-year-old Milwaukee brewery's last day of business at the 43000-square-foot space in the Pabst Brewery District was Aug. 30 a few years after it moved in there in 2019.

More:Milwaukee Brewing Co. is closing and selling its taproom near Fiserv Forum to a 'new brewery'

Pilot Project Brewing is buying the site which includes a production facility taproom and event space thanks to $8 million in fundraising led by Chicago-based investment group InvestBev.

Pilot Project's website describes itself as ""a launch pad for start-up breweries offering assistance with fine-tuning recipes production business development marketing distribution.""

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

Since it began in 2019 Pilot Project Brewing has launched 13 start-up breweries including Luna Bay Hard Kombucha ROVM Hard Kombucha Funkytown Brewery Azadi Brewing and others.

The expansion to Milwaukee will help the company grow so it can support its current brands and add more brands in the future.

""The response was very positive and as far as we know we're the only business doing what we do in this industry and we ended up filling our capacity very quickly"" Pilot Project’s co-founder and CEO Dan Abel told the Journal Sentinel. ""Around June last year my business partner and I looked at each other and said let's look for our next location. Let's get a bigger spot.

""We heard rumblings that the Milwaukee Brewing Company was open to selling"" Abel said. ""We met with the team here and we were pretty blown away. It's an absolutely beautiful facility and is the perfect size for the next step.""

Abel and his business partner Jordan Radke both graduated from the University of Wisconsin. Abel said opening the Milwaukee location was a homecoming of sorts.

""Most of our friends are here and a lot of our supporters of our Chicago operation are here"" Abel said. ""It was kind of a serendipitous.""

Pilot Project Brewing will also continue operations at its current site 2140 N. Milwaukee Ave. in Chicago in the Logan Square neighborhood.

It will invite back previous breweries that outgrew the Chicago space which could produce up to 30 barrels of product at the time to Milwaukee where the smallest batch is 30 barrels of product.

The production space in Milwaukee could give Wisconsin brewers an advantage Abel said. About half of Pilot Project's brewers are from Chicago and others are from around the nation.

""I would like to think that we're going to be a strong resource for potential brewery owners in Milwaukee to take the leap and even further into Wisconsin. I see that as a natural step"" Abel said. ""Us coming from Wisconsin we're excited to give that opportunity to a local brewer.""

Pilot Project said it will ""refresh the Milwaukee Brewing Company building including its beer garden rooftop restaurant and tasting room.""

Abel said they are looking to open later this fall with food and four or five brewers already involved in the Pilot Project operation.

Any events previously scheduled in the events space run by Noble Catering and the Bottle House 42 restaurant at the site will be honored and managed by the Noble Catering team.

Milwaukee Brewing Company also announced in March that it was looking for someone to take over its brands and leases including the Milwaukee Ale House at 233 N Water St. which closed Sept. 11.

No announcements have been made regarding the sale of Milwaukee Brewing Company brands or the Ale House space.

At a ceremony filled with music and an ongoing art installation by student Ana Monteiro which honored the history of the site as the original home of Native Americans and the 19th-century Halsey Street Episcopal Church the facility was hailed as a marriage of form and function.

“This building perfectly exemplifies the seamless relationship between physical infrastructure and social infrastructure. It demonstrates how much space and place can invite intellectual and cultural and social interaction. You build it and they will come—and make a difference in the world"" said Rutgers-Newark Chancellor Nancy Cantor. “We wanted to make this a meeting place a center of innovation dialogue debate and collaborative learning.”

She reminded students at the event that the HLLC was created for them and their dreams of building a more equitable world. “You make real what it means to celebrate the lived experiences of our students the next generation of changemakers doubling down on social justice’’ she said.

Created in 2015 the Rutgers-Newark HLLC is an intergenerational learning and residential community that enrolls scholars ranging in age from 18 to 60. They encompass a diversity of experiences including first-generation college students transfer students and those who are parents. Half are from the city of Newark. The program has been recognized nationally for reimagining honors programs including the use of an in-depth holistic admissions process to identify exceptional students.

The 320000-square-foot HLLC building located on New Street can house 390 students and includes a range of learning and meeting areas designed to foster conversation. The Global Piazza between Halsey and Washington Streets features a variety of illuminated words in 20 languages and is open to the public. It will be bordered by street-level shops eateries gallery space and facilities to support urban entrepreneurship.

At the ceremony Rutgers University President Jonathan Holloway praised the HLLC as the embodiment of American ideals. “It speaks to what drew me to Rutgers. It represents the democratic possibilities of this country a place that draws together people from different races ethnicities economic situations neighborhoods and communities and exposes them to life changing opportunities.’’

He added “Excellence can be found everywhere. We just need to look for it find it and nurture it. We know from looking around this room that seeking and cultivating talent produces amazing results.’’

HLLC Dean Timothy Eatman extolled the importance of diversity. “The notion of diversity swirls within this place and we will make sure that these scholars don’t forget it’’ he promised.

He noted that one goal of the HLLC was to ensure that it is replicated beyond the city a process that is underway as other schools in the U.S. have shown interest in incorporating aspects of the program. He quoted the chancellor. “She said it was insufficient for it to just be in Newark.’’

Two HLLC students and a graduate also spoke at the event.

Spoken word artist Sherish Taqueen described the HLLC as a catalyst for creativity and intellectual excitement. “It encouraged every idea and soon the ideas began to overflow’’ she said. “The journey you begin here is one that is endless.’’

Veronica Torres a Criminal Justice major described a sense of belonging and security. “I have never been so supported in a space as I am in this building.’’

Graduate Ty-Lynn Johnson a Rutgers Business School alumnus and now an investment analyst at Black Rock said support from his HLLC network helped him overcome self-doubt and seize opportunity. As he struggled against “imposter syndrome’’ an HLLC friend encouraged him. “He said ‘you need to be in that seat because if you’re not more of you will never get in that seat.’’’

In addition to the speakers there were musical performances by a drum group led by Timothy Ogunbiyi and Melaine R. Hill an assistant professor of American Literature in the Department of English and nationally renowned gospel violinist. Vincent Mann Turtle Clan Chief of the Ramapough Lenape Nation gave a “land acknowledgement’’ to open the ceremony. Shane Harris Prudential Financial vice president for social responsibility and president of the Prudential Foundation also gave remarks highlighting their gift to the HLLC to create the Prudential Scholars Program as a signature investment made in the future of Newark.

The Prudential Scholars Program is supported through a $10 million gift to the Pro-Social Entrepreneurship Pathway an HLLC academic program that includes the Urban Solutions Lab where students explore ways to remake urban America with a special focus on efforts within Newark. The lab is also supported by the PSE&G Foundation. The Science Technology Engineering Arts and Math (STEAM) Pathway an additional program supported by the PSE&G Foundation provides opportunities to integrate science across disciplines.

The Price Humanities Scholarship Program created with funding from the Mellon Foundation fosters the next generation of humanities scholars. The Rutgers-Newark BOLD Women’s Leadership Network launched with support from the Helen Gurley Brown Foundation helps women HLLC scholars develop leadership skills and pursue career objectives.

Also supporting academic programs within the HLLC space is Fiserv Inc. which is funding the Fiserv-RU-N Program for Inclusive Innovation an effort that will serve as a research and incubation space for the RU-N community and local businesses in addition to providing RU-N student scholarships. The program center is located on the ground floor of the HLLC building bordered by the piazza.

Why it’s worth watching: Only a few neobanks have built their own core banking platform like Current and One. Many rely on core services from fintechs like FIS Fiserv and Jack Henry. But partnerships with fintechs are now drawing increased scrutiny

Earlier this month the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) ordered Virginia-based Blue Ridge Bank to better monitor its fintech partnerships and better manage the risks they impose to customers.

to its fintech partnerships and better manage the risks they impose to customers. Also in September OCC Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu warned that the loosely regulated fintech sector is introducing systematic risk into the banking industry and that risk could escalate into a major problem or even a financial crisis .

The more operations that a neobank can control the less it exposes itself to third-party risk.

Core banking on the cloud: One notable detail went missing from the press release: Was Stash Core developed using cloud technology? Mambu which is powering the ledger is a cloud-first partner and many of the connections to Stash Core are made through APIs but it’s unclear where Stash Core itself is housed. Stash could have missed out on a big opportunity ."

Just under a year ago Ford announced what it described as its largest-ever manufacturing investment. The company and partner SK Innovation are spending $11.4 billion and adding 11000 new jobs to build EVs and assemble battery packs at campuses in Tennessee and Kentucky.

BlueOval City is slated to include a vehicle assembly plant a battery plant jointly operated by Ford and SK as well as supplier facilities and battery recycling operations. The roughly six-square-mile campus is being built on the outskirts of a small town called Stanton in a rural part of West Tennessee. The project site is situated on the Memphis Regional Megasite a massive greenfield site northeast of Memphis that state and local officials spent years preparing for a large-scale development of this kind.

When the campus is fully operational it's slated to employ nearly 6000 people. It will support production of the next generation of electric F-Series pickup trucks on which Ford has not yet provided additional details. Production is scheduled to start in 2025.

Ford said Friday that structural steel has gone up on the site. And since site preparation began earlier this year the automaker said that crews have moved more than 4.6 million cubic yards of soil; laid nearly 370000 tons of stone; and installed more than 4600 deep foundations.

“We are building the future right here in West Tennessee” Eric Grubb Ford’s director of new footprint construction said in a statement. “This facility is the blueprint for Ford’s future manufacturing facilities and will enable Ford to help lead America’s shift to electric vehicles.”

In a statement Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said the project would ""have a transformational impact on Tennesseans and our economy and we're proud this global company will call Haywood County home.""

Ford is targeting annual EV production of 600000 units by the end of next year and 2 million by late 2026. The addition of BlueOval City will play a key role in helping Ford scale up EV production.

DETROIT – Recent supply chain problems for Ford Motor have included a small yet important part for the company and its vehicles – the blue oval badges that don nearly every vehicle for its namesake brand.

The Detroit automaker has experienced shortages with the Ford badges as well as the nameplates that specify the model a Ford spokesman confirmed to CNBC. The Wall Street Journal first reported the problem including badges for its F-Series pickups on Friday citing anonymous sources.

The issue is the latest is a yearslong supply chain crisis that has ranged from critical parts such as semiconductor chips and wire harnesses to raw materials and now vehicle badges.

The Journal reported a Michigan-based supplier called Tribar Technologies that has made badges for Ford in the past had to limit operations in August after disclosing to Michigan regulators it had discharged industrial chemicals into a local sewer system.

A message seeking comment from Tribar was not immediately answered. Ford declined to comment on whether Tribar's limited operations were connected to the automaker's name-badge shortage.

A spokesman also declined to comment on how many vehicles have been impacted by the problem.

The report comes after Ford on Monday said said parts shortages have affected roughly 40000 to 45000 vehicles primarily high-margin trucks and SUVs that haven't been able to reach dealers. Ford also said at the time that it expects to book an extra $1 billion in unexpected supplier costs during the third quarter.

The announcement earlier this week including a pre-release of some earnings expectations caused Ford's stock to have its worst day in more than 11 years.

Separately Ford on Thursday announced plans to restructure its global supply chain to ""support efficient and reliable sourcing of components internal development of key technologies and capabilities and world-class cost and quality execution.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb21tZXJjaWFsYXBwZWFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL2ZvcmQtaW4tdGVubmVzc2VlLWJsdWUtb3ZhbC1jaXR5LWVsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGVzLzY5NTExMjI3MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford breaks ground on Blue Oval City in Tennessee,"Ford Motor Co. has officially broken ground on BlueOval City in Haywood County nearly one year after the $5.6 billion project was announced.

Structural steel is erected at the site that in 2025 is expected to begin production of a “revolutionary all-new electric truck” and advanced electric batteries for future Ford and Lincoln vehicles.

“We are building the future right here in West Tennessee” said Eric Grubb Ford’s director of new footprint construction in a news release. “This facility is the blueprint for Ford’s future manufacturing facilities and will enable Ford to help lead America’s shift to electric vehicles.”

Ford and SK On — a South Korean company that is part of the joint venture for BlueOval City — plan to create about 5800 jobs at a 3600-acre site in Stanton about 40 miles northeast of Memphis. Land leveling began at BlueOval City this spring as the first couple hundred construction workers appeared onsite.

In a news release Ford shared some details about the progress made in the past six months.

The Michigan automotive giant said crews have moved more than 4.6 million cubic yards of soil — enough to fill approximately 34500 swimming pools. Nearly 370000 tons of stone have been laid the weight of more than 1600 Statues of Liberty. Also more than 4600 deep foundations have been installed at the 6-square-mile mega campus totaling the height of approximately 176 Eiffel Towers when put end to end.

At the beginning of 2022 Ford hired Walbridge a Detroit-based contractor as the project’s lead construction firm. Next summer an estimated peak of 6000 construction workers are expected to be onsite each day.

BlueOval City is expected to be Ford’s largest most advanced auto production complex in the company’s 119-year history. The company hopes BlueOval City will accelerate its target of 2 million EVs produced annually by late 2026.

“Ford’s historic investment in West Tennessee is a testament to our state’s strong business climate and unmatched workforce” Gov. Bill Lee said in a statement. “BlueOval City will have a transformational impact on Tennesseans and our economy and we’re proud this global company will call Haywood County home.”

The site which is nearly 6 square miles is no longer just a big vacant plot in Tennessee.

Now home to BlueOval City so named for the Ford logo both Ford of Dearborn and SK Innovation of South Korea are moving forward with their joint $5.6 billion investment in an assembly plant that will build the next ""all-electric revolutionary"" truck and batteries. It will be Ford's first major presence in the deep South a region that is home to factories owned by Honda Toyota Lexus Volkswagen Kia Hyundai and Tesla.

Ford CEO Jim Farley is planning to begin production at the new factory in 2025 with a goal of building 2 million electric Ford and Lincoln vehicles a year globally by the end of 2026 the company said again Friday. A year ago the partnership revealed plans that estimated 5800 new jobs in Kentucky.

“We are building the future right here in West Tennessee” Eric Grubb Ford’s director of new footprint construction said in a statement. “This facility is the blueprint for Ford’s future manufacturing facilities and will enable Ford to help lead America’s shift to electric vehicles.”

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee a Republican said in a statement released by Ford that BlueOval City ""will have a transformational impact on Tennesseans"" and the economy far beyond the Hayward County town of Stanton.

Over the past year Ford has talked with Tennesseans who will be affected by the project both in person and through livestreamed discussions Ford said.

The construction team began preparing the land in March.

So far Ford said crews have:

Moved more than 4.6 million cubic yards of soil enough to fill some 34500 swimming pools.

Installed more than 4600 ""deep foundations"" which are watertight steel chambers that look like chicken wire tubes that range in length from 40 to 80 feet and are used to construct the foundation. If placed end to end the deep foundations would equal the length of approximately 176 Eiffel Tower structures.

Protecting water quality in the area is a major issue for Tennesseans.

The Memphis Sands aquifer sits beneath the project site.

""In the aquifer sheets of clay and water-saturated sands go down 3500 vertical feet stacked like a layered cake. But in a thin area stretched between the Mississippi and Kentucky borderlines is an absence of clay near the surface where rainwater can infiltrate into the ground quickly and directly replenish a water source that more than a million people rely on for drinking water"" said the Tennessee Lookout on Jan. 3 2021.

""Part of this recharge zone is underneath Ford’s megasite that spans nearly 6 square miles — almost the same size as downtown Memphis"" the article said.

Ford is working with the University of Tennessee to restore the stream waters flowing through the University’s Lone Oaks Farm the company said in its news release. Ford is also investing to expand STEM education for Tennessee students in kindergarten through 12th grade so that they'll be better prepared for careers in science and technology.

Fortinet VMware Cisco Drive SD-WAN Gartner Magic Quadrant

Single-Vendor SASE Surge Expected to Fuel Convergence of SD-WAN SSE Capabilities

Image: Gartner

Perennial leaders Fortinet and VMware and a surging Cisco set themselves apart from the rest of the pack in SD-WAN according to the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant report.

See Also: OnDemand | Simplifying your Security Stack with SSE Integration

Platform security giant Fortinet and virtualization behemoth VMware once again took the gold and silver in ability to execute in SD-WAN with Cisco leapfrogging both Versa Networks and Palo Alto Networks to capture the bronze. Gartner sees a large and growing gap in execution ability between those three and the other vendors it designated SD-WAN leaders: Palo Alto Networks Versa Networks and HPE Aruba.

""When clients are asking about who's included in RFPs who's being finalized who's being selected there is separation"" Jonathan Forest Gartner senior director and analyst tells Information Security Media Group. ""There is separation by some of the higher market share vendors.""

Cisco Fortinet and VMware respectively were the three SD-WAN market share leaders in 2021 with Versa Networks and HPE Aruba capturing fourth and fifth place market research firm Dell'Oro Group said in March. The worldwide SD-WAN market expanded by 35% in 2021 to more than $2 billion and the eight largest SD-WAN vendors accounted for more than 80% of revenue last year Dell'Oro Group found.

From a completeness of vision perspective Gartner found Palo Alto Networks and VMware were once against neck and neck with Palo Alto Networks taking the gold this time around. Fortinet leapfrogged Cisco and Versa Networks for the bronze in completeness of SD-WAN vision with Cisco and Versa falling to fourth and fifth place. HPE Aruba was last among the leaders in both execution ability and completeness of vision.

""There is some stability"" Forest says. ""There's enough deployments enough evidence of product deployment capabilities and overall everything we evaluate in the Magic Quadrant to make that assessment on what these vendors have done. So I do believe there's a track record and a certain level of maturity in this market.""

Outside of the leaders here's how Gartner sees the SD-WAN market:

Visionary: Juniper Networks

Juniper Networks Challenger: Huawei

Huawei Niche Players: Cradlepoint Barracuda Networks Nuage Networks Peplink Citrix and Forcepoint

""Things can change on a dime"" Forest says. ""Acquisitions can happen that can change things pretty quickly as can new development of products and new positions on innovation that disrupt the market. Things can always change.""

The Surge of Single-Vendor SASE

Gartner expects the share of organizations procuring both SD-WAN and security service edge from the same supplier will increase from 10% this year to 50% in 2025. Although secure access service edge is today dominated by multivendor solutions with orchestration tying them together Gartner says single-vendor SASE will simplify sourcing and offer a tighter technical integration and better user experience.

Most organizations today are using different vendors for SD-WAN and SSE due to unique requirements or differences in opinion between the networking and security departments Forest says. But as refresh cycles occur smaller vendors without rigid specific requirements will begin selecting one supplier for both SD-WAN and SSE and adoption will slowly move upstream to the midmarket and lower enterprise.

Some large enterprises with unique requirements will maintain separate SSE and SD-WAN vendors for the foreseeable future but Forest believes most customers will eventually converge on a single vendor to reduce complexity and simplify management. The consolidation to date has primarily been driven by SD-WAN vendors and the leading cloud security vendors are just beginning to buy their way into SD-WAN.

""Clients want less vendors"" Forest says. ""It's less complexity which from the security side makes sense because that reduces risk. Cost is part of it but not a driver. It's more about manageability and just reducing the attack surface.""

Fortinet Focuses on App Connectivity SD-Branch

Fortinet's SD-WAN business has focused over the past year on secure application connectivity SASE use cases SD-Branch opportunities and public cloud integration says Vice President of Products Nirav Shah. The company has built ZTNA enforcement into its SD-WAN offering to ensure adversaries aren't able to move laterally across the customer's entire application landscape in the event of compromise he says.

The company's SD-Branch investments will address the needs of big retail and healthcare environments by integrating LTE and 5G inside the SD-WAN appliance providing retail locations with 5G connectivity as well as Dual SIM card Shah says. And from a SASE perspective Shah says Fortinet offers customers flexibility by delivering its security and networking capabilities either on-premises or through the cloud (see: Ken Xie on Why Fortinet Is Leaning Into SD-WAN OT Security).

""We continue to lead the SD-WAN market and continue improving in execution and vision"" Shah tells ISMG. ""If you compare from last year to this year we are the only leader to improve in both execution and vision at the same time. No other vendor in the leadership quadrant could do that. So that speaks volumes to how well we are addressing any concern that customers or analysts have.""

Gartner criticized Fortinet for an average customer experience limited mind share in networking and limited third-party SSE integrations. Shah says Fortinet has invested heavily in building its networking practice out and becoming a key player in both wired and wireless LAN. From a partnership perspective Shah says Fortinet plans to deliver single-vendor SASE and isn't looking to team up with competitors.

""Our SD-WAN is a foundation for SASE because we can do the security and networking convergence that customers want"" Shah says. ""We want to take advantage of providing a single-vendor SASE architecture. And that's why you will not see Fortinet integrating with the other SSE players out there.""

VMware Doubles Down on 5G Integration Security Services

Over the past year VMware has enhanced its security capabilities and integrated private 5G services into its SD-WAN offering says Karl Brown senior director of product marketing for SD-WAN. Healthcare organizations manufacturers and retailers want to connect intelligent devices to 5G during their digital transformation efforts to improve service quality reduce latency and better support branch locations.

The company supports the security needs for cloud and SaaS applications through a bundled offering that allows customers to view analytics around application performance and network traffic and easily apply policies across all applications Brown says. VMware delivers its cloud web security technology from 150 cities to give users a direct path from where they're located to where their apps are hosted (see: VMware Doubles Down on Multi-Cloud Lateral Movement Defense).

""We make it extremely easy for our customers to connect their remote branch locations to cloud and SaaS applications"" Brown tells ISMG. ""We take away the complexity of trying to put appliances in multiple cloud locations and interconnect the users with those applications in the cloud. We make it extremely easy to deliver high-performance SaaS applications.""

Gartner criticized VMware for basic on-premises security product dependency and concerns around the Broadcom acquisition. Brown says Menlo Security's cloud protection offerings are fully integrated and benefit from close collaboration around the road map. VMware wants to extend its on-premises security offering beyond an existing firewall that's often used by customers in branch office locations.

""There is a segment of our customer base and potential customers that would like additional security in the appliance which would augment our cloud-delivered security services"" Brown says. ""We do fully intend to deliver upon that request from those customers.""

Cisco Emphasizes Network Visibility Public Cloud Partners

Cisco has strengthened its SD-WAN offering by providing more network visibility deep integrations with public cloud providers and additional security features and performance says Jay Chokshi director of product management for secure SD-WAN and SASE. Cisco has unveiled enhanced firewall capabilities and troubleshooting analysis as well as a Meraki platform with 33% enhanced performance he says.

Integrating Meraki and Viptela with ThousandEyes gives customers visibility into networks they don't control allowing them to spot outages and deep breaches across the broader internet sooner Chokshi says. Cisco also created a robust secure connection to public cloud that's simple to set up and makes it easy for customers to move applications to the cloud and access data in the cloud he says.

""The networking and security constructs are becoming increasingly complex"" Chokshi tells ISMG. ""The networks are becoming very complex. So bringing simpler security to the operations piece is very important. I think that's a big thing.""

Gartner criticized Cisco for having multiple platforms an average product and an average customer experience. Chokshi says Cisco has driven simplified operations across its products by investing in user experience and creating a simple intuitive workflow experience. Meraki allows Cisco to address SMBs' need for simplicity and lean operations while Viptela offers sophisticated features for enterprises.

""The market is very big. There are different segments of the market that have different needs"" Chokshi says. ""We have been able to bring a lot of what our customers are asking for by offering both Meraki and Viptela. In addition many of our customers are leveraging both the portfolios in their network.""

Palo Alto Networks Takes 5G Digital Experience to Next Level

Palo Alto Networks has bolstered its SD-WAN offering with native integrated 5G autonomous digital experience management and tighter SASE connections says Kumar Ramachandran senior vice president for SASE products. Integrating Prisma SD-WAN with Prisma Access' ZTNA capabilities gives customers the flexibility to select what components they want based on their deployment he says.

Native integrated 5G means customers will enjoy the best possible performance and availability in branch offices while no longer deploying a separate device Ramachandran says. And autonomous digital experience management provides deep visibility into application experience network behavior and user behavior automating application delivery and the resolution of performance issues he says (see: Why Would Palo Alto Networks Want Startup Apiiro for $600M?).

""Our SD-WAN solution is very focused on delivering the best possible user experience irrespective of the connectivity"" Ramachandran tells ISMG. ""You get this very very powerful user experience-based approach.""

Gartner criticized Palo Alto Networks for below-average customer experience below-average sales execution and limited on-premises security with SD-WAN. Ramachandran says the company has focused on bolstering both direct and MSP sales via a managed services partnership with AT&T. The company offers a full-blown firewall in the branch though he says most clients prefer cloud delivery.

""The cloud offers lots of advantages over taking a different security box and deploying it in the branch"" Ramachandran says. ""We get the elasticity of the cloud at the branch.""

Versa Networks Pursues Simplification Via AI ML

Versa has created a natural language processing chatbot and anomaly engine for network and security insights to more effectively leverage AI and ML-based technologies around SD-WAN says CEO Kelly Ahuja. Automating functions helps enterprises go faster save money and be agile by having machines do the basic work meaning organizations no longer need an army of employees troubleshooting security issues.

Vera's new chatbot allows users to ask questions in the management console using normal language and applies fixes with the click of a button greatly simplifying how enterprises interact with Versa's system Ahuja says. And the anomaly engine examines telemetry wherever software is running correlates data from all of those places identifies patterns and reports abnormalities back to customers she says.

""From a technology standpoint our solution is head and shoulders above the market based on what our customers are telling us"" Ahuja tells ISMG. ""In certain segments and certain geographies we're actually beating many of the other competitors hands down.""

Gartner criticized Versa Networks for product complexity poor customer experience and less DIY experience. Ahuja says Versa has done a lot of work to simplify its workflows with a well-lit path and said it provides comprehensive capabilities around routing appliances and security. Most customers are served via Versa's 150 service providers though many Global 2000 firms run directly on Versa he says.

""We have the most comprehensive understanding of the market and a full solution that covers both networking and security which is where the market is heading"" Ahuja says. ""So we are very very well-positioned to continue to lead the market and build and grow the business.""

HPE Aruba Doubles Down on Single Console Branch Security

HPE Aruba has worked in recent years to collapse WAN edge functions around routing firewalls and optimization into a single management console to simplify management and reduce human error says Derek Granath senior director of SD-WAN product and technical marketing. The company has teamed up to leverage user and device identity and role-based access control to enable segmentation he says.

The company has replaced branch firewalls by adding security functions at the branch such as dynamic path control and unified threat management and integrating with Palo Alto Networks and Check Point offerings he says. HPE Aruba also has increased its intrusion detection capability over the past year with prevention technology correlation of user identity and defense and mitigation features that isolate traffic he says.

""We've always been about improving performance on the WAN"" Granath tells ISMG. ""We have certain features that we think we do better than anybody such as our ability to run reliably on the internet even when it becomes impaired because of congestion.""

Gartner criticized HPE Aruba for an incomplete security road map limited geographic and vertical strategy and below-average customer experience. Granath said HPE Aruba has customers in every vertical and excels in financial services technology manufacturing and retail. From a security perspective HPE Aruba automates integrations with Zscaler and Netskope to make accessing SSE easier he says.

""There's no single SASE vendor that can tick all of the boxes for security and all of the boxes for the network"" Granath says. ""A dual or multivendor solution means customers don't have to compromise on either the security side or the network side.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNjb3JlLmNvbS9wZ2EvbmV3cy8yNDI5NDQz0gEtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc2NvcmUuY29tL3BnYS9uZXdzLzI0Mjk0NDMvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Homa: 'Money cannot buy' feeling on 18th hole at Presidents Cup,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNjb3JlLmNvbS9wZ2EvbmV3cy8yNDI5NDQz0gEtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc2NvcmUuY29tL3BnYS9uZXdzLzI0Mjk0NDMvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673ECC5D80>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

A defamation lawsuit launched by Lachlan Murdoch the eldest son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch against Australian news website Crikey had its first day in court on Friday.

Mr Murdoch who is the Fox Corp chief executive and News Corp co-chairman is suing Private Media over an opinion piece about the storming of the US Capitol.

He claims he was defamed in the article by Crikey’s political editor Bernard Keane which was headlined: “Trump is a confirmed unhinged traitor. And Murdoch is his unindicted co-conspirator.”

The first day of proceedings was taken up by legal argument over the terms of the defence and the case will return to court on October 10.

In its defence filed with the court on Friday Crikey argued the opinion piece was in the public interest.

Last month Crikey posted a full-page advertisement in The New York Times that invited the lawsuit saying it wanted to “test this important issue of freedom of public interest journalism in a courtroom”.

The defamation lawsuit was filed the following day.

The website has framed the battle as one of free speech and highlighted differences in size and wealth between itself and the companies owned by the Murdoch family.

It has launched a Go Fund Me for its defence and in a statement released on Thursday chief executive Will Hayward said: “We think it is important in an open well-functioning society that the rich and powerful can be critiqued.”

In a statement of claim a lawyer representing Mr Murdoch accused Crikey of using the situation for “self-promotion” and to “publicise the Crikey website and increase subscribers” and said the claim of public interest journalism was “disingenuous”."

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) a measure of inflation rose 8.3% annually in August a slight improvement from 8.5% in July the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said. This marked the second consecutive month of decreases to the annual inflation rate.

The latest CPI data showed that the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) could be 8.7% for 2023 according to The Senior Citizens League. This is down from the group's forecast last month when it said benefits could increase by as much as 9.6% next year. But while this increase is lower than previously forecasted it will still be the highest increase ever received by most Social Security beneficiaries alive today the group said.

Last year Social Security benefits rose by 5.9%. If benefits increase by 8.7% in 2023 it will be the highest increase since 1981 when high inflation pushed COLA to 11.2% according to the Social Security Administration (SSA).

If you are preparing for your retirement you could consider using a personal loan to help you pay off debt at a lower interest rate saving you money each month. Visit Credible to find your personalized interest rate without affecting your credit score.

INFLATION IMPROVES SLIGHTLY IN AUGUST FOR SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH — WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU

Average Social Security increase for seniors

A COLA increase of 8.7% next year means the average Social Security recipient would receive $1656 in monthly benefits and would see an increase of $144.10 per month according to The Senior Citizens League. In order to see what your exact increase would be retirees can multiply their current check amounts by .087.

The SSA will likely announce 2023’s Social Security increase in mid-October after the release of September’s inflation data. The new benefit amount will take effect in January 2023.

""COLAs are intended to help maintain the buying power of Social Security benefits when prices rise"" The Senior Citizens League said in its forecast. ""They are a permanent increase that will gradually boost the total Social Security income that individuals will receive over the course of their retirement. Without a COLA that adequately keeps pace with inflation Social Security benefits purchase less and less over time and that can create hardships especially as older Americans live longer lives in retirement.""

If you are retired or are preparing to retire paying down debt with a personal loan can help you reduce your interest rate and your monthly expenses. You can visit Credible to compare multiple personal loan lenders at once and choose the one with the best interest rate for you.

AMERICANS COUNTER CONSUMER PRODUCT 'SHRINKFLATION' WITH NEW SPENDING HABITS SURVEY SAYS

More Americans changing their spending habits as inflation surges

As inflation remains near its 40-year high many Americans have begun to cope by changing their spending habits according to a recent survey from Morning Consult. Many consumers also said that they have noticed the product size of their purchases is shrinking in a phenomenon dubbed ""shrinkflation.""

The survey said 54% of Americans have seen read or heard something about shrinkflation and 64% are worried about it. About 48% of Americans said they bought a different brand when confronted with shrinkflation and 49% said they chose a generic product instead according to Morning Consult.

Although inflation improved over the past two months it remains at levels not seen since the 1980s. The Federal Reserve has continued to raise interest rates in order to combat rising inflation but there are discussions on how these actions could potentially impact the U.S. economy.

If you are struggling with rising costs and are looking to reduce your expenses you could consider using a personal loan to help pay down debt at a lower interest rate. Contact Credible to speak to a loan expert and see if this is the right option for you.

In the lawsuit Cooper accused her then-employer Franklin Templeton of defamation not properly investigating the incident and discriminating against her on the basis of her race and sex according to Reuters.

On Wednesday Southern District of New York Judge Ronnie Abrams dismissed the lawsuit according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE. In the verdict Abrams wrote that the former insurance portfolio manager failed to prove her termination was because of her race or gender or that the company had defamed her and intentionally inflicted emotional distress.

Cooper made headlines on May 25 2020 when an altercation with Black birdwatcher Christian Cooper (no relation) went viral after it was captured on video. In the video Amy is seen calling the police on Christian after he asked her to leash her dog in a wooded area of Central Park where dogs are not allowed to be without a leash.

Christian said at the time that he approached Amy to remind her of the rule and he tried to bait the dog away from the plantings in the area using treats which was when Amy threatened to tell police she was being accosted by ""an African-American man.""

Amy initially apologized to Christian shortly after the incident telling WNBC at the time: ""It was unacceptable. And you know words are just words and I can't undo what I did. I sincerely and humbly apologize to everyone. Especially to that man his family.""

Cooper filed the lawsuit last year against Franklin Templeton its CEO and President Jenny Johnson and 10 John Does accusing the financial services firm of making public statements that ""created and nurtured"" the characterization of Cooper as ""a privileged white female 'Karen.'""

""Franklin Templeton perpetuated and legitimized the story of 'Karen' vs. an innocent African American to its perceived advantage with reckless disregard for the destruction of Plaintiff's life in the process"" the suit which was previously obtained by PEOPLE claims.

The asset management firm announced its decision to ""terminate"" Amy one day after the footage spread across social media.

""Following our internal review of the incident in Central Park yesterday we have made the decision to terminate the employee involved effective immediately"" the firm wrote on Twitter at the time. ""We do not tolerate racism of any kind at Franklin Templeton.""

A spokeswoman with Franklin Templeton told The Washington Post on Wednesday said the company was pleased with the outcome of the case.

""We continue to believe the company responded appropriately"" spokeswoman Lisa Gallegos told the newspaper.

EPA at the Supreme Court. At issue is the scope of the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate wetlands under the Clean Water Act.

More than 350 organizations states and members of Congress have filed amicus briefs in support of the Sacketts an Idaho couple who’ve been battling the EPA for 15 years for the right to build a home on a residential lot.

While the organizations and individuals filing amicus briefs are from different areas of the country and work in different industries their messages to the Court touch on many of the case’s key themes:

For decades the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers have defined the CWA’s key jurisdictional phrase—“waters of the United States”—beyond what Congress intended in order to expand their own power and aggrandize their jurisdictional authority. The agencies’ failure to adopt a workable definition of “waters of the United States” that clearly delimits the Act’s reach has frustrated both the regulated public and the federal courts. The agencies’ ever-expanding definition of “waters of the United States” violates Congress’s intent in the CWA to preserve the states’ traditional authority over the use and development of land and aquatic resources. Sound environmental policy and regulation do not require the limitless expansion of federal government power. The “significant nexus” test—which the agencies and some lower courts have employed to establish federal jurisdiction over wetlands—should be abandoned because it leaves millions of American property owners and businesses uncertain about how they’re legally allowed to use their land.



See all the amici supporting the Sacketts with selected excerpts below:

West Virginia and 25 other states

“If the CWA applies to any damp piece of land with an indeterminate ‘nexus’ to interstate waters then the Constitution’s and the statute’s balance among the sovereigns will come askew.”

“Water that is not a ‘water of the United States’ is not for that reason unprotected. Instead it is protected by state rather than federal law. Greater state authority over waters would not undermine the Act’s objective to ‘restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters’ 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a)—it would simply leave space for a different government body to further this objective. States have the prerogative and incentive to fill this space and to balance their power with facilitating local needs.”

“This case is not about what constitutes sound environmental policy. Instead it is about EPA’s longstanding efforts to circumvent statutory and constitutional limits on its regulatory power under the CWA by reimagining the statutory phrase ‘waters of the United States’ to encompass among other things parcels of land suitable for homebuilding as happened here. EPA’s regulatory approach is inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the statute and violates the structural limitations of federalism and separation of powers as well as infringing due process.”

“Since 1975 the Government’s interpretations of “navigable waters” have operated as a one-way ratchet to expand federal regulatory authority under the CWA … Those interpretations reached this Court on three occasions. Win or lose the Government responded the same way after each case: turn the ratchet again.”

Cato Institute Associated General Contractors of America Mountain States Legal Foundation NFIB Small Business Legal Center and Washington Legal Foundation

“For a statute that touches on millions of acres of land the lack of clarity is both dismaying and counterproductive.”

“In the past …. [the significant nexus] test has been justified on the assumption that broader federal jurisdiction is more conducive to the statute’s purpose of ‘restor[ing]and maintain[ing]the chemical physical and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters. …’ Such assumption merits caution. … Clarity and administrability rather than the breadth of federal jurisdiction alone are critical factors for whether a test advances the statute’s purpose. A vague test can cause federal enforcement efforts to be unfocused or haphazard make wetlands a liability for private landowners and breed ill will between landowners conservation interests and regulators. …”

“Complying with the law should not be this hard. Waters of true federal significance should be obvious. Properties should be bought sold and developed without undergoing months or even years of expert analysis. And people should understand the rules before they are fined and prosecuted. These are foundation aspects of our private property and due process rights. The Agencies and the regulated community needs this Court’s direction to rein in the behemoth WOTUS problem that has unfolded over the last few decades.”

“That these definitions bounce back and forth from administration to administration representing not a coherent policy of Congress but the whim of executive preference further renders the agencies’ authority suspect.”

“Continued federal expansion into environmental protection and conservation will box out and preempt more effective responsive state and local efforts.”

National Stone Sand & Gravel Association and the American Road & Transportation Builders Association

“The fundamental problem with ‘significant nexus’ a term that does not appear anywhere in the Clean Water Act is that it has no inherent limiting principles. It empowers the agencies to assert CWA jurisdiction over any wetland adjacent to a water feature with an intermittent remote or indirect connection to a navigable water and expands CWA jurisdiction well beyond the limits set by Congress.”

Atlantic Legal Foundation  Conservatives for Property Rights and Committee for Justice

“Throughout the United States there are countless other landowners who like Petitioners are knowingly (or unknowingly) precluded from using their property in any economically viable way because of the federal government’s expansive view of wetlands.”

“Without clarity about the meaning of WOTUS farm operations carry the risk of substantial civil penalties criminal fines and imprisonment for even negligent violations and costly-to-defend suits by environmental activists. …. Avoiding those risks means foregoing all practical use of an area of a farm that might be WOTUS—for the Agencies may treat even building a fence in a wetland as a violation of the CWA let alone moving dirt spreading fertilizer or other active farming.”

Associated Industries of Florida and the Florida H 2 0 Coalition

“By broadly empowering EPA and the Corps to assert federal authority over any wetland or surface water with even a remote theoretical connection to traditional navigable waters the significant nexus test interferes with the traditional state and local power. It coerces applicants acquiesce to federal jurisdiction to avoid the expense and time of determining what constitutes a significant nexus and to avoid lengthy and costly battles and litigation.”

“Unfortunately the boundaries of the CWA have been constantly changing due to the ‘significant nexus’ test developed in Rapanos v. United States 547 U.S. 715 (2006) and as interpreted by the government. These everchanging rules make it more costly for developers to purchase and develop land and these costs in turn make it difficult to provide homes that the public can afford.”

“A clearly delineated reading of ‘waters of the United States’ is critical for business and consistent with environmental protection. The reality is that permitting costs can and do inhibit project development including important climate clean energy resilience and water management projects. A clear and predictable understanding of ‘waters of the United States’ is needed to reduce these substantial costs and to ensure that they are not imposed more broadly than required.”

Wyoming Stock Growers Association Wyoming Association of Conservation Districts and Progressive Pathways

“[T]he practical effects of not knowing whether one’s lands or activities may fall within the auspices of the Clean Water Act are costly. Decades of ambiguous and subjective jurisdictional determinations have created significant uncertainty for landowners who are required to comply with the Clean Water Act as it is currently being applied by the agencies.”

Savannah Economic Development Authority Greenland Developers LLC and Resource & Land Consultants LLC

“[T]he persistent uncertainty has added hundreds of millions of dollars or more in permitting costs and frustrated—even prevented—warehousing and infrastructure development compounding post-pandemic supply-chain constraints.”

The Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence

“This case demonstrates that the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers have pulled off a naked power grab. Not only have they usurped the power of Congress to make the laws and the power of the courts to interpret those laws but they have also usurped state and local governments’ police power authority to regulate local land use.”

Farm Bureau of Arkansas and 19 Others

“In the decades since the CWA’s enactment however the federal government has attempted to increase its authority by regulating features that are wholly intrastate and that often are not recognizable as water bodies at all deeming them against both plain text and commonsense to constitute ‘waters of the United States.’”

“The ‘significant nexus’ test and the Corps assertions of jurisdiction unconstitutionally impose on a lay person a duty found nowhere at common law—a duty to retain a bevy of experts including an attorney biologist geologist hydrologist and countless others—to attempt to determine what the Act means before using their private property.”

American Exploration & Mining Association and 11 Other Mining Associations

“There is simply nothing in the text of the statute or in its legislative history to suggest Congress intended to exercise federal jurisdiction over all areas from which water molecules might someday travel to a navigable-in-fact water.”

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito Rep. Sam Graves and a Coalition of 199 Members of Congress

“In the CWA Congress selected language that from practically the Founding was understood both to exercise limited jurisdiction and to preserve the State’s traditional role as the principal regulators of local waters and lands. But this intent has now been turned on its head. Through the ‘significant nexus’ test the EPA and the Corps can use any ecological connection between land and nearby water as a pretext for intrusive central planning. This case presents an opportunity for the Court to finally put the genie back in the bottle …”

American Petroleum Institute Association of Oil Pipelines American Gas Association

“The absence of a clear rule as to what lands are in and what lands are out is not just a good-governance problem. It is detrimental to the Clean Water Act’s success. In order to protect ‘waters of the United States’ the statute requires regulated parties to obtain a permit before engaging in certain activities on covered property—and imposes severe civil and criminal penalties for a party’s failure to do so. If regulated parties lack adequate notice that their property is subject to the Act they run the risk of damaging protected waters and exposing themselves to crippling liability in the process.”

National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and Affiliated Organizations

“The impact of the significant nexus test to landowners relies almost entirely on how it is interpreted and applied by individual regulators. Regulated stakeholders have little opportunity clearly know what is prohibited because they are subject to the arbitrary application of an unclear standard.”

“Agencies cannot change a statute’s meaning years later by adopting rules that introduce new terms and use them in unnatural ways.”

“[R]egulated entities States and federal regulators all need a clearer and more easily-administrable standard in this notoriously unsettled area.”

Wearables are becoming a mainstay accessory in the public wardrobe. More and more people are starting to rely on the technology and the personalized data it provides. Some may even find it detects cardiac abnormalities. We turned to Jonathan Shirazi MD PPG – Cardiology for more on the intel we’re receiving from fitness bands smartwatches and smartphones.

Like anything having access to so much information and certainly reading too much into any information can lead to trouble. People can develop an anxiety over things they can measure. It’s important to absorb this data in moderation and try not to overthink it. That being said there are certainly some benefits to this technology.

How wearables work

Most wearables can detect a heart rate in one of two different ways. The most common way is through photoplethysmography a technology that uses a light sensor to detect changes in blood volume that can then be inferred as a heart rate. Does their blood change in an even amount every time? How frequently does the blood volume shift back and forth? This is the technology found in most Fitbit® and Garmin® models and early generation Apple Watches®.

Another means of determining the heart rate would be using what health care machines use monitoring the heart’s electrical activity to obtain a heart rate and in new generations of wearables even provide insight into the heart rhythm. Because it’s using the actual heart rate it tends to be more reliable for determining the heart’s rate and rhythm. This is the technology used by the latest generation Apple Watch and AliveCor® wearables.

Consumers must keep in mind that sensor errors the position of the device and other variables can alter the accuracy of wearables.

Wearables for wellness

I think of wearables as a tool for wellness in two ways. The benefit for the majority of people is the use of a wearable as a fitness tracker – a device that through the use of an accelerometer can count steps and determine overall heart rate. Even with some inaccuracies these devices still offer a general sense of baseline activity and baseline heart rate. This application is good for anyone trying to improve their health. If you want to increase your activity you need more steps or a higher heart rate. The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend that adults should aim for 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week.

As for the goal of 10000 steps a day that’s not necessarily the objective for all. For most the goal is to increase activity. So if you take on average 8000 steps a day and increase that to 10000 steps a day you would see improvements. Once you know your baseline you can set your own activity goal.

The second use is as an indicator of not just heart rate and pulse but the actual heart rhythm. Some newer wearables can tell if an individual’s heart rhythm is abnormal whether abnormally slow or abnormally fast this can be a useful tool for some patients who are struggling with feeling dizzy or light-headed experiencing palpitations erratic heartbeats shortness of breath etc. and those who suspect or are monitoring conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AFib) atrial flutter or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).

Individuals can look back through tracing data and see frequency and duration of instances. This could be a red flag and signal a provider to order an EKG or further evaluation.

Benefits of wearables

These devices certainly aren’t 100% accurate but I’ve seen a lot of patients benefit from wearables. They clue people into issues earlier and offer an opportunity for continual long-term monitoring. They are certainly not a replacement for clinically proven monitoring devices physicians use to detect abnormalities but they can be a useful weapon in the arsenal for information gathering.

The Apple Heart Study was recently presented at the national American College of Cardiology conference. People who wore an Apple Watch downloaded an app and were invited to enroll in a trial. The app would trigger the device to check the individual’s heart rate several times a day. If the pulse was irregular 5 out of 6 times they would receive an alert to contact one of the studies’ providers. Out of more than 400000 participants 2161 (0.5%) received an alert. When evaluating the results of those who were alerted and got their rhythm checked the Apple Watch had a positive predictive value 84% of the time when using 5/6 heart rate checks. It was accurate 71% of the time if the participant used 1/6 checks. Again while it’s not a replacement for an EKG or office visit it’s a great tool to have monitoring in the background.

When to see a doctor

First and foremost the way you feel is always the trump card. It’s the most important thing. If you feel like something is wrong or you’re experiencing symptoms you need to consult a physician. Just because a wearable says everything is normal doesn’t mean there aren’t other issues it’s not detecting.

Based on the output you’re receiving from your wearable consult a physician if you notice any irregular rhythm or if your heart rate is abnormally elevated when not exercising. Additionally if the heart rate is abnormally low during activity that may warrant an evaluation as well if you are experiencing symptoms of fatigue dizziness lightheadedness of shortness of breath.

For patients who have palpitations newer wearables that can detect and record the heart’s conduction system during those palpitations can be very informative. However one downside of this smart technology is that by the time the patient experiences symptoms and activates their device to start recording they may have missed the onset of the arrhythmia. There is a lot of valuable information in the beginning of the event. That’s why a tool like a Holter monitor can be so beneficial. Talk to your doctor about the appropriate evaluation of your symptoms and trust your instincts."

The race plan could not have gone any better for Gartner.

“It feels awesome” he said. “First race of my senior year; it’s a great way to start it off . . . I felt like I had more [left] which is great for my next couple of races.”

Gartner wanted to hang back among the leaders through the first mile as long as he kept pace. When he clocked in a sub-five-minute mile and still felt good he knew his legs could power him the rest of the way.

“You can’t win [the race] in the first mile but you can lose it” he said.

Coach Conor Markham said he and Gartner had been working on this strategy. He was impressed that Gartner took it to victory — but not surprised.

“If you saw the work that he puts in — this should happen” said Markham.

Veteran poise also proved superior in the earlier girls’ championship 5K. Brookline senior Camille Jordan went head-to-head with Cambridge sophomore Aoife Shovlin for most of the race and were deadlocked at the 3K mark. But Jordan had just enough extra in the tank winning in 18:19.7 with Shovlin (18:22.5) close behind.

“Towards the end I was kind of deciding whether or not I should hold back and see what I could do towards the finish or if I should just take the lead” said Jordan. “But I decided to kind of stay with her and let her get a little ahead so I could have a good finish.”

Jordan’s clocking left her prior PR in the dust by more than 90 seconds. Both she and coach Mike DeYoung credited a massive summer leap for building positive momentum for the fall.

“It felt really good” Jordan said. “I think I did a good job of training over the summer and just regaining my confidence in cross-country because normally I’m used to running track as my primary sport.”

Brookline also dominated in team scoring with just 37 points. The Warriors placed four runners in the top 11 finishers. For DeYoung the Frank Kelley was a quality first test for a team that should be a Division 1 front-runner.

“I would say people were about where I thought that they were given workouts and the work they did over the summer — maybe a little bit faster” he said. “But I know they’re a really talented group and super hard-working. They all ran over the summer [and] really dedicated themselves this summer to being the best they can be and I think that’s what you’re seeing.”

It was a tight field of runners at the start of the varsity girls' championship 5K. But Brookline senior Camille Jordan eventually gained separation to win the race. MARK STOCKWELL FOR THE BOSTON GLOBE

Fortinet VMware Cisco Drive SD-WAN Gartner Magic Quadrant

Single-Vendor SASE Surge Expected to Fuel Convergence of SD-WAN SSE Capabilities

Perennial leaders Fortinet and VMware and a surging Cisco set themselves apart from the rest of the pack in SD-WAN according to the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant report.

Platform security giant Fortinet and virtualization behemoth VMware once again took the gold and silver in ability to execute in SD-WAN with Cisco leapfrogging both Versa Networks and Palo Alto Networks to capture the bronze. Gartner sees a large and growing gap in execution ability between those three and the other vendors it designated SD-WAN leaders: Palo Alto Networks Versa Networks and HPE Aruba.

""When clients are asking about who's included in RFPs who's being finalized who's being selected there is separation"" Jonathan Forest Gartner senior director and analyst tells Information Security Media Group. ""There is separation by some of the higher market share vendors.""

Cisco Fortinet and VMware respectively were the three SD-WAN market share leaders in 2021 with Versa Networks and HPE Aruba capturing fourth and fifth place market research firm Dell'Oro Group said in March. The worldwide SD-WAN market expanded by 35% in 2021 to more than $2 billion and the eight largest SD-WAN vendors accounted for more than 80% of revenue last year Dell'Oro Group found.

From a completeness of vision perspective Gartner found Palo Alto Networks and VMware were once against neck and neck with Palo Alto Networks taking the gold this time around. Fortinet leapfrogged Cisco and Versa Networks for the bronze in completeness of SD-WAN vision with Cisco and Versa falling to fourth and fifth place. HPE Aruba was last among the leaders in both execution ability and completeness of vision.

""There is some stability"" Forest says. ""There's enough deployments enough evidence of product deployment capabilities and overall everything we evaluate in the Magic Quadrant to make that assessment on what these vendors have done. So I do believe there's a track record and a certain level of maturity in this market.""

Outside of the leaders here's how Gartner sees the SD-WAN market:

Visionary: Juniper Networks

Juniper Networks Challenger: Huawei

Huawei Niche Players: Cradlepoint Barracuda Networks Nuage Networks Peplink Citrix and Forcepoint

""Things can change on a dime"" Forest says. ""Acquisitions can happen that can change things pretty quickly as can new development of products and new positions on innovation that disrupt the market. Things can always change.""

The Surge of Single-Vendor SASE

Gartner expects the share of organizations procuring both SD-WAN and security service edge from the same supplier will increase from 10% this year to 50% in 2025. Although secure access service edge is today dominated by multivendor solutions with orchestration tying them together Gartner says single-vendor SASE will simplify sourcing and offer a tighter technical integration and better user experience.

Most organizations today are using different vendors for SD-WAN and SSE due to unique requirements or differences in opinion between the networking and security departments Forest says. But as refresh cycles occur smaller vendors without rigid specific requirements will begin selecting one supplier for both SD-WAN and SSE and adoption will slowly move upstream to the midmarket and lower enterprise.

Some large enterprises with unique requirements will maintain separate SSE and SD-WAN vendors for the foreseeable future but Forest believes most customers will eventually converge on a single vendor to reduce complexity and simplify management. The consolidation to date has primarily been driven by SD-WAN vendors and the leading cloud security vendors are just beginning to buy their way into SD-WAN.

""Clients want less vendors"" Forest says. ""It's less complexity which from the security side makes sense because that reduces risk. Cost is part of it but not a driver. It's more about manageability and just reducing the attack surface.""

Fortinet Focuses on App Connectivity SD-Branch

Fortinet's SD-WAN business has focused over the past year on secure application connectivity SASE use cases SD-Branch opportunities and public cloud integration says Vice President of Products Nirav Shah. The company has built ZTNA enforcement into its SD-WAN offering to ensure adversaries aren't able to move laterally across the customer's entire application landscape in the event of compromise he says.

The company's SD-Branch investments will address the needs of big retail and healthcare environments by integrating LTE and 5G inside the SD-WAN appliance providing retail locations with 5G connectivity as well as Dual SIM card Shah says. And from a SASE perspective Shah says Fortinet offers customers flexibility by delivering its security and networking capabilities either on-premises or through the cloud (see: Ken Xie on Why Fortinet Is Leaning Into SD-WAN OT Security).

""We continue to lead the SD-WAN market and continue improving in execution and vision"" Shah tells ISMG. ""If you compare from last year to this year we are the only leader to improve in both execution and vision at the same time. No other vendor in the leadership quadrant could do that. So that speaks volumes to how well we are addressing any concern that customers or analysts have.""

Gartner criticized Fortinet for an average customer experience limited mind share in networking and limited third-party SSE integrations. Shah says Fortinet has invested heavily in building its networking practice out and becoming a key player in both wired and wireless LAN. From a partnership perspective Shah says Fortinet plans to deliver single-vendor SASE and isn't looking to team up with competitors.

""Our SD-WAN is a foundation for SASE because we can do the security and networking convergence that customers want"" Shah says. ""We want to take advantage of providing a single-vendor SASE architecture. And that's why you will not see Fortinet integrating with the other SSE players out there.""

VMware Doubles Down on 5G Integration Security Services

Over the past year VMware has enhanced its security capabilities and integrated private 5G services into its SD-WAN offering says Karl Brown senior director of product marketing for SD-WAN. Healthcare organizations manufacturers and retailers want to connect intelligent devices to 5G during their digital transformation efforts to improve service quality reduce latency and better support branch locations.

The company supports the security needs for cloud and SaaS applications through a bundled offering that allows customers to view analytics around application performance and network traffic and easily apply policies across all applications Brown says. VMware delivers its cloud web security technology from 150 cities to give users a direct path from where they're located to where their apps are hosted (see: VMware Doubles Down on Multi-Cloud Lateral Movement Defense).

""We make it extremely easy for our customers to connect their remote branch locations to cloud and SaaS applications"" Brown tells ISMG. ""We take away the complexity of trying to put appliances in multiple cloud locations and interconnect the users with those applications in the cloud. We make it extremely easy to deliver high-performance SaaS applications.""

Gartner criticized VMware for basic on-premises security product dependency and concerns around the Broadcom acquisition. Brown says Menlo Security's cloud protection offerings are fully integrated and benefit from close collaboration around the road map. VMware wants to extend its on-premises security offering beyond an existing firewall that's often used by customers in branch office locations.

""There is a segment of our customer base and potential customers that would like additional security in the appliance which would augment our cloud-delivered security services"" Brown says. ""We do fully intend to deliver upon that request from those customers.""

Cisco Emphasizes Network Visibility Public Cloud Partners

Cisco has strengthened its SD-WAN offering by providing more network visibility deep integrations with public cloud providers and additional security features and performance says Jay Chokshi director of product management for secure SD-WAN and SASE. Cisco has unveiled enhanced firewall capabilities and troubleshooting analysis as well as a Meraki platform with 33% enhanced performance he says.

Integrating Meraki and Viptela with ThousandEyes gives customers visibility into networks they don't control allowing them to spot outages and deep breaches across the broader internet sooner Chokshi says. Cisco also created a robust secure connection to public cloud that's simple to set up and makes it easy for customers to move applications to the cloud and access data in the cloud he says.

""The networking and security constructs are becoming increasingly complex"" Chokshi tells ISMG. ""The networks are becoming very complex. So bringing simpler security to the operations piece is very important. I think that's a big thing.""

Gartner criticized Cisco for having multiple platforms an average product and an average customer experience. Chokshi says Cisco has driven simplified operations across its products by investing in user experience and creating a simple intuitive workflow experience. Meraki allows Cisco to address SMBs' need for simplicity and lean operations while Viptela offers sophisticated features for enterprises.

""The market is very big. There are different segments of the market that have different needs"" Chokshi says. ""We have been able to bring a lot of what our customers are asking for by offering both Meraki and Viptela. In addition many of our customers are leveraging both the portfolios in their network.""

Palo Alto Networks Takes 5G Digital Experience to Next Level

Palo Alto Networks has bolstered its SD-WAN offering with native integrated 5G autonomous digital experience management and tighter SASE connections says Kumar Ramachandran senior vice president for SASE products. Integrating Prisma SD-WAN with Prisma Access' ZTNA capabilities gives customers the flexibility to select what components they want based on their deployment he says.

Native integrated 5G means customers will enjoy the best possible performance and availability in branch offices while no longer deploying a separate device Ramachandran says. And autonomous digital experience management provides deep visibility into application experience network behavior and user behavior automating application delivery and the resolution of performance issues he says (see: Why Would Palo Alto Networks Want Startup Apiiro for $600M?).

""Our SD-WAN solution is very focused on delivering the best possible user experience irrespective of the connectivity"" Ramachandran tells ISMG. ""You get this very very powerful user experience-based approach.""

Gartner criticized Palo Alto Networks for below-average customer experience below-average sales execution and limited on-premises security with SD-WAN. Ramachandran says the company has focused on bolstering both direct and MSP sales via a managed services partnership with AT&T. The company offers a full-blown firewall in the branch though he says most clients prefer cloud delivery.

""The cloud offers lots of advantages over taking a different security box and deploying it in the branch"" Ramachandran says. ""We get the elasticity of the cloud at the branch.""

Versa Networks Pursues Simplification Via AI ML

Versa has created a natural language processing chatbot and anomaly engine for network and security insights to more effectively leverage AI and ML-based technologies around SD-WAN says CEO Kelly Ahuja. Automating functions helps enterprises go faster save money and be agile by having machines do the basic work meaning organizations no longer need an army of employees troubleshooting security issues.

Vera's new chatbot allows users to ask questions in the management console using normal language and applies fixes with the click of a button greatly simplifying how enterprises interact with Versa's system Ahuja says. And the anomaly engine examines telemetry wherever software is running correlates data from all of those places identifies patterns and reports abnormalities back to customers she says.

""From a technology standpoint our solution is head and shoulders above the market based on what our customers are telling us"" Ahuja tells ISMG. ""In certain segments and certain geographies we're actually beating many of the other competitors hands down.""

Gartner criticized Versa Networks for product complexity poor customer experience and less DIY experience. Ahuja says Versa has done a lot of work to simplify its workflows with a well-lit path and said it provides comprehensive capabilities around routing appliances and security. Most customers are served via Versa's 150 service providers though many Global 2000 firms run directly on Versa he says.

""We have the most comprehensive understanding of the market and a full solution that covers both networking and security which is where the market is heading"" Ahuja says. ""So we are very very well-positioned to continue to lead the market and build and grow the business.""

HPE Aruba Doubles Down on Single Console Branch Security

HPE Aruba has worked in recent years to collapse WAN edge functions around routing firewalls and optimization into a single management console to simplify management and reduce human error says Derek Granath senior director of SD-WAN product and technical marketing. The company has teamed up to leverage user and device identity and role-based access control to enable segmentation he says.

The company has replaced branch firewalls by adding security functions at the branch such as dynamic path control and unified threat management and integrating with Palo Alto Networks and Check Point offerings he says. HPE Aruba also has increased its intrusion detection capability over the past year with prevention technology correlation of user identity and defense and mitigation features that isolate traffic he says.

""We've always been about improving performance on the WAN"" Granath tells ISMG. ""We have certain features that we think we do better than anybody such as our ability to run reliably on the internet even when it becomes impaired because of congestion.""

Gartner criticized HPE Aruba for an incomplete security road map limited geographic and vertical strategy and below-average customer experience. Granath said HPE Aruba has customers in every vertical and excels in financial services technology manufacturing and retail. From a security perspective HPE Aruba automates integrations with Zscaler and Netskope to make accessing SSE easier he says.

""There's no single SASE vendor that can tick all of the boxes for security and all of the boxes for the network"" Granath says. ""A dual or multivendor solution means customers don't have to compromise on either the security side or the network side.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ldGFsb2N1cy5lcy9lbi9uZXdzL2hlYXJ0LWp1bGlhbi1hbHBzLW1pbGthLWJvdXRpcXVlLWhvdGVsLWFuZC1yZXN0YXVyYW50LWdhcnRuZXItYXJjaGl0ZWN0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In the heart of Julian Alps.

Three notable innovations

GE’s XA100 aims to provide a leap in performance for both fifth- and sixth-generation fighters and is being touted as the next big thing in fighter aircraft propulsion. It has three notable innovations that make it cutting edge:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9ib2VpbmctY2VvLXByb21pc2VzLWFib3V0LWNsZWFuLWF2aWF0aW9uLWZ1ZWwtb3V0cGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d50gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnJlaWdodHdhdmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JvZWluZy1jZW8tcHJvbWlzZXMtYWJvdXQtY2xlYW4tYXZpYXRpb24tZnVlbC1vdXRwYWNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing CEO: Promises about clean aviation fuel outpace technology,"WASHINGTON — Expectations for quick decarbonization of aviation are unrealistic and create pressure to invest in unproven technologies instead of mass production of sustainable aviation fuel which will have an immediate benefit said Boeing CEO David Calhoun.

Speaking last week at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce aerospace event here the Boeing (NYSE: BA) chief questioned the speed at which governments and stakeholders are promising change when little biofuels infrastructure exists and alternative propulsion systems are still over the horizon.

“My fear is pace. A lot of potential technologies hydrogen including green hydrogen get talked about want to get funded and then lead to policy choices that try to accelerate all of that at a very fast pace: ‘You’ll be green by 2035. Every next airplane has to be hydrogen.’

“You confuse policymakers in the process” he said.

Boeing is working to meet the industry goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Calhoun said the aviation sector has set an ambitious target considering it only represents 2.4% of global CO2 emissions. The company released its annual sustainability report last summer.

Boeing which invested $450 million last January in electric vertical takeoff and landing air taxi developer Wisk is not aggressively pursuing hydrogen power. Rival Airbus by contrast has said it believes it can produce a hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035 although it could be 2040 before regulators certify it according to analysts.

“Hydrogen on its best day is going to move [carbon reduction] about 2%. That doesn’t mean we don’t believe in it. But its contributions are in the second half of the century not the first half. Sustainable aviation fuel that is the mover. And it isn’t easy either” said the manufacturer’s top executive.

Experts say hydrogen is very efficient but occupies a lot more space than jet fuel which makes it impossible to use for anything other than short flights without a complete redesign of aircraft which could take decades.





Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by comparison will constitute more than 30% of the carbon emissions reduction in the short and medium term Calhoun argued. The International Air Transport Association’s baseline scenario for carbon-neutral flying by midcentury calls for 65% of emissions to be abated by SAF.

Currently only about 0.1% of fuel consumed by commercial aircraft is SAF according to aviation consultancy IBA. It costs two to four times as much as conventional jet fuel.

Achieving pollution targets will require commercial SAF production at scale proponents say.

IATA estimates 119 billion gallons will need to be produced annually to get to net-zero carbon by midcentury. Current investment commitments from energy companies and aviation partners will take production from 33 million gallons per year to 1.3 billion gallons by 2025. Effective government incentives could push production to 8 billion gallons by 2030 the amount needed to achieve economies of scale and make the fuel affordable.

Jet engines today can take a 50/50 blend of SAF which reduces CO2 emissions by up to 80%. Boeing and Airbus are working to get certification for engines that operate 100% on SAF which industry officials expect by the end of the decade.

JetBlue announced Friday that it plans to buy 25 million gallons of SAF derived from CO2 from Air Company which is using renewable electricity to capture carbon from the atmosphere. The five-year purchase commitment is expected to start in 2027. JetBlue (NASDAQ: JBLU) has set a goal of converting 10% of its total fuel usage to SAF on a blended basis by 2030.

Air Company claims its carbon-neutral fuel offers an additional 14% reduction in emissions per net gallon on a life cycle basis than SAF derived from plant or biowaste feedstocks.

Calhoun who ran GE Aircraft Engines earlier in his career said getting to 100% SAF use is more complicated than many suggest.





“It’s not good enough that an engine burns it. … Variations in fuel are enormous impactful on the life cycle of an engine enormously and our airlines buy engines for their life. And the second 10 years is a lot tougher than the first 10” Calhoun said. “So there’s an enormous technology investment that has to go into propulsion technologies. To prepare for SAF we have to make sure every next airplane is capable of burning SAF. And that’s possible. And then of course we’ve got to get it out there in the marketplace.

“So what can a policymaker do to screw it up? They can tell us you have to be 50% SAF by 2035. And the music will stop. Because we won’t be able to get there. We’ll get a long way but we won’t be able to get there.”

The aviation industry needs to educate policymakers on what can realistically be achieved in various time frames Calhoun said. He invited officials and other interested parties to use Boeing’s Cascade tool which analyzes the emissions of every plane in operation and identifies what steps would be needed to get to net-zero emissions by 2050.

“If we do that I think policymakers in light of the fact that we are 2% of the problem they’ll go with us and we can educate them and they’ll be in the right spot” the CEO said.

“Sustainability is good for us is good for aviation. It will increase the rate at which we displace older airplanes. Today’s technology has already improved the situation 30% over what they displace. As we move SAF into that environment that number gets bigger. And then we have to increase the rate at which we turn over the fleets. I do think policymakers will come up with some cute ways of helping us with that” Calhoun added. “And avoid choosing technologies.”

The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes a tax credit for biofuel producers to help bring down the cost and stimulate production of SAF.

The accident caused by a piece of debris on the runway killed all 109 people on board and four on the ground. It dented the reputation of supersonic air travel and accelerated the retirement of the Concorde which was already facing infeasibly high operating costs and repeated complaints about its noise. Three years later in October 2003 the Concorde completed its final flight from New York to London in 3.5 hours and then disappeared from public sight ending 27 years of commercial operation.

Nearly two decades have passed and a startup and a handful of airlines are suddenly interested in bringing supersonic air travel back. In June 2021 United Airline ordered 15 supersonic jets from Boom Supersonic a Denver Colorado-based company developing an aircraft called Overture aimed to fly at Mach 1.7 or 1.7 times the speed of sound (Concorde’s top speed was just above Mach 2). A year later American Airlines followed suit and placed an order for 20 Overture jets. Both U.S. airlines along with the U.K.’s Virgin Atlantic Airways and Japan’s Japan Airlines have placed conditional orders of a total of more than 100 supersonic jets from Boom.

None of those planes has been built yet however. Boom’s goal is to deliver the first Overture in 2025 and fly the first paying passenger before the end of this decade. That’s not an unreasonable timeline per aviation standards. Yet industry experts have mixed opinions about whether Boom actually has the financial and technological resources to deliver its lofty promise.

The differences between Overture and the Concorde

The Concorde was co-manufactured by France’s Aérospatiale and the British Aircraft Corporation. Between 1976 and 2003 it was primarily operated by British Airways and Air France for transatlantic flights. The development cost of the Concorde overran initial estimates by more than 20 times and operation of the aircraft relied heavily on government subsidies and high ticket price. (In 1997 a round-trip ticket from New York to London cost 30 times more than an economy class ticket on a subsonic plane.) The Concorde also faced constant complaints about its noise which led the U.S. government to ban its landing in New York from 1976 to 1977 and British Airways to cancel a route from London to Singapore in 1977.

Aeronautical technology has come a long way since the days of Concorde from material science to aerodynamics to propulsion said Boom CEO Blake Scholl.

Take aerodynamic as an example. “We’ve gone from developing airplanes in a wind tunnel where every test takes months and costs millions to being able to optimize with software simulation where we can do hundreds of wind tunnel tests in a matter of hours” Scholl said.

Scholl brings lots of experience in technology and startups but none in aviation. A former product manager at Amazon he is a co-founder of Kima Labs a mobile payment company acquired by Groupon in 2012 for an undisclosed amount. Scholl moved to work for Groupon for two years following the merger and left in early 2014 to found Boom.

Boom isn’t looking to build a larger or faster plane than the Concorde but first and foremost a more financially viable one. Overture will be constructed with carbon fiber composite which is about 40 percent lighter than aluminum the primary material making up the body of the Concorde. A lighter aircraft means less fuel consumption and lower operating costs. To further increase fuel efficiency and optimize airflow during flight Overture will also feature a complicated fuselage shape that’s thicker in the front and narrows down toward the back. The design is the result of about 26 million hours of software simulation Scholl said.

To minimize noise—a major complaint about the Concorde—Overture will be powered with modern turbofan engines without afterburners a component used in Concorde and many combat supersonic jet engines to achieve high speeds.

Boom is pre-selling Overture at $200 million each to airlines. The price is comparable to what a similar subsonic aircraft would cost. United said the operating cost of Overture will be 75 percent less than that of Concorde and passengers can expect to pay fares similar to business-class tickets on most commercial airlines.

""Concorde was a political project built for the glory of France and England"" said Mike Boyd president of Boyd Group International an aviation consulting and research firm. ""It was not built based on solid market economics. Boom is a private project made for a market in need. That's the fundamental difference."" Boyd consulted Boom's early concepts in 2015 shortly after the company was founded and helped introduce the startup to the aviation industry. He said his firm has no financial interest in Boom.

A high-tech jet missing an engine

Despite the substantial commercial interest Overture has generated the plane is missing its most important component: the engine.

In August 2020 Boom announced a partnership with Rolls-Royce which built the engine for Concorde to develop an engine for Overture. That deal abruptly fell apart in early September. It's unclear who backed out first. In a statement Boom said Rolls-Royce’ ""proposed engine design and legacy business model is not the best option"" for Overture.

Following the news several major airplane engine makers including GE Aviation Honeywell and Safran Aircraft Engines said they had no interest in making a supersonic engine for Boom. Still Boom said it plans to announce a new engine partner later this year.

""What Blake (Scholl) said is only half true. Yes the aircraft side has advanced a lot since Concorde. But the engine side not so much"" said Bjorn Fehrm a former fighter pilot for the Swedish Air force who now runs an aeronautical consulting firm based in France.

The unique challenge of supersonic jet engine is a tradeoff between speed and external noise. Today's commercial aircraft manage to keep engine noise at an acceptable level because they are only flying at 80 percent the speed of sound Fehrm said. ""Boom wants to fly 70 percent faster than sound. This is impossible to do with a quiet environmentally friendly engine.""

Concorde was powered by four engines converted from those used in the British Royal Air Force's combat jets. Those engines were powerful enough to achieve a top speed of just over Mach 2 but created a loud sonic boom. Although Boom claims Overture will not be louder than today's subsonic airplanes during takeoff and landing it's not seeking to rewrite existing regulations. Overture will fly at a maximum speed of Mach 1.7 over water and just below sonic speed over land. Scholl said this configuration will shorten the time of most transoceanic flights by half and over-land flights by 20 percent.

Fehrm who specializes in aircraft cost evaluation estimates it would cost Boom between $3 billion to $5 billion to develop an engine from scratch. Boom has so far raised less than $300 million from venture capital firms including Celesta Capital and Y Combinator. To meet the 2025 delivery timeline it would need to raise funds at an accelerated pace.

Scholl said United's pre-order in 2020 was a ""breakthrough"" that ""opened up many aisles around the world."" But Richard Aboulafia an aerospace consultant at AeroDynamic Advisory said United and American's orders are more of creative advertising than an actual vote of confidence in Boom's technology. ""If there is anybody at these airlines who has put down serious money on an airplane that has no engine that person should be fired instantly"" he said.

Boyd who has witnessed Boom's journey from the beginning is more bullish. ""It's the only private supersonic company that has advanced this far. That track record clearly shows they have something"" he said. ""American Airlines did not fall off the turnip truck. They know what they are doing.”",,,

Source: GE Healthcare

While the one-stop concept is most easily realized when building a new hospital a scaled-down version can be integrated into existing workflows the GE expert underlines: “True hospitals can’t set-up new departments overnight but light and colour concepts pleasant furniture and a dedicated app are things that can be introduced almost anywhere. The more disciplines are located on-site the quicker the patients can be helped. Patient organisations increasingly demand such patient-centric care.”

The One-Stop Clinic has already been implemented in hospitals in the US Latin America Turkey France and Spain. After the presentation at ECR 2022 in Vienna more European countries including Switzerland and Germany have shown interest and even started projects. In the future GE will continue to focus on comprehensive solutions rather than isolated products as Zeqiri points out: “The therapy has to be integrated into the treatment journey. It must not fall by the wayside.”

MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- Dozens participated in the American Heart Association's Annual Heart Walk Saturday morning in Milwaukee.

But for one man walking in the event held a special meaning.

Two years ago Matt Pemberton the director of core solutions at GE Healthcare was shoveling snow off of his driveway when all of a sudden he began having trouble breathing.

""I couldn't just take a deep breath. I had no chest pain so I went inside and it went away very quickly"" Pemberton said. ""That's why I didn't think it was much.""

But when he decided to go outside again just moments later Pemberton said the same feeling happened within minutes.

""I go inside and my wife's like 'hey you should go to the doctor and do your ECG'"" Pemberton said.

Luckily that's when he remembered he had a handheld KardiaMobile device from ""a swag bag from my boss.""

""I grabbed it. It takes a single view of the heart unlike the ones we make at GE that's a lot more comprehensive. Even though it's not cleared to do this I had knowledge of how to read an EKG. So I was able to read and notice there was a problem and I went into the hospital"" Pemberton said. ""The device didn't tell me it was bad I just knew from my experience that I needed to go to the doctor.""

When he arrived Pemberton was diagnosed with a heart blockage commonly known as ""the widow maker.""

He credits the device for saving his life.

""My doctor said at any time I went back out I could've easily blocked that artery and died on the driveway"" Pemberton said.

Now years later he's undergone a complete lifestyle change from exercising more to eating healthier.

""I'm feeling great. It's been two years since I had my open heart surgery"" Pemberton said. ""I've lost weight and I'm feeling really good.""

His advice? Staying on top of your health.

""[My doctor] checks my cholesterol now twice a year. I didn't check it at all before"" Pemberton said. ""Take care of yourself. If I had any message for anyone you don't need a device to do that."""

The U.S. Air Force faces cultural and training challenges to its digital engineering goals said Brig. Gen. Steven J. Bleymaier director of logistics engineering and force protection for Air Mobility Command.

The Air Force had major wins with programs such as Sentinel that will replace the aging Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile as well as in its efforts to re-wing the A-10 attack aircraft but siloed organizational constructs culture training outdated processes and funding are among some of the impediments standing in the way of IT modernization efforts.

“This is an enterprise problem. That’s how I see it” Bleymaier said during a panel at the Air Force Association’s Air Space and Cyber Conference Sep. 21.

Some of the challenges the Air Force comes up against include test processes that are still focused around physical testing as opposed to virtual and airworthiness that is still based on paper methods as well as lack of funding and hiring and training processes.

“To really achieve the full benefit and the value of digital engineering it requires an enterprise ecosystem but it’s currently funded in this bubble so it has to compete with folks with small resources” Bleymaier said. “So what you end up with is siloed capabilities that aren’t connected and there are different levels of maturity and scale. So that’s a mismatch.”

Successes the Air Force has seen thus far are partly due to the 2018 Defense Department (DOD) efforts to transform its engineering practices into digital engineering. Recognizing the need to adapt and modernize the Air Force created the Digital Transformation Office three years later with an aim to coordinate the service’s move to digital processes.

While the Air Force has witnessed progress in the digital engineering space the panel acknowledged a lot of hard work that lies ahead and needs to happen across the enterprise and the lifecycle to ensure successful outcomes.

“Digital engineering technology is available today but it’s not necessarily available to the military at large” Bleymaier said. “Not only do we need to unlock digital engineering but we need to unleash it. We need to unlock it and get it into the hands of the military. Otherwise you’re not going to experience the power and the full value and its ability to accelerate acquisition across the lifecycle.”

The panel emphasized the importance of moving away from document-intensive linear processes to digital engineering that accelerate software-based acquisition decrease lifecycle costs increase readiness reliability and availability and sharpen the Air Force’s competitive edge.

“They [China] have 2030 goals for AI and ML and to be the dominant power and they are nationally mobilized and they are moving out toward achieving their goals and objectives” Bleymaier said. “So that should give us a sense of urgency … but even knowing that about China there still seems to not be the sense of urgency there should be with accelerating and adopting digital engineering.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlwc29zLmNvbS9lbi11ay9nZW4tei1hbmQtbWV0YXZlcnNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gen Z and the Metaverse,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ipsos.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /en-uk/gen-z-and-metaverse (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674107BF10>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlwc29zLmNvbS9lbi11ay9nZW4tei1hbmQtbWV0YXZlcnNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxlbmdpbmVlcmluZzI0Ny5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zdXBlcm1pY3JvLWRlbGl2ZXJzLTJuZC1nZW4tbnZpZGlhLW92eC1jb21wdXRpbmctc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supermicro Delivers 2nd-Gen NVIDIA OVX Computing System,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.digitalengineering247.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/supermicro-delivers-2nd-gen-nvidia-ovx-computing-system/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674107B730>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxlbmdpbmVlcmluZzI0Ny5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zdXBlcm1pY3JvLWRlbGl2ZXJzLTJuZC1nZW4tbnZpZGlhLW92eC1jb21wdXRpbmctc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

LILLINGTON N.C. (WTVD) -- ""Instead of saving money I'm paying extra money.""

Michael Houle is a Harnett County homeowner whose quest to go solar and save money on power bills instead wound up costing him more money.

""They say it works but I have not seen anything off my electric (bill) at all to this day"" Houle said.

Houle decided to go solar in January of 2021. He said a salesman from the North Carolina solar-based company PowerHome Solar which later renamed the company to Pink Energy came to his Harnett County house and made big promises.

""They said it would work good the way our house was facing and everything; putting them on the back roof that we could probably get up to 100% power with it"" Houle recalled.

Besides energy savings he was told there would also be incentives on his taxes.

While marijuana is illegal in North Carolina cannabis enthusiasts have found a loophole.

""They said that once we got them installed that we could get a 12% tax credit."" Houle electronically signed a 37-page contract for a total price of more than $47000 for the 13 solar panels along with a Generac battery cabinet in his garage.

He said the salesmen said that would give him extra protection.

""They say that I could run a couple of rooms upstairs if the power goes out but I have not been able to do that yet"" he said.

Plus not long after his brand new system was installed it stopped working.

""They tell me they're going to have someone out here to fix it and they send people out here and then it still has not worked.""

Month after month he said he saw no savings in his power bill but he still had to make his monthly payments of $171 on the system. Houle said the company did reimburse him for some of his monthly payments for the solar panels but his biggest frustration is the lack of savings he's seen since going solar.

""I've done nothing but have to come out of pocket since I got it and I got it to try and save money"" Houle said to Troubleshooter Diane Wilson.

Houle is not alone Wilson has heard from more than a dozen PowerHome Solar/Pink Energy customers in North Carolina and beyond who all say they have systems that don't work or they have not seen any difference in their power bills since going solar.

WATCH: Crypto and romance scams continue to cost victims billions

Online scams continue to soar costing victims thousands of dollars. Just in North Carolina the average loss to a scam is close to $9000 per victim according to the FBI's latest r

The North Carolina Attorney General's Office has more than 110 complaints filed against the company. There are more than 1100 complaints filed with the Better Business Bureau in the last three years and the BBB issued an alert on the company for a pattern of complaints.

The NC State Board of Examiners of Electrical Contractors took action against PowerHome Solar in 2019 and put the company on year probation for failing to respond to complaints in a timely manner failing to complete projects multiple expired permits and engaging in malpractice or unethical conduct in the use of its license. The executive director of the board said it received other complaints which are part of open and ongoing investigations.

As for Pink Energy's owner Jayson Waller he is very vocal on his Facebook page about the complaints and issues customers are facing. He blames it on a vendor his company worked with: Generac.

A company spokesperson for Pink Energy states ""Pink Energy is in the midst of a massive spike in customer service issues due to a faulty product provided by one of our former suppliers named Generac. The Generac part in question called SnapRS fails at such a high rate that the vast majority of Pink Energy service calls are related to this issue and this is negatively impacting our customer service capabilities. We strongly urge Generac to conduct a national product recall and encourage our customers to contact Generac.""

In August Pink Energy filed a federal lawsuit against Generac alleging defective products which impacted Pink Energy's business and reputation. However Pink Energy did not start working with Generac until two years ago and many of the customer complaints against the company were filed before that partnership. Pink Energy did not address that.

A Generac spokesperson says in part ""In certain situations especially when product installation guidelines have not been followed as appears to be the case with some Pink Energy installations customers may have experienced certain issues with a particular Generac component of their solar energy system - the SnapRS 801 or 801A. We have introduced a new next-generation rapid shutdown device which has been designed and engineered to the highest reliability standards. We are committed to getting those upgrades and warranty replacements taken care of as quickly as possible and those steps are well underway. It is unfortunate that Pink Energy as the installer and service provider of such products has made the unilateral decision to quit offering Generac warranty support despite the availability of parts. Instead of helping expedite the resolution of their customer complaints they have asked Generac to solely assume this responsibility. Although Pink Energy does not appear to put the needs of these customers first Generac has - and always will - stand behind our products and honor our customer commitments.""

As the two companies battle it out in court customers like Houle are stuck in the middle. Pink energy states Houle's issues are due to Generac equipment failures. For the troubles Pink Energy has reimbursed 11 payments and claims it's expediting three additional payments now due to service delays. Pink Energy also claims Houle's system is up and running properly and just waiting on solar panel replacement but he says that is not the case.

""I'd be happy if they come and get it off my roof. That'd be nice; then I don't have to worry about it at all"" Houle said.

Besides frustrations from Pink Energy customers employees of the company shared with ABC11 a letter they received from Pink Energy leadership. The letter informs the employees that they've been terminated and the company is closing permanently.

Both the NC Attorney General's office and BBB said they're working with Pink Energy to resolve customer complaints.

In order to protect your money if you want to go solar do your research on a company look at the complaints and what others are saying. You can't go with what a salesperson says you need to read all of that fine print before signing anything especially if you're signing electronically.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The total yield of Agaricus bisporus obtained from the studied compost was 61.3 kg m−2 (460 g kg−1 compost) in four fruiting flushes (yielding 23.2 15.6 8.8 and 3.4 kg m−2 of mushroom caps respectively). These yields are comparable or higher than standard yields obtained in the Australian mushroom industry confirming the high productivity and representative nature of the composting run studied.

Physicochemical changes during the composting process

The initial pH of the compost mix after addition of gypsum to the straw blend was 8.0 and it remained at this level during the pre-wet phase and Phase I but decreased during pasteurization conditioning and spawn run to a final value of pH 6.3. The electrical conductivity of the compost was stable at 2.5–3.0 μS throughout (Fig. S1).

The total C content of the compost decreased slowly from 48% (w/w) at bale break to 41% (w/w) when casing was applied at the start of the production phase due to the loss of C through microbial respiration during composting. The ash content increased correspondingly from 7% (w/w) to 26% (w/w). Interestingly total N and S content of the compost also increased slowly during the composting process to final values of 2.6% (w/w) for N and 2.2% (w/w) for S but this increase probably just represents the retention of N and S despite overall loss of C. Extractable C and N levels increased briefly during the pre-wet phase but then decreased again to base levels of 20 mg g dw−1 for carbon and 2–3 mg g dw−1 of N (Fig. S2). The moisture content of the compost increased during the initial bale wetting stage to 70% (w/w) and was maintained at 70–80% during Phase I decreasing to 60–70% in Phase II and during spawn run (Fig. S3).

Extracellular enzyme activities during composting

Conversion of the macromolecular components of compost feedstocks especially proteins and the structural compounds cellulose hemicellulose and lignin is catalyzed primarily by extracellular enzymes secreted by mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria and fungi. Key changes in the enzymatic profile occurred in the pre-wet phase during the thermophilic phase and at the end of spawn run. During initial bale wetting and pre-wet stage (process days 1–5) high activities were observed for most of the enzymes tested (Table 1). The high activities of invertase amylopectinase and protease enable mesophilic compost organisms rapidly to utilize the soluble sugars starch and protein made available in the substrate through the wetting process and these activities decreased to low levels by day 9. Invertase and amylopectinase were not substantially active later in the composting process possibly in response to depletion of their substrates. However the enzymes responsible for degradation of cellulose (cellulase β-glucosidase) and hemicellulose (xylanase) were also highly active at the start of the process and decreased in activity during the pre-wet period. These enzyme activities are therefore likely to be affiliated with mesophilic organisms that initially benefited from increased nutrient availability but then decreased in activity with increasing temperature in the windrows. This is consistent with the transient increase seen in overall microbial activity (FDA hydrolysis) by day 5 with a subsequent reduction in activity by day 9.

Phase I was a highly aerobic phase with air actively blown through the compost in large and enclosed tunnels. There was an immediate but transient increase in activity of cellulase/β-glucosidase xylanase protease chitinase and overall microbial activity at the start of Phase I representing rapid growth of thermophilic organisms under these conditions. The transient pulse in enzyme activities was followed by a slow increase in activity of all these enzymes throughout the rest of Phase I through Phase II (pasteurization and conditioning) and into the spawn run. Protease and β-glucosidase activities were especially high during the conditioning process as the compost cooled after pasteurization but the most notable aspect of this period of the process was the profile of xylanase and cellulase activities during the spawn run. Activity of these two enzymes increased to a maximum around day 25 and decreased again as colonization of the compost by Agaricus was completed consistent with displacement of thermophilic cellulose-degrading fungi (especially Mycothermus) by the growing Agaricus mycelium.

Efficient colonization of the compost by Agaricus led to an increase in total microbial activity (FDA hydrolysis) but was also reflected in increasing peroxidase activity from day 30 onwards corresponding with the onset of Agaricus-mediated lignin degradation. Chitinase activity also increased at the end of spawn run suggesting enhanced activity of organisms producing cell wall degrading enzymes targeting Agaricus mycelium.

Microbial populations in mushroom compost

The total population of bacteria in compost (measured as 16S rRNA gene copies per g dry weight of compost) was significantly higher than the fungal population (ITS copies per g dry weight of compost) throughout the composting process (Fig. 2). The size of the fungal population decreased during the pre-wet phase while bacteria proliferated under these conditions and the bacteria:fungi ratio reached almost 2500 at day 9. This ratio decreased sharply as temperature increased during Phase I and mesophilic bacteria were eliminated. The fungal population grew steadily during Phase I and pasteurization/conditioning as thermophilic species proliferated. Interestingly no substantial increase in fungal numbers was observed during spawn run consistent with the concept that Agaricus obtains most of its nutrition through degradation of the biomass of other fungi such as the thermophilic Mycothermus. The bacterial population increased 10-fold during Phase I but decreased again during pasteurization and conditioning and there was always 10–50 times more bacteria than fungi. The size of the bacterial population increased together with Agaricus during spawn run suggesting that the bacteria may have colonized the Agaricus hyphae or otherwise benefited from the presence of this organism.

Succession of bacterial communities in mushroom compost

Analysis of bacterial diversity in mushroom compost at 19 timepoints during the composting process revealed a total of 3240 different OTUs with up to 1134 different OTUs present in any given sample (Table S4). Bacterial diversity increased slowly during the pre-wet phase reaching a maximum at the end of Phase I. Removal of mesophilic organisms during pasteurization led to a steep fall in bacterial diversity; this decrease persisted through the conditioning period and during growth of the Agaricus mycelium suggesting that these conditions were selective for a specific group of organisms.

The dynamics of specific bacterial taxa during production of mushroom compost can be delineated into three main periods (Fig. 3). During the pre-wet phase and early Phase I the dominant bacteria present changed frequently with populations growing quickly and then disappearing equally rapidly as they were overgrown by other species. Arcobacter made up nearly 30% of the total bacterial population at the start of composting possibly derived from the poultry manure or from the recycled process water used for straw wetting. Several strains of Acinetobacter were also dominant (20–30% of overall population) during the early pre-wet phase while the subsequent dominant taxa were Solibacillus and Comamonas followed by Pseudomonas and Bacillus largely mesophilic organisms which are characteristic of the straw and field origin of the raw materials. As Phase I progressed the dominant taxa were Bacillus Paenibacillus and uncharacterized Clostridia and Proteobacteria followed by Ruminofilibacter which made up to 20% of bacteria present in mid-Phase I. The frequent succession in dominant organisms presumably reflected the depletion of preferred C sources for each species from the compost and the rapidly changing environmental conditions as the temperature of the compost increased.

The second distinctive period in the composting process was the end of Phase I/start of Phase II. At this point species evenness increased and individual organisms became less dominant reflecting the increase in diversity seen at the end of Phase I. Thermus made up 6% of the bacterial community together with a thermophilic Sphingobacterium and a species of Luteimonas.

The bacterial community changed completely after pasteurization with the rapid variation seen earlier in composting replaced by comparative stability. The dominant organism throughout conditioning and spawn run was the heterotrophic nitrifier Pseudoxanthomonas taiwanensis. The population size of this species increased quickly after pasteurization and it made up about 15% of the bacterial compost community from this point until almost the end of the spawn run.

Succession of fungal communities in mushroom compost

Fungal community dynamics during composting followed a similar pattern to that found for bacteria although the overall fungal diversity was much lower (only 340 OTUs found with ITS3-ITS4 amplification) (Table S5). In addition it was not possible to measure the diversity of compost fungi accurately in later samples than mid-spawn run because Agaricus dominated the amplicon obtained from these timepoints. As with bacteria the early stages of composting were characterized by a rapid succession of different taxa responding to changing nutrient availability and temperature conditions. Although the wheat straw feedstock carried a range of different fungi (mainly in the families Pleosporaceae Rhytismataceae and Davidiellaceae) the compost in pre-wet was dominated by the pleospore Lewia infectoria and gradually replaced by an uncharacterized ascomycete and Myceliophthora (Fig. 3). During Phase I there was a transient increase in Thermomyces followed by rapid colonization of the compost by the thermophilic fungus Mycothermus thermophilus which made up more than 80% of the fungal population in the compost from mid-Phase II until it was overgrown by Agaricus in mid-spawn run.

Microbial diversity variability among compost yards

All the composting yards sampled used the same fundamental composting process and the same main raw materials (poultry manure wheat straw and gypsum) but there were differences among them in scale and process details (Table S1). Phase I compost production varied from 80 to 1600 t per crop and three of the yards provided additional N either as inorganic supplements (urea or ammonium sulfate) or organic materials (e.g. cottonseed meal or soybean meal). The length of the pre-wetting period varied (2–14 days) as did the length of Phase I (9–21 days). The Phase II process by contrast was relatively similar at all yards.

To determine the effect of this variation across compost yards bacterial community composition was measured in end-Phase I and end-Phase II compost at five yards from four Australian states (Fig. 4). At the end of Phase I Bacillaceae was the only taxon consistently present in all compost yards with considerable differences in all other taxa. Yards A and B revealed similar bacterial communities with a high proportion of Ruminicoccaceae and Limnochordaceae and thermophilic bacteria in the Thermaceae and Bacillaceae families (15–30%). Yard A had a much higher proportion of Thermus than Yard B possibly because it is a larger enterprise allowing a high temperature to be more easily maintained throughout the compost pile (Table S1). In Yards B C and E common families were Cellvibrionaceae Xanthomonodaceae and Flavobacteriaceae (2–10%) while the bacterial profile for Yard D had a higher proportion of mesophilic taxa such as Planococcaceae and Micrococcaceae (~7–12%). This may be because Phase I was done outdoors and as a consequence lower temperatures were maintained for a longer period than for other yards.

Fig. 4: Relative abundance of bacterial taxa from five geographically distinct compost yards. A End Phase I B end Phase II. Rare taxa with a relative abundance of <3% and taxa that were not classified to family are not shown. Full size image

Bacterial profiles were similar in Phase II for all compost yards despite variations in pasteurization time and practice (i.e. pasteurization in bulk or in trays). The common taxa across all yards were Xanthomonodaceae (mainly Pseudoxanthomonas (2–31%)) and Streptosporagiaceae (Thermopolyspora (1–2.5%)). In Yards B C and E a smaller proportion of Pseudoxanthomonas (2–10%) in the bacterial profile corresponded with a larger proportion of other thermophilic taxa such as Thermobacillus (1%) Thermopolyspora (2–4%) and Truepera (2–4%) (Table S3). Although the Xanthomonadaceae family was not dominant in Yard E (Fig. 4) Pseudoxanthomonas was one of the top 10 genera by the end of Phase II at this yard (Table S3).

Bacterial diversity changes in a similar manner during composting at all yards

An unweighted Unifrac distance metric was used to compare bacterial communities among compost yards and phases (Fig. 5). The succession of different bacterial communities throughout the composting process followed the same general pattern in all compost yards. This was indicated with end-Phase I samples at the top left of the plot progressing to end-Phase II at the bottom right (Fig. 5). The bacterial community at end-Phase I was significantly different from that in the mid- and end-Phase II (PERMANOVA: F = 2.4399 R2 = 0.1764 p < 0.05 d.f. = 3). The bacterial communities in Yard A clustered separately from other yards in the ordination plot presumably due to the combination of large operational scale and indoor Phase I processing (Table S1).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGljYWxkZXZpY2UtbmV0d29yay5jb20vYW5hbHlzdC1jb21tZW50L2NvbXBldGl0aXZlLWR5bmFtaWNzLW9ydGhvcGFlZGljLXJvYm90aWNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Competitive dynamics in the orthopaedic robotics market,"Orthopaedic robotic surgical systems are specialised to improve surgical outcomes for orthopaedic surgeries. They aid in various procedures such as partial knee replacement total knee replacement and total hip replacement to ultimately help surgeons perform procedures more consistently and accurately than with manual techniques. Unlike the dominant status of Intuitive Surgical in the general surgery robotics market all major orthopaedic manufacturers join the battle in the orthopaedic robotics market.

The major brands of orthopedic robots include Stryker Mako Zimmer Biomet ROSA RECON DePuy Synthes VELYS and Smith & Nephew CORI. The CORI Mako and ROSA RECON can be utilised for partial and total knee replacements as well as total hip replacements. The VELYS can be used only for total knee replacements. According to GlobalData analysis Stryker Mako is by far the largest player in the US bolstered by years of sales and early entry into the market. Mako has a robotic cutting tool attached to its robotic arm with a focus on haptics. The system requires a pre-operative computed tomography (CT) image that is used to generate a 3D model of the knee to assist the physician with pre-surgical planning.

Zimmer Biomet ROSA RECON is the second player in the market. Its robotic arm helps to accurately place cutting jigs that are pinned to the patient’s bone to help guide the surgeon’s cutting tool. ROSA RECON uses X-rays magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or even works on an image-free basis. Smith & Nephew CORI which has the smallest footprint of the four systems controls less than 20% of the orthopaedic robotics market. Notably the share of DePuy Synthes VELYS has increased greatly in the past year from less than 10% to over 20% in 2022. Affordable pricing can be one of the major reasons to explain the quick adoption of VELYS.

Price-setting determines a product’s profit margin as well as market share and the ease of making sales or the difficulty in gaining adoption in the highly competitive orthopaedic robotics market. The capital expense of orthopaedic robots is tremendous. The average selling prices (ASPs) of all four systems are from $480000 to over $1.1 million in the US. DePuy Synthes VELYS is more budget-friendly compared with other brands and is 56% cheaper than Mako. Service and support costs for orthopaedic robots also vary depending on system configuration. The service cost of VELYS is approximately 40% less than Mako.

According to a survey by the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons over half of the captured membership claimed robotics are used for marketing purposes having pressures from other facilities that provide robotic surgery options. When nonclinical factors greatly contribute to the decision of adopting a new orthopaedic robot lower pricing may be effective enough in persuading surgeons to move away from leading brands. The ASP of Mako has declined by nearly 9% in 2022. GlobalData expects the capital expense of orthopaedic robots will continually drop in the future due to the fierce competition."

In fact among the multitude of negative earnings surprises as of late General Mills beat expectations regarding both EPS and revenue. While this is impressive I’m neutral on General Mills due to its valuation being too high.

Diving into its Q1 results General Mills net sales increased to $4.7 billion an increase of 4% year-over-year facilitated by a 10% increase in organic net sales compared to the previous year. It is important to note however a 5% decrease in organic volume.

While seemingly concerning a 15% increase in organic pricing and mix offset this decline illustrating the apparent pricing power of General Mills and the consequent acceptance of price increases by the consumer.

Similarly diluted EPS increased 32% year-over-year to $1.35 with adjusted EPS following suit increasing 13% from the prior year to $1.11 and coming in above expectations of $1.00.

The company certainly didn’t achieve this without any challenges however as inflation continues to plague producers in the form of input costs. General Mills faced an approximately 14% to 15% increase in its cost of goods sold causing its gross margin to only advance 0.2% from 34.7% to 34.9% compared to the previous year.

This isn’t necessarily surprising as the PPI a measure of inflation from the perspective of producers came in at 7.3% in August above expectations of 7.1%. Regardless this was offset by the aforementioned pricing power of the firm which sustains this still impressive margin.

Wall Street liked this news sending shares up 5.72% on Wednesday despite downward market pressures after the Federal Reserve’s announcement of a 75 basis point interest rate hike.

What’s even more appealing is the 32% gain of General Mills over the last year compared to the -16% return of the S&P 500 (SPX) thanks to solid fundamentals and significant barriers to entry.

General Mills was founded in 1928 and has grown to manage a diverse selection of consumer staples including brands such as Cheerios Blue Buffalo and Pillsbury. With commitments to drive shareholder value through its Accelerate strategy the company pledges to constantly innovate and capitalize on its scale.

General Mills Has Solid Fundamentals

General Mills success in Q1 can be partially attributed to its respectable fundamentals though they may come at a premium to investors.

The company’s Fiscal 2022 gross operating and net margins are 33.71% 17.14% and 14.25% respectively. While these values themselves contain some insight it’s important to compare such metrics to previous performance or fellow competitors for a more effective ratio analysis. Accordingly General Mills’ gross margin is superior to about 67% of companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods Industry and the operating and net margins are superior to about an impressive 88% of companies in the same industry.

Furthermore its return on equity which can be interpreted as the amount of net income produced by $1 of shareholder’s equity is 40.34% better than about 96% of companies in the industry. In a similar manner but with respect to assets instead of shareholder’s equity its return on assets is 8.52%.

It is also vital to consider the economic profit or “economic value added” of the company by finding the difference between the return on invested capital and the weighted average cost of capital determining how efficiently and effectively the company manages shareholder money.

Currently GISs economic profit is 5% which has been generally stable over the past 10 years. While not extremely high it does outperform competitors such as the -3% economic profit of The Kraft Heinz Co. (NASDAQ: KHC) and the 4% economic profit of Kellogg (NYSE: K).

While General Mills capital management may be positive attention should be drawn to its management of debt through the form of liquidity ratios which are measures of how easily a company can satisfy its short-term debt.

General Mills’ current and quick ratios are 0.63x and 0.4x respectively which are quite low. These metrics place General Mills below about 90% of fellow companies in the industry.

A cursory glance at the balance sheet would reveal a decrease in cash and cash equivalents since last year with considerable increases in accounts payable and the current portion of long-term debt; monitoring this is a necessity as more long-term debt becomes current which could detract from future cash flow.

Speaking of cash operating cash flow increased from $370 million in the prior year to $389 million in Fiscal Q1 2023. 90% of this is expected to be converted to free cash flow in Fiscal 2023 which can proliferate the company’s ability to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. In Q1 alone the company paid $325 million in dividends and repurchased $501 million worth of shares up from only $150 million in the previous year.

Finally while these fundamentals are strong they come at a price. Its P/E ratio is currently 19.5x with a forward P/E of 19.3x and a PEG ratio of 3.48. GuruFocus also assigns GIS an intrinsic value of $64.69 and with shares trading at $80.78 the stock appears overvalued.

General Mills Increases Its Fiscal 2023 Guidance

CEO Jeff Harmening was pleased with these results stating “We continue to deliver strong performance in a highly volatile operating environment.” As a result he continued “Given the strength of our first-quarter results and confidence in our ability to adapt to continued volatility ahead we are increasing our full-year outlook for net sales operating profit and EPS growth.”

Organic net sales growth which was previously expected to increase by 4% to 5% is now expected to increase by 6% to 7%. Adjusted operating profit growth which was previously expected to be -2% to +1% is now expected to be flat to +3%. Finally adjusted diluted EPS growth was increased from flat to +3% to +2% to +5%.

Any growth is notable in an inflationary and rising interest rate environment and increasing such growth is even more impressive pointing to the sustainable competitive advantages the firm enjoys.

The Keys to Success: Sustainable Competitive Advantages

The goal of any firm is to enjoy above-average profits over the long term a “sustainable competitive advantage” and the goal of investors is to subsequently identify such companies. Doing so is quite simple when considering General Mills facilitating its strong performance.

The majority of these competitive advantages of General Mills are rooted in basic economics. For instance General Mills has been able to mitigate the effects of inflation. Why? Because of the inelastic nature of its products.

Elasticity is a measure of how consumers’ demand reacts to a change in price. For elastic goods a change in price provokes a substantial change in demand and for inelastic goods a change in price has little effect on demand. Food for both humans and pets is inelastic. Regardless of changes in price consumers and their pets still need to eat granting the firm the ability to maintain sales despite increasing prices.

On the contrary dining at restaurants may be decreasingly feasible for consumers as the prices of both food and other necessities continue to climb. Subsequently many are choosing to eat at home leading to even more demand for products in the tried and true brands of General Mills.

Moreover the company also enjoys economies of scale and scope by producing a great deal of a wide variety of products creating multiple revenue streams. This along with well-established brands worth $9 billion create economic moats or barriers to entry preventing other companies from entering the industry.

In Q1 General Mills either grew or held market share in 66% of U.S. retail sales. This was due in part to the company’s successful execution of vertical integration as seen in the acquisition of TNT Crust a frozen pizza crust producer with double-digit compound annual net sales growth.

The combination of inelastic goods and a substantial market share along with the numerous barriers to entry established by economies of scale scope and brand recognition has proven to be beneficial for the company consumers and shareholders alike.

Is GIS a Good Stock to Buy?

Wall Street enjoyed General Mills’ Q1 Earnings but it may now be somewhat overvalued. As such GIS currently has a Hold rating based on three Buys 11 Holds and two Sells. The average General Mills price target of $76.81 suggests 2.8% downside potential with a high price target of $88 and a low target of $57.

Conclusion: General Mills Valuation Offsets Its Strong Fundamentals

In an oligopolistic market with a few large competitors it is apparent that General Mills is able to mitigate the effects of inflation. Along with positive fundamentals and a track record of growth through successful acquisitions the many competitive advantages and economic moats may create the same confidence in investors as the company has established in consumers regarding quality and loyalty to their products. However the current valuation is not as attractive.

Upon returning to levels closer to its intrinsic value this consumer staple stock could also be a staple in one’s portfolio.

The largest U.S. automaker currently builds GM’s six-speed eight-speed and 10-speed rear-wheel drive and nine-speed front-wheel drive transmissions in a variety of Chevrolet Buick GMC and Cadillac at its 2.82-million square foot Toledo Ohio transmission plant that it has renamed Toledo Propulsion Systems.

Congress in August approved significant financial incentives for automakers to convert plants producing parts for gasoline-pore vehicles to electric models.

GM ANNOUNCES $491M INVESTMENT IN INDIANA FACILITY AS PART OF EV PRODUCTION EFFORTS

""Once the plant is converted it will produce GM’s family of EV drive units which convert electric power from the battery pack to mechanical motion at the wheels"" GM said adding the plant will produce transmission products while building drive units simultaneously during GM’s EV transition.

The Toledo facility currently employs approximately 1500 people. Many autoworkers have expressed concerns about the shift to EVs and if it would impact current auto employment.

""This investment helps build job security for our Toledo team for years to come and is the next step on our journey to an all-electric future"" said GM executive vice president of Global Manufacturing and Sustainability Gerald Johnson.

GM said last year it would increase its EV and autonomous vehicle investments from 2020 through 2025 to $35 billion a 75% increase as it vows to stop selling gas-powered vehicles by 2035.

GM and LG Energy Solution said last month they are considering a site in Indiana for a fourth U.S. battery cell manufacturing plant for the companies' joint venture.

Employees who had worked remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic are expected to “pivot to a more regular in-person work cycle” which includes three days on GM’s campus each week a spokesperson said Friday. The return-to-office mandate will take effect later this year the spokesperson said.

“We’re committed to maintaining flexibility to ensure our employees can attend to personal commitments” the spokesperson said. “We will share details with them in the coming weeks.”

Detroit-based GM joins a long list of corporations including Apple Inc. Peloton Interactive Inc. and Comcast Corp. that have asked workers since Labor Day to return to offices several days a week.

GM like much of the auto industry allowed white-collar workers to log in remotely under its “work appropriately” strategy during the pandemic.

Ford Motor Co. said Saturday it’s keeping a “flexible hybrid” model that only requires salaried workers to appear in-person for group meetings. Mitsubishi Motors North America Inc. offers its corporate employees the option to work from home all the time.

Those policies stand in stark contrast to Tesla Inc. where Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk ordered workers in June to spend 40 hours per week in the office and dismissed remote work as “pretend.”

While many CEOs remain critical of remote work some research has shown that people who work from home are just as productive and typically more satisfied than office workers.

Still the ability to work remotely presents a wrinkle for companies with a mix of white-collar and frontline workers: Management must walk a fine line when they extend flexibility to some employees and not to others.

GM employs more than 94000 people in the US including about 2300 workers at its Detroit Renaissance Center global headquarters according to the company’s website.

The automaker said Friday that the drive units will be used in the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV 2024 GMC Sierra EV and current GMC Hummer EVs. GM's Factory Zero which straddles Detroit and Hamtramck is currently building the Hummer and will build the Silverado EV along with Orion Assembly in Orion Township.

Toledo Propulsion Systems will be GM’s first U.S. powertrain or propulsion-related factory transformed for EV-related production. Last week GM said it will invest $491 million at the GM Marion Stamping plant in Marion Indiana to prepare it to make steel and aluminum-stamped parts for future vehicles — including EVs — made at various GM assembly plants.

“Our Toledo team has a long proud history of building great products and they have worked hard to earn this investment” Gerald Johnson GM executive vice president of Global Manufacturing and Sustainability said in a statement. “This investment helps build job security for our Toledo team for years to come.""

GM's investment is a recognition of UAW Local 14 members ""skills know-how and drive that make GM successful” said UAW President Ray Curry in a statement.

GM purchased Toledo Propulsion Systems in 1956. It employs 1500 people and currently builds GM’s six-speed eight-speed and 10-speed rear-wheel drive and nine-speed front-wheel drive transmissions that are used in various Chevrolet Buick GMC and Cadillac vehicles.

But GM has said it will transition to a lineup of all zero-emissions vehicles by 2035 and be a carbon-neutral company by 2040. It is in the process of bringing 30 new EVs to the global market by 2025.

As GM transitions to all-electric CEO Mary Barra has promised to bring all employees along for the transformation. Last year GM introduced its Automotive Manufacturing Electrical College (AMEC) to teach workers about various aspects of electric car production.

Johnson said the investment in Toledo is an example of GM’s intention to create jobs and retain its current workforce. GM has invested more than $1.9 billion at Toledo since 2011 including Friday's announced investment.

Renovation work at Toledo Propulsion Systems will begin this month. GM spokesman Dan Flores said the company is not disclosing how long that renovation work will take but he said once the plant is converted it will make EV drive units. Those are units that convert electric power from the battery pack to mechanical motion at the wheels. GM’s EV drive units will cover front-wheel drive rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive propulsion combinations including high-performance and off-road capabilities.

The Toledo Propulsion Systems team will continue building internal combustion engine transmission products while building drive units simultaneously during GM’s EV transition.

Studies of islatravir for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) will be discontinued and there was no announcement about the development of implants or injections.

Islatravir or EFdA (formerly known as MK-8591) is a first-in-class nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI) with multiple mechanisms of action. It has a long half-life in the body and initially showed potential for both long-acting HIV treatment and prevention.

Islatravir as part of a once-daily combination with Merck's approved NNRTI doravirine (Pifeltro) demonstrated good activity in previously untreated people. Another study showed that this combination maintained viral suppression in people who switched from their current regimen.

Glossary long-acting In pharmacology a medication which maintains its effects over a long period of time such as an injection or implant. oral Refers to the mouth for example a medicine taken by mouth. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Regulatory agency that evaluates and approves medicines and medical devices for safety and efficacy in the United States. The FDA regulates over-the-counter and prescription drugs including generic drugs. The European Medicines Agency performs a similar role in the European Union. reverse transcriptase A retroviral enzyme which converts genetic material from RNA into DNA an essential step in the lifecycle of HIV. Several classes of anti-HIV drugs interfere with this stage of HIV’s life cycle: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). nucleoside A precursor to a building block of DNA or RNA. Nucleosides must be chemically changed into nucleotides before they can be used to make DNA or RNA.

Because doravirine is not suitable for long-acting therapy Merck also paired islatravir with its experimental long-acting NNRTI MK-8507 in a once-weekly regimen. In addition Merck and Gilead Sciences started a study of islatravir plus Gilead’s long-acting HIV capsid inhibitor lenacapavir (Sunlenca) which was recently approved in Europe.

Islatravir was also being evaluated for PrEP both as a once-monthly pill and as an implant which early studies suggested could provide protection against HIV for a year.

But islatravir ran into trouble due to unexpected -- and still unexplained -- safety issues.

In November 2021 Merck announced that participants who received once-weekly islatravir plus MK-8507 experienced a decline in CD4 T cells. Further review found that CD4 counts also fell in people taking once-daily islatravir plus doravirine for HIV treatment while those taking islatravir alone for PrEP experienced a decline in total lymphocyte counts. (T cells are one type of lymphocyte and they usually are not measured separately in HIV-negative people.)

Merck did extensive animal studies of islatravir prior to human trials and saw no signal of T cell declines but the drug is metabolised differently in animals and people. The decline in CD4 cells was small and subtle in people who received once-daily islatravir but larger in those who used the higher once-weekly dose. Some of the latter participants saw a 50% drop in their CD4 count and some fell below the 200 cells/mm3 threshold that defines AIDS.

In December Merck announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had placed a partial clinical hold on seven trials of islatravir plus doravirine for HIV treatment meaning current participants could continue to receive the drug but no new ones would be randomised. The FDA also placed a full clinical hold on studies of injectable islatravir for treatment and all formulations of islatravir for PrEP meaning participants would no longer receive the drug. In addition Merck and Gilead suspended their study of islatravir plus lenacapavir.

""We don't have a full explanation right now"" Dr Michael Robertson executive director of Merck Research Laboratories said during a December 16 virtual meeting with HIV community advocates. ""The CD4 count is concerning but the overall safety profile [of islatravir] has been really excellent so we don't want to throw out the baby out with the bathwater….We're going to do everything we can to understand that and see if there's a path forward.""

A path forward for treatment but not for PrEP

Since that time Merck researchers have conducted extensive analyses to learn more about the adverse events and have held discussions with regulators about the fate of islatravir. This resulted in a plan to start new treatment trials using a lower oral dose of islatravir but development of islatravir for PrEP has been halted.

One new phase III study will evaluate once-daily islatravir plus doravirine for previously untreated people with HIV and two trials will test the combination as a switch option for treatment-experienced people with an undetectable viral load. Some participants currently enrolled in islatravir treatment studies will have the option to transition to the lower dose. In addition Merck and Gilead agreed to resume the phase II trial of once-weekly oral islatravir plus lenacapavir using the lower dose.

In one of the earlier treatment trials 90% of previously untreated participants achieved an undetectable viral load using the initially selected 0.75mg once-daily dose of islatravir plus doravirine but the response rate was nearly as high (86%) for those who used a lower 0.25mg dose. Merck’s announcement this week did not specify the dose that would be used in the new trials.

Even if the lower dose proves to be safe a new once-daily regimen of islatravir plus doravirine would not be a game-changer as several effective daily options are already available. But a once-weekly oral regimen would be a welcome new option. While the CD4 cell decline was greatest in people who received once-weekly islatravir plus a high dose of MK-8507 an additive effect has not been seen with lenacapavir so far.

While treatment studies are going forward Merck decided to discontinue the development of once-monthly oral islatravir for PrEP “after careful evaluation and analysis” as a lower dose might not offer long-lasting protection. What’s more adverse events are a more pressing concern with PrEP compared to treatment because PrEP drugs are used by large numbers of healthy HIV-negative people and the risk-benefit balance is different.

The company remains confident in the nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor drug class and will soon start a phase Ib trial of a novel candidate known as MK-8527.

“We continue to believe in the potential of the NRTTI mechanism and we are evaluating additional candidates with the goal of helping to address unmet needs in HIV prevention” said Eliav Barr MD chief medical officer of Merck Research Laboratories.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb3NwYWNlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2ZkYS1hZHZpc29yeS1jb21taXR0ZWUtcHJlcGFyZXMtdG8tdGFja2xlLWFub3RoZXItcDEzay1pbmhpYml0b3Itc2VjdXJhLWJpby1zLWNvcGlrdHJhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ODAC Hones in on Secura's P13K Inhibitor in Next Vote,"JHVEPhoto/GettyImages

The FDA will meet Friday to discuss the future of Secura Bio’s Copiktra (duvelisib) which has been approved as a third-line treatment for relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL).

Copiktra is an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-delta and PI3K-gamma. The Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) members will examine updated overall survival data and safety and tolerability concerns that plague the PI3K inhibitor class.

PI3K inhibitors have become an especially troubling class of drugs for the FDA as concerns continue to mount over their safety.

Earlier this year an FDA advisory committee overwhelmingly recommended halting single-arm clinical studies of PI3K inhibitors due to safety concerns.

Instead ODAC the same committee that will review Copiktra’s data recommended the use of randomized clinical trials in order to mitigate the safety concerns.

Gilead Sciences withdrew its P13K inhibitor Zydelig (idelalisib) from the market. In June The FDA withdrew approval of TG Therapeutics' cancer drug Ukoniq (umbralisib). Bayer’s copanlisib has also been brought into question.

Copiktra which Boston-based Verastem initially developed was granted full approval by the FDA in 2018. In addition to CLL it was also granted accelerated approval as a second-line treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL).

Secura Bio based in Nevada acquired Copiktra in 2020 for $311 million and withdrew the FL indication following a strategic review of the FL landscape.

Long-term follow-up data that will be reviewed suggests Copiktra did not provide longer life to patients when equated to the Novartis comparator drug Arzerra. However in its briefing documents the FDA honed in on Copiktra’s concerning safety data.

“Duvelisib is associated with substantial toxicity that includes fatal or serious infection diarrhea or colitis rash pneumonitis hepatotoxicity and neutropenia” the FDA wrote in its briefing documents.

Pointing to the DUO trial the FDA said patients treated with duvelisib experienced higher rates of adverse and serious adverse events. Trial data showed 23 patients who received Copiktra about 15% of that patient population died. Only 5 patients who received Novartis’ Arzerra (atumumab) about 3% died.

The primary difference in fatal adverse events was infection typically pneumonia. Data showed that 14 patients (9%) experienced a fatal infection with Copiktra compared to one patient for Kesimpta the report said.

Other safety data showed 124 patients treated with Copiktra about 78% of the patient population faced serious adverse events while 50 patients in the Arzerra arm about 32% suffered serious adverse events. Seventy patients who received Copiktra discontinued treatment and 48 patients saw their dosing levels reduced.

Beyond CLL Copiktra is being assessed as a potential treatment for peripheral T-cell lymphoma. It previously received Fast Track designation from the FDA for this indication.

Upcoming Business: GSK’s Zejula

In November ODAC will again meet but this time to discuss GSK PARP inhibitor Zejula.

The meeting comes after the company announced its intentions to withdraw Zejula as a fourth-line treatment for advanced ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer that is associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) positive status.

GSK noted the decision was made in consultation with the FDA and based on a totality of PARP inhibitor data in the late-line ovarian cancer treatment setting. In its note GSK reported that data from other PARP inhibitors showed a “potential detrimental effect on overall survival” in studies conducted in a BRCA mutant 3L+ advanced ovarian cancer population.

During the meeting the committee will hear updated data including final overall survival data from the NOVA trial. The committee will determine whether the data supports continued labeling in the U.S. market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL2NvcGlrdHJhcy1ibG9vZC1jYW5jZXItbm9kLWplb3BhcmR5LWZkYS1leHBlcnRzLXZvdGUtZG93bi1zZWN1cmFzLXBpM2stZHJ1Z9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Copiktra's blood cancer nod in jeopardy as FDA experts vote down Secura's PI3K drug,"Securo Bio’s Copiktra looks on track to follow other PI3K inhibitors in bowing out of certain blood cancer markets after an FDA expert panel backed a negative review by the agency’s internal team.

An FDA panel of external cancer experts voted 8-4 against Copiktra’s currently FDA-approved use in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

The panel reiterated the FDA’s concerns that the drug hasn’t demonstrated a favorable benefit-risk profile. Because of serious side effects Copiktra could have a potential detrimental effect on patient survival despite it's ability to stave off disease progression the FDA found.

During heated discussions at Friday’s meeting Securo and the FDA argued about whether Copiktra’s side effects indeed killed more patients than the cancer would have otherwise.

The data that triggered the FDA scrutiny came from a longer follow-up of the phase 3 DUO trial. After a five-year follow-up patients who received Copiktra after failing at least two prior therapies experienced a 6% higher risk of death compared with Novartis' Arzerra though the difference wasn’t statistically significant.

Still the debate isn’t about Copiktra’s efficacy—the drug showed strong tumor response and disease progression data—but rather safety. Among patients who enrolled in DUO for third or later-line treatment 13 patients (14%) in the Copiktra arm died from side effects versus four (4%) for Arzerra.

DUO’s trial design also allowed patient crossover between the study groups upon disease progression. By the FDA’s analysis among nine patients in the Copiktra arm that later got Arzerra none died because of side effects. In contrast among 90 Arzerra patients that went on to receive Copiktra nine (10%) died from side effects.

Secura the FDA and the expert panel all acknowledged that patient crossovers have made an exact interpretation of Copiktra’s patient survival profile impossible. But the FDA figured the safety signals are alarming enough.

For its part Secura argued that the longer-term analysis at least didn’t show any detrimental effect of Copiktra on patient survival. After all the death risks were similar between the two trial arms the company said.

But as an FDA official pointed out during the meeting it’s not a qualification for approval if a drug doesn’t show patient detriment. Rather showing a benefit is. And several panelists agreed.

“It’s incumbent upon the sponsor to establish that there was a favorable risk-benefit profile. I think given the current context that data about this class extended follow up on this study I don’t think they’ve established that.” David Harrington Ph.D. from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute noted in his no vote.

“I thought this data was extremely difficult to interpret but […] I do have concerns about this class of medication” Christopher Lieu M.D. from the University of Colorado Cancer Center explained for his vote against Copiktra. “If we’re not clearly improving overall survival in our patients but we’re increasing toxicity and treatment-associated death I’m not sure that we are truly helping patients.”

Before Copiktra the FDA studied safety problems with multiple PI3K inhibitors during a separate advisory committee meeting in April. As the FDA’s scrutiny mounted Gilead Sciences Bayer Incyte and TG Therapeutics either pulled their PI3K indications off the market or scrapped their application plans.

Secura has also pulled a Copiktra accelerated approval in follicular lymphoma in December but decided to keep fighting for the full approval in CLL/SLL which is currently the drug’s only commercial indication. The company has recently also withdrawn Farydak as a treatment alongside Takeda’s Velcade and the corticosteroid dexamethasone in multiple myeloma after two prior regimens citing difficulty to complete the required confirmatory clinical trial.

Four panelists during Friday’s meeting sided with Secura arguing the tumor shrinkage and disease progression benefits support Copiktra’s use at least in some heavily pretreated CLL/SLL patients.

The new devices are both mobile and lightweight and can accept in-person payments for enterprise and platform businesses according to an announcement on the Adyen website.

The NYC1 is meant for “businesses that have already invested in hardware like phones or tablets and want to add payments to their set-up” according to a press release. Businesses can offer customized payment flow in their own POS app using the device.

The AMS1 is meant for “enterprise and platform businesses that want to be able to access all operational apps via one device” the release stated. Businesses can accept payments and run their own business application on this all-in-one terminal which has an Android operating system.

The launch marks Adyen’s first foray into hardware design. The firm worked closely with some of its largest customers to design the devices according to the website announcement.

“We designed two devices that would seamlessly fit into their payments journeys” Adyen said in the announcement. “Their brief to us was simple: terminals that support mobile customer journeys at an affordable cost with a powerful battery.”

“Adyen’s commitment is to help businesses realize their ambitions faster and creating our own terminals is the latest way we’re delivering on this promise” said Adyen Chief Operating Officer Kamran Zaki in the release. “We always innovate based on customer feedback to deliver superior experiences with speed and flexibility. With our in-person payments offering businesses have a full suite of terminals to choose from enabling them to pick the best one to meet their specific needs.”

In addition to its dedicated POS machines Adyen is involved in the ongoing rollout of Tap to Pay on iPhone which allows businesses to use iPhones to accept contactless payments without the need to purchase or manage additional hardware.

To adapt to new realities the travel and tourism industry had to embrace contactless payments as a way of aiding social distancing.

This has hastened the adoption of next-generation technology and contactless payments in travel and hospitality are now the norm. Each customer-to-merchant interaction may be done digitally giving customers a secure worry-free and seamless experience.

According to Identiv the global contactless payments market will rise to $18 billion over the next five years representing an 11.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). As a result 27% of small businesses have noticed an increase in consumers’ contactless spending habits and alternative payment technologies such as BNPL services are now included in Apple’s iOS 16 release as part of Apple Pay.

Customer expectations have changed drastically as they emerge from pandemic life. Many see digital services as the ‘new normal’ so expect this to be replicated when going abroad. Yet as hotels try to meet these needs without the right assets and processes in place it’s proving a challenge.

If you’ve been in the travel industry for a while you’re probably getting tired of hearing people complain about how long it takes to get paid by credit card processors. Transaction values in travel are getting higher and systems are getting older. The manual processing of customers is one of the greatest pain points and hotels find it hard to collect and keep customer information all into one secure database.

In the modern travel industry businesses can no longer afford to use inefficient and dated payment methods. Sophisticated technology that automates routine payment processes is needed. This will help hotel operators reduce operational costs and allow them to be more efficient with collecting guest payments. Omnichannel services will help staff to monitor and swiftly issue payments and be comfortably integrated into self-service machines alleviating pressures for staff from the front desk.

The future of alternative payments

As it stands the travel industry should rethink travel putting payments first as many other industries have done. The popularity of digital wallets contactless payments and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) methods has accelerated. Customers look for a simple stress-free experience and don’t want to book a room at a hotel which doesn’t accept their preferred payment method or lack a guest checkout option. Without this wide range of choices hotels will fall victim to their competitors as customers will go elsewhere.

Swapping to an omnichannel end-to-end payment is the competitive advantage hoteliers have been looking for. A unified end-to-end payment process can help manage online booking fees and accommodation deposits. These fees can be collected swiftly while customer data is easily tracked on a scale and recorded all in one place.

International payments processing

As a hotel owner the importance of multi-language payment should not be underestimated. It allows travel businesses to cater to both a local and broader audience reaching new possible customers across the globe.

Multi-currency payments are also important for any hotel business. This choice can attract customers who are more likely to decide when to buy especially when it’s a currency they are familiar with.

Finally hotels that integrate Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) features on their website allow the customer to pay in their local currency and save money on exchange rates. Full payment transparency is shown on the terminal at the point of sale (POS) benefitting the experience of both the customer and the business.

Secure end-to-end payments

Implementing an innovative payment method has a multitude of benefits for hotel businesses. The centralised nature of end-to-end payments means transactions can be processed faster. With a rise in late bookings and last-minute cancellations hotel owners can easily accept payments and issue refunds.

A centralised system can help with tracking real-time customer data. Complete visibility allows businesses to cater to every customer exclusively including tailored support and opportunities to give rewards to returning customers. The result? The golden ticket to customer loyalty and retention.

With unnecessary admin being largely taken care of businesses can focus on high-priority tasks and ensure more can be done to improve the business. A dependable and trustworthy solution will reflect positively on your team experience that stands out as seamless and flexible is a feature most customers look for in hotel stays and distinguish one business from the other.

Sophisticated technology that automates routine payment processes is needed. This will help hotel operators reduce operational costs and allow them to be more efficient with collecting guest payments. Omnichannel services will help staff to monitor and swiftly issue payments where needed. In addition multi-language and currency software automatically reduces time spent worrying about exchange rates and language barriers. The power of innovative technology can allow payments to be comfortably integrated into self-service machines alleviating pressures for staff from the front desk.

Digital payments as a service

Contactless payments are the way forward in a post-pandemic future and early adopters will undoubtedly have an advantage.

From making reservations to hotel check-ins and check-outs ordering catering and room service sightseeing and learning about events and tourist attractions there is nothing contactless hospitality solutions cannot do more efficiently while maintaining brand integrity.

The industry-wide message is clear: businesses should no longer neglect the value-added services these modernized payment systems provide.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWRlZmluYW5jZWdsb2JhbC5jb20vcG9zdHMvZmluYXN0cmEtdmlzYS1hbm5vdW5jZS1iYWFzLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRpb24tZWFzZS1jcm9zcy1ib3JkZXItcGF5bWVudC1jYXBhYmlsaXRpZXMv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHJhZGVmaW5hbmNlZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9wb3N0cy9maW5hc3RyYS12aXNhLWFubm91bmNlLWJhYXMtY29sbGFib3JhdGlvbi1lYXNlLWNyb3NzLWJvcmRlci1wYXltZW50LWNhcGFiaWxpdGllcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finastra and Visa announce a BaaS collaboration to ease cross-border payment capabilities,"Finastra and Visa announced a Banking as a Service (BaaS) collaboration on September 22 2022.

This partnership will co-develop new features for Finastra’s Payments Hub solutions. It will also implement Visa Direct a digital payment network connecting more than two billion accounts through push-to-account offerings.

Finastra’s bank customers will now have access to cross-border payouts with a specific targeting audience of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and individuals. This new service will allow for international payments in multiple different currencies.

Barry Rodrigues executive vice president payments business unit at Finastra said “This BaaS partnership will allow banks to offer their customers greater choice in how to route cross-border payments.

“It provides a solution for banks seeking to help increase overall customer satisfaction and loyalty through a transparent and cost-effective digital payments option.”

This new capability offered by Finastra’s Payments Hub solutions and Visa Direct bypasses challenges associated with deploying custom-built cross-border payment solutions––namely expense and time-consuming processes.

More specifically the new feature available on-premises or in the cloud through software as a service (SaaS) will enable banks to integrate the Visa network via Finastra’s FusionFabric.cloud open development platform. They will be able to offer quick low-cost payments for their customers with great transparency.

Ruben Salazar Genovez senior vice president and global head of Visa Direct said “Innovation in cross-border money movement is accelerating at an incredible pace.

“Banks are under pressure to quickly implement and launch programs for their customers that stay ahead of their expectations.

“Together we [Finastra and Visa] are bringing benefits of our network to thousands of banks globally providing a wide range of new and existing case studies to clients.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ob21lLzIwMjIwOTIzMDA1MjI3L2VuL1dpc2UtUGxhdGZvcm0tTGF1bmNoZXMtSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1SZWNlaXZlLVNlcnZpY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wise Platform Launches International Receive Service,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ob21lLzIwMjIwOTIzMDA1MjI3L2VuL1dpc2UtUGxhdGZvcm0tTGF1bmNoZXMtSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1SZWNlaXZlLVNlcnZpY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026740675000>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Women of Honduran Garifuna and Dominican Caribeñe women of Roxbury women of Las Vegas. Women of color who survived and thrived.

Before Rixy’s paintings — neon and nearly animated with a specific soulful brilliance and sultry boldness — covered walls from Worcester to Allston her work was always a reflection of herself and the women in her life.

“I used artwork as a mirror trying to find my identity” Rixy said. “Once I started putting confidence in myself and the women around me the more I wanted to embody that beauty and power. For me and the women I know these are the superheroes.”

My life is a beautiful resistance because I think it has bloomed from survival from the survival of my lineage from my family. I don’t like to necessarily glorify the struggle but at the same time I can’t erase it. My life is a beautiful resistance because of survival and the tactics we had to use to bring ourselves here and make sure we are present through all of these shifts.

The Hispanic history I carry with me is between vigor and resiliency. When I think about my heritage I think about immigration. I think about what my family has done to bring us here the story of my ancestors and what they have gone through. At the same time our culture is so vibrant and beautiful and it isn’t knocking anyone down. It’s interesting how we can be with so much color music food family and love yet the migrations we have gone through are hard.

What gives you joy?

Safety and security. Something about being able to see my loved ones happy and safe and health right now that’s really bringing me joy. More than anything seeing people be able to lean into themselves and take care of themselves as hard as it is gives me joy. What gives me joy is making dinner for my. mom having my friends over for a good time and the art I create.

Describe the role art has as a powerful tool of representation and space-holding.

In my form of public art we’re really reiterating stories of our community. As fantastical and surreal and stylized as the art can be it can look like a whole dream and we’re reflecting our inner dialogues the stories we have experienced.

Art has a really beautiful way at least for me personally of reinterpreting life. I put things in a cartoon stylized way so I can interpret what is going on. It creates a lot more inner peace to be able to let it out in a healthy organized way of artmaking and shows people they are here. Being able to represent and create based on my culture my family to say we’re here and we’re beautiful. You can’t ignore public art.

""Tea Time with Princess B” a 2020 mural by Rixy in Lawrence. Rixy

What inspired you to become an artist?

At first I was really looking at art as a safe haven for myself. I went into art because it was where I could talk to myself and understand parts of myself when I was alone. The conversations I was having internally were the same as the conversations other people were having.

Art is almost an international language. We can all be sharing the same dialogue without saying many words. To create is such a superpower. It drives me so much to know that I have the power to keep dialogue going.

You center women of color in your work. How did that become your passion and mission?

Knowing those stories of the women in my life and what they had to go through? They deserve the biggest spotlight possible these bold ass women. The more life is going on I realize the toxicity that looks to limit our identities and I wanted to break that mold. The social impact became so therapeutic and empowering.

Thomas James ""Tommy"" Chenevert age 71 of Dover Ohio passed away Saturday July 16 2022 in Dover's Hennis Care Centre following a long illness.

Born February 26 1951 in Napoleonville Louisiana he was a son of the late Gerald and Olivia Sussman Chenevert. Tommy graduated from Assumption High School in Napoleonville and went on to earn his bachelor’s degree in Business Management from Nicholls State University and later a Petroleum Engineering degree from the University of Southwestern Louisiana. He was employed as a Port Captain at Tidewater Marine and Petroleum Engineer at Halliburton. Tommy married the former Barbara Ferry Turney on April 6 1986 and the couple has resided in Dover the past 28 years.

Tommy was a member of St. Anne Catholic Church in Napoleonville and attended St. Joseph Catholic Church in Dover.

Tommy was a good and moral man who loved God deeply. Tommy loved most to be with his family and friends visiting cooking for them and enjoying nice meals with them. He enjoyed playing sports especially tennis in his youth and watching them as he grew older. In his youth he also enjoyed time with his family at the Fort at Lake Verret. He had a gift for art and did very nice pen and ink drawings and cards for family and friends for special occasions. He had a great sense of humor and could start a group laughing when he started chuckling and couldn’t stop. He was a loyal and loving family member and friend. He will be greatly missed but always loved.

In addition to his wife Barbara he is survived by his step-children Bradford (Barbi) and Jennifer Turney; his grandson Logan Turney; his sisters Clare (Rodney) Acosta and Sue (Tommie) Aysenne; his brothers Matthew (Wanda) and Jerry (Debbie) Chenevert brother-in-law Michael Stein; and his many nieces and nephews.

Besides his parents Tommy was preceded in death by his sister Elizabeth (Betty) Stein and his brother Mark Chenevert.

Honoring his wishes Tommy was cremated and a memorial service was held Saturday July 23 at 1:30 p.m. in the Toland-Herzig Funeral Home & Crematory Dover Ohio; Fr. Jimmy Hatfield officiated.

Funeral services will be held at St. Anne’s Catholic Church in Napoleonville Louisiana on Saturday September 24 2022. Visitation will be held from 9:00 t0 11:00 A.M. A funeral Mass will follow at 11:00 A.M. with burial later in St. Anne Catholic Cemetery Napoleonville. Family and friends are invited to join us in remembering and in celebrating Tommy’s life.

Instead of flowers the family requests that contributions in Tommy's memory be made to the National Kidney Foundation or the American Cancer Society.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8va2l0Y2hlbmVyLmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvYWNjdXNlZC1pbi1sdWNhcy1zaG9ydHJlZWQtY2FzZS1ncmFudGVkLWJhaWwtMS42MDgxMzE30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Accused in Lucas Shortreed case granted bail,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8va2l0Y2hlbmVyLmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvYWNjdXNlZC1pbi1sdWNhcy1zaG9ydHJlZWQtY2FzZS1ncmFudGVkLWJhaWwtMS42MDgxMzE30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EC690C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

FERGUS – The mother of a Fergus teen killed in a hit and run 14 years ago always hoped one day there would be an arrest in the case. But now that it has happened old feelings and emotions are coming back.

Judie Moore mother of Lucas Shortreed said she was shocked when she got the news of the two arrests.

“There’s a real sense of relief and it’s happy people are happy when they see me whereas before it was such a sad occasion” Moore said in an interview.

Shortreed was 18 when he was struck by a car and killed while walking home from a party on Wellington Road 17 on Oct. 10 2008. Police identified the vehicle as a mid-90s white Dodge Neon but never found the car or driver.

As years passed seemingly without any solid leads or arrests Moore said the situation did seem hopeless for years.

That changed on Wednesday when OPP announced they had charged David Alexander Halliburton and Anastasia Marie Halliburton in relation to the case and executed a search warrant at an address on Sideroad 21 in Mapleton not far from where Shortreed was struck recovering a car.

“I always kind of hoped for it” Moore said.

The Halliburtons appeared in a Guelph court on Thursday and were later released on bail.

While there was relief Moore said this has also brought back the anger that nobody came forward.

“You can even understand that they were scared and they drove away that night and couldn’t comprehend it the shock of it all but I just don’t understand how they couldn’t come forward two weeks later a month later or 14 years later come forward on their own accord” Moore said.

Moore said she doesn’t know the couple charged but noted a strange coincidence of having been to the house that was subject to the search warrant in the past as she knew a previous owner.

“At first everyone is happy for the news like we finally found them but then it changes to another more angry emotion like ‘how could they?’” Moore said.

Moore said this case impacted the whole community but thanked them for their continued support in finding an answer.

She noted while there was a lot of press surrounding large billboards and a sign on a transport truck but the community effort seemed to slip by.

“The part that didn’t make the news was that there were these little posters and those posters were pretty much in every storefront downtown and people’s houses and everywhere” Moore said.

“You literally cannot walk downtown without seeing Lucas’ face or drive around a neighbourhood without seeing his face because everybody wanted these people found.”

She holds on to some good memories of her son.

She recalled a story she heard at his funeral when he and friends saw someone get a kite stuck in a tree.

“They were kind of all laughing at him watching and Lucas was the only one that went over and got the kite out of the tree” Moore said.

She also heard second hand from Wellington Terrace staff where Shortreed volunteered for a time about how well he treated the residents there even making a spaghetti lunch at the end of his session.

“They told me this story Lucas didn’t” Moore said. “He just went ahead and did it and he didn’t think it was anything out of the ordinary to do something like that for somebody.”

Mostly to Moore she’ll remember her son as the youngest of the siblings who loved animals and people was caring a bit mischievous and independent.

“It would be awesome to know what he’d be doing now but we’ll never know” Moore said."

Officially opened on September 5 1922 The Stark Building was a construction marvel of its time. It is one of the oldest and most celebrated high-rise commercial buildings in the state.

When The Stark Building first opened in 1922 it was considered to be such a momentous occasion that the Hartford Courant dedicated almost its entire main section to the building. At 17-stories and a height of 256 ft. The Stark Building was one of the two main skyscrapers that dominated the city skyline. The construction of the building was an incredible exercise of architectural design wedded to technological ingenuity and it symbolized the growth of Hartford as one of the leading cities in New England. As the Courant notes the building’s construction required over 2000 tons of structural steel 22466 ft. of piping 30 miles of electrical wire 40000 cubic ft. of limestone three boilers six passenger elevators and one freight elevator. As the main branch for the Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co. It was the first building to use bulletproof glass and has vault doors weighing 27 tons installed in the basement. The building was so advanced for its time that it even had an automatic refrigeration system for the drinking water throughout the building.

“This building just occupied by its owners represents that latest idea in bank and office building design and construction in this country” said the building’s architect Benjamin Wistar Morris (1870-1944). “The primary consideration throughout the operation were convenience the economy of plan arrangement and the best possible construction.”* The Stark Building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Main Street Historic District.

Stark Office Suites and its investors purchased the iconic building in 2017 and commenced a significant renovation/modernization of the historic structure. “Transforming this classic into a modern premium office building right in the center of Hartford’s renaissance has been truly exciting” said Adam Stark president of Stark Office Suites. He and his team have worked painstakingly to preserve the character of this building while bringing it up to twenty-first-century standards. “We wanted to celebrate the building’s old-world charm by preserving the magnificent architectural features and reintroducing a formal doorman to greet our tenants to make the experience of entering the building unique and special” he added. Significant upgrades to enhance the beauty and energy efficiency of the building included a newly remodeled lobby LED lighting throughout the building upgraded elevators HVAC and plumbing systems artwork displays throughout and in all common areas and a unique fiber optic backbone that can give tenants access to managed phone and internet systems integrated into their leases. An outdoor colored lighting system of a similar format to what is used at The Empire State Building was installed and is used regularly for light shows for the benefit of the city.

On the occasion of The Stark Building’s 100th birthday Adam Stark said “The Stark Building represents the grandeur of Hartford’s amazing past and the amazing potential for the city’s future. We are excited to be a part of the next 100 years of this incredible city.”

The Stark Building located at 750 Main St. next to the Old State House in the downtown blends all the modern amenities of a contemporary office facility with the Old World charm of a building steeped in history. The Stark Building offers a wide array of office solutions ranging from single offices up to full floors with a flexible menu of services to choose from including high-end fiber optic managed technology and telephone systems professional conference space and access to all Stark Office Suites locations throughout Connecticut and New York.

Today's Top Deals

This latest production is a revamping of the classic Starting Lineup figures that debuted back in 1988 by Kenner Productions which featured likenesses of the biggest stars from the major sports leagues. The toys first conceived by former football player Pat McInally were very popular throughout the ’80s and ’90s and once included 4-inch action figures of sports stars from basketball baseball football and hockey and even trickled into boxing soccer golf and other sports. The Starting Lineup franchise was eventually purchased by Hasbro in 1991 and later discontinued in 2001. Fast forward more than 20 years and Starting Lineup and its collectible figures are back and better than ever.

The new and improved NBA action figures each of which retails for $49.99 now stand 6-inches tall — a whole two inches taller than their first iteration — and feature premium details with accessories including two pairs of additional hands a flight stand with base an exclusive Panini basketball trading card plus a redemption code for a Panini NFT Trading Card of the featured athlete.

We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.

Hasbro is releasing a set of four action figures featuring characters from the 1980s Dungeons & Dragons cartoon. The new Dungeons & Dragons Cartoon Classics line will include three heroes from the cartoon – Diana the Acrobat Hank the Ranger and Bobby the Barbarian along with a two-pack of series arch-villain Venger and Dungeon Master. Uni will also be included with Bobby's figure. Each figure will also include a different type of dice which can be collected together for a full set. Diana Hank and Bobby's figures will each cost $24.99 while the Venger and Dungeon Master two-pack costs $49.99. The action figures are currently available for pre-order with Venger and Dungeon Master being an exclusive to Target.

The Dungeons & Dragons cartoon originally aired on CBS from 1983 to 1985 as part of that network's Saturday morning cartoon block. The cartoon is basically an isekai anime in which a group of kids from the real world gets transported to a fantasy world filled with D&D monsters and characters. The group is then given abilities (roughly corresponding to D&D classes at the time) by a character literally called the Dungeon Master and try to figure out a way home. Major antagonists of the Dungeons & Dragons cartoon include the evil wizard Venger and the dragon goddess Tiamat who the children occasionally manipulate for their own means.

The characters of the Dungeons & Dragons cartoon have been used more frequently in recent months with Wizards of the Coast producing a special set of Magic: The Gathering cards featuring the characters. Additionally likenesses of the characters were also used in the Dragons of Stormwreck Isle Starter Set adventure.

A leading concern is that hospices will see dips in their referral streams admissions and ultimately their bottom lines according to YoloCares CEO Craig Dresang.

“In most markets hospitals will both refer patients to an independent hospice and compete for patients with a local hospice provider” Dresang told Hospice News. “Since they both refer and compete we must find ways to simultaneously partner and vie for patients in a friendly and collaborative way.”

Some hospice providers feel that this represents a conflict of interest for health systems Dresang said. This is largely due to the potential to see revenue gains from both sides of the reimbursement coin.

The California-based hospice provider is among those that have seen health system and hospital M&A activity rise. For example earlier this year Adventist Health expanded it footprint to Mendocino County.

Last year Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian formed a home care and hospice venture in the California — rebranded as Hoag at Home.

California isn’t the only market seeing a swell of this activity.

In 2021 Wisconsin-based Aspirus Health System expanded with hospice and palliative care programs in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. That same year EmpRes Healthcare subsidiary Eden Health began offering hospice and palliative care in Idaho Falls.

Leaders in some hospices and other providers expect disruption in the M&A space.

Some hospices fear that more competition from health and hospital systems may have adverse financial and operational impacts according to Stan Massey partner and chief strategy officer for Transcend Strategy Group. However strengthening a hospices collaborations and partnerships with them could be improve patient access and somewhat ease workforce pressures he added.

“Some hospices are feeling this perceived threat of competition from health systems” Massey told Hospice News. “But it’s looking for ways to partner with them and provide true quality end-of-life care. Some hospices have been successful in being a partner in research education and filling in gaps of care. The bottom line is that by helping provide the right care it also really does include providing great education and support for family caregivers because ultimately this staffing shortage is going to affect all of health care.”

Several factors are driving facility-based health care organizations to eye home-based care including a growing preference to age in place among seniors. More hospitals and health systems are investing in hospice in a response to growing demand and the current strain on acute care services. Health systems are looking to expand into community-based hospice and palliative care to complement existing offerings while creating new care delivery channels.

More health systems stepping into hospice can have positive effects when it comes to patient access and the ability to quickly process referrals according to St. David’s HealthCare President and CEO David Huffstutler.

“When other health care systems invest in services like hospice care everyone benefits” Huffstutler told Hospice News in an email. “It allows us to discharge patients when they are ready and enables patients to choose a setting in which they are most comfortable – whether that’s in an assisted living facility or their own home.”

Texas-based St. David’s HealthCare was formed through a partnership between hospital operator HCA Healthcare (NYSE: HCA) and two nonprofit organizations — St. David’s Foundation and Georgetown Health Foundation. The recent expansion of services has its roots in HCA’s $400 million acquisition of an 80% stake in Brookdale Senior Living’s home health and hospice segment last year.

The health system recently launched a home health and hospices business branded as St. David’s HealthCare at Home and St. David’s Hospice & Family Care.

“The addition of home health and hospice services to our health care network allows us to expand access to care and improves our ability to meet the needs of our patients” said Huffstutler. “Home health and hospice are critical to the continuum of care. Patients will have improved care coordination and integration of hospice services when they are discharged from our hospitals.”

One of the biggest motivators for hospitals is to expand their continuum of care according to Massey. Part of this motivation is driven by capacity constraints as hospitals see rising demand for inpatient care he said.

“Some of our health-based system clients have really turned to hospice and home health mainly as a pressure relief valve to keep hospital beds. They don’t have enough to meet demand” Massey told Hospice News. “Even though we’re not in a hospital capacity crisis because of COVID any longer there are a lot of hospitals that still are often at capacity issues. Health systems haven’t figured out the mix of patients yet that they are getting from their own hospital systems who are often high acuity and really don’t have that much life left.”

The impact on patient choice quality and understanding of end-of-life care services is at the root of hospice providers’ concern according to Dresang.

Hospital-based hospices have made the market more competitive and more confusing for health care consumers he said.

“On one hand it looks like increased competition. But it is actually limiting competition because a health system will either intentionally or unintentionally limit a patient’s choice regarding hospice” Dresang said. “It has not turned out to be a good thing for patients. It has diluted the public’s understanding of end-of-life care and challenged the independent organizations that have long histories of being integrated into their communities and that serve as a safety net.”

But there’s enough room for health and hospital systems to coexist alongside hospices according to Massey.

Health and hospital systems need the expertise that hospice providers bring when it comes to delivering serious illness and end-of-life care outside their walls in home- and community-based settings he added.

“Home-based hospice care is a different ballgame” said Massey. “They just can’t wave a magic wand and be an expert at providing it without some experience or hiring workers that have the experience. That is part of the appeal. For those hospices that have been serving their communities primarily based on home-based services for 30–40 years they truly are experts. I think they are going to have an edge on the expertise over hospital-based systems for quite some time.”

But questions linger in the minds of hospice providers around whether hospital and health systems will work with or against them in terms of stretching the limited pools of staffing resources wider.

A number of hospice leaders previously told Hospice News that staff poaching from bigger health systems and other providers is becoming a greater source of tension in the industry’s recruitment and retention ground war. This often comes with promises of higher wages more extensive benefit packages or sign-on bonuses.

Health systems tend to be better-positioned financially than hospices to offer staff higher compensation.

This means hospices are fighting harder to recruit and retain enough staff to provide end-of-life care amid widespread workforce shortages according to Dresang.

“Most hospices will never be able to pay nurses at the same rate a unionized hospital does” Dresang told Hospice News. “However we win over candidates with organizational culture benefits and work-life balance.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vc21va3ltb3VudGFpbm5ld3MuY29tL2FyY2hpdmVzL2l0ZW0vMzQzNjktc21hdGhlcnMtc3Vlcy1oY2EtZm9yLWVncmVnaW91cy1tZWRpY2FsLW5lZ2xpZ2VuY2UtZHVyaW5nLXNvbi1zLWJpcnRo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smathers sues HCA for 'egregious' medical negligence during son's birth,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='smokymountainnews.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /archives/item/34369-smathers-sues-hca-for-egregious-medical-negligence-during-son-s-birth (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267416BAAA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vc21va3ltb3VudGFpbm5ld3MuY29tL2FyY2hpdmVzL2l0ZW0vMzQzNjktc21hdGhlcnMtc3Vlcy1oY2EtZm9yLWVncmVnaW91cy1tZWRpY2FsLW5lZ2xpZ2VuY2UtZHVyaW5nLXNvbi1zLWJpcnRo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsbnVyc2VzdW5pdGVkLm9yZy9wcmVzcy9uYXRpb25hbC1udXJzZXMtdW5pdGVkLWFwcGxhdWRzLWNvbnN1bWVyLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLWJ1cmVhdS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,National Nurses United applauds Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on investigation into exploitive training ...,"Nurses charge contracts that create financial obligations are unfair deceptive and abusive

National Nurses United (NNU) applauds the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) efforts to investigate exploitative and coercive employment-related training repayment agreement provisions (TRAPs). NNU defines TRAPs as job-based financial agreements mandated as a condition of employment which require nurses to work minimum periods of time or pay large sums of money for the involuntary so-called “training.”

“These coercive agreements exploit the most vulnerable of our nurses just as they are starting their professional nursing careers” said NNU President Jean Ross RN. “Hospital administrators have corrupted the notion of onboarding and on-the-job training by creating a scheme of modern-day indentured servitude. At a time in our country when we have all seen how valuable nurses are to the health of our country it is a disgrace and a disservice to see hospital corporations extort and exploit a new generation of nurses. We must welcome these nurses into the ranks by supporting and protecting them from the forces that seek to bleed them dry.”

TRAPs are often targeted at newly licensed nurses who are first starting their careers as RNs immigrant nurses or at nurses in areas where one or a few health care corporations dominate the labor market. Hospital employers promote these employer-mandated debt contracts as enhanced education and training programs new graduate contracts or so-called “residency” programs for RNs. More than a third of nurses we surveyed only learned of the debt scheme after they were offered a job and some only learned of it when they were signing papers to accept employment. As market consolidation in the health care industry grows hospital employers leverage their monopoly power to coerce nurses into debt through “take it or leave it” contracts or contracts of adhesion.

Many nurses report they were initially excited to learn about the training but say they were disappointed that much of the so-called “training” was just a rehash of basic nursing school topics or instruction on hospital procedure and policy.

In response to the CFPB’s request for comments NNU conducted a survey of nearly 1700 nurses and compiled a comprehensive document looking at the use of TRAPs and their effects on nurses working conditions and nurse union and advocacy work.

NNU found that nurses commonly cited that the financial contracts binding them to their employers contributed to poor working conditions. Of the more than 325 nurses surveyed who said they are or were in TRAPs 34 percent said they felt restrained from complaining about unsafe staffing or other unsafe or unfair working conditions. In addition nearly 40 percent of those same nurses reported they had to accept low wages during the term of the contract. Many nurses reported being required to work in units that had dangerously low nurse-to-patient staffing ratios. They also reported getting assigned the least desirable shifts and being mistreated but feeling locked into their jobs by the repayment provisions. In comments and interviews nurses recognized danger to themselves and their patients but reported feeling constrained in their ability to complain or leave because of a TRAP.

HCA one of the largest health care corporations in the country widely uses TRAPs when employing newly graduated nurses.

One nurse interviewed by NNU shared how they found themselves trapped in their job and unclear on how much they owed to pay off HCA. Here’s an excerpt from NNU’s comments to the CFPB page 88:

“Nurse H was preparing to enroll in the HCA-owned Research College of Nursing when they received an offer for HCA to cover most of their tuition in exchange for two years of full-time work at HCA Midwest hospitals and an agreement to pay a prorated amount that they think is between $15000-18000 if they left before two years. … They can see a reduction in their debt on each paycheck but do not know how to access a current balance. They did not realize when they signed the contract that they would be required to complete twenty weeks in the StaRN program without any reduction in their debt balance extending their contract past the two years they agreed to… Nurse H is unhappy to be trapped at HCA which pays much lower wages than other jobs that are available to them in the same region doing similar work.”

Furthermore nurses relayed they were facing or fearing retaliation for union activity or engaging in concerted activity with coworkers. One newly graduated nurse who was hired through a staffing agency as a “contract” nurse was told she needed to enroll in a training program and would be required to pay $15000 if she did not complete her 24-month contract. But she quickly found herself deeply concerned for the safety of her patients but was threatened by hospital administrators when she sought help.

As the CFPB investigates employer-driven debt NNU urges the Bureau to consider employment contracts that create financial obligations on nurses or other workers as a condition of employment or as a condition of minimum contract period of labor to be unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices (UDAAPs) under federal consumer protection law. By regulating and investigating employers that use debt or the threat of debt as part of employment contracts the CFPB can play a critical role in ensuring that nurses have safe and fair workplaces where they can meet their professional duties of patient care and advocacy.

“Being there for them and being somebody they can rely on” said Tilley the director of pulmonary renal and oncology medical surgery units.

But nowadays it’s getting harder to find people willing to take on the role. A nursing shortage is affecting LewisGale and hospitals across the country. Nationwide research shows the country could see a shortage of up to 450000 nurses if health care leaders and federal officials don’t take any action.

“We have had to get incredibly creative and innovative on how to staff our hospitals” said Amy woods the chief nursing officer at LewisGale Medical Center in Salem.

Aging nurses nearing retirement age the stress of working during the pandemic and the rise of high-paying travel nursing jobs are all factors.

Nurses say the shortage starts in the classroom which is why LewisGale is partnering with Galen College of Nursing.

“How do we entice the younger generations to want to be nurses?” said Woods. “It starts at a very early age.”

Still staffing academic settings is a challenge too. Putting a nurse in a classroom means taking one out of a hospital.

Another new initiative is that HCA Virginia LewisGale’s parent company is offering $800000 in scholarships for new or current employees to pursue nursing careers at its southwest Virginia facilities including LewisGale Medical Center LewisGale Hospital Alleghany LewisGale Hospital Montgomery and LewisGale Hospital Pulaski as well as their central Virginia and New Hampshire hospitals. The funds will support the path to becoming a licensed practical/vocational nurse or a registered nurse within HCA Healthcare.

The scholarships are eligible for nursing students who are currently enrolled in a Board of Nursing-accredited program. The LPN/LVN scholarships are $7000 per student and the RN scholarships are $14000. There is a one-year full-time employment commitment in an HCA Healthcare facility upon completion. Candidates are also eligible for sign-on bonuses at the time of hire.

“This scholarship money is a huge encouragement” said Woods.

Tilley says it’s a career worth pursuing.

″It’s a rewarding field. Not only are you helping somebody in the most difficult time in their life potentially” said Tilley. “There’s opportunity for education. There’s opportunity for growth.”

As market data suggests that clear aligner sales will continue to expand across the UK Ian Ellis details how practices can share some of this growth.

There is no question that life for a dentist has changed significantly over the last two and a half years.

Who would have thought that an entire country could be locked down dental practices shut and livelihoods impacted to such a profound degree. Professional resilience is challenged continuously.

Although practices theoretically reopened in June 2020 many did so with restrictions and cross-infection risk mitigation became a major issue. The population’s restricted ability to go out or socialise resulted in subsequent financial savings for many.

Combined with an increased use of camera close-ups in Zoom meetings the demand for aesthetic dentistry escalated (Aesthet Surg J 2021). The media/internet drive for ‘straight teeth and the perfect smile’ has certainly accelerated the uptake of clear aligners with patients increasingly ready to allocate funds for dental enhancement.

Significant market growth

Clear aligners represent a huge business opportunity for your practice. A non-AGP procedure a high degree of digitisation and a patient preference for more aesthetic options has resulted in significant market growth. Consider the following:

The global dental services market size is valued at over $300 billion (approximately £250 billion) (Grandview Research 2020)

Straumann’s 2021 annual report suggests that globally more than 21 million people started orthodontic treatment and 4 million started a course of clear aligners. They estimate the addressable market value for clear aligners is double that of premium implants

Straumann estimates the clear aligner market globally to be worth over £4.3 billion and growing at more than 20% per year

Align Technology’s £2.6 billion annual aligner sales alone (Q2 2022) represents a 60% market share

In Q2 2022 Align Technology annual global clear aligner sales were $800m which relates to approximately 600000 cases shipped worldwide. That is equivalent to more than 1600 cases per day.

On the assumption that Align Technology cases represent 60% of the global market adding cases provided by Dentsply Sirona Henry Schein Straumann Active Aligners and others over 2700 cases are started every day.

If we estimate that the UK represents 3% of the global market (£7 billion of £250 billion) then UK dentists will initiate over 2400 clear aligner cases every month.

How many of those cases are you doing? This market is set to grow year on year. Now ask yourself how many cases you could be doing.

What is driving interest in clear aligner therapy?

Achieving a ‘better’ smile and improved aesthetics are key drivers for uptake of treatment. Clear aligners are often considered straightforward for patients to use and within limits can enhance a smile and offer the aesthetic benefit of being almost invisible in the mouth.

Convenience is high on patients’ lists. Patients (and dentists) lead busy lives. Patient welfare remains paramount and face to face appointments are still needed at key times. Optional remote monitoring enables the dentist to check teeth are tracking and frees time for other in-surgery treatments. Face-to-face appointments can then be scheduled as required.

Removable aligners have some distinct advantages over fixed orthodontic appliances. Oral hygiene is easier and aligners are less likely to trap food. Clear aligners are generally more comfortable to wear avoiding problems associated with broken or bent wires. Aligners are easily replaced when the time comes to swap to the next tray. Ultimately clear aligners offer levels of flexibility that many patients desire.

Essential involvement

Campaigns from the direct-to-consumer (DTC) sector are helping drive patients to visit their dentist often for a clinical opinion or competitive quote. Whatever your position on DTC the sector continues to grow (DTC data is excluded from statistics above). GDPs are unlikely to stop this growth. But can communicate the risks and limitations of DTC to their patients when they have the opportunity.

Dentists are faced with price sensitivity from patients. Responding to requests for a ‘better’ price is common in practices. Dentists are not obsolete in clear aligner treatments. Their involvement is essential and patients need to understand the role of a fully trained professional in their care.

To help overcome the cost barriers Active Aligners are positioned at a price point that enables dentists to promote their clear aligner therapy between the established brands and DTC products.

‘Knowledge is power’

Knowledge is essential to achieve predictable outcomes and minimise treatment failures. Many courses are available providing clear aligner training to a variety of levels. You can start your education with a free-to-provider accreditation course with Active Aligners. Progress through to more advanced levels such as the IDDA education programmes or education provided by the BOS.

Aligner therapy cannot be considered in isolation and is usually planned in tandem with other treatments eg whitening or bonding. Discussion of the overall treatment plan from the outset (of course respecting the management of any primary dental disease) leads to better patient acceptance and more realistic expectations. It in turn can drive increased practice revenue.

The vast majority of practices still rely on PVS impressions instead of digital intra-oral scanners. Introducing clear aligners to your practice is therefore straightforward with Active Aligners as we accept PVS impressions or digital scans. This enables access for all irrespective of your depth of digital engagement.

If there is an intra-oral scanner available it can confer advantages for both patient and practice. Time can be saved by not having to take or process PVS impressions and there are added environmental benefits (avoiding impressions plaster models plastic waste etc).

Additional revenue streams

Using a scanner will impress your patients; demonstrating that yours is an up-to-date practice using modern technology. This drives a positive message about the type of practice you are in and your cutting-edge philosophy.

Once in the practice a scanner has multidisciplinary dental use. Expanding from clear aligners to implants and crowns offers additional revenue streams and maximises utilisation of your device. Yes there is an investment required but your accountant can advise if you have the potential to offset any outlay against tax/capital allowances.

By initiating treatment with the right patients dentists can take their share of the growth in one of the fastest expanding areas of modern dentistry. Clinicians need to be aware of the limitations of aligner therapy and know when a case is best placed in the hands of a specialist.

Certain malocclusions are suited to clear aligner treatment and others are not generally recommended (see Table 1). Patients may request aligner therapy for more complex treatments. With experience clinicians can expand their repertoire and broaden their treatment options. With Active Aligners you have the choice to limit treatment to the anterior region (5 to 5) or utilise the Full Arch (7 to 7) option.

There are many benefits to providing clear aligner therapy for patients. Dentists are best placed to provide these treatments.

Market data suggests that clear aligner sales will continue to expand across the UK. So why not put yourself in a position to share in some of that growth.

American confectionary brand Hershey’s have teamed up with Japanese confectionary brand Monteur to create some delicious treats perfect for the upcoming autumn months. The two companies have worked together before and previous collaborations were wildly popular. This year looks like it will be just as popular and new products were released on September 1.

We were lucky enough to receive a sample of some of the products on sale and were blown away by the rich sweet taste. So sweet and tasty were they that we instantly felt an overwhelming sadness as the collaboration will come to a close at the end of September!

But instead of lamenting what could have been (i.e. eating Hershey’s and Monteur sweets until our bodies eventually give out) we decided to treasure the time that we do have and gave all products we were lucky enough to be sent a thorough taste test.

▼ Hershey’s x Monteur Caramel Chocolate Cream Puff — 129 yen (US$0.90)

At a glance you’d be forgiven for assuming this Caramel Chocolate Cream Puff was just an ordinary cream puff but that will all change once you bite into the puff and reach the filling.

▼ We dare you to look at this without your mouth instantly watering.

Inside the cream puff is not one but two layers of deliciousness; a cream made with Hershey’s cocoa and a melt-in-your-mouth caramel sauce. The caramel sauce has a hint of bitterness which goes well with the sweet chocolate cream.

▼ Hershey’s x Monteur Caramel Chocolate Eclair — 129 yen (US$0.90)

Next up is the Caramel Chocolate Eclair another product with a luxurious taste. It also has chocolate cream and caramel sauce as a filling. Let’s take a look at the cross-section.

The chocolate layer on the outside has a slight bitter flavour and a crispy texture which pairs well with the creamy filling.

▼ Hershey’s x Monteur Caramel Chocolate Roll Cakes — 388 yen (US$2.70)

Finally we tried the Caramel Chocolate Roll Cake which comes pre-cut into four pieces. The filling is a mix of whipped cream caramel sauce and chocolate flakes and the sponge layer is made using cocoa from Hershey’s.

The cake comes precut in four slices making it the perfect treat to share with your friends and family.

▼ Or you can do as we did and devour the whole thing by yourself.

All products in the Monteur x Hershey’s collaboration all have a delightful combination of bitter and sweet tastes and you can taste the caramel and chocolate with each bite.

The Hershey’s x Monteur products are on sale in all areas of Japan except for the southern region of Kyushu and will be on sale until the end of September.

And while Kyushuites might be missing out on trying the Hershey’s collaboration this time they’ve got something equally delicious to keep them satisfied.

Bill and Jen Wintermyer | September 24 2022

The score and the stats are a stark contrast to the outcome of the game. With nearly two-thirds of the stadium packed and electric atmosphere fans saw the game end with Hershey’s win over Milton Hershey 28 to 21.

The game really came down to one series with Milton Hershey starting at their own 24-yard line driving the ball down field with a balanced rushing and throwing series. Milton Hershey got to Hershey’s 4-yard line with first and goal but then was unable to score and turned the ball over on downs. This changed the course of the game by seeming to take all the momentum away from Milton Hershey.

Hershey countered starting at the 4-yard line moving the ball on 8 rushing attempts and 1 passing attempt before they stalled and were forced to punt. While they didn’t score on this drive they did eat up a ton of clock.

The first score was a result of a Hershey 14-yerd rushing touchdown by Angel Cabrera at 6:29 in the first. Hershey got their second score following another Angel Cabrera 4-yard rush with only 52 seconds left in the first. First quartered ended 14-0 Hershey.

Milton Hershey marched downfield and scored in the second quarter after a 29-yard dash by Elijah Johnson at 9:32. Hershey responded starting at their on 19-yard line and ending with Angel Cabrera scoring his third touchdown of the game following a 29-yard scamper. Milton Hershey scored with less than a minute on the clock ending the half at Hershey 21 Milton Hershey 14.

Starting on a short field Milton Hershey only needed 5 plays to score on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Kenneth Emile to Mohamad Koroma tying the game at 8:56 in the third quarter. Hershey 21 Milton Hershey 21. Hershey responded with Quarterback Daniel Painter running in the ball for a score at 5:38. Hershey 28 Milton Hershey 21.

The fourth quarter saw no scores but lots of great play by both teams but the game ended Hershey 28 Milton Hershey 21.

That means over 700 pairs of shoes will be given to needy local children.

It had many newcomers excited.

“Seeing the children and how an event like this can affect them and impact their lives so greatly it’s so important” said Brooke Butler-Wagner a first-time guest.

Eleven years ago women volunteers for the Salvation Army came up with an interesting idea.

Cindy Munnich the Special Events & Communications Coordinator for Salvation Army Harrisburg explained “They sat around a table and thought ‘you know women love shoes but kids need shoes. How can we marry the two into a fundraising event?”

Now the Salvation Army hosts the luncheon every year.

The money raised will go towards shoe vouchers sponsored by Boscov’s.

From there

“The kids can come in pick out shoes that they like that fit them fit their personality and Boscov’s will then exchange them and bill us for it” said Munnich.

The Shoe Strut also benefits other Salvation Army programs in Harrisburg and allows newcomers to do good in their community.

“It’s a touching thing to see what the salvation army does for the community and how it’s something that we can be a part of” said first-time guest Lindsey Barnes.

“More than anything we want to get the word out on what we do all year long. all year long the salvation army is meeting needs” said Munnich.

The event brought women from all over to bid on auctions compete in shoe contests and strut their stuff on the runway.

But it also has an unexpected purpose.

“In addition to supporting the salvation army all the boutiques that are represented here today are owned by women” said Donna Jefferson owner of Simply J Boutique. “So they are small businesses owned by women so I think it’s real important that we support each other.”

The last ten Shoe Struts raised more than $680000."

Doug Burgum today joined leaders from the North Dakota Tribal College System to announce a new apprenticeship program developed in partnership with Hess Corporation to improve educational and employment opportunities for Native Americans across the state.

Hess announced that it will invest $12 million to provide tuition assistance stipends and other support for establishing apprenticeships in a variety of industries. The apprenticeships will be designed by each of the five tribal colleges in North Dakota based on the local job market and needs of their tribal communities. Halliburton and Nabors Industries also will each invest $1 million in the new apprenticeship program. Representatives of the three companies attended today’s press conference at the Capitol along with the five tribal college presidents and chairs of two of the five tribal nations with whom North Dakota shares geography.

“Public-private partnerships can be transformative and the program being launched today is another great example of our state’s private-sector partners believing and investing in the future of North Dakota” Burgum said. “With today’s announcement Hess Nabors and Halliburton are providing essential resources for our tribal colleges to invest in students in a way that can spark generational change and empower people improve lives and inspire success.”

Officials said the new program will provide tribal college students with on-the-job skills training through college work study internships and apprenticeships following the “earn and learn” model of the apprenticeship program currently in place at Lake Region State College. The new apprenticeship program is scheduled to launch in January 2023.

(Valley News Live) - The North Dakota Tribal College System (NDTCS) announced a new apprenticeship program to improve educational and employment opportunities for Native Americans across North Dakota.

Over the next four years Hess Corporation will invest $12 million to provide tuition assistance stipends and other support for establishing apprenticeships in a variety of industries designed by each of the state’s five tribal colleges based on the local job market and needs of their tribal communities. Halliburton and Nabors Industries will each invest $1 million in the new apprenticeship program.

Cankdeska Cikana (Little Hoop) Community College President Dr. Cynthia Lindquist said: “The partnership we are announcing today reflects the tireless efforts of everyone involved over the past 18 months to design a program that serves a traditional education mission while concurrently responding to deeper community needs. We are excited to develop new career and workforce opportunities for our young people and are very pleased to have the support from Hess Nabors Halliburton and the Governor.”

The new statewide program will provide tribal college students with on-the-job skills training through college work study internships and apprenticeships as they progress toward completing a two-year degree or technical certification with the possibility of earning a bachelor’s or master’s degree depending on the apprenticeship position and location. The program is scheduled to begin in January 2023.

Fortinet VMware Cisco Drive SD-WAN Gartner Magic Quadrant

Single-Vendor SASE Surge Expected to Fuel Convergence of SD-WAN SSE Capabilities

Perennial leaders Fortinet and VMware and a surging Cisco set themselves apart from the rest of the pack in SD-WAN according to the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant report.

Platform security giant Fortinet and virtualization behemoth VMware once again took the gold and silver in ability to execute in SD-WAN with Cisco leapfrogging both Versa Networks and Palo Alto Networks to capture the bronze. Gartner sees a large and growing gap in execution ability between those three and the other vendors it designated SD-WAN leaders: Palo Alto Networks Versa Networks and HPE Aruba.

""When clients are asking about who's included in RFPs who's being finalized who's being selected there is separation"" Jonathan Forest Gartner senior director and analyst tells Information Security Media Group. ""There is separation by some of the higher market share vendors.""

Cisco Fortinet and VMware respectively were the three SD-WAN market share leaders in 2021 with Versa Networks and HPE Aruba capturing fourth and fifth place market research firm Dell'Oro Group said in March. The worldwide SD-WAN market expanded by 35% in 2021 to more than $2 billion and the eight largest SD-WAN vendors accounted for more than 80% of revenue last year Dell'Oro Group found.

From a completeness of vision perspective Gartner found Palo Alto Networks and VMware were once against neck and neck with Palo Alto Networks taking the gold this time around. Fortinet leapfrogged Cisco and Versa Networks for the bronze in completeness of SD-WAN vision with Cisco and Versa falling to fourth and fifth place. HPE Aruba was last among the leaders in both execution ability and completeness of vision.

""There is some stability"" Forest says. ""There's enough deployments enough evidence of product deployment capabilities and overall everything we evaluate in the Magic Quadrant to make that assessment on what these vendors have done. So I do believe there's a track record and a certain level of maturity in this market.""

Outside of the leaders here's how Gartner sees the SD-WAN market:

Visionary: Juniper Networks

Juniper Networks Challenger: Huawei

Huawei Niche Players: Cradlepoint Barracuda Networks Nuage Networks Peplink Citrix and Forcepoint

""Things can change on a dime"" Forest says. ""Acquisitions can happen that can change things pretty quickly as can new development of products and new positions on innovation that disrupt the market. Things can always change.""

The Surge of Single-Vendor SASE

Gartner expects the share of organizations procuring both SD-WAN and security service edge from the same supplier will increase from 10% this year to 50% in 2025. Although secure access service edge is today dominated by multivendor solutions with orchestration tying them together Gartner says single-vendor SASE will simplify sourcing and offer a tighter technical integration and better user experience.

Most organizations today are using different vendors for SD-WAN and SSE due to unique requirements or differences in opinion between the networking and security departments Forest says. But as refresh cycles occur smaller vendors without rigid specific requirements will begin selecting one supplier for both SD-WAN and SSE and adoption will slowly move upstream to the midmarket and lower enterprise.

Some large enterprises with unique requirements will maintain separate SSE and SD-WAN vendors for the foreseeable future but Forest believes most customers will eventually converge on a single vendor to reduce complexity and simplify management. The consolidation to date has primarily been driven by SD-WAN vendors and the leading cloud security vendors are just beginning to buy their way into SD-WAN.

""Clients want less vendors"" Forest says. ""It's less complexity which from the security side makes sense because that reduces risk. Cost is part of it but not a driver. It's more about manageability and just reducing the attack surface.""

Fortinet Focuses on App Connectivity SD-Branch

Fortinet's SD-WAN business has focused over the past year on secure application connectivity SASE use cases SD-Branch opportunities and public cloud integration says Vice President of Products Nirav Shah. The company has built ZTNA enforcement into its SD-WAN offering to ensure adversaries aren't able to move laterally across the customer's entire application landscape in the event of compromise he says.

The company's SD-Branch investments will address the needs of big retail and healthcare environments by integrating LTE and 5G inside the SD-WAN appliance providing retail locations with 5G connectivity as well as Dual SIM card Shah says. And from a SASE perspective Shah says Fortinet offers customers flexibility by delivering its security and networking capabilities either on-premises or through the cloud (see: Ken Xie on Why Fortinet Is Leaning Into SD-WAN OT Security).

""We continue to lead the SD-WAN market and continue improving in execution and vision"" Shah tells ISMG. ""If you compare from last year to this year we are the only leader to improve in both execution and vision at the same time. No other vendor in the leadership quadrant could do that. So that speaks volumes to how well we are addressing any concern that customers or analysts have.""

Gartner criticized Fortinet for an average customer experience limited mind share in networking and limited third-party SSE integrations. Shah says Fortinet has invested heavily in building its networking practice out and becoming a key player in both wired and wireless LAN. From a partnership perspective Shah says Fortinet plans to deliver single-vendor SASE and isn't looking to team up with competitors.

""Our SD-WAN is a foundation for SASE because we can do the security and networking convergence that customers want"" Shah says. ""We want to take advantage of providing a single-vendor SASE architecture. And that's why you will not see Fortinet integrating with the other SSE players out there.""

VMware Doubles Down on 5G Integration Security Services

Over the past year VMware has enhanced its security capabilities and integrated private 5G services into its SD-WAN offering says Karl Brown senior director of product marketing for SD-WAN. Healthcare organizations manufacturers and retailers want to connect intelligent devices to 5G during their digital transformation efforts to improve service quality reduce latency and better support branch locations.

The company supports the security needs for cloud and SaaS applications through a bundled offering that allows customers to view analytics around application performance and network traffic and easily apply policies across all applications Brown says. VMware delivers its cloud web security technology from 150 cities to give users a direct path from where they're located to where their apps are hosted (see: VMware Doubles Down on Multi-Cloud Lateral Movement Defense).

""We make it extremely easy for our customers to connect their remote branch locations to cloud and SaaS applications"" Brown tells ISMG. ""We take away the complexity of trying to put appliances in multiple cloud locations and interconnect the users with those applications in the cloud. We make it extremely easy to deliver high-performance SaaS applications.""

Gartner criticized VMware for basic on-premises security product dependency and concerns around the Broadcom acquisition. Brown says Menlo Security's cloud protection offerings are fully integrated and benefit from close collaboration around the road map. VMware wants to extend its on-premises security offering beyond an existing firewall that's often used by customers in branch office locations.

""There is a segment of our customer base and potential customers that would like additional security in the appliance which would augment our cloud-delivered security services"" Brown says. ""We do fully intend to deliver upon that request from those customers.""

Cisco Emphasizes Network Visibility Public Cloud Partners

Cisco has strengthened its SD-WAN offering by providing more network visibility deep integrations with public cloud providers and additional security features and performance says Jay Chokshi director of product management for secure SD-WAN and SASE. Cisco has unveiled enhanced firewall capabilities and troubleshooting analysis as well as a Meraki platform with 33% enhanced performance he says.

Integrating Meraki and Viptela with ThousandEyes gives customers visibility into networks they don't control allowing them to spot outages and deep breaches across the broader internet sooner Chokshi says. Cisco also created a robust secure connection to public cloud that's simple to set up and makes it easy for customers to move applications to the cloud and access data in the cloud he says.

""The networking and security constructs are becoming increasingly complex"" Chokshi tells ISMG. ""The networks are becoming very complex. So bringing simpler security to the operations piece is very important. I think that's a big thing.""

Gartner criticized Cisco for having multiple platforms an average product and an average customer experience. Chokshi says Cisco has driven simplified operations across its products by investing in user experience and creating a simple intuitive workflow experience. Meraki allows Cisco to address SMBs' need for simplicity and lean operations while Viptela offers sophisticated features for enterprises.

""The market is very big. There are different segments of the market that have different needs"" Chokshi says. ""We have been able to bring a lot of what our customers are asking for by offering both Meraki and Viptela. In addition many of our customers are leveraging both the portfolios in their network.""

Palo Alto Networks Takes 5G Digital Experience to Next Level

Palo Alto Networks has bolstered its SD-WAN offering with native integrated 5G autonomous digital experience management and tighter SASE connections says Kumar Ramachandran senior vice president for SASE products. Integrating Prisma SD-WAN with Prisma Access' ZTNA capabilities gives customers the flexibility to select what components they want based on their deployment he says.

Native integrated 5G means customers will enjoy the best possible performance and availability in branch offices while no longer deploying a separate device Ramachandran says. And autonomous digital experience management provides deep visibility into application experience network behavior and user behavior automating application delivery and the resolution of performance issues he says (see: Why Would Palo Alto Networks Want Startup Apiiro for $600M?).

""Our SD-WAN solution is very focused on delivering the best possible user experience irrespective of the connectivity"" Ramachandran tells ISMG. ""You get this very very powerful user experience-based approach.""

Gartner criticized Palo Alto Networks for below-average customer experience below-average sales execution and limited on-premises security with SD-WAN. Ramachandran says the company has focused on bolstering both direct and MSP sales via a managed services partnership with AT&T. The company offers a full-blown firewall in the branch though he says most clients prefer cloud delivery.

""The cloud offers lots of advantages over taking a different security box and deploying it in the branch"" Ramachandran says. ""We get the elasticity of the cloud at the branch.""

Versa Networks Pursues Simplification Via AI ML

Versa has created a natural language processing chatbot and anomaly engine for network and security insights to more effectively leverage AI and ML-based technologies around SD-WAN says CEO Kelly Ahuja. Automating functions helps enterprises go faster save money and be agile by having machines do the basic work meaning organizations no longer need an army of employees troubleshooting security issues.

Vera's new chatbot allows users to ask questions in the management console using normal language and applies fixes with the click of a button greatly simplifying how enterprises interact with Versa's system Ahuja says. And the anomaly engine examines telemetry wherever software is running correlates data from all of those places identifies patterns and reports abnormalities back to customers she says.

""From a technology standpoint our solution is head and shoulders above the market based on what our customers are telling us"" Ahuja tells ISMG. ""In certain segments and certain geographies we're actually beating many of the other competitors hands down.""

Gartner criticized Versa Networks for product complexity poor customer experience and less DIY experience. Ahuja says Versa has done a lot of work to simplify its workflows with a well-lit path and said it provides comprehensive capabilities around routing appliances and security. Most customers are served via Versa's 150 service providers though many Global 2000 firms run directly on Versa he says.

""We have the most comprehensive understanding of the market and a full solution that covers both networking and security which is where the market is heading"" Ahuja says. ""So we are very very well-positioned to continue to lead the market and build and grow the business.""

HPE Aruba Doubles Down on Single Console Branch Security

HPE Aruba has worked in recent years to collapse WAN edge functions around routing firewalls and optimization into a single management console to simplify management and reduce human error says Derek Granath senior director of SD-WAN product and technical marketing. The company has teamed up to leverage user and device identity and role-based access control to enable segmentation he says.

The company has replaced branch firewalls by adding security functions at the branch such as dynamic path control and unified threat management and integrating with Palo Alto Networks and Check Point offerings he says. HPE Aruba also has increased its intrusion detection capability over the past year with prevention technology correlation of user identity and defense and mitigation features that isolate traffic he says.

""We've always been about improving performance on the WAN"" Granath tells ISMG. ""We have certain features that we think we do better than anybody such as our ability to run reliably on the internet even when it becomes impaired because of congestion.""

Gartner criticized HPE Aruba for an incomplete security road map limited geographic and vertical strategy and below-average customer experience. Granath said HPE Aruba has customers in every vertical and excels in financial services technology manufacturing and retail. From a security perspective HPE Aruba automates integrations with Zscaler and Netskope to make accessing SSE easier he says.

""There's no single SASE vendor that can tick all of the boxes for security and all of the boxes for the network"" Granath says. ""A dual or multivendor solution means customers don't have to compromise on either the security side or the network side."""

Men and women in 122 countries and territories were asked about their physical and emotional health among other factors.

Every country in the world saw a drop in scores regarding women's health.

The second year of the Covid-19 pandemic took a toll on people’s health worldwide but a new survey shows that women’s overall health took the hardest knock.



The survey conducted by medical technology company Hologic investigated how well women's health needs were met in 2021. Out of 127 000 women and men in 122 countries and territories surveyed the overall score for the Global Women's Health Index in 2021 was just 53 out of 100 - one point lower than in 2020.

READ MORE | A doctor's guide to healthy living at every stage of womanhood - from pre-puberty to menopause

South Africa recorded an index score of 55 out of 100 and ranked 55 out of 122 countries and territories.

“Women in 2021 were more stressed worried angry and sad than they were in 2020 – or at any point in the past decade” the report reads.

The survey done in partnership with Gallup showed that every country in the world - high-income and low-income alike - fell short when it came to women’s health and creating policies that support it. The authors of the report write:

Millions of women worldwide were in crisis. Too few were being tested for deadly diseases. Their emotional health was suffering. They couldn’t meet basic needs and they didn’t feel safe.

Widening the gap

Each country’s score was based on women's responses to questions in five categories:

Preventative care: This referred to being tested for hypertension cancer diabetes and sexually transmitted diseases or infections in the past 12 months - South Africa ranked as one of the fastest-declining countries in 2021.

Emotional health: Respondents were asked how often they worry are stressed sad or angry.

Opinions about health and safety: Questions centred on the availability of quality healthcare and whether respondents felt safe walking alone at night in their city or area.

Basic needs: Respondents were asked whether they had sufficient money in the past 12 months to buy food and provide shelter for themselves and their families.

Individual health: Respondents were asked if they had any health problems that prevented them from doing things people their age normally do.

Here are some other significant findings of the survey:



Women’s ability to meet their basic needs like affording food fell while men’s ability to do so didn’t change.

In nearly 50 countries and territories less than 10% of women reported being tested for cancer in the previous year.

Women reported being more stressed worried angry and sad in 2021 compared to 2020 - or at any point in the past decade.

The belief in the value of visiting a healthcare professional declined among women with elementary education or less.

The highest score was 70 points with Taiwan in the top spot followed by Latvia Austria and Denmark.

Taiwan and Kazakhstan scored the highest on emotional health where unlike the rest of the world which is getting more negative with each passing year levels of stress anger worry and sadness have remained relatively low and stable in these two countries for more than a decade notes the report.

Afghanistan Congo and Venezuela all scored fewer than 40 points overall while the US took 23rd place with 61 points out of 100.

The fastest-declining countries for emotional health included India Bangladesh Benin Guinea and the UK.

Importantly the divide between women in high-income and low-income countries grew even bigger than in 2020 the data shows.

What about South Africa?

Another sobering finding was that women felt less safe walking alone at night in 2021 than they did in 2020 (up from 32% to 37%). The report mentions:

More than one in three do not feel safe walking alone in their neighbourhoods which translates into nearly 1 billion women worldwide who feel unsafe.

These percentages were even higher in a number of countries in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa which also have some of the world’s highest rates of female intentional homicide.

In Venezuela 81% of women said in 2021 that they do not feel safe walking alone at night while in South Africa 76% said they do not feel safe.

However SA was also one of the fastest-Improving countries when it came to Individual Health in 2021.

Stephen MacMillan CEO of Hologic says: “Women’s health has taken a back seat to nearly everything else going on in the world. No matter what pandemics wars or other crises roil our societies we must commit ourselves to improving the health of women because they form the backbone of our families communities and societies.”

Workers at an Home Depot store in Philadelphia have filed to have a vote to be represented by a union.

The store at 4640 Roosevelt Blvd. in Philadelphia has about 275 employees according to the filing by an independent union Home Depot Workers United which is seeking the vote. Vincent Quile the lead organizer of the group said he was inspired to seek union representation by successful union representation votes at an Amazon distribution center in Staten Island New York the first union win at the online retailing giant and more than 200 successful votes at various Starbucks locations nationwide.

Quile 27 who works in the store’s receiving department and had been on staff for five-and-a-half years said he’s not sure of the store’s exact headcount and he believes there are numerous empty positions.

“It’s one of the main reasons we’re doing this. Everyone there is so overworked” said Quiles when asked about the motIvation behind the vote. “It’s pay but it’s also staffing it’s proper training working environment.”

If this effort is successful it would be the first Home Depot store where all its hoursly workers were represented by a union.

Home Depot issued a statement saying it will work with the union vote process but that it doesn’t support the union’s organizing efforts.

“We look forward to talking with our associates about their concerns” said the statement. “Our open-door policy is designed to assure all associates that they can bring concerns directly to leadership and we have a track record of working successfully with our associates to resolve them. We do not believe unionization is the best solution for our associates.”

There has been a surge in union organizing votes so far this year according to data from the National Labor Relations Board which oversees most organizing efforts in the private sector.

Between January through July of this year there were 826 union elections up 45% from the number held in the same period of 2021 according to a CNN analysis of data from the NLRB. And the 70% success rate by unions in those votes is far better than the 42% success rate in the first seven months of 2021.

But only 41000 potential union members were eligible to vote in the 2022 elections. Even if the unions had won all those votes — NLRB data don’t break down how many workers worked at each company holding a vote — it would be a small fraction of the more than 100 million workers at US businesses who don’t belong to a union according to Labor Department statistics.

Despite high profile wins by workers at Starbucks and Amazon the retail sector still has a below-average percentage of workers who belong to unions.

FRESNO Calif. (KFSN) -- A man was shot outside a home improvement store in southeast Fresno.

It happened around 2:30 pm on Saturday in front of the Home Depot on Kings Canyon and Winery Avenues.

Investigators say two men got into an argument.

One of the men fired a single shot hitting the other man.

The victim ran inside the store into the lumber area and the suspect took off.

Fresno Police are still trying to determine what led to the argument and gunfire.

The victim was taken to the hospital in critical condition but is expected to survive.

Investigators say it's unknown if the two men knew each other.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZXNub2JlZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9jcmltZS9hcnRpY2xlMjY2MzEwMDYxLmh0bWzSAUBodHRwczovL2FtcC5mcmVzbm9iZWUuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY3JpbWUvYXJ0aWNsZTI2NjMxMDA2MS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man shot in parking lot of a Fresno Home Depot.

Shoppers love Amazon (AMZN -1.07%) and Home Depot (HD -0.29%). But investors haven't been as enthusiastic about the companies in recent times. Shares of both have dropped in the double digits since the start of the year. And Amazon and Home Depot continue to face the challenges of rising inflation and a tough economic environment.

Over time though these two retail leaders have delivered gains in revenue profit and share performance. They also have a history of increasing return on invested capital and free cash flow. They've shown us they have what it takes to make a great long-term addition to your portfolio. And I'm confident about both stocks over time. But which is the better buy right now if you had to choose just one? Let's find out.

The case for Amazon

We'll talk about the negative points first. Higher inflation has weighed heavily on Amazon's e-commerce business. For example the cost of shipping international containers has doubled from pre-pandemic days. Amazon also found itself with too much capacity after ramping up its fulfillment network during the early days of the health crisis.

As a result the company has reported declines in operating cash flow and operating income over the past few quarters.

But here's the bright side of the picture. Amazon's cloud computing business continues to grow sales and operating income in the double digits -- and into the billions of dollars -- each quarter. This is significant because Amazon Web Services (AWS) generally is a key profit driver for the company. It made up more than 70% of total operating income last year. And AWS is the industry leader.

As for the e-commerce business Amazon said it's made progress in controlling costs and improving its use of the expanded fulfillment network. Forecasts call for global retail e-commerce to grow in the double digits in the coming years so Amazon's growth in this business is far from over.

The case for Home Depot

The pandemic resulted in people spending more time at home. And that led to high demand in home improvement projects. This hasn't waned. Strength continues in both the do-it-yourself market and the professional market. And that helped Home Depot to report its highest level of quarterly sales and profit ever in the second quarter.

Of course Home Depot still faces the tricky job of managing today's economic situation. The company has invested in higher stock levels to combat supply chain disruptions. Home Depot says it wants to have products available for customers when they need them. The company also is putting money into new supply chain facilities. Overall Home Depot invested $750 million in its business in the quarter.

It's not yet clear whether the economy will hurt demand in the coming months. But trends seen so far are reason to be optimistic about what matters the most: the long term.

""The long-term underpinnings of demand for home improvement remains strong"" Chief Operating Officer Ted Decker said during the earnings call.

One clue: Professional customers have a solid backlog of projects. To ensure future success Home Depot is improving its digital platforms and ramping up its services to professionals. So the long-term looks bright for this market leader.

Amazon or Home Depot?

Over time Amazon and Home Depot both have great prospects as mentioned above. But Amazon has a longer road ahead when it comes to recovery. Key metrics of free cash flow and return on invested capital have declined at both companies this year. But Home Depot's measures seem to be stabilizing.

HD Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts

Home Depot also remains highly profitable while Amazon has posted net losses in the past two quarters.

At the same time Amazon and Home Depot have seen their share prices and valuations fall.

HD PS Ratio data by YCharts

Both trade lower in relation to sales compared with earlier this year. But Home Depot trades even lower by this measure than Amazon even as quarterly revenue reached historic highs.

At these levels Home Depot looks particularly appealing especially considering the company's recent earnings growth and demand for its products. And that's why right now Home Depot is the better buy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL2VzcG5wcmVzc3Jvb20uY29tL3VzL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzLzIwMjIvMDkvZXNwbnMtY29sbGVnZS1nYW1lZGF5LWJ1aWx0LWJ5LXRoZS1ob21lLWRlcG90LXRyYXZlbHMtdG8ta25veHZpbGxlLXRlbm4tZm9yLXdlZWstNC1hbmQtdGhlLXNob3dzLTEwdGgtdmlzaXQtdG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ESPN's College GameDay Built by The Home Depot Travels to Knoxville Tenn. for the 10th Time,"College football’s premier pregame will make its ninth visit to the Florida – Tennessee rivalry game

Dollar sales in the cookie category were $10.8 billion up 9.4% from the same period a year ago IRI said. Unit sales dipped 1.6% to 3.5 billion.

Leading the category was Nabisco with sales of $3.5 billion in the 52 weeks up 3.4% from the year-ago period. Private label cookie sales were $890 million an increase of nearly 15% from the year-ago 52-week period. Pepperidge Farm cookies accounted for $531 million in sales a 3.8% increase from the same period a year ago according to IRI.

As trends in consumer behavior revealed increased preferences for snacking innovation in the category displayed an appeal to seasonal sensibilities. Several cookie companies introduced products in flavor profiles of the season with pumpkin spice emerging as the fall favorite.

While Campbell Soup Co.’s Pepperidge Farm cookies showed solid growth in the past year the company leaned into the strength of its largest snack brand Goldfish with the introduction of a limited-time sweet snack collaboration with Dunkin’ Brands. The release of Goldfish Dunkin’ Pumpkin Spice Grahams followed comments from Mark A. Clouse president and chief executive officer of Campbell Soup during the company’s June 8 conference call to discuss third-quarter financial results. Mr. Clouse said the Goldfish brand has “grown from a favorite kids’ food to a top choice of their teen siblings and their parents.”

Goldfish Dunkin’ Pumpkin Spice Grahams were crafted with coffee drinkers in mind as they resonate with notes of pumpkin donut glaze and warm spices — including cinnamon cloves and nutmeg according to the company.

Nabisco’s parent company Mondelez International has announced plans to invest into segments driven by snacking including biscuits and chocolate.

“Our annual state of snacking survey shows that consumers increasingly prefer snacking over traditional meals” Dirk Van de Put CEO of Mondelez said in a July 26 conference call to discuss second-quarter earnings. “And because snacking plays such an important role in consumers’ lives our core categories of chocolate and biscuits historically have resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions.”

Nabisco released a limited-time cookie in July with Neapolitan Oreos. According to the company Neapolitan Oreos provide “a playful twist on ice cream with a unique waffle cone-flavored base cake.” The cookies feature three crème layers matching those found in Neapolitan ice cream: vanilla strawberry and chocolate.

Mondelez’s belVita cookies brought in $426 million in sales in the 52 weeks ended Aug. 7 according to IRI. In August belVita was ranked as the fastest growing brand globally in “Food & Drink 2022” a report by London-based consultancy company Brand Finance.

The Voortman brand of Hostess Brands Inc. saw a 24% sales jump to $176 million in the same period IRI said.

“Voortman growth continues to be driven by expanding distribution.” Andrew P. Callahan president and CEO of Hostess Brands Inc. said in an Aug. 3 conference call with analysts to discuss second-quarter earnings.

Voortman accounts for approximately 10% of the Hostess sales he said.

“We are by far the leading share within our sugar-free portfolio” Mr. Callahan said. “That subsegment of sugar-free is growing at — consistently growing at two times the rate of total sugar.”

Meanwhile critics of Medicare Advantage (MA) should start to spend time with payers to understand what their needs are and what is driving up their costs. In turn home health providers can form a clearer picture of where they fit in as a solution.

Those were two of the main messages Susan Benoit president of Humana Inc.’s (NYSE: HUM) CenterWell Home Health relayed at Home Health Care News’ FUTURE event last week.

“I would encourage all home health providers to embrace Medicare Advantage payers” Benoit said. “We’re all moving to value-based care. We’re moving with CMS to value-based purchasing in 2025 but we’re also moving to that model as more Medicare beneficiaries are choosing Medicare Advantage plans versus traditional Medicare.”

Formerly known as Kindred at Home CenterWell Home Health is the rebranded home health organization of the Louisville Kentucky-based Humana. The CenterWell brand includes the company’s range of payer-agnostic health care offerings including senior-focused primary care.

Humana and CenterWell have been bullish on value-based care and Medicare Advantage Benoit said mainly because that’s where they see the future of home health going.

“Medicare Advantage payers have tremendous data analytics and claims data on their members” Benoit said. “I would suggest we all spend time with MA payers and really listen to what their pain points are so we can educate them on what we can do for them.”

As a home health provider proving your worth and your value will go a long way in today’s market Benoit said.

For example if a home health agency has a specialty program that has proved to be exceptional at treating congestive heart failure and keeping patients from going back to hospital for treatments those are quantifiable data points that MA payers want to see.

“Those are the kinds of things you have to bring to the table with MA payers” Benoit said. “They’re looking for a reduction in hospitalizations a reduction in total cost of care improving star ratings and great patient experience. I think we’ve just got to embrace it.”

Humana is operating value-based care models in 14 of the 38 states it serves Benoit said. Some of those models are being done through utilization management but the company is currently working on building a value-based care clinical model and figuring out what the reimbursement rate should look like for a home health company.

Humana and Heal together

With several moving parts finally steady at CenterWell Benoit said one of the key focuses for the rest of the year and beyond is to integrate patient care through its different brands and partnerships.

That includes its partnership with Heal a Los Angeles-based in-home primary care provider that focuses mainly on seniors.

Heal is another provider that has invested in value-based care and is already seeing the benefits pay off.

“We operate on a value-based care framework” Justin Zaghi the chief medical officer at Heal said at FUTURE. “We have evidence showing that we’ve saved Medicare — through the Independence at Home project — around $8 million on about 1000 patients in one year. That was done through reductions in ER visits and hospitalizations. By operating in a risk-based environment we’re able to capture more of the value that we’re creating for the health care system.”

Justin Zaghi the chief medical officer at Heal.

Humana’s $100 million investment in Heal was just an early sign of both companies leaning into value-based care.

By partnering with like-minded companies like Heal and DispatchHealth Benoit believes Humana and CenterWell are able to break down the silos throughout the continuum care.

“I think we absolutely are” she said. “[Working across brands and with partners] creates better communication better coordination and allows us to have more information about that patient.”

Ownership and partnerships

There are plenty of advantages to Humana’s reach when it comes to what it owns throughout the continuum of care.

One example Benoit brought up was the One Homecare Solutions purchase made in 2021.

One Homecare Solutions — or onehome — is a utilization management convener that has home health operations in South Florida and Texas.

“What this creates is better communication and easier coordination when you have owned assets” Benoit said. “If we’ve got a nurse in the home seeing a patient we get a member summary so we know if the prescriptions have been filled recently or not. We have their labs. We understand everything that’s going on with that patient and there’s communication back and forth with the different entities to reduce rehospitalization improve the patient experience and provide that continuity of care.”

At the same time Humana doesn’t believe it can own everything.

That’s why it has strategic partnerships with companies like Heal and DispatchHealth.

“In the Atlanta market we can reach out to Dispatch if we have a patient that needs urgent care in the home” Benoit said. “They come into the home prevent that patient from potentially going to the emergency room and that’s helped us reduce rehospitalization rates.”

DispatchHealth is specifically good at a certain thing. In its case that specialty is in-home urgent care. Those are the types of partnerships Humana looks for when deciding who to join forces with.

“We are looking for people that are really good at specific items” Benoit said. “When we identify a problem or look for opportunities to reduce hospitalizations reduce total cost of care provide a better patient experience we’re looking for those partners that are really really good at that. Who can provide the data that says ‘We can make a difference with this patient.’”

“I would suggest we all spend time with MA payers and really listen to what their pain points are so we can educate them on what we can do for them.” Susan Benoit president of CenterWell Home Health.

There is also the middle ground Benoit said like Humana deciding to sell a portion of Kindred at Home’s hospice and personal care assets to private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice for $2.8 billion.

“We at Humana felt like we could still get the advantages of owning [personal care] and hospice but not have to have the majority ownership” she said. “We value that it’s a very important component of the continuum of care so we definitely wanted to keep some ownership of that.”

Why clinicians want flexibility

Like any home health provider CenterWell Home Health has been dealing with unique staffing issues in 2022.

Bruce Broussard president and CEO of Humana and Benoit will regularly have listening sessions with the company’s nurses and clinicians to understand the challenges they’re facing.

“One of the most important things that we’re hearing out of those sessions is they want flexible work schedules” Benoit said. “It may not be that they’re wanting to work part time; it may be that they want to work different days of the week or different hours in the day so it’s not a Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. position.”

Scheduling has been a pain point for CenterWell and many others in the home health industry. Benoit says that making the routing system more efficient can ease the burden on its clinicians.

“I think if we can get more efficient from a routing standpoint that will make sure we’re not overwhelming clinicians” Benoit said. “When there’s a shortage you’re always asking them to take an additional patient two patients three patients and if we’re not careful we will burn our long-term successful nurses out.”

It’s also no secret to the home health industry that documentation has been a thorn in the side of clinicians for years. That’s one of the major issues CenterWell’s nurses and other clinicians have had recently.

“Documentation in home health it’s a lot – and many people are documenting late at night” Benoit said. “We’re really working on ways that we can reduce the amount of documentation for our clinicians and working with companies that auto populate medications for us into Homecare Homebase saving clinicians time at the start of care.”

Humana has also hired a clinician experience leader whose sole job is to improve the work life of the company’s clinicians.

Why Humana might be interested in Cano Health

Days after the FUTURE event news started circulating that primary care provider Cano Health (NYSE: CANO) is exploring a sale.

Susan Benoit president of Humana Inc.’s (NYSE: HUM) CenterWell Home Health.

Humana — as well as CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) — have been rumored to have interest in buying Cano Health according to sources who spoke with Reuters.

Rumors of Humana buying Cano Health have been in the air since July as Humana has been building out its risk-based capabilities through primary care purchases.

Cano Health is a senior primary care company with 137 medical centers in six states.

In its investor meeting last week leaders with Humana reported it could spend up to $550 million in expanding its senior-focused value-based primary care clinics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Nhbm8tbnlzZWNhbm8tcmlzZXMtYXMtaHVtYW5hLWFuZC1jdnMtdmllLWZvci1hbi1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1kZWFs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cano (NYSE:CANO) Rises as Humana and CVS Vie for an Acquisition Deal - TipRanks.com,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.tipranks.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/cano-nysecano-rises-as-humana-and-cvs-vie-for-an-acquisition-deal (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EBC3370>, 'Connection to www.tipranks.com timed out.

Elizabeth Street in Detroit. Photo via Facebook

DETROIT – Officials from Huntington Bank joined Detroit Wayne County and state officials on Wednesday for the grand opening of Huntington Tower the first large new downtown Detroit building to be completed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The tower was originally envisioned to be the headquarters for Chemical Bank prior to Chemical’s 2020 merger with TCF Bank and TCF’s subsequent June 2021 merger into Columbus Ohio-based Huntington Bank the Detroit Free Press reported.

As part of the TCF-Huntington deal Detroit became the headquarters for Huntington’s commercial banking operations.

The new glass-clad building adorned with Huntington Bank’s signature green color is located across from Comerica Park on Woodward Avenue and was designed by Neumann/Smith Architecture.

Half of the tower is devoted to indoor parking with mostly offices on the top nine floors and starting next month a Huntington branch will open on the ground floor.

While Huntington for now is the tower’s sole occupant others could join the bank in the future.

The Tower was built in the footprint of a surface parking lot and an empty 10-story 1950s office building known as the Michigan Mutual Liability Annex that was demolished.

Construction began in 2019 but was delayed over the pandemic and bank mergers with construction finishing up just last month. The project was originally projected to cost $104 million though Huntington Bank has not revealed the final cost.

Today is a momentous day for our bank for the city of Detroit for the county of Wayne and for the state of Michigan. — Gary Torgow chairman of Huntington Bank’s board of directors

Gary Torgow chairman for Huntington Bank’s board of directors and Huntington Bank CEO Stephen Steinour cut the ribbon at the entrance to the new headquarters along with Governor Whitmer Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan Sandy Pierce chair of the Detroit Economic Club’s board of directors and others.

Among other officials Wayne County Executive Warren Evans and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson joined hundreds of attendees at the grand opening.

“Today is a momentous day for our bank for the city of Detroit for the county of Wayne and for the state of Michigan” Torgow told the attendees. “We never faltered through that promise that we made to Detroit to that obligation to occupy this new green glowing high-rise tower representing the largest bank building built in Detroit’s history.”

Detroit City Councilman Coleman Young II gave Torgow a Spirit of Detroit Award at the grand opening.

Duggan talked about how with each merger announcement over the last few years he worried about Detroit possibly losing the bank to another city.

Whitmer said that right after she took office she came down to the location in Detroit and noted it was just an empty lot “on which we are all celebrating today.”

“It’s an honor to be here less than four years later to see what has gotten accomplished here and what it is going to mean for the people of this community for the people of our state” Whitmer said.

Torgow co-founded the Sterling Group the developer of Huntington Tower back in 1988. In 2009 he handed off the real estate firm to his children to focus on banking the Free Press reported. Huntington Bank itself is only a tenant in the building and has no ownership interest.

Torgow and partner David Provost bought numerous distressed banks to build what became Talmer Bank. Talmer merged with Chemical Bank in 2016 forming what was the biggest bank headquartered in Michigan.",,,,,,

Image credit: Shutterstock/luchschenF

Biosensors are devices and/or chemicals that are used to detect biological markers. For example a biosensor can detect and identify specific diseases to help prevent the spread of that disease and to better treat patients with that disease. Biosensors are for example used to measure glucose levels for diabetes patients monitor blood pressure for heart disease patients measure general nutrition in livestock or even find life on Mars.

Types of Biosensor Suppliers

We have identified three major categories of commercial suppliers of biosensors. The first is chemical detectors such as assays or a disposable device which changes color such as with pregnancy tests. The second is electronic devices that identify biomarkers using an electronic method such as spectroscopy (measuring light) or other electrochemical reactions. The third and last are lab-based products where one sends a sample to a lab which then performs a proprietary test using various methods similar to the first two categories.

At ESMO 2022 in Paris oncologists discussed real-world cases and big-picture challenges

Sep 23 2022 2:15 PM ET

Originally published on Illumina News Center

The European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual congress convened earlier this month in Paris where Illumina presented key abstracts demonstrating the clinical utility of comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). CGP is a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach that uses a single test to assess hundreds of genes—including relevant cancer biomarkers as established in medical guidelines and clinical trials—for tumor therapy guidance.

During an invitation-only roundtable at the conference Illumina Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Phil Febbo said: “I do believe that having a complete understanding of an individual’s cancer is the best way to provide best care for patients. It’s amazing to be in this role and at a company that’s really driving to make this available and accessible.” Four panelists at the roundtable discussed the value of CGP in case studies relating to prostate cancer liquid biopsy and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) detection and diagnostics.

In addition to these case studies the doctors talked about their methods of using CGP in their practice their distinction between testing tissue versus liquid the challenges of attracting talent to the lab the business of collecting and interpreting data and the need to improve care and—most importantly—outcomes.

Dr. Nicole Pfarr head of both the Molecular Diagnostic Unit and the Next Generation Research Facility at the Technical University of Munich spoke about a drive to build collective knowledge: German universities and hospitals are compiling genetic data to establish a national database. With that in mind more testing will mean more data. “We want to include more in the Molecular Tumor Board discussions” she said. “It used to be that we would do a large gene panel and if we found something then we would do HRD [testing]. Now we do all the testing up front. Large gene panel HRD translocations included. We do this for all the ovarian cancer breast cancer pancreatic and prostate cancer. And astonishingly we also find high HRD scores in sarcomas.”

While testing and generating data has been critical to developing the field of precision oncology the data itself carries great significance from a patient perspective. “I’ve had some interesting discussions about the return of data” said Dr. Bettina Ryll founder of the Melanoma Patient Network Europe and former EU Cancer Mission Board member. “Some patients want the data. They can’t always tell you why or what they’re precisely going to do with it but being in possession of one’s own data—in particular genomic data—returns some ownership of the disease and might help to cope. This ownership gives back some of the control you have lost in the cancer diagnosis and we should not underestimate the psychological value of that. I have medical training I have a science background and I can tell you when my husband was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma I realized how much I had no clue how it is to go through it. I had always considered cancer a medical issue but if you’re there personally you see the psychological issue is half the problem—and it hits the patient the carers the people who are there and it’s huge.”

Ryll who lives in Sweden also urges the medical community to support greater genomic literacy among patients. “I preach a lot about the difference between somatic and germline” she said. “One of the first questions I always get is ‘Is it possible I have passed this on to my children?’ People are very worried and experience huge feelings of guilt. We have a responsibility toward our patients to lessen their burden and make an effort to teach and contribute to the general education.”

Dr. Joaquin Mateo an oncologist and research leader at Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona also emphasized the patient experience: “One of the problems is that the infrastructure for precision medicine has been set up from hospitals based on the particularities of the hospital not the particularities of the patient. They may have to travel for example or sometimes their data will need to be accessible from afar to be assessed by other professionals. We need to prepare easy pathways for patients who may need to receive testing counseling and treatment in different places.” He stressed the need to put the patient at the center and organize the rest of the infrastructure around them.

“Melanoma is obviously close to my heart” said Ryll whose husband was diagnosed with it in 2011 and died a year later. “At the time we had a survival of 5% for five years now we are at 50%. It sounds great but it means we still lose one out of two patients. For us precision medicine is one of those fields that offers a lot of hope.”

The two main shape categories into which they fall are inline (shaped more like a screwdriver) and pistol-grip (shaped like a handgun). Pistol-grip wrenches are typically bulkier but the design also allows for larger socket sizes -- at ½-inch or above you'll likely be using a piston-grip wrench.

Another variation comes in the power delivered by the batteries. Like all electric tools their power is measured in voltage. Most impact wrench batteries are either 18 or 20 volts with the 20-volt models usually considered preferable since they provide more power though factors like motor type also influence power.

""Generally speaking 20-volt is better than 18-volt"" says Tim Koster founder of Clever Creations. Clever Creations is a website dedicated to DIY projects repair guides and tool reviews. ""The higher the voltage the more power the tool has. That said a specific 18-volt model impact wrench can still be stronger than a different model that works on 20-volt. Voltage is not the only thing to consider.""

Another important consideration when choosing a cordless impact wrench is torque. Torque the twisting force that gives impact wrenches their abilities is measured in pound-feet which is determined by multiplying the force acting on an object (in pounds) by the distance of the lever being used to exert the force (in feet). While an impact wrench doesn't use an actual lever pound-feet can still be used as a universal scale by which to measure torque. However the abbreviation is often written in reverse as ""ft-lb.""

Torque varies based on impact wrench size with 1/2-inch impact wrenches providing an average of 300 pound-feet of torque and 3/4-inch impact wrenches providing an average of 1200 pound-feet. An impact wrench's torque can't be adjusted by itself but there are attachments that can vary the torque. Additionally torque shouldn't be confused with inches per minute (IPM) or revolutions per minute (RPM). While there is a mathematical relationship between the measurements IPM and RPM measure speed not torque.

Of course the amount of torque you need depends on your application as well: ""If you do a lot of automotive work then you can benefit from up to 500 pound-feet of torque"" says Koster. ""If you only do light work on the other hand 200-250 pound-feet will be more than enough.""

There are other features that differ between battery impact wrenches as well. For instance some have variable-speed triggers which means that the speed at which the wrench turns is controlled by how hard the user presses the trigger. Impact wrenches also differ based on how their sockets are secured with ball or pin detents providing more security and friction (or hog) rings providing easier release.

""A friction ring is typically preferred especially when swapping out sockets a lot"" says Koster. ""Detent pins are notoriously difficult to work with."" That said if you won't be changing sockets you may prefer the tight grip of a pin detent.

""Each anvil style has its own benefits"" says Tarini. ""For users who need maximum socket retention and are generally not changing sockets frequently -- such as those working at height where a dropped socket might be hazardous -- the detent pin design would be preferred. For users who are switching socket sizes more often the friction ring design allows for strong socket retention while allowing an easier socket change. In the case of the automotive user the friction ring is the preferred design as it provides the socket retention needed while allowing the user to quickly change sockets without additional tools (which may be required on some detent pin designs).""",,,,,,,,,,,,

The 16:10 display of the ThinkPad T16 G1 which has been enlarged to 16 inches is likely to be the first thing that catches your eye. The option of a significantly larger battery raises the hope of long battery runtimes as does the optional low-power display. Other changes will be explained throughout this review as well as possible drawbacks compared to the predecessor.

Our model comes with an Intel Core i5-1240P 16 GB of DDR4-3200 RAM a 512 GB PCIe 4.0 SSD a FHD+ low-power display and a large 86 Wh battery. The optional Intel U CPUs seem to be a little more economical according to our reviews thus far. A 2.5K panel is also available but the 4K UHD option of the predecessor with 100% DCI-P3 is no longer available. Nvidia's GeForce MX550 is also optional.



The competition of the ThinkPad T16 as a high-end business device among the 15/16-inch laptops primarily includes Dell's Latitude 15 5531 and HP's EliteBook 865 G9.

It is ""essential"" to establish a permanent tax exemption system for proceeds from investment Kishida said in a speech delivered at the New York Stock Exchange to encourage more foreign investment in Japan.

Kishida said such tax incentives are necessary because Japan has ¥2 trillion ($14 billion) in personal financial assets but ""only around 10%"" is invested in stocks.

Since he took office last October Kishida has proposed a ""new form of capitalism"" that emphasizes wealth redistribution.

Kishida said his new capitalism policies should be as powerful as two-way Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani as it could help the Japanese economy achieve ""growth and sustainability.""

Under the Nippon Individual Savings Account (NISA) program holders of designated accounts at financial institutions are exempted from taxes levied on proceeds from investments until 2042.

Kishida proposed eliminating the deadline in the speech but the details will be left for further deliberations by the Finance Ministry and a tax system panel of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

Kishida also said Japan will expand tax incentives to improve the environment for startup businesses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLmNsZXZlbGFuZGNsaW5pYy5vcmcvMjAyMi8wOS8yMy9hbGV4LWdvcnNreS1qb2huc29uLWpvaG5zb24tZXhlY3V0aXZlLWNoYWlybWFuLWpvaW5zLWNsZXZlbGFuZC1jbGluaWMtc3BlYWtlci1zZXJpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alex Gorsky Johnson & Johnson Executive Chairman Joins Cleveland Clinic Speaker Series,"Tom Mihaljevic M.D. Cleveland Clinic CEO and President will welcome Alex Gorsky Johnson & Johnson Executive Chairman to join him as part of the speaker series Ideas for Tomorrow.

Such was the case with Ann Sievers of Il Fiorello Olive Oil Company in Suisun Valley.

The love of olive oil runs in her blood and that of her family. Thanks to an academic abstract she wrote and videotaped the world has a chance to hear her passion on the topic.

Sievers’s paper was recently submitted to and accepted by Yale University the University of Rome Italy and the University of Bari Italy. Her daughter Elisabeth Fiorello Sievers who is fluent in Italian and a third-level sommelier recently read the abstract at the Fourth International Conference on Olive Oil and Health in Rome. The focus of the conference was on Olive Oil Policy Education Economics Climate Health and Marketing.

What happens next? Ann Sievers is waiting to hear as her daughter only just returned home from Italy.

“It’s an honor for sure to present to a group like this” she shared.

Olive oil she emphasized is a valuable sustainable product.

“What we do matters” she pointed out.

The combined forces of the City of Atlanta and Dekalb County governments private investment firms corporate power players the Atlanta Police Foundation and film and television production studio Blackhall Studios have worked to destroy close to 400 acres of the city’s largest forest in order to build a $90-million eighty-five-acre police training compound and a massive $400-million forty-acre movie studio complex. Only a valiant effort of forest defenders has held them off. Residents have marched organized petitions filed lawsuits and sponsored teach-ins. Muskogee (Creek) people from Georgia Oklahoma and Alabama have gathered for a rematriation summit and stomp dance ceremony on their historic territory. Raves and music festivals have filled the woods with crowds and the echoes of rap folk and techno past sunrise. Construction equipment has been sabotaged incursions into the forest pushed back demonstrations held at the homes of the heads of subcontracted engineering firms and memes circulated widely online. Around the city “Defend the Atlanta Forest” signs are displayed in yards and in the heart of the forest wooden treehouses cling sturdily to mature tree limbs and trunks. Below a village threads through the woods: tents tarped dwelling areas and outdoor kitchens. Huge banners suspended between towering trees sway in the wind welcoming supporters to the forest and demarcating the line that has been drawn around it: “No Cop City No Hollywood Dystopia.”

In November 2021 members of the Muscogee (Creek) Tribe currently living in the Helvpe Ceremonial Grounds in Oklahoma traveled to their historic territory in Atlanta’s South River Forest. The stomp dance and cultural sharing events they held in Intrenchment Creek Park were attended by hundreds of people.

Much more than a local conflict or environmental defense activism the battle for the South River Forest brings to the fore critical questions of urban life in the age of climate change. On the one hand the situation in the forest illuminates emergent mutations of urban space process and government produced by capitalist urbanization and control in the shifting social-ecological contexts of the twenty-first century. On the other hand it points to significant transformations in the strategies and struggles through which humans as world creators and dwellers fight for life on a planet being pushed into the abyss. As such the conflict in the Atlanta Forest is a struggle over the future of urban life in the Anthropocene.

§1 The South River Forest is a central site of the tipping point between two possible futures prescribed for Atlanta from the perspective of climate governance: the city will be either a “climate refuge” or a climate no-go zone.

Roughly three and a half hours from the Atlantic coast and nestled in Georgia’s piedmont region Atlanta is the nineth largest metropolitan area in America. It is also one of the fastest growing. Despite this 47.9% of Atlanta’s land is covered in tree canopy—the highest of any city the country. This lush interconnected network of mature pines oaks magnolias and other trees together gives Atlanta its nickname the “city in a forest.” Alongside making it more verdant and livable than some other urbanized areas and providing habitat for pollinators birds and a wide array of other wildlife Atlanta’s approximately 3.7 millions trees generate increasingly critical ecosystem services in an era of climate chaos. With global warming Atlanta faces increasingly frequent and intense rainfall catastrophic flooding and hotter longer-lasting heat waves as well as potentially lethal wet bulb temperatures. According to Climate Central data average summer temperatures in Atlanta have increased by 2.9°F over the last 50 years. In the summer of 2022 as part of a triple-digit heat wave blanketing the American Midwest and South that led the National Weather Service to advise a third of America to stay indoors several Georgia cities experienced temperatures above 100°F and Atlanta tied a fifty-year old June heat record of 98°F. The previous week it broke a heat record by reaching 99°F.

The proposed razing of Atlanta’s tree canopy is directly connected with this epochal crisis. As local organizations such as the South Atlanta Watershed Alliance repeatedly point out the demolition of the South River Forest will directly decrease the city’s natural ability to field extreme heat and flood events by shifting greater burden onto already-stressed grey infrastructure and eliminating the natural shade and cooling provided by urban tree canopy. Furthermore forests sequester CO₂ and Atlanta’s urban forests’ annual gross sequestration rate has been estimated at 42000-45000 tons of carbon per year the highest among cities with significant tree cover in America. Urban governments know well the importance of urban ecosystems services and climate futures which is why the City of Atlanta’s own 2017 Atlanta City Design: Aspiring to the Beloved City urban plan envisioned the forested area currently slated for construction as part of an enormous 1200-acre urban greenspace.

These global warming trajectories intersect with other forecasts for Atlanta in particular intimations that it will be a “climate refuge.” Used with increasing frequency over the past several years the terms “climate haven” or “climate refuge” refer to areas projected to receive significant chunks of the tens of millions of climate refugees and migrants as they flee wildfires natural disasters or coastal flooding along the planet’s densely developed coastlines. Once discussed as a far-off future matter in recent years media planners and politicians have begun advocating immediate and proactive relocation. During the pandemic as extreme weather intensified and became more frequent across the country planning and media discourse began suggesting that we have reached the “limits” of urban resilience—the dominant discourse and practice of climate adaptation in cities since at least 2010—advocating instead a post-resilience form of adaptation focused on defunding and disinvesting from flood- and storm-prone cities.

This emergent discourse is exemplified by a recent Washington Post opinion piece by the scenario strategy advisor Parag Khanna. Published in November 2021 after historic flooding in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia caused by an “atmospheric river” that poured multiple inches of rain in hours Khanna’s piece argues that while wealthy American cities like Boston New York Los Angeles or San Francisco can afford to build resilience to rising seas hurricanes and wildfires others cannot. Citing the growing number of hurricanes slamming the Louisiana Gulf Coast in recent years and the economic cost of rebuilding infrastructures like power lines that will only be knocked out by subsequent storms Khanna argues that New Orleans “is going the way of Venice” and the US government “must realistically assess which geographies are becoming unlivable and which are well suited to larger population settlement. It should then offer incentives for migration toward the latter and away from the former—and direct infrastructure spending accordingly… Property developers should lure displaced Americans to gentrify the Rust Belt along the Great Lakes. The people of New Orleans should be given one-way tickets to Detroit where they can contribute to the city’s nascent postindustrial revival.”

Khanna’s vision of defunding and disinvesting from flood- and storm-prone cities and attendant climate refuge gentrification elsewhere is currently just a proposal. Still it is part of a broader climate adaptation narrative that has been gaining traction. This discourse is focused not on securing existing spaces but instead declaring their obsolescence while simultaneously identifying specific cities and regions as climate refuges. The mayor of Buffalo New York set the first explicit precedent for this in 2019 when he designated his city a Climate Refuge City in hopes of attracting new residents and economic investment. Later that year the New York Times proposed Duluth Minnesota as a critical climate refuge. For Rust Belt cities that have sustained economic population and job losses since the 1970s taking on the mantle of a climate refuge is increasingly seen as an attractive branding angle. Access to increasingly scarce resources is often seen as a key qualifier for climate refuge status (the Great Lakes hold 20% of the world’s fresh surface water). Even hot crowded and water-poor Atlanta is projected to be the destination of at least 250000 climate migrants as coastal cities like Savannah Charleston or Miami become increasingly inundated. This is likely a conservative estimate however: in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 more than 100000 people evacuated to Atlanta in a matter of days.

The destruction of the South River Forest will undermine the city’s ability to be any kind of climate sanctuary or refuge. After all even though Atlanta is a “city in a forest” it is now the city in the United States that is losing tree cover the fastest. Rather than the verdant green canopy and flowing fresh water of climate utopian city visions this is a future Atlanta closer to Bladerunner 2049’s Los Angeles: crowded polluted and denuded of life with elites ensconced in the city’s John Portman-designed concrete and glass compounds while swelling surplus populations are crowded into dilapidated apartments surveilled and held in check by state-of-the-art militarized police.

§2 The proposed construction of Cop City is one instance of a broader global tendency of governments’ use of cities as laboratories for experiments in social control and profit extraction in the era of climate chaos and social upheaval dynamics of which were exacerbated by the pandemic.

On the heels of the George Floyd Rebellion in 2020 the Atlanta Police Foundation proposed building a $90-million eighty-five-acre police training complex. Slated for the site of a former prison farm “Cop City” plans include a mock city for police training simulations replete with gas stations banks apartment complexes nightclubs and splash pads as well as burn and explosives test sites shooting ranges and a helicopter landing pad. The police training compound will be two times larger than that of the New York Police Department and three times the size of the Los Angeles Police Department’s the two largest police departments in the country. Originally named the Atlanta Institute for Social Justice and Public Safety Training “Cop City” is touted as a way of rebuilding the Atlanta Police Department’s morale and a method of bridging the gap between the police department and “the community” with weekly farmers’ market and community garden plots.

After the police murder of Floyd in the summer of 2020 an impassioned uprising overwhelmed cities across America and prompted urban elites to search for new social management strategies. This was especially the case across metro Atlanta where massive crowds took over streets and parks disregarding curfew orders to march together burn police cars and loot stores. Unable to contain the situation the governor declared a state of emergency in late May for every county in Georgia deploying thousands of National Guard troops to parks and malls across Atlanta. The uprising shattered the peace of the “Atlanta Way” a longstanding political alliance between black and white business classes. This power sharing arrangement and agreement on moderate incremental reform rather than direct confrontation is widely celebrated as the reason why the city remained peaceful in the aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. In 2020s America this strategy is less effective as dividing lines are more unclear; instead of simple black and white there is a multiracial bourgeois governing class alliance of economic and cultural elites and America’s motley multi-racial urban and suburban proletariat. This striation was visible in the 2020 Floyd uprising in Atlanta when then-mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Killer Mike—a major property owner in the city’s West side—issued “go home” appeals during the uprising.

Amidst such change real estate interests and business coalitions who back the Atlanta Police Foundation sought revised approaches to ensure that such widespread—and frequently multi-racial and multi-generational—urban uprisings would never occur again. Academic governmental and military strategists widely agree that volatile urban spaces are the key conflict environments in which the twenty-first-century’s political and environmental upheavals will play out and against which existing counterinsurgency methods devised in past environments and conditions are woefully insufficient. As a 2016 counterinsurgency training video produced by the US Army and screened at the Pentagon’s Joint Special Operations University warned “our current and past strategies can no longer hold. We are facing environments that the masters of war never foresaw. We are facing a threat that requires us to redefine [military] doctrine and the [army] in radically different ways. The threat is clear. Our direction remains to be defined.”

Increasingly governments and police are now using cities as laboratories for experimenting with new modes of government and control. Some of this involves design-based efforts to construct infrastructures able to fortify cities against climate change and disaster. From New York to Miami Lagos to Kyoto the supposed imperative of resilience building has formed the substrate of a profound transformation of urban planning and government based on a rejection of modernist city/nature binaries and attempted interlinking of living beings natural processes and technological systems via sensing nodes disaster management infrastructure and human communities. Urban resilience in this way flanks and creates important discursive and material conditions in which a truly cybernetic world can freely unfold. But along with managing the impact of hurricanes and floods on markets and infrastructure building a “resilient” urban space is also a matter of developing new modes of counterinsurgency to administer social upheaval and maintain order such as those that will be trialed in the Cop City facility. As former Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms put it the goal of Cop City is to enable “twenty-first-century training” for “twenty-first-century policing.” Thus its opposition often summed up in the slogan “Stop Cop City” takes on historical and global significance.

§3 The proposed construction of Blackhall Studio is a step in the emergent hyper-striated Anthropocene world in which the economic success of global investment firms functions as the organizing principle of policing the urban environment the nonhuman elements of the world human populations and possible human ways of life.

Immediately east of the proposed site for Cop City and on top of even more of the South River Forest Blackhall Studios and CEO Ryan Millsap plan to expand the footprint of Atlanta’s film industry. While the police training compound needs to be read in light of urban counterinsurgency experiments for a post-George Floyd climate chaos world Blackhall Studio’s plans for the forest need to be understood in the post-pandemic context of real estate and finance-driven “hostile urban takeovers.” According to David Madden Covid-19 has “inaugurated a new phase of urban political-economic recomposition realignment and restructuring.” Driven by a range of political projects being legitimated in the name of pandemic response this emergent paradigm of “covid-capitalist urbanization” as he names it is characterized by the escalation of pre-existing forms of rentierism the remodulation of workplace conditions and the intensification of the relationship between urban government tech companies and algorithms. One can think here of how the pandemic has served as an opportunity for live trials of surveillance and tracking technologies in the form of selfies robotics and AI as well as “pandemic smart city” tech such as contact tracing apps and drones or social contact monitoring and vaccination pass systems. But the pandemic has also seen private equity firms real estate and venture capitalists seize control of urban futures launching new forms of accumulation by dispossession that are fueling a real estate market frenzy and massive housing shortages.

Founded in 2017 by Ryan Millsap CEO of Irinda Capital Management (ICM)— owner of tens of thousands of apartments across the Sunbelt—Blackhall played host to a slew of movies like Venom (2018) Godzilla: King of Monsters (2019) and Jumanji: The Next Level (2019) as well as straight-to-streaming shows like Lovecraft Country (2020). Eyeing expansion Blackhall originally snapped up properties in the largely black working-class Gresham Park neighborhood around the South River Forest and in a February 2021 deal with the Dekalb County government Blackhall managed to “swap” fifty-three non-contiguous acres in Gresham Park for forty acres of Intrenchment Creek Park. In April 2021 Millsap sold Blackhall to Commonwealth Asset Management for $120 million while retaining “a substantial minority interest.” Since then Blackhall has partnered with private equity firm Silver Lake which infused the project with $500 million renamed Shadowbox and announced a $1.5 billion global expansion plan. While Millsap sold controlling interest in Blackhall he retained legal control of the forty acres of Intrenchment Creek Park slated for clearcutting. To what end is not currently clear but he has announced plans for a new streaming platform Blackhall Americana.

The rapid proliferation of the content industry over the last two years is unsurprising. During the pandemic streaming services reached a high of some 1.1 billion subscribers or roughly one in eight people on the planet. Demand has only increased and generationally speaking it is Millennials and Gen Z who consume the most whether it’s streaming services like Netflix (150 million subscribers in the US) Amazon Prime and Disney+ or platforms like TikTok which has roughly 100 million monthly users in the US. The space of content is rapidly expanding and Facebook’s conversion into Meta is a sign of things to come. Shadowbox’s most recent investor Silver Lake is a largely technology-centered investment firm which in April 2022 invested $150 million into Genies an avatar ecosystem for the metaverse promising “Your own mini world. Oh and you own it all.”

In 2016 a Danish politician writing for the World Economic Forum penned an essay titled “Welcome to 2030. I own nothing have no privacy and life has never been better.” The essay predicted a shift towards a sort of AI-run Nordic luxury socialism but it recently went viral on right-wing Twitter due to its provocative title and in response to revelations that private equity firms like Blackstone are transforming America into a nation of renters. Amidst a decline in new housing construction private equity firms are snapping up single-family homes and converting them to rentals. According to geographer Desiree Fields these firms own a growing portion of the single-family home rental market with the four largest—Invitation Homes American Homes 4 Rent Tricon Residential and Front Yard Residential—owning approximately 182000 units nationwide. Significantly Atlanta is the epicenter of this change with those four firms owning 27000 single-family homes in the metro area.

The reach of private equity firms extends beyond the single-family home renter market. Invitation Homes is actually a creation of Blackstone which recently purchased Preferred Apartment Communities for $6-billion and its 12000 multi-family housing units in cities like Atlanta Nashville and Tampa. In 2021 half of Blackstone’s more than $12-billion profits were from real estate alone. This cash grab extends into Atlanta’s low-income apartment complexes. With lax laws concerning’s renter’s rights and decrepit living standards abound according to the Atlanta-Journal Constitution: “At least three-fourths of the region’s most dangerous apartments … belong to private equity firms or other absentee investors under whom crime and squalor are not so much bad fortune as collateral damage from a widely followed business model.” Mold broken appliances and violence related to the city’s drug trade combine to make an unlivable situation for many tenants yet they are trapped paying higher rents to massive predatory institutions dedicated to scraping ever more money off the back of the average American.

The point here is not to remind that there is in fact a capitalist class but rather to reveal the linkages between their actions and to understand the future they have in store for the rest of us if they were to succeed. At the end of the day organizations like Shadowbox and the private equity firms it represents don’t want to just make movies or streaming shows; they want to reshape the world in a darker more synthetic way. Their designs fuse endless content with the creation of urban and suburban fiefdoms. In other words they would destroy a forest to make a movie about a jungle that you stream while you live in the pod and eat the bugs. They’d play host to films that cast black actors and tout environmental themes while contributing to environmental racism and increasing gentrification and displacement. They’d make Atlanta hotter and less alive leaving us further from a future we can survive in or even remotely influence.

§4. The fight for the forest is a hubristic innovative fight for life in and against emergent Anthropocene urban dystopias.

On a weekday morning this past June a caravan of cars trucks and dirt bikes clogged the road along the perimeter of the South River Forest. They delivered bouquets of flowers and signs of support to the tree sitters who inhabiting makeshift houses high in the trees have put their lives on the line to defend the forest. Families zoomers and dirt bikers honked their horns and blasted radios to show their appreciation for the tree sitters and the forest itself.

The plan to bulldoze a maturing urban forest to build urban counterinsurgency training compounds and produce more streaming content clearly encapsulates the dystopian—and careless—nature of contemporary neoliberal regimes and the increasingly apocalyptic trajectory they are on. We are entering crucial decades of climate chaos in the twenty-first century. Heat waves come like clockwork; in the American west water reserves are at historic lows; panthers gorillas songbirds bees butterflies and frogs are on the verge of extinction; food and gas shortages and material price spikes have already triggered demonstrations and riots in response. Meanwhile the dominant solutions to the climate crisis are to either deny its existence outright or enforce austerity measures on the general population.

In contrast the defense of the South River Forest illuminates a possible path forward one that is nascent but nevertheless vital in the present: the fight for life. Everyone defending Atlanta’s South River Forest is acting for both themselves and those who will inherit the land after them. It’s become an existential and also commonsense matter of whether there will be anything but avatars and heat waves for those who come next. For many people the only human response to watching the video of George Floyd’s murder was to open the door and go outside in the midst of a pandemic and stay-at-home orders to join millions of others in the street. Today for many the only human response to attempts to bulldoze the South River Forest and build a landscape of police training and Hollywood film compounds has been to get up and go to the woods.

We live in a time of rapid change and cascading crisis. It’s imperative that we are able to stand back from the noise of each moment and see the present “poly-” or “perma-” crisis as a time of epochal and governmental remodulation. We should be attentive to these changes in narrative and material reality and be able to understand them when they are incipient rather than already full-blown. Too often like the Owl of Minerva spreading its wings only with the falling of dusk we only see the walls that have been erected around us once they’re already cemented in stone. Perpetually late to the game power has moved on. The conflict in the Atlanta Forest highlights some of these changes: urban global warming refuge cities cities as labs where control and extraction are being recalibrated. But it also points to the need for people (whoever they are wherever they are) to be as innovative and ready to use the present as an opportunity to experiment freely with new forms of thought strategy and life. “Stop the Metaverse Save the Real World”—inscribed on a banner tied between two loblolly pines in the South River Forest— are the philosophical and political stakes of our time.",,,,,,

Throughout her time at the School of Public Health alum Leah Magid (SPH’17) admits that she felt lost. She knew where her public health interests lay but she did not know an exact career path to get there and was often left feeling like she had more questions than answers.

Now as a senior manager at IQVIA a global provider of advanced analytics technology solutions and clinical research services for the healthcare industry Magid has stayed connected with the Career and Practicum Office at SPH to help students interested in consulting work find and navigate their own career paths.

“In public health we can be overwhelmed with this idea that the natural career move after our MPH is working at a hospital department of health or NGO. While these are all great career paths they weren’t what I was interested in and I imagine a lot of current students can relate to this same feeling” says Magid. “I want to help students explore their options and find a path that works for them. The process to find your career intimidating and not always clear so I want to be able to support students and alumni in whatever way I can.”

As an MPH student Magid began working at IQVIA through her practicum experience with the Strategy Consulting Team. She was hired on as an associate consultant after graduating from SPH and has been working her way up through the ranks ever since. In her current role Magid works to establish strategic expertise in the consumer healthcare space supporting companies in shifting their approach in a more science-driven and innovative direction. She also oversees the day-to-day operations of IQVIA’s Cell and Gene Therapy Center where she drives the development of IQVIA’s patient-tailored offerings for these therapies.

Magid enjoys the interdisciplinary nature of her work as well as the opportunity to solve complex problems through innovation on a day-to-day basis. She says that the critical thinking skills she gained throughout her time at SPH have been essential for bringing a public health lens to all aspects of her work.

“No matter what problem we are trying to solve we always want to be thinking about our stakeholders the people who will be seeking these therapies” she says. “This idea can get lost at times because of a focus on business assessments for example but when you approach the work from a public health perspective you are bringing it back to the patients caregivers treaters and our health systems. Thinking about and addressing nuances like socioeconomic background and demographic differences by region allows us to provide really thoughtful and impactful recommendations to our clients.”

This person-centered perspective is one that IQVIA has long valued and over the last four years Magid has been leading recruitment efforts at SPH to bring students to the company. In partnership with the Career and Practicum Office Magid has worked to facilitate IQVIA information sessions on campus and has attended a number of career and practicum fairs as well as other networking opportunities for students.

She has also positioned herself as a point of contact for SPH students interested in IQVIA and consulting work in general answering questions about consulting in the field mentoring students throughout the practicum and job search processes and helping them prepare for interviews with consulting firms across the country.

“There is a lot of talent at SPH and I want to help students interested in consulting work understand how to apply the skills they’ve gained throughout their program to a corporate setting” says Magid highlighting that she hopes to be able to provide a resource for students that she felt was missing when she was a student at SPH. “I would not have gotten my practicum or job at IGVIA without the help of the Career and Practicum Office but I still had a lot of unanswered questions that I wish I could have talked to someone about. I hope I can help to fill in some of these gaps and ease the process for students interested in pursuing a career in consulting.”

Magid says that working with SPH students over the years has been a really gratifying and fulfilling process. “The students at SPH are incredibly driven so to be a part of their career journey even in small ways is a really great feeling” she says. “It is my way of giving back to a community that gave me so much.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYWxiYW5pYW5kYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWxiYW5pYS1sYWNrcy1hY2Nlc3MtdG8taW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS10cmVhdG1lbnRzLW9uLWNhbmNlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Albanian Daily News,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYWxiYW5pYW5kYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWxiYW5pYS1sYWNrcy1hY2Nlc3MtdG8taW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS10cmVhdG1lbnRzLW9uLWNhbmNlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026740D54FD0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The issues range from staying up late to getting to class on time the following day balancing rigorous courses and a hectic social calendar and making sure that their backpack never runs out of college-student snacks.

But perhaps the issue that concerns college students the most is also the most important: How do I get a job after graduation? And more specifically that question is narrowed to this: It seems every potential employer wants to hire someone with experience but as a student how do you get that experience without a job?

There are however opportunities for students to gain that valuable workplace experience. One such opportunity is the Rankin College of Business Internship Program at Southern Arkansas University. The Internship Program works with students each semester placing them in professional job settings in their degree field. That experience gives students a head start on their careers.

Six College of Business students took part as interns during the spring semester and nine more completed internships this summer. In addition four graduate students in the College of Business also participated in internships this summer.

One of those students is Naija White who participated in the Tjuanna Byrd Internship Program in the summers of 2021 and 2022. The Tjuanna Byrd program is for women of color who are pursuing a degree in a STEM field. White a 2019 Lafayette County High School graduate interned at Windstream in North Little Rock in 2021. Her time there saw her attending company meetings shadowing coding assignments and fixing bugs on the Windstream website.

After earning her degree in information systems in May of 2022 White again participated in the program. Her last internship was with Stone Bank in Little Rock as an IT Support Representative. White said she would recommend the SAU internship program to other students in the College of Business. “It’s a great program. It opened a lot of different doors for me” said White. “It really helps you network with other interns and with professionals. It gives you knowledge in the field you want to pursue.”

Faith Lonigro used her experience in the Internship program to help land her first job following graduation. Faith worked in the Logistics Department for J.B. Hunt in northwest Arkansas where she spent half her time shadowing other employees and the rest working with brokers and customer representatives. “I really enjoyed my time at J.B. Hunt” said Faith. “They were really helpful and nice and I got experience on the supply chain side.”

Faith graduated from SAU in December 2021 with a degree in supply chain management. With her degree earned in the classroom and experience earned on the job she landed a job with Lanxess in El Dorado where she works with the production schedule for the company. “My internship helped me with my job search and getting my first job” said Faith. “If I hadn’t had the internship I probably wouldn’t be here.”

Desiah Williams a junior in the Rankin College of Business participated in the Internship Program for the first time this summer. Like White she also earned a spot in the Tjuanna Byrd Summer Internship Program. Desiah a 2019 graduate of Bearden High School completed an internship with Arvest Bank in Rogers AR in the IT and security department.

Dr. Robin Sronce dean of the Rankin College of Business believes the Internship Program is a great program that helps students move toward the careers they want. “We’re very proud of our Internship Program” said Sronce. “It allows the Rankin College of Business to work with both businesses and our students. And it’s an opportunity for our students to gain invaluable workplace experience.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

(NASDAQ:JKHY) Just Reported Third-Quarter Earnings: Have Analysts Changed Their Mind On The Stock?,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. ( ) shareholders because the company has just released its latest third-quarter results and the shares gained 3.1% to US$169. Jack Henry & Associates reported in line with analyst predictions delivering revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models following these results.

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a notable 8.3% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to swell 11% to US$5.75. In the lead-up to this report the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$181 suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. There's another way to think about price targets though and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Jack Henry & Associates with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$200 and the most bearish at US$170 per share. Still with such a tight range of estimates it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.

These estimates are interesting but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare both to the Jack Henry & Associates' past performance and to peers in the same . We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Jack Henry & Associates'historical trends as the 6.6% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2025 is roughly in line with the 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 3.7% annually. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.

With that in mind we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Jack Henry & Associates. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Jack Henry & Associates analysts - going out to 2026 and you can

The Giants drafted the 6-foot-6 259-pound Johnson in Round 4 No. 107 overall. Can Johnson develop into a more productive NFL player than he was as a college player?

“It’s really exciting for me because I think I have a super high ceiling. I think I haven’t even scratched the surface of what I’m capable of. I’m really looking forward to proving every day that I’m out here” Johnson said Saturday after the second of two rookie mini-camp practices.

“I think I have tremendous room to improve. I think I can grow a lot more than where I’m at right now. I think that’s why I’m so excited. I’m coming in here with a learning mindset. I want to develop respect from my teammates and my coaches. I think that’s going to help me continue to grow and improve. But I’m super excited to get to work and get going here because I think I have a potential to be a really special player here.”

The Giants certainly hope so. They traded for veteran Darren Waller a year ago hoping he could be a difference-making tight end. After one mediocre season in which leg injuries limited his availability Waller might retire.

That likely is part of the reason the Giants drafted Johnson.

“I think the big thing for me is consistency. Being consistent” Johnson said. “I’ll flash a lot of really good things on tape but it’s putting all that stuff together every single snap that’s going to help me reach my potential.

“Consistency comes from repetition doing it a lot and then being very detail oriented. Being very honest with yourself when you’re watching film and then having a coach that’s going to hold you to that standard every single day and not let the little stuff slide. I think that’s a big part of having consistent technique.”

Johnson understands that tight end is not a simple position to play.

“Tight end is a lot even at the college level. You’re just asked to do so much and that’s why I think it’s a great position” Johnson said. “Everything you’re asked to do it’s very unique. It’s not just a one-tool guy. The best tight ends are able to do everything. I think that’s really cool for a guy like me that I feel like I have the potential to do all the things that you can ask a tight end to do and be a guy that you can’t take off the field.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d0b3AuY29tL2xvY2FsLXNwb3J0cy8yMDI0LzA1L2luY3JlZGlibHktc3BlY2lhbC1yYXJlLTE5MjAtamVyc2V5LXdvcm4tYnktd2FsdGVyLWpvaG5zb24td2hlbi10aGUtc2VuYXRvcnMtYmVhdC1iYWJlLXJ1dGgtaXMtbm93LXVwLWZvci1hdWN0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Incredibly special’: Rare 1920 jersey worn by Walter Johnson when the Senators beat Babe Ruth is now up for auction,"A piece of D.C. baseball history is up for sale and for sports memorabilia collectors its rarity is bringing up…

A piece of D.C. baseball history is up for sale and for sports memorabilia collectors its rarity is bringing up its value.

A game-worn jersey that belonged to Washington Senators pitcher and Baseball Hall of Famer Walter Johnson is currently at auction. Heritage House which is hosting the auction says the unique uniform is over a century old and valued at $3 million.

Production Manager Mike Provenzale told WTOP in the 20 years he’s worked for Heritage House Johnson’s jersey ranks at the top of all the items they’ve ever sold.

“It’s one of the most impressive items we’ve ever offered” he said calling the right-hander “one of the greatest sportsmen of all time.”

Using photo-matching the auction house traced the jersey back to April 29 1920 when the Washington Senators defeated the New York Yankees 2-1 at the Polo Grounds. It was the first time Johnson faced legendary hitter Babe Ruth. According to Provenzale Johnson earned his 299th career win while Ruth was only able to get a an RBI off a sacrifice fly.

“Through that photo-matching you’re able to identify the exact moment he was wearing it and when you can do that and it’s an important game with a lot of significant notes like that that just really piques the interest of high level collectors” he said.

This jersey was gifted by Johnson to teammate Eric “Swat” Erickson as a retirement gift after the 1920 season. Provenzale said Erickson brought a ranch in New York and had a barn where he kept all his sports collectibles including Johnson’s jersey.

“Decades later his granddaughter discovered it in the barn” Provenzale said adding that she was the one who initially sold it to a private seller.

Johnson’s legacy added an additional element that makes the jersey extremely valuable.

Known as “The Big Train” Johnson helped the Senators win its only World Series championship in 1924. He spent his entire 20-year playing career in Washington earning a record of 417-279 with a 2.17 ERA. For more than 50 years his 3509 strikeouts were the most thrown by a pitcher in the majors. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1936 prior to his death 10 years later.

“He was the most dominant pitcher. He holds numerous records. He has the most scoreless games the most consecutive years leading the league in strikeouts” Provenzale said. “Essentially it’s him and Cy Young who are considered … the greatest pitchers of all time.”

Unlike modern jerseys which teams and players hold on to due to their value at the time uniforms were not seen with much significance other than being work clothes. The fact that Johnson’s gift survived is “a miracle” Provenzale said.

“Jerseys in that era were considered disposable” he said. “They were worn and worn and repaired until they could no longer be repaired.”

There is only one other known jersey worn by Johnson that exists and it is sitting in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown New York. Combined with the disposable nature of uniforms in the past it is unlikely that another game-worn Johnson jersey will surface Provenzale said.

“So if you’re interested” he said. “This is the opportunity to get it”

The auction ends on May 17.

Look out for Jordaine Johnson!!!

Johnson who missed the entire outdoor season last spring with a broken toe left lots of smoke at Schools Stadium on Saturday when he produced one of the greatest and electrifying sprint triples in state history at the Super Essex Conference Championships in Newark.

Johnson a junior at East Orange Campus started off his day by running a meet record 10.53 in the trials of the American Division 100-meter dash No. 5 in the state this season. He followed that up by winning the 100 dash final in 10.70.

Johnson returned to the track 15 minutes later to finish first in the 400 in 47.91 No. 2 in the state this season. Later in the day Johnson completed the sprint trifecta with his best performance of them all when he blazed his way to a meet and Essex County record 21.04 which is No. 8 in NJ history for all conditions (there was no wind gauge).

How rare and remarkable is Johnson's triple!!!?

I can only find three other sprinters in state history who ran under 10.55 under 21.10 and under 48.00 in their high school careers!!!

Olympic gold medalist Dennis Mitchell a 1984 graduate of Edgewood ran 10.47 21.06 and 46.02. The late Mario Heslop of Franklin (Class of 2019) went 10.33 20.74 and 46.73 and Shamali Whittle of Hamilton North (Class of 2022) had high school PR's of 10.48 20.55 and 47.82.

That's some fast company that Johnson joined!!

And Johnson might be the first to ever go under 10.55 under 21.10 and sub 48 on the same day!! Heslop and Whittle accomplished their times on different days. Still checking on Mitchell.

Here's some more info on Johnson's 21.04 in the 200.

Johnson's 21.04 broke the Essex County automatic time record for all conditions of 21.22 that Maxwell Booker of Essex Catholic ran when he finished second to Danny Johnson of Rahway (21.03) at the 2000 Meet of Champions at Frank Jost Field in South Plainfield. The times by Booker and Johnson were wind-aided as they were run with a tailwind of 2.3 meters per second.

In case you're wondering the state record in the 200 for all-conditions is a wind-aided 20.51 (2.8 meters per second) by Antonio Tarantino of Paul VI in the trials of the 2018 New Balance Nationals Championships at North Carolina A&T in Greensboro N.C.

The Northbay-Wiseman partnership went to Karstensens Skibsværft for their new pelagic vessel with a design spec and arrangements finalised in co-operation with the yard’s design team to achieve optimum standards for the crew the best possible catch-handling and storage and optimised performance and fuel consumption. To achieve these goals nothing has been spared in outfitting Artemis with the latest systems and equipment.

The new vessel’s hull was built at the Karstensen Shipyard Poland and arrived in Skagen in February 2022 for outfitting.

The 75.70 metre Artemis has a 15.60 metre beam and a 2313 cubic metre capacity in its 12 RSW tanks. There’s a pair of 20-inch SeaQuest fish pumps deployed from the at fish pump deck and catches are routed to the separator and from there to the selected tanks. The owners opted for a twin Johnson Controls 1400kW/1.204.000kCal/h RSW system with a C-Flow vacuum system for discharging.

The trawl deck layout has a Karmøy Winch package with a pair of 91-tonne trawl winches controlled by a Karmøy Winch management system. There are 110-tonne net drums in a waterfall configuration aligned to the stern gates equipped with hydraulic closers and guiding pics a 71-tonne topline winch and a 57-tonne tail-end winch as well as mooring winches an anchor windlass a netsounder winch on the aft gallows and two sets each of hydraulic and fish hose reels for the SeaQuest fish pumps. A net bin on the starboard side is recessed into the shelterdeck.

The deck cranes are from MacGregor Triplex with a KN-60 fore deck crane an NK-6000 net crane aft and a KNR-75 fish pump/general purpose crane mounted on the aft gantry with a deployment area over the trawl deck and aft of the stern.

The Furuno Smart Bridge puts a row of five 55-inch Olorin monitors facing the skipper’s control position and there are a further fifteen 27-inch Hatteland monitors dotted around the wheelhouse.

The echo sounders are a Furuno FSS-3 BB and a pair of Simrad ES80 sets and the key fishfinding sonars are all from Simrad with a low frequency 14-19-24kHz ST94 set a medium frequency 70-85-90kHz CS-94 and an FS-70 trawl sonar.

The propulsion configuration has a Wärtsilä package of a 6100kW 10V31 main engine driving a 4200mm diameter 4G1095 propeller via a SCV 100/2-PDC68 gearbox coupled to a Marelli MJRM 710 2800kW/3500kVA shaft generator. The 866kW W12V14 auxiliaries are also Wärtsilä units and the harbour set is a 200kWe Scania DI09.

When the winches demand full power there’s less demand from propulsion. So the gearbox PTO is clutched in while the winch system is in use with power routed from the shaft alternator to give the deck all the power it needs. Once the gear is back in the water and Artemis is towing the PTO can be clutched out power routed to the shaft from the main engine and electrical power to the systems on board comes from one of the two gensets.

The gensets are able to connect into main switchboard controlled by the vessel’s DEIF power management system. The electrical power system is designed for sliding frequency (60-50Hz) by means of frequency converters for 400/440V and rotating frequency converter for 230V. This allows main engine and propeller revs to be 17% lower than would otherwise be possible.",,,,,,

The heads of three major US banks on Wednesday pledged that they would withdraw from the Chinese market if Washington imposed sanctions on Beijing in response to an invasion of Taiwan.

JP Morgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan and Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser told lawmakers at a hearing of the US House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services in Washington that the three banks would follow the guidance of the US government to exit China if necessary.

The three bankers made the pledge after US Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer asked the three if they would pull their investments out of China should the Chinese Communist Party follow through on its threat to invade Taiwan.

The US lawmaker spoke of Beijing’s continual threats toward Taiwan and its military exercises around Taiwan last month.

Citing the military actions of Russia against Ukraine Luetkemeyer said there was a great risk in investing in “volatile nations with dictatorial governments” as financial institutions have played a significant role in supporting these regimes’ economies.

Moynihan said Bank of America had followed the government’s guidance to “work with China” in the past few decades but if the US position changed “we’ll immediately change it as we did in Russia.”

Dimon and Fraser agreed with Moynihan’s comments on following the government’s lead.

“We very much hope it doesn’t happen” Fraser added.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February the security situation across the Taiwan Strait has drawn increasing interest in the international community.

Fears over a possible invasion of Taiwan have been growing in particular after US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a 19-hour visit to Taipei early last month which China strongly opposed.

Pelosi’s visit prompted China to launch several days of large-scale military exercises around Taiwan.

In a prerecorded interview with CBS’ 60 Minutes program that aired on Sunday US President Joe Biden told host Scott Pelley that the US would defend Taiwan “if in fact there was an unprecedented attack.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG1lbnRtb25pdG9yLmFpL3NlY3RvcnMvZmluYW5jaWFsLXNlcnZpY2VzL2lzLXRoZS1maW5hbmNlLXNlY3Rvci1xdWFudHVtLXJlYWR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is the finance sector quantum ready?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG1lbnRtb25pdG9yLmFpL3NlY3RvcnMvZmluYW5jaWFsLXNlcnZpY2VzL2lzLXRoZS1maW5hbmNlLXNlY3Rvci1xdWFudHVtLXJlYWR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673E727550>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Fortinet VMware Cisco Drive SD-WAN Gartner Magic Quadrant

Single-Vendor SASE Surge Expected to Fuel Convergence of SD-WAN SSE Capabilities

Image: Gartner

Perennial leaders Fortinet and VMware and a surging Cisco set themselves apart from the rest of the pack in SD-WAN according to the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant report.

See Also: OnDemand | Simplifying your Security Stack with SSE Integration

Platform security giant Fortinet and virtualization behemoth VMware once again took the gold and silver in ability to execute in SD-WAN with Cisco leapfrogging both Versa Networks and Palo Alto Networks to capture the bronze. Gartner sees a large and growing gap in execution ability between those three and the other vendors it designated SD-WAN leaders: Palo Alto Networks Versa Networks and HPE Aruba.

""When clients are asking about who's included in RFPs who's being finalized who's being selected there is separation"" Jonathan Forest Gartner senior director and analyst tells Information Security Media Group. ""There is separation by some of the higher market share vendors.""

Cisco Fortinet and VMware respectively were the three SD-WAN market share leaders in 2021 with Versa Networks and HPE Aruba capturing fourth and fifth place market research firm Dell'Oro Group said in March. The worldwide SD-WAN market expanded by 35% in 2021 to more than $2 billion and the eight largest SD-WAN vendors accounted for more than 80% of revenue last year Dell'Oro Group found.

From a completeness of vision perspective Gartner found Palo Alto Networks and VMware were once against neck and neck with Palo Alto Networks taking the gold this time around. Fortinet leapfrogged Cisco and Versa Networks for the bronze in completeness of SD-WAN vision with Cisco and Versa falling to fourth and fifth place. HPE Aruba was last among the leaders in both execution ability and completeness of vision.

""There is some stability"" Forest says. ""There's enough deployments enough evidence of product deployment capabilities and overall everything we evaluate in the Magic Quadrant to make that assessment on what these vendors have done. So I do believe there's a track record and a certain level of maturity in this market.""

Outside of the leaders here's how Gartner sees the SD-WAN market:

Visionary: Juniper Networks

Juniper Networks Challenger: Huawei

Huawei Niche Players: Cradlepoint Barracuda Networks Nuage Networks Peplink Citrix and Forcepoint

""Things can change on a dime"" Forest says. ""Acquisitions can happen that can change things pretty quickly as can new development of products and new positions on innovation that disrupt the market. Things can always change.""

The Surge of Single-Vendor SASE

Gartner expects the share of organizations procuring both SD-WAN and security service edge from the same supplier will increase from 10% this year to 50% in 2025. Although secure access service edge is today dominated by multivendor solutions with orchestration tying them together Gartner says single-vendor SASE will simplify sourcing and offer a tighter technical integration and better user experience.

Most organizations today are using different vendors for SD-WAN and SSE due to unique requirements or differences in opinion between the networking and security departments Forest says. But as refresh cycles occur smaller vendors without rigid specific requirements will begin selecting one supplier for both SD-WAN and SSE and adoption will slowly move upstream to the midmarket and lower enterprise.

Some large enterprises with unique requirements will maintain separate SSE and SD-WAN vendors for the foreseeable future but Forest believes most customers will eventually converge on a single vendor to reduce complexity and simplify management. The consolidation to date has primarily been driven by SD-WAN vendors and the leading cloud security vendors are just beginning to buy their way into SD-WAN.

""Clients want less vendors"" Forest says. ""It's less complexity which from the security side makes sense because that reduces risk. Cost is part of it but not a driver. It's more about manageability and just reducing the attack surface.""

Fortinet Focuses on App Connectivity SD-Branch

Fortinet's SD-WAN business has focused over the past year on secure application connectivity SASE use cases SD-Branch opportunities and public cloud integration says Vice President of Products Nirav Shah. The company has built ZTNA enforcement into its SD-WAN offering to ensure adversaries aren't able to move laterally across the customer's entire application landscape in the event of compromise he says.

The company's SD-Branch investments will address the needs of big retail and healthcare environments by integrating LTE and 5G inside the SD-WAN appliance providing retail locations with 5G connectivity as well as Dual SIM card Shah says. And from a SASE perspective Shah says Fortinet offers customers flexibility by delivering its security and networking capabilities either on-premises or through the cloud (see: Ken Xie on Why Fortinet Is Leaning Into SD-WAN OT Security).

""We continue to lead the SD-WAN market and continue improving in execution and vision"" Shah tells ISMG. ""If you compare from last year to this year we are the only leader to improve in both execution and vision at the same time. No other vendor in the leadership quadrant could do that. So that speaks volumes to how well we are addressing any concern that customers or analysts have.""

Gartner criticized Fortinet for an average customer experience limited mind share in networking and limited third-party SSE integrations. Shah says Fortinet has invested heavily in building its networking practice out and becoming a key player in both wired and wireless LAN. From a partnership perspective Shah says Fortinet plans to deliver single-vendor SASE and isn't looking to team up with competitors.

""Our SD-WAN is a foundation for SASE because we can do the security and networking convergence that customers want"" Shah says. ""We want to take advantage of providing a single-vendor SASE architecture. And that's why you will not see Fortinet integrating with the other SSE players out there.""

VMware Doubles Down on 5G Integration Security Services

Over the past year VMware has enhanced its security capabilities and integrated private 5G services into its SD-WAN offering says Karl Brown senior director of product marketing for SD-WAN. Healthcare organizations manufacturers and retailers want to connect intelligent devices to 5G during their digital transformation efforts to improve service quality reduce latency and better support branch locations.

The company supports the security needs for cloud and SaaS applications through a bundled offering that allows customers to view analytics around application performance and network traffic and easily apply policies across all applications Brown says. VMware delivers its cloud web security technology from 150 cities to give users a direct path from where they're located to where their apps are hosted (see: VMware Doubles Down on Multi-Cloud Lateral Movement Defense).

""We make it extremely easy for our customers to connect their remote branch locations to cloud and SaaS applications"" Brown tells ISMG. ""We take away the complexity of trying to put appliances in multiple cloud locations and interconnect the users with those applications in the cloud. We make it extremely easy to deliver high-performance SaaS applications.""

Gartner criticized VMware for basic on-premises security product dependency and concerns around the Broadcom acquisition. Brown says Menlo Security's cloud protection offerings are fully integrated and benefit from close collaboration around the road map. VMware wants to extend its on-premises security offering beyond an existing firewall that's often used by customers in branch office locations.

""There is a segment of our customer base and potential customers that would like additional security in the appliance which would augment our cloud-delivered security services"" Brown says. ""We do fully intend to deliver upon that request from those customers.""

Cisco Emphasizes Network Visibility Public Cloud Partners

Cisco has strengthened its SD-WAN offering by providing more network visibility deep integrations with public cloud providers and additional security features and performance says Jay Chokshi director of product management for secure SD-WAN and SASE. Cisco has unveiled enhanced firewall capabilities and troubleshooting analysis as well as a Meraki platform with 33% enhanced performance he says.

Integrating Meraki and Viptela with ThousandEyes gives customers visibility into networks they don't control allowing them to spot outages and deep breaches across the broader internet sooner Chokshi says. Cisco also created a robust secure connection to public cloud that's simple to set up and makes it easy for customers to move applications to the cloud and access data in the cloud he says.

""The networking and security constructs are becoming increasingly complex"" Chokshi tells ISMG. ""The networks are becoming very complex. So bringing simpler security to the operations piece is very important. I think that's a big thing.""

Gartner criticized Cisco for having multiple platforms an average product and an average customer experience. Chokshi says Cisco has driven simplified operations across its products by investing in user experience and creating a simple intuitive workflow experience. Meraki allows Cisco to address SMBs' need for simplicity and lean operations while Viptela offers sophisticated features for enterprises.

""The market is very big. There are different segments of the market that have different needs"" Chokshi says. ""We have been able to bring a lot of what our customers are asking for by offering both Meraki and Viptela. In addition many of our customers are leveraging both the portfolios in their network.""

Palo Alto Networks Takes 5G Digital Experience to Next Level

Palo Alto Networks has bolstered its SD-WAN offering with native integrated 5G autonomous digital experience management and tighter SASE connections says Kumar Ramachandran senior vice president for SASE products. Integrating Prisma SD-WAN with Prisma Access' ZTNA capabilities gives customers the flexibility to select what components they want based on their deployment he says.

Native integrated 5G means customers will enjoy the best possible performance and availability in branch offices while no longer deploying a separate device Ramachandran says. And autonomous digital experience management provides deep visibility into application experience network behavior and user behavior automating application delivery and the resolution of performance issues he says (see: Why Would Palo Alto Networks Want Startup Apiiro for $600M?).

""Our SD-WAN solution is very focused on delivering the best possible user experience irrespective of the connectivity"" Ramachandran tells ISMG. ""You get this very very powerful user experience-based approach.""

Gartner criticized Palo Alto Networks for below-average customer experience below-average sales execution and limited on-premises security with SD-WAN. Ramachandran says the company has focused on bolstering both direct and MSP sales via a managed services partnership with AT&T. The company offers a full-blown firewall in the branch though he says most clients prefer cloud delivery.

""The cloud offers lots of advantages over taking a different security box and deploying it in the branch"" Ramachandran says. ""We get the elasticity of the cloud at the branch.""

Versa Networks Pursues Simplification Via AI ML

Versa has created a natural language processing chatbot and anomaly engine for network and security insights to more effectively leverage AI and ML-based technologies around SD-WAN says CEO Kelly Ahuja. Automating functions helps enterprises go faster save money and be agile by having machines do the basic work meaning organizations no longer need an army of employees troubleshooting security issues.

Vera's new chatbot allows users to ask questions in the management console using normal language and applies fixes with the click of a button greatly simplifying how enterprises interact with Versa's system Ahuja says. And the anomaly engine examines telemetry wherever software is running correlates data from all of those places identifies patterns and reports abnormalities back to customers she says.

""From a technology standpoint our solution is head and shoulders above the market based on what our customers are telling us"" Ahuja tells ISMG. ""In certain segments and certain geographies we're actually beating many of the other competitors hands down.""

Gartner criticized Versa Networks for product complexity poor customer experience and less DIY experience. Ahuja says Versa has done a lot of work to simplify its workflows with a well-lit path and said it provides comprehensive capabilities around routing appliances and security. Most customers are served via Versa's 150 service providers though many Global 2000 firms run directly on Versa he says.

""We have the most comprehensive understanding of the market and a full solution that covers both networking and security which is where the market is heading"" Ahuja says. ""So we are very very well-positioned to continue to lead the market and build and grow the business.""

HPE Aruba Doubles Down on Single Console Branch Security

HPE Aruba has worked in recent years to collapse WAN edge functions around routing firewalls and optimization into a single management console to simplify management and reduce human error says Derek Granath senior director of SD-WAN product and technical marketing. The company has teamed up to leverage user and device identity and role-based access control to enable segmentation he says.

The company has replaced branch firewalls by adding security functions at the branch such as dynamic path control and unified threat management and integrating with Palo Alto Networks and Check Point offerings he says. HPE Aruba also has increased its intrusion detection capability over the past year with prevention technology correlation of user identity and defense and mitigation features that isolate traffic he says.

""We've always been about improving performance on the WAN"" Granath tells ISMG. ""We have certain features that we think we do better than anybody such as our ability to run reliably on the internet even when it becomes impaired because of congestion.""

Gartner criticized HPE Aruba for an incomplete security road map limited geographic and vertical strategy and below-average customer experience. Granath said HPE Aruba has customers in every vertical and excels in financial services technology manufacturing and retail. From a security perspective HPE Aruba automates integrations with Zscaler and Netskope to make accessing SSE easier he says.

""There's no single SASE vendor that can tick all of the boxes for security and all of the boxes for the network"" Granath says. ""A dual or multivendor solution means customers don't have to compromise on either the security side or the network side.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Swedish fintech company Klarna captured the world’s attention with its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) model during the pandemic popularising the already existing payment framework. Its growth and public popularity propelled the company’s valuation to above $45 billion at its peak a massive leap from its pre-pandemic high valuation of $5.5 billion in 2019. Leveraging the company’s success and the popularity of its BNPL model in March 2022 Klarna sought to utilise its open banking prowess with the launch of a new sub-brand Klarna Kosma.

Explainer: Klarna Kosma is an open banking provider with connections to over 15000 banks across Europe and the US. Available in over 27 countries the platform offers account verification bank transfer business transaction management risk management and identification capabilities among others.

Following its launch in March this year Klarna Kosma benefited from the resources of its parent group Klarna inheriting its 15000 bank connections across 24 countries. In July the new sub-brand announced its maiden partnership with Berlin-based finance management platform Airbank.

The German group sought to expand its international presence and by partnering with Klarna Kosma Airbank secured access to account information from the entirety of Klarna’s bank network across several countries through a single API integration.

Highlights:

40% increase in the number of users connecting their bank accounts to the platform increase (compared to the daily average) during the first week following news of the Klarna Kosma collaboration

Secured the second highest daily signup number in Airbank’s history in the wake of the partnership announcement

50% increase in connected banks per existing user following integration

Airbank finds international expansion solutions in Klarna Kosma

To achieve its goal of international expansion it was essential for Airbank to find a partner that would offer robust and real-time connections to many banking institutions. Airbank also wanted to scale in its core markets while also targeting new markets for expansion.

Airbank predominantly operates in Germany which accounts for nearly half of the firm’s current user base. Beyond Germany the fintech uses the English language version of the platform to serve the rest of Europe.

Since Germany was the group’s core market it had focused its bank integrations and connectivity resources there. However with Klarna Kosma’s 15000 banking connections Airbank wanted to expand its platform offerings to clients based in other European countries including Spain Portugal Italy and the Netherlands among others.

Metrics of success

To determine the project’s success both parties measured the conversion and adoption rates regularly and had similar KPI targets. Airbank measured several KPIs across both product and growth. It tracked:

Percentage of existing users with new bank connections

Dormant users converted to active

Ratio of successful bank connection requests to failed requests

Total failed bank connections

LinkedIn post engagement and total reach as well as LinkedIn page followings

Clicks on the app.joinairbank.com link from the promotional email

New signups following the public announcement

Blog post traffic

Website traffic

Airbank reported on these KPIs on a daily basis in Slack for two weeks after launch. Since the two-week mark it has been referring to the KPIs monthly. Product marketing and product management have been reporting on the KPIs to the whole team specifically to the CTO VP growth and the account management teams.

Klarna Kosma highlighted the number of customers and sessions as well as the number of bank account connections with every single SME or SMB as the other key metrics they tracked on a daily basis.

Klarna Kosma advantages

Airbank initially explored potential open banking solutions available in the market. Ben Snyder product marketing manager at Airbank states that it was evident from the get-go that Klarna Kosma would be the right partner.

Upon selecting Klarna Kosma it took around three months from technical assessment to commercial and legal discussions to determine the partnership’s viability.

The two groups first got in touch in April cross-checking the requirements and capabilities on both ends. Airbank was looking for a partner that could increase its bank and PSD2 connections.

The discussions enabled Klarna Kosma to understand Airbank’s needs. Beyond looking to increase bank connections Airbank also had a specific list of connections they wanted to include. Missing connections like Paypal were quickly identified Klarna Kosma assuring to deliver its availability.

Implementation process

Prior to integration the contract and implementation process included three stages:

Commercial discussions

Use case validation

Sandbox testing

The partnership implementation started with commercial discussions between the Klarna Kosma’s sales team and Airbank led by Alex Mueller VP of growth and Patrick de Castro Neuhaus CTO. The consultation aimed to establish what Airbank needed from the collaboration with support from the vendor’s solution engineers.

As the commercial discussions took place Klarna Kosma explored the use case of Airbank to understand the compatibility between Klarna Kosma’s offering and Airbank’s use case and feasibility.

“We took a deep dive into the use case of Airbank to understand what exactly they would use the data for and in what kind of services” Daria Berdnikova business development manager at Klarna Kosma explains.

Upon exploration Klarna Kosma understood that Airbank would use the transaction history of the users with connected their bank accounts to make cash flow predictions categorise spending and manage several bank accounts within one environment.

“In some countries open banking is not as developed so we had to do a lot of work on our side to ensure that banks in particular countries were supporting all the necessary data points like account holder name transaction history etc” adds Berdnikova.

During the use case validation stage the salesperson from Klarna Kosma consulted with the solution engineer from Airbank on the possibility of the integrations and ways to execute them.

The discussions were followed by Airbank signing up for Klarna Kosma’s sandbox environment where the former could test the new platform and understand how it works. The testing process was also an opportunity for Airbank to raise any tickets in the future to solve any pain points that might have occurred. Once both parties were satisfied and contracts signed the integration process began.

Out-of-the-box product

One of the benefits of selecting Klarna Kosma’s platform is that it is a ready product companies can integrate with in a short timeframe.

Berdnikova states “integration altogether on our side takes a couple of days because it is a ready product. We have a nice API reference that is clear and digestible. Some of our partners go live within a week depending on their priorities. Some may take a little bit longer for internal reasons on the clients’ side due to the long testing process shifting priorities etc.”

Following the integration and contract signing the delivery manager from Klarna Kosma entered the process to give production access to Airbank enabling the platform to go live.

Klarna Kosma granted production access to Airbank in June. After gaining access Airbank tested the solution for a month before going live.

During the testing phase Berdnikova notes that Airbank did not flag any pain points that needed resolving. Throughout the process however Klarna Kosma provided integration support and advised on ways to integrate specifically to its client’s requirements.

Klarna Kosma’s global team of engineers handled the queries with the jurisdiction-specific team responding to their region-specific questions.

Testing

When Airbank began testing the platform Klarna Kosma could see the tests happening via its portals. If Airbank raised any issues engineers would connect with Klarna Kosma via an embedded chat function enabling swift responses.

The portal showed every single session on the platform providing insights into how long it took for customers to type in their ID number or log in to the platform. The portal also gave insights into the reasons behind the error.

Overall the entire integration process was a smooth operation that did not require much heavy lifting according to both parties.

Klarna Kosma’s platform was largely delivered without any necessary tinkering with Airbank only requesting the addition of a PayPal connection which the platform initially did not have.

Airbank specifically requested the addition of a PayPal connection due to the popularity of PayPal accounts among SMEs and SMBs.

Challenges

While the integration process was smooth specific bank connections required closer inspection to ensure connectivity. Klarna Kosma had to look at the PSD2 (open banking) APIs’ quality and ensure that a fallback solution was in place to counter any unstable connection.

“Some [banks] are set up in a different way. You have to know how to handle the connectivity on an individual basis. This was not a matter of challenge; it was a matter of tackling these specific bank connections separately” Berdnikova explains.

“PSD2 is still being fully implemented in a usable way. Not every bank has the easiest way to access the data that should be accessible” adds Snyder.

Klarna Kosma quickly inspected the necessary individual bank connections and established the link within one week at most.

Results

Upon going live on the Klarna Kosma platform Airbank announced its expanded banking connectivity generating increased interest from the customers.

According to Snyder the German group witnessed the number of users connecting using open banking via the platform increase by 40% (compared to the daily average) during the first week following news of the collaboration.

Airbank also secured the second highest daily signup number in its history in the wake of the partnership announcement. The only single higher day came one month before when the company announced its Series A.

Airbank’s account managers reported that adding all the new banks unblocked many of its users and the average number of banks per existing users increased by around 50%.

The collaboration also provides Airbank with an opportunity for growth. Its sales and marketing teams can broaden their targets due to new bank connections. Its activated users connect to 30% more banks via open banking following the partnership.

For Klarna Kosma the collaboration raised the recently formed subsidiary’s brand awareness generating new leads for the company.

While no new collaboration is being discussed between the two groups currently Airbank is open to further cooperation should Klarna Kosma expand its access to more institutions.

Capri Sun is introducing a fake “romance-novel hero” to inform parents—but not their kids—that the beverage line now contains an average of 40% less added sugar.

He comes to life as ""Juicio"" in a new campaign titled “Your Kids Will Never Know” that represents a distinct departure from Capri Sun’s recent kid-focused advertising and marketing.

“Our number one priority has been building a relationship with kids and speaking to them in a language that makes sense to them” Samantha Mills associate director at The Kraft Heinz Co. tells Marketing Daily. “This campaign is not at all delivering on that objective. In fact it is the polar opposite in every single possible way.”

In this spot from Goodby Silverstein & Partners Juicio has all the trappings of a romance novel character—from long flowing hair to an open shirt and ultra-tight pants.

The “tasty new delight” is ostensibly the creation of fictitious author Samantha Craven and her equally fictitious titles ""Beach of Desire"" and ""Beauty On The Beach.""

However less than 10 seconds into the spot the voiceover informs viewers ""now that your kids have tuned out this steamy romance we can tell you what this is really about.”

There follows the sugar-reduction news and the advice that kids will still love the flavor. “So why tell them?”

Themed as a cheesy romance novel promo directed by The Giraffe Sisters the fun spot comes with all the adult-teasing clichés in a parody that is wonderfully cringe-worthy while pitching that Capri Sun reduced sugar levels across its portfolio of brands by an average of 40 percent.

‘Your Kids Will Never Know’ stars “Juicio’ (portrayed by Eric Lutz) the protagonist complete with long flowing hair an open shirt hairy chest tight pants and all the drapings.

The company is investing significantly in the future of grocery pickups with its temperature-controlled eCart Trace Grocery (via GoBrightDrop). According to BrightDrop's company blog Trace Grocery smooths out the online grocery process by eliminating the need for grocery workers to hold pickup orders in a different place in the store before customers come to retrieve their items. Instead grocers can pull items directly from the shelves and place them in the carts before taking them out to the curb. This technology allows food to stay cold for up to four hours. This means potentially faster pickups for consumers and freed up time for the workers.

After a successful test in two Kentucky cities Kroger will be Trace Grocery's first official customer expanding the carts' availability to its stores later this year (via GoBrightDrop). A Trace Grocery cart currently has nine different compartments that allow items to be separated by order and storage temperature. Additionally with future developments customers will be able to unlock the cart's contents by QR code eliminating the need for store employees to facilitate the pickup process (via Grocery Dive).

According to Fox Business BrightDrop plans to expand Trace Grocery to other retailers by 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi1gFodHRwczovL3RvcGNsYXNzYWN0aW9ucy5jb20vbGF3c3VpdC1zZXR0bGVtZW50cy9sYXdzdWl0LW5ld3MvYmFieS1mb29kLWNsYXNzLWFjdGlvbi1sYXdzdWl0LWFuZC1zZXR0bGVtZW50LW5ld3Mva3JvZ2VyLWNsYXNzLWFjdGlvbi1hbGxlZ2VzLXNpbXBsZS10cnV0aC1vcmdhbmljLXJpY2UtcnVza3MtYmFieS10ZWV0aGluZy13YWZlcnMtY29udGFpbi10b3hpYy1tZXRhbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge dismisses Kroger class action over alleged toxic metals in Simple Truth teething wafers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='topclassactions.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/baby-food-class-action-lawsuit-and-settlement-news/kroger-class-action-alleges-simple-truth-organic-rice-rusks-baby-teething-wafers-contain-toxic-metals/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EB491E0>, 'Connection to topclassactions.com timed out.

COLLIERVILLE Tenn. — As the community remembers the Collierville Kroger mass shooting one year ago the Collierville area first responders are being honored as the brave men and women who rushed into danger as customers and workers scrambled to escape the terror through any available exit.

Two firefighters who were sent to different parts of the store spoke to ABC24 about their lasting images and the lessons learned.

On the afternoon of Sept. 23 2021 an ordinary day changed for Collierville firefighters Skylar Hunt and Daniel Laplant when they heard about a disturbance at the Kroger on New Byhalia Road.

""We pretty much immediately started heading to the truck” said Laplant. “It's one of those things we don't have to look up the address. We know where the Kroger is in this town.""

Those same moments across town at Station Two just three-tenths of a mile from that Kroger Hunt and other firefighters witnessed fear from their fellow citizens.

“We just heard people screaming running into the bay of the fire station yelling ‘they're shooting they're shooting’” said Hunt. “First thing I thought was that can't happen in Collierville.""

Any doubts were dashed as the firefighters arrived at the most intense and significant crime scene in the town's more than 200-year history.

""As soon as we got there there was a gentleman shot in the parking lot” said Laplant.

First responders found more than a dozen people shot and didn't know if the active shooter acted alone or was still firing.

""We are trained to do it. We rely on our training and we just trusted our skills” said Hunt.

Hunt tended to several people hurt in the back of the Kroger including a worker who was shot in the chest and head but conscious.

""What really just threw me off about it was the guy never stopped talking never had breathing problems and all he would say is ‘I want my mom. Get me my momma. I want my momma’” said Hunt.

Laplant entered through the front of the store and witnessed the carnage firsthand.

""Went in there was immediately a lady shot in the deli. We went over to her and about the time we got to her another crew was coming in behind us so we left her with them and we started clearing down the front aisle of the store” said Laplant.

The firefighters prioritized the more seriously hurt victims first and benefited by the extra ambulances arriving from other Memphis area agencies.

""We were able to stop bleeding you know start IV""s on people get ‘em loaded get ‘em out quickly. So the care got to those individuals much faster than it would have” said Laplant.

""When they see you they know that help is there. And I'm not going to say the fear went away but you could see the fear kind of subside a little bit” said Hunt.

Collierville Fire Chief John Selberg served as Germantown Fire Chief that day and to this day marvels at the heroism of the first responders who assisted first.

""These guys went in without knowing that the shooter wasn't coming after them” said Chief Selberg. “They still went in because they know that was the only way they were going to save lives.""

And because of those first responders' bravery and quick action Chief Selberg is confident they prevented an awful day from becoming even worse.

""The level of injuries that some of those people had would have had a lot more deaths if those guys hadn't done what they did” he said.

Now one year after the mass shooting Hunt and Laplant are humble about their efforts that day but also reflective.

""I'm just thankful for the guys. Reflect back to everyone who was there that day. It took teamwork. Everyone did great” said Hunt.

""I think it was good to show that it could be done. It could be done as safely as possible. We had the equipment that we felt protected” said Laplant.

The work of the Collierville firefighters last September continues to be studied and used as a model of how to quickly respond but also calmly carry out treatment of mass shooting victims."

They found their solution from L3Harris Technologies.

Officials of the Naval Sea Systems Command in Washington announced a $32 million order last week to the L3Harris C5 Integrated Systems segment in Camden N.J. for CEC spares and signal data processors.

The CEC is a maritime tactical sensor and weapons network for anti-air warfare that combines information from sensors on aircraft and surface vessels that are operating over broadly distributed geographic areas.

CEC combines sensor information into a common tactical picture for battle groups at sea. It improves overall situational awareness and enables fleet commanders to work closely together to attack enemy forces from long ranges.

The order to L3Harris is a modification to a six-year $14.9 million contract the company won last July for CEC system production and repair. This contract has options that could increase its value to $378.9 million.

CEC blends sensors and weapons into a integrated real-time network that expands the battlespace; enhances situational awareness; increases depth of fire; enables long intercept ranges; and improves decision and reaction times.

It extracts and distributes sensor information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC-equipped units by fusing the distributed data from shipboard airborne composite tracking network ground-mobile units Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) and coalition partners into one fire-control-quality air track picture.

The system uses line-of-sight data distribution to share radar-measurement data among sensors and weapons to create one distributed integrated air picture. It combines surveillance and targeting information such that the combined system is greater than the sum of its parts.

Related: CACI joins project for networking software to connect sensors and weapons in new brand of mosaic warfare

The jam-resistant CEC obtains target track information to form one real-time composite track to help coordinate theater air and missile defense to engage incoming cruise missiles.

CEC consists of the Data Distribution System (DDS) the Cooperative Engagement Processor (CEP) and interface with combat systems and sensors.

Of course most people know about the high rollers and casino whales extremely rich individuals who love nothing more than gambling millions of dollars in a single session.

However the richest people at casinos are usually not the gamblers but the casino owners themselves.

Out of all these owners there are a few who are at the very top of the US casino business.

These individuals are some of the wealthiest people in the States and many of them own multiple resorts that are worth billions of dollars.

Some were born into the business others only got involved with casinos much later in life.

However all are extremely ambitious and have built a reputation as some of the best businessmen and businesswomen in the country.

1. Sheldon Adelson – $33.5 Billion

Image: Wikimedia Commons

Adelson made and lost millions of dollars multiple times in his adult life.

He only really established his fortune after launching Comdex a Las Vegas computer trade exhibition in 1979.

Adelson began building his casino empire the Las Vegas Sands Corporation in 1989 when he purchased the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas for $128 million.

After honeymooning in Venice Adelson decided to demolish the Sands and build a new casino-hotel in its place. The Venetian opened in 1999 and cost $1.5 billion to construct.

Adelson took his casino empire to Asia in the early 2000s building Sands Macau the island’s first Las Vegas-style casino in 2004.

During the same year Adelson decided to take Las Vegas Sands Corporation public. After he did his net worth reportedly grew by $1 million every hour for two years!

Other developments soon followed including The Venetian Macau which opened in August 2007 and cost $2.4 billion.

In 2010 Adelson outdid himself building the Marina Bay Sands resort in Singapore. At a cost of $5.5 billion it was the most expensive building in the world.

These resorts continued to make fantastic amounts of profit for Adelson earning him a top ranking on Forbes’ Annual “Biggest Winner” List in 2013 after his casinos added an estimated $15 billion to his net worth during the year.

In September 2020a few short months before his death Sheldon Adelson was estimated by Forbes to be worth an incredible $33.5 billion.

Adelson died in January 2021 at the age of 87. He is survived by his wife Miriam Adelson who still owns more than half of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation gambling empire.

She has a current net worth of $27.7 billion.

2. Tilman Fertitta – $7.9 Billion

Image: Wikimedia Commons

Tilman Fertitta initially made his money during Houston’s real estate boom in the 1980s. He then moved on from real estate and became an investor in seafood restaurants owned by the Landry family.

Fertitta became the sole owner of these restaurants in 1988 and has steadily grown the business portfolio by purchasing a number of well-known restaurant chains such as Bubba Gump Rainforest Cafe and Joe’s Crab Shack.

In 2005 as his restaurant empire continued to grow Fertitta moved into the casino business by buying Golden Nugget Hotel and Casinos for $295 million.

This bought him both a casino in Laughlin Nevada and the famous Golden Nugget in Las Vegas one of the oldest casinos in Sin City.

Since purchasing the property Fertitta has spent over $300 million renovating it. This included constructing a new hotel tower and expanding the casino floor itself.

Fertitta has opened three more Golden Nugget casinos including one that replaced Trump Marina in Atlantic City.

Fertitta bought this property at a massively discounted $38 million nearly a tenth of the $316 million Trump Enterprises was asking for before the 2008 financial collapse.

3. Phil Ruffin – $3.1 Billion

Image: Twitter/LindaSuhler

Phil Ruffin built his wealth through owning a chain of convenience stores. He then moved into the hotel business and finally in 1995 when he was 60 years old the casino industry.

He began his casino empire by buying the Crystal Palace Resort in the Bahamas.

Three years later Ruffin bought his first US-based casino taking over The Frontier Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

The Frontier had been struggling for years because of a long workers’ strike that was being performed by members of the Frontier’s staff.

Ruffin resolved the strike in a few short hours and remodeled the casino for $20 million dollars.

He would ultimately go on to sell the 36-acre property for more than $1.2 billion in what was the largest per-acre price in The Strip’s history.

Ruffin currently owns two of Las Vegas’ most iconic casinos Treasure Island and Circus Circus. Both of these properties have undergone extensive renovations.

Ruffin now aged 87 is still fully committed to his casinos. So much so that he told Forbes that he has no intention of retiring and aims to “die at his desk.”

4. Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta III – $2.6 Billion

Image: Forbes

The two Fertitta brothers who are third cousins of Tilman Fertitta each have a net worth of $2.6 billion and have had shockingly similar career paths.

They both got their start in the casino business from an early age thanks to their father Frank Fertitta Jr. who launched Station Casinos in 1976.

Station Casinos began as a casino for locals to enjoy and has become one of the largest local casino operators in Las Vegas.

Having worked for Station Casinos as young men Lorenzo and Frank led the company to its first IPO after their father retired in 1993.

They raised $294 million and became principal shareholders and co-founders of Station Casinos Inc. in the process.

Both Frank and Lorenzo were early investors in the UFC purchasing the fight promotion company for $2 million dollars in 2001.

In 2016 the brothers sold their shares for an estimated $4 billion.

Station Casinos Inc. now owns numerous hotel-casinos including Red Rock Casino and Spa in Las Vegas and Sunset Station in Henderson Nevada.

The company also manages a large number of casinos for other owners.

5. Elaine Wynn – $1.7 Billion

Image: The Wall Street Journal

Nicknamed the “Queen of Las Vegas” Elaine Wynn is a woman who along with ex-husband Steve transformed the Las Vegas casino industry.

The two of them launched Mirage Resorts in 1973 which would go on to build some of Las Vegas’s most iconic casinos including The Mirage Treasure Island and Bellagio.

These developments were among the first to offer the full range of glitz and glamor that Las Vegas casino resorts have become known for.

In 2000 following their great success the couple sold Mirage Resorts to Kirk Kerkorian for $6.4 billion.

The Wynns wasted no time in launching their new venture Wynn Resorts.

Their first property the flagship hotel and casino Wynn Las Vegas was opened in April 2005 and cost $2.7 billion to construct.

Wynn Resorts now operates a total of six hotel-casinos two in Las Vegas three in Macau and one in Boston.

Elaine and Steve divorced in 2010 evenly splitting their 38% stake in Wynn Resorts.

In 2018 Steve Wynn resigned as CEO of Wynn Resorts and sold the majority of his shares following accusations of sexual misconduct from Wynn Resort staff members.

This has made Elaine the second largest shareholder of Wynn Resorts and one of the most powerful casino owners in the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWluc2lkZXIvd3lubi1yZXNvcnRzLXZlbnR1cmluZy1pbnRvLW55LWZvci1tYW5oYXR0YW4tcHJvamVjdC0yNjQ1NjU3L9IBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWluc2lkZXIvd3lubi1yZXNvcnRzLXZlbnR1cmluZy1pbnRvLW55LWZvci1tYW5oYXR0YW4tcHJvamVjdC0yNjQ1NjU3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wynn Resorts venturing into NY for Manhattan project,"New York real estate heavyweight Related Companies is partnering with Wynn to pursue a casino license with plans for a project in Manhattan.

Las Vegas Boulevard the epicenter of American gambling is dominated by New York landlords.

Now a big company from Las Vegas wants a bite of the Big Apple.

New York real estate heavyweight Related Companies announced recently that it’s partnering with Wynn Resorts to pursue a casino license with plans for a project in Related’s Hudson Yards development in Manhattan.

Their news release did not provide specifics on the project saying only it would be a “resort entertainment and gaming destination along the Hudson River” and that it would be near the sprawling Javits Center convention facility.

But Wynn’s venture marks a reversal of sorts from what Las Vegas has seen in recent years: New Yorkers snapping up property in Southern Nevada’s most lucrative stretch of real estate.

Of course Las Vegas has long been a destination for out-of-town developers house flippers and commercial-property landlords. (I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve written about Southern California firms buying apartment complexes here.)

But when it comes to the Strip one city in particular has emerged as the main source of buyers lately.

New York-based Vici Properties a Caesars Entertainment spinoff vastly expanded its holdings in Las Vegas when it acquired casino giant MGM Resorts International’s real estate spinoff in a $17 billion-plus deal.

As part of the buyout which closed this spring Vici acquired several MGM-operated properties along Las Vegas Boulevard including The Mirage Park MGM New York-New York Luxor and Excalibur.

Before that Vici also acquired casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s real estate on the Strip — The Venetian Palazzo and The Venetian Expo — for $4 billion in a deal that closed in February.

All told Vici now owns 660 acres of real estate along the Strip “the most economically productive street in the world” the company said this spring.

Another major landlord from New York is investment giant Blackstone whose portfolio includes Bellagio Aria and Vdara. It purchased those three for more than $8 billion combined and leased them back to MGM Resorts.

It also owns two other MGM-operated properties — Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand — in a joint venture with Vici.

Blackstone had kicked off a real estate buying spree in Southern Nevada after the economy crashed a decade or so ago and it owned and operated The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for years.

It bought the flashy hotel-casino in 2014 for $1.73 billion and sold it for $5.65 billion. The sale which closed in May marked the “most profitable single asset sale ever” for Blackstone’s real estate business the company previously said.

Meanwhile New York’s Dreamscape Companies acquired the off-Strip Rio for $516.3 million in 2019 and New York investment firm Gindi Capital after it teamed up to buy Showcase Mall several years ago purchased more property along Las Vegas Boulevard in 2019 for $172 million.

Last month Clark County commissioners approved Gindi’s plans for a new three-story retail complex spanning more than 300000 square feet on that roughly 9.5-acre site — which Gindi had acquired from Spectrum Group Management another New York firm.

Related Wynn’s casino partner in New York is no stranger to Las Vegas either. Among other ventures here it partnered on the development of World Market Center downtown’s massive furniture-showroom hall that was acquired in 2017 by (drum roll) Blackstone.

Time will tell whether other Las Vegas firms plant a flag in New York. But odds are a company there is bound to buy something here first.

The Review-Journal is owned by the Adelson family including Dr. Miriam Adelson majority shareholder of Las Vegas Sands Corp. and Las Vegas Sands President and COO Patrick Dumont.

FAIRFAX CITY VA — George Mason Center for Psychological Services is hosting its sixth annual Food for Thought fundraising event on Oct. 3 to help pay for the many services it provides the Northern Virginia community.

""We're the main training clinic for the doctoral students in clinical psychology and we serve the community"" said Prof. Robyn Mehlenbeck the center's director. ""We're not the university counseling center. It's not for the Mason students. They have their own counseling center.""

CPS offers a variety of in-person psychological services including traditional therapy and testing in an office building located at 10340 Democracy Lane in Fairfax City.

""We do a lot of testing for kids for learning disabilities ADHD and then psycho-social because the schools really like our reports and will actually follow recommendations that we send"" Mehlenbeck said.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic CPS opened an emotional support line where people can find help both in English and Spanish by calling 703-215-1898 from 8:30 a.m.-8:30 p.m. seven days a week.

""It's not a therapy service. It's support"" Mehlenbeck said. ""But for those who need more than that we offer what we call our brief three-session skills intervention. That is also open to folks in the community at very low cost."" A single session costs $25 or $75 if all three sessions are needed. Prince William County residents can access the sessions for free according to Mehlenbeck.

""We actually initially set that program up for essential workers during COVID"" she said. ""Now it's open to the whole community."" More information about all the services CPS offers is available online.

Since CPS is a nonprofit it relies on sponsorships and fundraisers like Food for Thought for support. Leidos is hosting the Oct. 3 event from 6-9 p.m. at its headquarters located at 1750 Presidents St. in Reston.

""We'll have lots of food lots of drink"" Mehlenbeck said. ""We'll talk about what we do at the center how we help particularly specialized populations. This year we're really focusing on veterans because we do a lot of work with veterans. We do a lot of work with youth our teenagers and young adults. We have two funds specifically for those areas in addition to our general fund that helps all of our low-income clients."" Food for Thought will also have a silent auction with items like Washington Wizards tickets and vacation getaways that people to bid on. Those not able to attend the Oct. 3 event in person will still be able to submit bids online. In addition to the Leidos-sponsored event Capital Auto Club and Ferrari of Washington will be showing their support for CPS by showcasing their vehicles along Market Street in Reston from 5-8:30 p.m. on Oct. 3. The car show is free open to the public and does not require registration. The deadline to purchase tickets for the Food for Thought event at Leidos headquarters is midnight on Sunday Sept. 25. Information about purchasing tickets or sponsorship opportunities is available online.

Members of the Presidential Estates community feel they are being ignored and that rules established decades ago are being broken so they want the county to say no to developing the land.

“What they’re doing basically is trying to structure this so they can do an end runaround of this around the owners give us nothing. In fact what they said the benefit to us would be was an end to the litigation” said resident Jeffrey Frantz.

The problem for the neighborhood is that it surrounds a golf course that is intertwined with the community but is privately owned.

For nearly 40 years owners of the golf course have tried to develop it but a lawsuit in the 80s established a set of covenants that said the space needed to remain a golf course or open green space unless a majority of the community’s residents and 75 percent of residents in the immediate surrounding area approve.

But now the present owners and the Lennar Corporation are trying to build more than 100 homes on the land frustrating those who say it goes against the rules that have been reaffirmed as recently as 2009 and to those who say it’s going to add to already horrible traffic.

“You’re looking at probably 400 or 500 additional cars when all is said and done plus whatever vendors and contractors and construction that’s associated with that” said Amy Chafetz the president of a nearby homeowners association.

Lennar’s attorneys presented their proposal to the commission which voted 7-2 in approval of the developer’s plan.

The homeowners say they will be appealing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ2xlbm5sbG9waXMvMjAyMi8wOS8yNC90cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi1yZXF1aXJlcy10aGF0LXlvdS1zdGF5LXRydWUtdG8tYW5kLWV2b2x2ZS13aG8teW91LWFyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Transformation Requires That You Stay True To And Evolve Who You Are,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/glennllopis/2022/09/24/transformation-requires-that-you-stay-true-to-and-evolve-who-you-are/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ2xlbm5sbG9waXMvMjAyMi8wOS8yNC90cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi1yZXF1aXJlcy10aGF0LXlvdS1zdGF5LXRydWUtdG8tYW5kLWV2b2x2ZS13aG8teW91LWFyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbW9yZ2FuaGlsbHRpbWVzLmNvbS9wcm9wZXJ0aWVzLW9uLXRoZS1tb3ZlLWZyb20tY29tbWVyY2lhbC10by1yZXNpZGVudGlhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Properties on the move from commercial to residential,"Two major housing projects in the works in Morgan Hill are proposed on land that has long been classified for commercial use.

The developments are both in the planning stages on the north side of town and together would add a total of 218 units to the city’s housing supply.

One of the projects is slated for the 4.6-acre site currently occupied by Family RV a motor home sales and rental business that moved onto the property at 19380 Monterey Road in 2012. DeNova Homes has been working on plans for a 93-unit condominium development for which the Morgan Hill Planning Commission on Sept. 13 approved a tentative map and design permit.

Just over a mile south in the Evergreen Village development just off Cochrane Road the property owner is now planning a 125-unit townhome condominium project where a grocery market medical offices tire store and retail space have been proposed for several years.

The developer Evergreen Development has applied for a General Plan and zoning amendment—which will require approval from the city council—to allow the construction of the residential project according to city staff. The property is currently zoned commercial and the developer is seeking to change that to “mixed-use flex.”

The planning commission also on Sept. 13 heard a “preliminary review” of the Evergreen residential project from city staff and the developer. No action from the commission was taken or requested during the hearing which was scheduled to give commissioners a chance to provide input to the developer.

Laura Ortiz of Evergreen Development told the commission that the original commercial plans envisioned for the 6.6-acre property were derailed by the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the market.

She said the development company has reached out to “every grocer that is out there” for the market portion of the commercial plan but none have taken a bite. Many of the grocers have said there are not enough residents on that side of town yet to support one of their stores Ortiz said.

Furthermore many potential office and medical tenants contacted by Evergreen have balked at the cost of new “ground up construction” Ortiz added.

Chad Kiltz of Evergreen Development told the commission Sept. 13 “At the end of the day we determined the best use here was just straight residential. The reason (is) everybody (in the commercial sector) seems to be saying we need more rooftops” to support their business. “Adding higher density rooftops here could actually support the existing and new commercial development that will be coming here in the near future and also attract additional uses” Kiltz continued.

Still city officials would prefer to see commercial—and possibly even “light industrial”—plans come through for the site at Evergreen Village which includes the recently opened 7-Eleven gas station and convenience store on Cochrane Road. The 20.43-acre village was once part of the Morgan Hill Ranch business park then was classified by the city council as a commercial master plan known as The Villages in 2014.

In 2018 the city council approved amendments to the master plan and the project has been known as Evergreen Village since then according to city staff. The pandemic which started in March 2020 stalled the construction schedule for the commercial site; the first major construction in Evergreen Village was the 7-Eleven which opened in January.

The city has also issued permits for a senior assisted living facility Starbucks Taco Bell and a hotel on other land within Evergreen Village.

Morgan Hill Economic Development Manager Matt Mahood told the planning commission Sept. 13 that the best use for the remainder of the Evergreen site is still commercial. He acknowledged that the pandemic “stopped the momentum” of new commercial development in the region but “we’re seeing that momentum come back.”

Mahood said the city should continue looking for light industrial uses—which could include office research & development or medical—for the remaining undeveloped portion of Evergreen Village.

“We will ultimately need to protect our commercial land” Mahood said. “We felt that converting this existing commercial property to residential is premature.”

The applicant for the 125-unit residential proposal is Lennar Homes of California according to city staff. Conceptual plans show the units placed in multiple buildings of five to eight townhome-style condominiums each.

The undeveloped property is located on the northeast corner of Butterfield Boulevard and Jarvis Drive.

Privacy noise concerns

The 93-unit DeNova Homes project proposed at the current site of Family RV was applied for under SB330 and the “density bonus law”—state laws that encourage affordable housing and leave the city little discretion to reject the developer’s plans according to city staff.

After a lengthy discussion—which included objections to the current plans from the property’s neighbors—the commission on Sept. 13 approved the residential project’s tentative map and design permit with conditions. The commission voted 4-2 with Commissioners Paul Lake and James Wilson in dissent. Commissioner Malisha Kumar was absent from the meeting.

The project’s final map will require city council approval.

Conditions for approval include: modified landscape plans to include more trees and larger ones to act as a privacy buffer for existing homes on the south side of the DeNova Homes site; a 7-foot-tall wood fence along the property line shared with existing residences; and a disclosure statement added to the home ownership covenants stating that there is a potential for noise dust and other business related impacts from the existing firm Irish Construction adjacent to the site to the north.

Irish Construction has been in operation next to the DeNova Homes property for about 24 years.

The residential map approved Sept. 13 includes 20 three-story buildings throughout the 4.6-acre property with maximum heights of 40 feet.

Residents who live on Angelica Way who spoke during public comment during the Sept. 13 meeting told the commission they were worried that the height of the new homes might compromise their privacy in their backyards and swimming pools.

One of the residents Bob Long questioned the accuracy of a city traffic study on the DeNova project which determined there would be no significant impact from the residential development. Long suggested the city’s study didn’t consider the “bigger picture” of hundreds more homes permitted or under construction on the north side of Morgan Hill and how those units might contribute to traffic congestion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zb3V0aGZsb3JpZGEvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL2hpc3RvcmljLWhvbGx5d29vZC1iZWFjaC1yZXNvcnQtY291bGQtYmUtdGVybWluYXRlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Historic Hollywood Beach Resort condo could be terminated - South Florida Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2022/09/23/historic-hollywood-beach-resort-could-be-terminate.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zb3V0aGZsb3JpZGEvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL2hpc3RvcmljLWhvbGx5d29vZC1iZWFjaC1yZXNvcnQtY291bGQtYmUtdGVybWluYXRlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The Iron District complex will stretch between 10th and North James Lovell streets according to materials released by organizers. It is an estimated $160-million project that will include 99 apartments in Michigan Street Commons an 8000-seat soccer stadium a 140-room hotel and a 4000-capacity performance venue. They hope the facility will open in 2024.

Bear Development and Kacmarcik Enterprises

AEG would operate the 4000-capacity performance venue with Milwaukee’s Pabst Theater Group AEG Presents chief communications officer Dennis Dennehy tells the BizJournal.

Though concert promoter Live Nation is bigger AEG promotes a variety of entertainment including big-name music acts Justin Bieber Taylor Swift Kenny Chesney and Elton John.

The other big proposed venue in Milwaukee right now in the Deer District is being opposed by a group of locally owned music venues including Pabst Theater Group. Madison-based FPC Live and the Milwaukee Bucks are partnering for the live entertainment venue. But Pabst Theater and allies argue that partnership would significantly reduce the number of shows the local owners can get compared to the national companies AEG and FPC Live.

Live Nation is a minority owner in FPC Live and a majority owner of Frank Productions.

Live Nation Spain’s Cesar Andion tells IQ he hopes to establish the Andalucía Music Forum as an annual event following its successful launch earlier this month.

The newest gathering for the international music industry in southern Europe debuted at the Albeniz Cinema in Málaga from 5-7 September attracting 350 delegates and speakers.

Showcases were limited to acts from guest country Mexico alongside local Andalucían talent.

“We are all super-happy with how everything turned out – it was exactly what I had in my mind when I was designing it” says Andion. “The attendance was perfect for deep and friendly networking as we wanted AMF to be a forum and not a big conference fair.

“The vibe was friendly professional easy-going laid back and fun and Málaga was the perfect spot as a gateway for Latin America in Europe and vice-versa. It’s very different to most of music conferences and we want to keep it that way in terms of the concept vibe and style.”

“We are also planning another one in Madrid that will be completely different to AMF”

Andion says the biggest organisational challenges concerned the timing.

“We organised it all in just a few months and during the summer which is quite a hard time to work because everyone is either on holidays or working on festivals” he says. “But we have a great team with pros in Europe like Ruud Berends (Netherlands) and Ignacia Snadoval (Germany) Fabrizio Onetto and Malfi Dorantes from Mexico and of course Esteban Ruiz and Erica Romero in Andalucía. The Mad Cool team worked really hard to make it happen and I am very thankful to everyone.”

And not only does Andion now have a sequel in the works he also has his sights set on launching a sister conference in Madrid.

“We are also planning another one in Madrid that will be completely different to AMF” he reveals.

AMF is part of the Andalucía Big by Mad Cool project which also included the new 30000-cap Andalucía Big Festival held near Sacaba Beach from 8–10 September with acts such as Muse Jamiroquai Years & Years Glass Animals Michael Kiwanuka Wolf Alice Franz Ferdinand and Aurora.

“It’s a very ambitious project and has been a total success”

“The project is ‘big’ as it is titled because it has three ‘legs’ as we say in Spanish: the pro forum the festival and a tour of Andalucían provinces” explains Andion. “It’s a very ambitious project and has been a total success. Málaga deserved a big festival as it’s one of the coolest and most visited cities in Spain but also because it’s the cultural and event capital of Andalucía.

“The festival had incredible vibe I was really impressed with the audience which was Spanish in majority but with great attendance of Brits.”

Mad Cool Festival and The Spanish Wave are also teaming up to promote Spanish talent at next week’s International Festival Forum (IFF) ILMC’s invitation-only event for music festivals and booking agents. The event will mark the culmination of a nationwide project to find the best emerging acts from Spain.

Three Spanish artists – Hickeys Irenegarry and Pablo Drexler – were chosen from more than 500 applications and will perform at the Mad Cool Festival & The Spanish Wave Presents showcase at London’s Camden Assembly from 9pm on Wednesday (28 September).

Spain is the guest country for IFF 2022 which takes place in London between 27-29 September.

I'm driving to the Bad Bunny concert. What's the best route to take?

Chase Field is at 401 E. Jefferson St. Phoenix. It is bounded by Seventh Street to the east Fourth Street to the west Jefferson Street to the north and the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks to the south.

There are multiple construction projects taking place on both the freeways and surface streets to and from Chase Field so plan extra time to get there if you are arriving by car.

For example Fourth Street will be closed by noon.

The Weeknd's Phoenix concert was an epic post-apocalyptic hellscape.Why that was awesome

If you're coming from the Southeast Valley

Take Interstate 10 west then use the right three lanes to I-17 at the split. Exit to the right on Seventh Street then turn left at the light on Lincoln Street. Or continue north on Seventh Street to Jefferson Street then turn right to access parking facilities east of Seventh Street.

A word to the wise: Left turns from Seventh Street westbound onto Washington Street are prohibited.

To avoid congestion continue on I-17 to the Seventh Avenue exit go right on Seventh Avenue and then right at Lincoln or Jefferson streets.

If you're coming from Scottsdale or east Mesa

Take Loop 202 west to I-10 and exit via the Fifth Avenue HOV lane or Seventh Avenue. Turn left on Fillmore Van Buren (accessible from Fifth Avenue only) or Jefferson streets.

If you're coming from the Northwest Valley

Use I-17 to the Jefferson Street exit then turn left and continue eastbound.

If you're coming from the Northeast Valley

Take State Route 51 (Piestewa Freeway) to I-10 east exit at Washington Street and turn right. Or take I-10 west to the Seventh Street exit and turn left.

To avoid congestion continue on I-10 to Seventh Avenue or the Fifth Avenue HOV exit. Turn left on Fillmore Van Buren (accessible from Fifth Avenue only) or Jefferson streets.

If you're coming from North Central Phoenix

Use surface streets including Seventh Avenue First Avenue and Seventh Street.

Due to heavy traffic Seventh Street is the least-preferred option.

If you're coming from the West Valley

Take I-10 to Seventh Avenue or the Fifth Avenue HOV exit and turn right. Turn left on Fillmore Van Buren (accessible from Fifth Avenue only) or Jefferson streets for parking.

Harry Styles makes history at Madison Square Garden as banner is raised to the rafters ...,"Fri Sep 23rd 2022 09:50 am

Every fan in attendance at show received a feather boa courtesy of Madison Square Garden

Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. raised the newest banner to the rafters on Thursday in celebration of Harry Styles’ 15 consecutive nights at “The World’s Most Famous Arena.” Styles’ “Love On Tour” residency ran from Aug. 20 through Sept. 21.

The banner was unveiled and presented to Styles by “CBS Mornings” host Gayle King during the encore of the final show at Madison Square Garden. It is one of only four music-related banners – held by just three artists – currently hanging from The Garden’s rafters. And in celebration of this momentous occasion Madison Square Garden made sure every fan in attendance received a feather boa in order to celebrate in true Harry style.

“Selling out 15 consecutive nights at Madison Square Garden is a massive accomplishment and reinforces Harry Styles as one of the most impactful artists of his generation” said Jim Dolan executive chairman and CEO of MSG Entertainment. “It is a testament to Harry and his fans that a banner celebrating this remarkable achievement will hang from the rafters alongside some of the most legendary artists and athletes in history. Harry has already headlined ‘The World’s Most Famous Arena’ several times in his skyrocketing career and we’re honored that MSG was ‘Harry’s House’ for these 15 incredible nights.”

The 15-night run took over New York City and brought fans from all over the world to The Garden. To celebrate the residency Madison Square Garden fully transformed into “Harry’s House” with interactive photo activations placed around the venue for fans to share their best “Love On Tour” styles; custom postcards distributed at each show with various “Harry’s House” designs; and exclusive specialty food and beverage options created specifically for the run. Additionally a “Love On Tour” merch pop-up was set up at MSG throughout the run and was accessible to all fans – regardless of whether they had tickets.

Styles’ activations with Everytown and HeadCount were presented every night at MSG. He will be donating proceeds from the tour with Live Nation matching equaling over $1 million to Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund – the education research and litigation arm of Everytown for Gun Safety the largest gun violence prevention organization in the country. HeadCount the nonpartisan voter-engagement organization were also on site to inspire voter registration status and to vote in this year’s midterm elections.

A press release said “Styles’ critically acclaimed single ‘As It Was’ continues to smash records on the Billboard charts with a 14th week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and a record 15th week atop the Billboard Global 200. The song ties for the fourth-longest reign in Billboard Hot 100 history and the longest-running solo No. 1 song. ‘As It Was’ is also the first song ever to spend its first 24 weeks on the top three positions on the same chart with 23 of the 24 in the top two extending its record. ‘As It Was’ is featured on his Platinum certified album ‘Harry’s House.’ ”

Styles joins only two other musical acts to have banners hanging from The Garden’s rafters: Billy Joel and Phish. Additional banners celebrate MSG legends including Bill Bradley Walt “Clyde” Frazier Adam Graves Rod Gilbert Henrik Lundqvist Mark Messier and Willis Reed.

The MH-60Rs are called the world's most advanced maritime helicopter.

What You Need To Know Over the next few years crews in Owego will begin retrofitting the fleet with anti-submarine anti-surface and search-and-rescue capabilities



The Southern Tier location currently employs more than 2500 people



Work is set to begin in the very near future delivery taking place sometime between 2025 and the early part of 2026

Over the next few years crews at the Owego location will begin retrofitting the fleet which will have anti-submarine anti-surface and search-and-rescue capabilities.

The Southern Tier location currently employs more than 2500 people. Staff said this contract was a key component in keeping jobs local.

While this isn’t the first time Lockheed has sent aircraft overseas it’s one of the larger orders in recent memory.

Work is set to begin in the very near future with the delivery taking place sometime between 2025 and early 2026.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2ZpeGVkLXdpbmcvcmF5dGhlb24tbm9ydGhyb3AtZ3J1bW1hbi1iZWF0LWJvZWluZy1sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJ0aW4taW4taHlwZXJzb25pYy1taXNzaWxlLWNvbnRlc3QvMTUwMzE1LmFydGljbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raytheon-Northrop Grumman beat Boeing Lockheed Martin in hypersonic missile contest,"The US Air Force has selected a joint bid from Raytheon Missiles & Defense and Northrop Grumman to build a new hypersonic weapon.

The Department of Defense (DoD) said on 22 September that the pair won a $958 million contract to produce the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) for the Armament Directorate of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Eglin AFB in Florida.

Raytheon and Northrop beat competing bids from Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

The funding provides for HACM “design development and initial delivery” says a DoD contract announcement.



Raytheon and Northrop confirmed the award on 23 September.

“Raytheon Missiles & Defense continues to be at the forefront of hypersonic weapon and air-breathing technology development” says Wes Kremer president of the Raytheon business.

The company describes the HACM as an air-breathing scramjet-powered munition. Scramjet engines use high flight speeds to forcibly compress incoming air before combustion a process Raytheon says enables sustained flight at hypersonic speeds – generally considered to be Mach 5 or greater.

Hypersonic weapons like HACM can reach their targets faster than similar traditional intercontinental ballistic missiles potentially letting them evade missile-defence systems.

“Our scramjet propulsion technology is ushering in a new era for faster more-survivable and highly capable weapons” Northrop says.

The companies have collaborated since 2019 to integrate Northrop’s scramjet engines into Raytheon’s air-breathing hypersonic weapon designs.



HACM is being developed in conjunction with the Southern Cross Integrated Flight Research Experiment a joint US-Australia project.

The DoD is running several parallel hypersonic weapon development programmes including the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon being produced by Lockheed and the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept an effort funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency that uses a Lockheed hypersonic vehicle and a Aerojet Rocketdyne scramjet.

The Pentagon also announced in August $2 million in grants to support hypersonic research at several US universities.

The bid to develop such platforms comes as military leaders in Washington DC increasingly warn that the USA lags in operational hypersonic capabilities – particularly as rivals like China and Russia claim to have produced hypersonic weapons.

The USA’s top military officer US Army General Mark Milley in October 2021 described a Chinese test of a hypersonic weapon as “very concerning” likening it to the Soviet Union’s surprise launch of the Sputnik satellite which accelerated the Cold War space race.

However Milley has downplayed those weapons’ impact on the war in Ukraine. During recent congressional testimony he described hypersonic weapons as having no “significant or game-changing effect” on that conflict.

While the real-world capability of such weapons remains largely uncertain military strategists caution that the relatively cheap missiles give China a potential advantage over the USA.

Mark Cancian a former US Marine Corps officer and current researcher at the Center for Strategic and International studies is running war games to understand how a conflict over Taiwan might play out. He tells FlightGlobal that US air bases in Japan and Guam and US Navy aircraft carriers will be extremely high-value targets for China in the opening hours of such a conflict.

Hypersonic weapons pose a potentially substantial threat to these assets which Cancian says would be essential to any US-led military campaign near the Taiwan Strait.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3JheXRoZW9uLWJlYXRzLWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1ib2VpbmctdG8td2luLWNvbnRyYWN0L9IBVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3JheXRoZW9uLWJlYXRzLWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1ib2VpbmctdG8td2luLWNvbnRyYWN0Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raytheon ‘Beats’ Lockheed Martin & Boeing To Win Contract To Develop ‘One Of Its Kind’ Hypersonic Cruise Missile,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3JheXRoZW9uLWJlYXRzLWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1ib2VpbmctdG8td2luLWNvbnRyYWN0L9IBVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3JheXRoZW9uLWJlYXRzLWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1ib2VpbmctdG8td2luLWNvbnRyYWN0Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673E5D9ED0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

If you live in a climate that experiences lots of storms and windy weather including tornadoes and hurricanes you may want to consider installing storm windows. According to Brennan Corp storm windows are an external addition to already installed windows with the purpose of preventing storm damage as well as regulating heat and blocking out noise.

Most modern windows are already designed to be energy efficient in the fashion of storm windows but older homes can greatly benefit from the addition of a storm window. Some storm windows are permanent installations and others are temporary. There are lots of different types of storm window materials for both the window and frame. The window can be either glass plastic or even low emissivity or low-e (via Energy.gov). The frame can be aluminum wood or vinyl each with varying pros and cons. Popular home improvement stores like Lowe's and Home Depot both sell a wide variety of storm windows but it can be hard to discern which is a better deal including both price and material.

White and Elsie M. White. Marilyn passed away on September 16 2022 at the age of 86 surrounded by the love and grace of her family. Marilyn suffered from complications from an anoxic brain injury sustained during a medical procedure in April. She fought hard to recover to return to her lifetime passion for teaching piano.

Marilyn attended Knox College in Galesburg Illinois where she received degrees in liberal arts and piano performance. She received her master's degree with distinction in piano from Indiana University Bloomington where she was a student of Menahem Pressler and also studied organ and church music. She excelled in all of her studies receiving top honors awards honorary memberships and fellowships for continuing doctoral studies in music theory. Her love of education continued throughout her life with her most recent college courses in Jazz in the fall 2021 and spring 2022 semesters. She attended First and Calvary Presbyterian Church and later joined Trinity Presbyterian in Springfield.

In Marilyn’s early career she performed professionally as a piano and organ soloist worldwide. She also performed as a pianist with the world-renowned Fine Arts Trio in Columbia Missouri and was an ensemble performer with many college and university faculty members. As a professor she taught at Christian College (now Columbia College) in Columbia Missouri Evangel University and Southwest Missouri State University (now Missouri State University) in Springfield Missouri. She was also active in church music as an organist choir director and handbell choir director.

Marilyn had a deep love for teaching and genuinely loved her students and the teachers she worked with for over 50 years. Marilyn used these experiences and the knowledge she gained through research and teaching to develop and author a non-traditional piano series Music Moves for Piano™ which is a piano method series based on Edwin E. Gordon's Music Learning Theory. Marilyn has successfully used this new teaching approach with her own students since 1992.

Music Moves for Piano™ has received international recognition and has been published translated and used worldwide as a new standard for music education resulting in speaking engagements on the topics of composition improvisation piano pedagogy and audiation at conferences throughout the world including the World Piano Pedagogy Conference the Early Childhood Music & Movement Convention the GIML International Conference the National Conference on Keyboard Pedagogy and the Music Teachers National Association Conference. Most noteworthy she was most recently selected to be the keynote speaker at the 2023 International Conference on Music Learning theory sponsored by the Gordon Institute for Music Learning.

Marilyn was active in many local and state music organizations. She was a founding member of the Springfield Area Arts Council the Springfield Piano Teachers Forum and a member of the Springfield Symphony Orchestra Board of Directors for 14 years. She also served two years as Convention Chair and two years as President for the Missouri Music Teachers Association and was honored by the Missouri Music Teachers Association as the 2007 ""Teacher of the Year."" In the fall of 2008 Andrea Apostoli President of the Italian Gordon Organization ""AIGAM"" presented her with honorary membership in AIGAM for outstanding work in the field of piano pedagogy.

Marilyn was married to Dr. Howard J. Lowe on June 4 1960. She is survived by her son Doug Lowe (wife Melanie) and their three children Jennifer James and Jonathan; son Dr. David Lowe and his three children Matthew Sarah and Lauren; and her twins; Susan Libiez (husband Dave) and their two children Michael and Anna; and William Lowe (fiancée Ashley Brown) and his three children Nicholas (fiancée Olivia Bible) Caroline and Whitney. She is also survived by her brother Dr. Roger White (wife Dr. Marilyn White) and sister Karen Avalos.

She was preceded in death by her husband Dr. Howard J. Lowe brother Dr. David White and the recent passing of her brother Steve White (survived by his wife Dr. Cathy White).

Marilyn was loved by so many as she traveled the world to meet her friends and colleagues and enjoy some of the best fine arts performances in the world. Our family is extremely grateful for the overwhelming amount of kind words and for learning about and reading the amazing stories of the profound impact she had on so many people's lives. It is important to her family to keep her work and legacy alive and to honor her desire to continue to promote and encourage music education and learning.

Those words were hard to hear. They were my daughter’s words of despair when she received the worst news of her life: The baby she was carrying suffered from grave defects. That sweet baby named Lila was diagnosed with gastroschisis a dangerous condition in which her intestines were developing outside her body. She also had only one healthy kidney and her very small size indicated that she might have a fatal genetic anomaly.

And Camille was indeed young: 21 years old. She married her high school sweetheart while she was in college and she got pregnant her senior year. All this sounds unusual especially in an era when Americans are getting married and having children at older ages than ever before but marriage at a relatively young age fit Camille. She was always an old soul and so was her husband. They were mature beyond their years but this moment felt different. The news about Lila was terrifying — crushing actually.

I didn’t really know what to say in response. I knew she’d rise to the occasion but I could see in her eyes that she wasn’t ready for a motivational speech. When you get bad news there are times you don’t need encouragement so much as empathy. All I could think to say was “No one is old enough for this news. There is no right age for this challenge.” We cried we prayed and then we prepared. Our daughter was becoming a mother in the most difficult of circumstances.

And it was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen.

Her first concrete decision as a mom was to refuse amniocentesis. Though she desperately wanted more information about Lila the thought of any additional risk to her baby was too much for her to bear. She’d find out Lila’s true condition when she gave birth; then and only then would we know if she’d live.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS9mb3J0LXdvcnRocy10YWxsZXN0LWJ1aWxkaW5nLXNlbGxzLWp1c3QtMTItM20tYXVjdGlvbi1zdHVubmluZy1wcmljZS1kcm9w0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2ZvcnQtd29ydGhzLXRhbGxlc3QtYnVpbGRpbmctc2VsbHMtanVzdC0xMi0zbS1hdWN0aW9uLXN0dW5uaW5nLXByaWNlLWRyb3AuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fort Worth's tallest building sells for just $12.3M at auction in stunning price drop,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.foxbusiness.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /real-estate/fort-worths-tallest-building-sells-just-12-3m-auction-stunning-price-drop (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EAB5B70>, 'Connection to www.foxbusiness.com timed out.

NEOM

Malcolm Aw said he pulled out of a Neom contract because of alleged Saudi human rights abuses.

The CEO of Solar Water told BI that he had planned to build solar desalination plants.

Human rights campaigners say tribe members are being forcibly evicted to make way for the megacity.

A green energy founder pulled out of a $100 million Neom contract after he realized that the Saudis were bulldozing villages to make way for the megacity.

Malcolm Aw the CEO and founder of Solar Water told Business Insider that he initially got involved with Neom to help realize its ambitions as a pioneering green energy ""eco-city.""

Neom is the centerpiece of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 project to diversify the Saudi economy away from fossil fuels and transform it into a luxury tourism destination and innovation hub.

However Aw said he was so appalled at reports of human rights abuses that he canceled the Neom contract in 2022 despite having already built some of his desalination plants there.

""They just they bulldoze their way right through villages and everything which is just unbelievable"" said Aw.

Aw spoke to BI after BBC News reported that an exiled Saudi colonel said Saudi Arabia authorized the use of lethal force to clear the way for its Neom desert megacity.

Col Rabih Alenezi said he was ordered to evict people living on the land to make way for a part of the project called The Line . The area was mostly populated by the Huwaitat tribe.

The BBC said it was not able to independently verify Alenezi's comments about lethal force.

However satellite images analyzed by the BBC showed three villages including schools and hospitals were destroyed to make way for Neom.

One of the villagers Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti was later reportedly killed by Saudi authorities said the UN.

""What it tried to do is turn the whole province into Dubai or Qatar or something but in doing so they are clearing the people who have been there for years out of the area"" said Aw.

""These people could be such a contribution to this whole development. You know the villages have all been removed.""







Aw who is a descendant of Tiger Balm founder Aw Boon Haw told BI that he had initially been drawn to work on the Neom project because of its commitment to green energy and ecology.

Aw's company uses solar energy for desalination while most desalination plants burn fossil fuels and have been found to pollute oceans. Neom had offered Aw's company Solar Water $100m for exclusive rights to use his technology.

Neom's planners say they want to be an""eco-city"" with the signature project ""The Line"" — a vertical mirrored skyscraper cutting through the desert — running on 100% renewable energy and 95% of the land preserved for nature. They claim to be committed to ""respecting existing communities and cultural heritage within our region.""

But Aw believes the promises are not being fulfilled and planners are performing a U-turn on their original vision for the city.

""What they're doing is not ethical and what they're doing is they're creating an exclusivity to house wealthy people in a wealthy touristic area. But that wasn't the original idea. The idea was to develop a green scenario"" he said.

""The whole idea we came in is to make the place green and for the people the local people the indigenous who have been there for ages for yonks to be able to share into development"" said Aw. ""But then they change course. Suddenly they are totally different from what we expect to do and in doing so they have done a lot of damage.""

Neom declined to comment on Aw's claims. The Saudi embassy in the UK did not respond to a request for comment.

Saudi Arabia has been trying to quell public criticism about its Vision 2030 plans .

Last year BI reported that the crackdown extended to those criticizing the evictions on social media with Fatima al-Shawarbi sentenced to 30 years in prison for speaking out.

The project has been beset by problems in recent months with costs spiraling to an estimated $1 trillion and key projects delayed or cut back. In April Bloomberg reported that Saudi officials were reducing the number of people expected to be living in Neom from around one million to 300000 by 2030. The report also said the length of The Line could be cut from around 100 miles to one mile.

Aw urged planners to stand by their original ethical and ecological vision.

""You know we have the technology to solve the [green energy] problem that people are complaining about today. Absolutely. Absolutely. But there's just not the vision or the ethical commitment"" he said."

Who’s to blame?,"California has long been known as the country’s priciest place to fill up your tank but these days the Golden State is “completely out of whack.”

As gas prices plummeted around the nation in recent weeks California’s price at the pump has rebounded with a vengeance to an average of $5.58 a gallon.

That’s $1.89 more than the national average — the highest price gap in at least 22 years according to a Bay Area News Group analysis of AAA data.

While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drove prices higher around the world California’s perplexing price swing is largely due to the local oil industry experts say which is putting the state on another planet when it comes to gas.

“The commodity price of gasoline in California has gotten completely out of whack” said Severin Borenstein an energy economist at UC Berkeley. “If this holds we’re just starting to see the increase. It’s going to go up even more.”

Average prices in the Bay Area are even higher with San Francisco drivers closing in on $6 a gallon and many commuters are desperately waiting for gas-rebate checks from the state which are set to hit most bank accounts in October. Although fuel costs are still down from their peak in June drivers are contending with nearly seven months of average prices topping $5 a gallon.

“It’s unfair” said Sonya Khvann a single mother of three who was pumping gas in Alameda on Friday. She spends about $800 a month on fuel shuttling around her children. “It’s not like you can change your career overnight” said Khvann a part-time real estate agent. “Not everyone can be in tech.”

Much of California’s high gasoline costs are explainable. The state’s 54-cent gasoline excise tax is among the highest in the country — only Pennsylvania’s is higher. There are also stricter environmental regulations and special fuel blends that prevent rampant smog from accumulating in cities. Altogether fees – including federal taxes which all states pay – tack on roughly $1.20 to the base price of California gasoline.

But the widening gap between what everyone from San Jose to Los Angeles is paying compared to the rest of the country is due to the concentrated nature of California’s oil refineries experts say. Due to the state’s special gas blend California is often termed a “fuel island” because nearly all gas sold in the state is refined locally by a handful of companies including Chevron Marathon Petroleum and PBF Energy. That means mechanical hiccups at refineries can cause major price spikes not seen elsewhere in the country.

Tom Kloza of the Oil Price Information Service said the reduced flow of gas is likely due to refiners bringing equipment offline for maintenance. He said much of the oil industry deferred regularly scheduled maintenance in spring so they could continue reaping record profits during the energy price spike following the Russian invasion.

But it’s hard to get to the bottom of exactly why California’s oil refiners have reduced output now just as prices drop elsewhere. There has been no major refinery outage or catastrophe reported in recent months. Instead experts glean information from oil production reports. “Because of antitrust regulations we don’t know how individual refineries are operating” said Kevin Slagle vice president of the Western States Petroleum Association.

In a statement the California Energy Commission said state refineries are seeing “temporary” production issues that coupled with maintenance activity and “lower-than-normal gasoline inventories” is driving the current price spike over the past four weeks.

The mysterious price surge comes as California Gov. Gavin Newsom has turned up the rhetoric against the oil industry as the Golden State moves to phase out most gas-powered vehicles by 2035 and expand restrictions on drilling. In a statement on Friday Newsom’s office accused fossil fuel companies of “holding families hostage” while touting Sacramento’s plan to send up to $1050 to California families to alleviate the financial pain.

“We’re phasing out the fear of gas prices and ushering in our oil-free future” Newsom’s office added. Related Articles Economy | Good news: The worst could be over for gas prices this spring

Borenstein has spent years studying the gap between California’s gas prices and the national average. He said the unaccounted-for difference which he termed a “mystery surcharge” took off in 2015 when gas prices spiked in the aftermath of a Torrance oil refinery explosion. Before the blast the unexplainable price gap was about 2 cents but afterward it ballooned to over 40 cents and has remained high ever since.

Kloza Borenstein and David Hackett an energy expert at Stillwater Associates said there is no evidence of racketeering among the state’s oil refineries. There is an ongoing probe into gas pricing and oil industry practices in the State Assembly however. Sacramento has a long history of accusing the industry of price-gouging and announcing investigations that yield few results.

Still it is commonly accepted that September has been a bonanza month for California’s oil refiners. “If you’re a (refiner) on the Gulf Coast your gross profit on gasoline is about $6.60 (per barrel of oil). If you’re in Los Angeles it’s about $101” said Kloza. “The difference is incredible.”",,,,,,,,,

Marriott’s long-awaited new 785000-square-foot headquarters opened this summer directly across the street from the garage and was officially dedicated Monday. The headquarters opening followed the opening of the adjacent Marriott Bethesda Downtown hotel in March.

The agreement between the county and the company which took effect Aug. 1 restricts parking in the county-run Woodmont Corner Garage to Marriott employees from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. The garage is open to the public after 6 p.m. on weekdays and all day on weekends. Credit: Dan Schere.

During the hours that the garage is closed to the public there are gates that remain down at the entrances. The gates are lifted during the hours it is open to the public and drivers pay at a kiosk using their license plate number.

Area restaurateur Jeff Black whose restaurant Black’s Bar and Kitchen abuts the Woodmont garage said the arrangement with Marriott makes no sense.

“This is a public parking garage. It’s being used for private interest. And yes it’s impacting my business. It’s destroying my happy hour which is one of the things that’s been carrying me through the pandemic” he told Bethesda Beat on Tuesday.

Marriott’s former longtime headquarters was on Fernwood Road but with the lease expiring this year the company decided several years ago to relocate. County officials urged the hotel giant to remain in the county and in October 2016 Marriott announced it would build a new headquarters in downtown Bethesda.

As part of an incentives package the county promised Marriott it would supply 1200 parking spaces downtown. Additionally the state and county each agreed to provide Marriott with $22 million in economic development funds Bethesda Beat reported at the time.

In April 2017 the county reached an agreement with Marriott that allowed the company to use the Woodmont Avenue garage on weekdays according to Montgomery County Department of Transportation spokeswoman Emily DeTitta. The effort was led by then-County Executive Ike Leggett but ultimately approved by the County Council she wrote in an email to Bethesda Beat this week.

In December 2017 the county’s planning board approved the Marriott project.

Black said he has had to deal with multiple hardships at his Bethesda restaurant since construction on the new headquarters started four years ago.

“We’ve endured the noise the grinding the dynamite the [dump] trucks … . It’s been like we’re at war. And we’ve tolerated it because we all want Marriott to come in” he said.

Black called the agreement with Marriott “corporate welfare on steroids” and said it’s particularly unfair because no alternative option for parking was made available.

“I’ve been here for 23 years. I’ve been paying taxes employing people buying alcohol from the county doing all the right things. The reason people are being so [giving] to Marriott is because it’s gonna bring jobs. Well I’ve always brought jobs. Where’s my consideration?” he said.

In a statement to Bethesda Beat on Friday Marriott wrote that it understands that the “community is adjusting to Marriott’s leasing of Garage 11.” Silver Spring man faces child pornography distribution charge

“We are committed to being good neighbors and will remain in regular contact with Montgomery County as we evaluate our associates’ use of the garage both near and long term and the needs of others in the community” the company said.

DeTitta noted in her email that there are four other public parking garages within a couple blocks of the area where the Woodmont garage is.

“Over a period of years Marriott estimates a reduced need for parking due to Bethesda having a strong transportation network. Each year Marriott has the ability to give up some of its parking spaces and consequently reduce its payment” she wrote.

Gene Wilkes owner of the Tastee Diner across the street from the garage and next to the new headquarters told Bethesda Beat on Wednesday that the Marriott agreement is yet another example of how the county has made it difficult for small businesses to survive.

“This is a garage that was constructed with tax dollars that we all contributed our tax dollars to. And then they give it to a single user?” he said.

Wilkes said he remembers that county officials had discussions with small business owners in Bethesda at the time but doesn’t think the dialogue was constructive.

“I went to several meetings that we [as business owners] initiated and we got nowhere. We said ‘Well for goodness sake if you’re gonna provide a public garage why don’t you give them the one over where Chevy Chase Cars is at on the other side of Wisconsin Avenue?’ ” he said.

Wilkes said he remembers being told that Marriott didn’t want its employees crossing Wisconsin Avenue to get to work for safety reasons.

Ultimately nothing positive came out of the deal for small business owners Wilkes said. The diner he said is rebounding from its struggles during the pandemic but that recovery is hampered by customers’ inability to find parking close by.

“[The county’s] catering to large business. We all got ripped off” he said. “And parking is almost impossible now. Our weekends are coming back but our weekdays are terrible. Because people will call and say ‘Can I get an order to go? I’ve circled the block three times I can’t get a parking spot.’ ”

Wilkes agreed with Black that the county needs to better serve its small businesses.

“If Marriott can get the whole garage could Jeff Black get three or four [parking] meters in front of his restaurant? Could I get three or four meters in front of my restaurant for the exclusive use of the Tastee Diner? That’ll never happen but I mean that’s what we did for Marriott” he said.

Beth Aberg owner of Random Harvest Home Furnishings at 7766 Woodmont Ave. near the garage wrote in an email to Bethesda Beat on Thursday that working conditions have been “horrible” for the last couple of years due to the headquarters construction.

“It’s even worse now as they added the bike lane at Marriott’s insistence took away the parking garage and left only five spaces on the street that are usually taken by their employees staying all day” Aberg wrote.

“In addition there is no loading zone for businesses so our delivery trucks have nowhere to park to load and unload furniture. Because of this we will be giving up that location in the near future and I can tell you the landlord is having a difficult time finding a new tenant because of the parking situation.”

Mark Bucher owner of the local Medium Rare steakhouse chain which has a location near the Woodmont Avenue garage said he doesn’t have a problem with Marriott’s use of the garage. But he is worried about parking overall because of the county’s continuation of the outdoor streeteries – streets that have been closed to traffic since the start of the pandemic in order to make room for outdoor seating. The closed streets include Norfolk Avenue near Bucher’s restaurant.

“Marriott’s great. I’m thrilled that Marriott’s in Bethesda. Don’t get me wrong. They did the right thing by offering up the parking. I’m not upset with that as much as I’m upset with them renewing the streeteries” he said.

The loss of parking caused by the streeteries combined with the lack of availability in the Woodmont garage could hurt some businesses he said.

“I wish when they renewed the streeteries … they would have asked restaurateurs about it and … they didn’t think about losing this entire parking garage. So I think it’s tough” he said.

As to the Marriott agreement DeTitta says county transportation officials discussed the arrangement with the Bethesda business community prior to its approval in 2017.

“As Marriott approached occupancy of their headquarters MCDOT did let the community know of the change by posting notices and flyering vehicles” she wrote. “We also partnered with the Bethesda Urban Partnership (BUP) and the [Bethesda-Chevy Chase] Regional Service Center before Marriott came in to boost awareness of the change and promote alternative parking options to local businesses and community members.”

Allie Williams president and CEO of the Greater Bethesda Chamber of Commerce told Bethesda Beat on Tuesday that businesses had been notified before the new agreement took effect. Additionally the chamber has been talking about it since the spring he said.

“People knew it was coming and it was a phase-in as it was happening. So really [there are] no frustrations that I’ve heard and nothing that caught anybody by surprise” he said.

Set in a 19th-century building on the western shore of the storied destination the Lake Como Edition will be a short drive from Central Milan. It will offer 145 guest rooms (including two penthouse suites) a lobby bar floating pool and a variety of restaurants and bars to enjoy during downtime. Overlooking Italy’s third largest lake the property also includes breathtaking views of the Bellagio mountains.

Edition’s parent company Marriott International made a deal with Bain Capital and Omnam Group who will own and develop the hotel through a fund managed by investment management company Kyralos SGR.

“We are excited to work with Bain Capital Credit and Omnam Group to introduce the Edition Hotels brand to one of Italy’s most beautiful destinations” says Josh Fluhr senior vice president and managing director Edition Hotels Marriott International in a statement. The opening of the new hotel is expected to strengthen Marriott International’s European portfolio of properties which currently includes more than 719 properties across 25 hotel brands.

“There is an incredible opportunity for hotel investments in Italy not only in large tourist destinations like Rome and Milan but in specific locations that have a strong appeal for guests that look for high quality services and unique experiences” said Paolo Bottelli CEO of Kryalos SGR.

As time goes on more industries are realizing the capabilities and benefits these advancements bring.

Digital assistants like Alexa and Siri have consumers wondering why the same capabilities can't be used at work. While there are enterprise versions of Alexa and Cortana conversational AI is still not at a point where a user can ask any question and receive a coherent answer. Like most other types of AI the best use cases are narrow as opposed to broad.

The level of risk associated with conversational AI also comes into play. For example if Alexa or Siri makes a mistake in a consumer context that mistake will likely be mildly annoying if not laughable. In a business setting however the stakes go up because the AI's accuracy impacts a brand's perceived quality.

""Most chatbots are tailored to connect to just one particular service such as news food hotel reservations weather information or flight bookings"" said Adnan Masood chief AI architect at digital technology services provider UST. ""Multipurpose bots are being developed to accomplish multiple tasks with the same interface.""

However current challenges include support for multimodality in dialog systems the ability to process and understand visual dialogs data-efficient dialog model learning (learning from smaller data sets) the use of knowledge graphs and collaboration with IoT devices to maintain context.

""The next generation of conversational AI systems will address multiple ethical and technical challenges associated with general conversational AI systems including bias safety multi-turn context consistency knowledge management and synthesis"" said Masood.

Conversational AI continues to advance

Conversational AI examples in vertical markets Within financial services Wings Financial Credit Union uses conversational AI to authenticate members. The company uses Nuance Gatekeeper an AI-enabled biometrics platform that can verify members in as little as 0.5 seconds with a 99% authentication success rate. The platform considers more than a thousand physical and behavioral factors unique to each person. As a result member accounts are more secure. ""Conversational AI has had huge successes in financial services but also experienced challenges. Success has always come in two places: FAQs that require generic answers or when an answer is completely fulfilled and personalized"" said Wayne Butterfield a partner with ISG automation a unit of global technology research and advisory firm ISG. ""The industry has struggled with anything outside of these two types of queries."" Health insurance companies like Humana also need better ways to address customer queries. In working with IBM Humana developed an IBM Watson-based voice agent that can provide faster friendlier and more consistent support for administrative staff at healthcare providers. The solution relies on conversational AI to understand the intent of a provider's call verify they are permitted to access the system and member information and determine how best to provide the information requested. Similarly just as the healthcare sector at large benefited from AI during the pandemic CVS worked with IBM Consulting to use Watson Assistant for handling a tenfold spike in call volume as the US rolled out its COVID-19 vaccination program. ""One of the biggest trends to emerge was the active role patients played in their own healthcare but pharma companies didn't want their customers -- healthcare providers and patients -- seeking product information on Twitter or TikTok"" said Alisa Hummings senior director and global head of medical information services at IQVIA a healthcare intelligence company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL25ldy1qZXJzZXkvaGlsbHNib3JvdWdoL2hpbGxzYm9yb3VnaC1nZW5lcmFsLWVsZWN0aW9uLTIwMjItam9obi1qLWNpY2NhcmVsbGnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hillsborough General Election 2022: John J.

Are you running for office in Hillsborough? Contact Alexis Tarrazi at alexis.tarrazi@patch.com for information on being featured in a candidate's profile and submitting campaign announcements to Hillsborough Patch. (All of the candidates were given the same questions)

John Ciccarelli Age: 56

Town of residence: Hillsborough New Jersey since 1999. Position sought: Township Committee

Party Affiliation: Republican Family: Married to my wife of 25 years Kim (Demko) Ciccarelli. She was born and raised in Hillsborough and is a teacher’s aide at the Whiton Elementary School in Branchburg. Together we raised two daughters who went through the Hillsborough Township School District with Sydney working as a Park Ranger in Utah and Alexa studying psychology at Coastal Carolina University in South Carolina. Education: I am a graduate of the University of Delaware with a B.S. in Civil Engineering and also have an M.B.A. with a Real Estate Concentration from Rutgers University. In addition I am a licensed Professional Engineer in New Jersey (current) and am a Certified Cost Professional and Planning & Scheduling Professional issued by the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering International (AACE). Occupation: I am currently a Director in the Construction Advisory Services practice at J.S. Held LLC and have more than 30 years of experience performing expert dispute resolution consulting and project advisory services for clients in the engineering and construction industries globally. I have prior experience performing this line of work at several firms including Marsh & McLennan Deloitte and the Port Authority of NY & NJ. Previous or current elected appointed office: Hillsborough Township Planning Board the Master Plan Sub-Committee and Open Space Advisory Board.

Campaign website: hillsboroughnjgop.com/candidates Why are you seeking to run for Township Committee? Hillsborough has given so much to me and my family over the years and stepping up for this servant leadership role is a way for me to continue giving back to the community. Ever since I started volunteering for the township I have been guided by the municipal legal and administrative processes and the business-like approach exhibited by the Township Committee. I seek to leverage my technical expertise business acumen and practicality to the Township Committee and to the community including the continued emphasis on strong fiscal policies open space/farmland preservation and infrastructure improvements. As a husband father and former President and current board member of the Hillsborough Soccer Club I want to ensure that Hillsborough stays as one of the Best Towns to Live in America! Do you feel overdevelopment is an issue in town? How would you like to address it? Yes. “Overdevelopment” driven by the State’s affordable housing mandates is an ongoing issue because Hillsborough is a very desirable place to live. As has been explained in the past the State has mandated that Hillsborough build a negotiated amount of affordable housing by 2025 and if we do not the courts will strip us of our planning controls. I plan to address the risk of overdevelopment by emphasizing that we must continue expanding our already extensive open space (almost 40%) and continue lobbying our NJ Legislature representatives in the State Senate and in the Assembly to address the affordable housing mandate crisis by passing meaningful legislation reforms. My background as a Professional Engineer and industry leader includes experience lobbying in Washington D.C. to secure support for infrastructure programs. I will require developers to meet the requirements in our zoning ordinances. Community members often suggest that the township should force builders to pay for roads schools or other improvements however the State considers this “pay to play” and illegal. As such I will address the risk of overdevelopment with the legal and administrative tools available to develop the township smartly considering the goals and objectives of the Master Plan to protect the public health safety and welfare of Hillsborough’s residents.

What other issues do you feel need to be tackled in town? Other issues that must be tackled in town include: continue the business-like approach to government and maintaining strong fiscal policies (to maintain the tax rate and attract businesses); expand the social and recreational opportunities for senior citizens (like developing a Senior and Community Center); and implementation of the township’s road paving plan. My skills and background as a leader in the engineering construction and business consulting industries is well suited to help address these issues for the well-being and safety of Hillsborough. What sets you apart from the challenging candidates? I am humbled and honored to be one of the candidates endorsed by the Hillsborough Republicans as they recognized my combined understanding of government and private sector experience with my background as a Professional Engineer and leader in Hillsborough sports programs engineering construction and business. Those who have worked with me know that I take a sensible approach to any challenges ask tough questions and put in the time and effort to achieve results. As a servant leader and representative of the residents of Hillsborough I will expect the same of each person that I engage with while working for the township. While I have no doubt that I have a lot to learn from the existing township committee members and professionals I am also confident that these combined skills will allow me to seamlessly transition to the township committee and make impactful contributions for the citizens of Hillsborough.

What else would you like to share about yourself or your campaign? I grew up in Roxbury NJ and drove through Hillsborough numerous times on my way to school at the University of Delaware in the late 80’s. Now ironically I live a couple hundred feet from the route taken when the Promenade was a sheep farm. I enjoy watching sports of all kinds and spent years coaching and watching my daughters participate in soccer lacrosse track and cheerleading with the Hillsborough Township Recreation Hillsborough Soccer Club Jr. Raiders and High School programs. Being from Northern NJ my allegiance has primarily been to New York teams especially as a diehard Yankee fan. Professionally I am also a recognized industry leader and have served for more than 15 years on the Board of Directors for not-for-profit organizations including professional educational and Hillsborough. I look forward to using these skills to represent the citizens of Hillsborough and will focus on low municipal taxes and fiscal responsibility sustainable infrastructure expanding our extensive open space maintaining public safety and enhancing community services for the youth senior citizens and all residents of our diverse town. My wife and I raised our family in Hillsborough and made memories to last a lifetime. I am running to serve my family friends neighbors and all current residents as well as future families of Hillsborough to ensure that they have the same opportunity to make the same great memories that we did.",,,,,,,,,

MA,Mastercard,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL2hvdy13b3VsZC10aGUtY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtY29tcGV0aXRpb24tYWN0LWltcGFjdC12L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Would the Credit Card Competition Act Impact Visa and Mastercard?,"Congress recently proposed a bill that could cost Visa and Mastercard billions. Here's what you should know.

Credit card companies have come under increasing scrutiny from the federal government and Congress recently proposed a bill to increase competition in credit card processing networks. The goal is to lower transaction fees saving merchants and consumers money.

The move would be particularly meaningful for Visa (V 0.79%) and Mastercard (MA 0.33%) the world's two largest credit card processors. Here's what's in the bill and what it might mean for their bottom lines.

The Credit Card Competition Act

According to research from Ascent credit card processing fees for merchants range from 1.15% plus $0.05 to 3.15% plus $0.10 in interchange fees plus another 0.14% to 0.17% in assessment fees. These are fees paid to the card's issuing bank the card's payment network and the payment processor.

To reduce these fees Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Roger Marshall (R-KS) introduced a bill that looks to open up the payment processing market and increase competition. The bill is called the ""Credit Card Competition Act of 2022."" The bill would require banks with more than $100 billion in assets to process electronic credit transactions on no fewer than two affiliated networks one of which must be outside of Visa's or Mastercard's network. Supporters say the bill would save consumers money while increasing competition breaking up the dominance that Visa and Mastercard enjoy. Several organizations have come out in support of the bill.

""Processing credit card transactions should not be limited to two companies when there are a dozen that can do the job just as well"" said Leon Buck vice president for government relations banking and financial services at the National Retail Federation. ""Routing choice has saved retailers and their customers billions in the debit card market and can do even more in the much-larger credit card market.""

The National Association of Convenience Stores has also come out in favor of the bill saying that the average ""swipe fee"" of 2.25% is seven times the amount retailers in Europe pay and five times more than those in China. According to Christine Pollack vice president government relations at The Food Industry Association the hidden processing fees cost the average U.S. family $900 per year.

Here's what Visa and Mastercard have to say about the proposed bill

Visa and Mastercard account for 83% of the general-purpose cards and charged $77 billion in merchant fees last year alone. These fees include interchange or swipe fees which partner banks earn and network fees that credit card companies make.

The companies have pushed back on the legislation. According to Vasant Prabhu chief financial officer at Visa there is already a lot of competition in the market. He says that most Americans carry multiple credit cards like American Express Mastercard and other types of co-branded cards.

One of Prabhu's concerns is that the payment infrastructure for credit cards isn't ready for multiple networks and there would be a cost of reissuing cards and upgrading technology to accomplish this. He said the bill would also hurt consumers because it could lead to the demise of customer loyalty programs. This would ultimately hurt co-branded credit cards issued by airlines or retailers that may have to scale back their rewards to customers for using their credit cards.

Craig Vosburg chief product officer for Mastercard also voiced concerns about the safety and security of routing transactions through different networks. Vosburg said merchants could choose the cheapest networks that may not have the best security measures to protect consumers. Mastercard Chief Executive Officer Michael Miebach said that other payment processors hadn't made the same investments as Visa and Mastercard in the safety and security of their networks.

The bottom line

According to Doug Kantor chief counsel at the National Association of Convenience Stores the move could reduce swipe fees by $11 billion or more annually.

With competition heating up in the payments industry additional regulation would make it difficult for Visa and Mastercard to replicate the success they've had during the past decade. The credit card giants have enjoyed healthy profit margins over the years. If more payments get processed through alternative networks Visa and Mastercard could see their margins come under pressure. The bill would also impact banks and credit unions that rely on interchange fees for their co-branded payment products.

Where the proposed bill goes from here

With credit cards growing in popularity it's not surprising to see lawmakers putting the industry under the microscope. The Credit Card Competition Act has been referred to the Senate Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs but has not yet been placed on the committee's calendar.

Most legislative analysts don't see the bill becoming law during this congressional session which ends Jan. 3.

Brandon Bell/Getty Images

AGs from 24 states sent a letter threatening to take action over a new merchant code for gun stores.

The move follows the International Organization for Standardization's recent vote to create the code.

All three credit-card companies recently said they have adopted the standard.

The Republican attorneys general of 24 states are threatening to ""marshal the full scope of our lawful authority"" as Visa American Express and Mastercard adopt a new merchant category code recently created for gun and ammunition stores.

The AGs sent a letter Tuesday to the CEOs of American Express Mastercard and Visa. The letter was led by the attorneys general of Tennessee and Montana. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the story.

All three payment processors have adopted the code NPR reported.

The attorneys general warned that tracking the data could lead to misuse whether intentional or unintentional. ""Creating and tracking this data only matters if your institutions are considering using that information to take further harmful action—like infringing upon consumer privacy inhibiting constitutionally protected purchases by selectively restricting the use of your payment systems or otherwise withholding your financial services from targeted ""disfavored"" merchants.""

They said using a merchant code for gun stores would be an inaccurate method for keeping track of firearms purchases. ""This categorization would not recognize the difference for example between the purchase of a gun safe and a firearm. Nor would it capture firearm purchases made at department stores resulting in arbitrarily disparate treatment of ""gun store"" merchants and consumers.""

The coordinated move came after the Geneva-based nonprofit International Organization for Standardization (ISO) approved the creation of the merchant code earlier this month. A spokesperson for the National Rifle Association told Insider the vote was ""nothing more than a capitulation to anti-gun politicians and activists bent on eroding the rights of law-abiding Americans one transaction at a time.""

Gun rights advocates including the NRA have expressed concerns that the new merchant category code would effectively create a gun registry and put gun owners at risk.

This would ""create the obvious risk that law-abiding consumers' information will be leaked discovered hacked or otherwise obtained and misused by those who oppose Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights"" per the letter.

Visa referred Insider to a statement it issued on Sept. 13 a few days after the ISO decision: ""Many misunderstand what that means and are in turn advocating the use of MCCs to ""track"" gun sales as a potential tool in combatting gun violence"" Visa wrote. ""That's not what merchant codes are designed for nor should they be. MCCs already exist for hundreds of different businesses including beauty salons bookstores newsstands bowling alleys and bakeries among many others.""

The company said that when Visa and other payment networks process a transaction they don't have visibility over the items consumers buy.

In a separate statement to Insider Mastercard said it ""respects individuals' right to transact privately with others"" and that the creation of the merchant code would not cause the company to deviate from its principles ""Quite simply we allow lawful purchases on the network. This ensures the application of a clear consistent and reliable standard upon which consumers businesses and governments across the world can understand and rely.""

American Express did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

LONDON – A climate change activist disrupted play at the Laver Cup on Friday in dramatic fashion when he ran on to the court and set himself on fire.

The protestor – who was wearing a T-shirt that read ""END UK PRIVATE JETS"" – ran onto the middle of the court mid-way through Stefanos Tsitsipas' 6-2 6-1 win over Diego Schwartzman.

He then sat down by the net and appeared to pour lighter fluid on his right arm before setting it alight. The fluid also spilled onto the ground and caught on fire.

The most important one -- and the through line for Davis Love III's squad -- is a twosome that finished first on Saturday afternoon and will take a perfect record into Sunday's singles matches.

Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth played 64 holes over the first four sessions at Quail Hollow Golf Club and trailed after just two of them. In fact the duo was 4 UP for as many holes (2) as it trailed and it was 3 UP or better for more holes than it trailed or was tied. That's difficult to do across any series of matches but even more so against a handful of the best players in the world.

Spieth chipped in against Hideki Matsuyama and Taylor Pendrith on Saturday afternoon to touch off a 2-0-0 day that started nine hours earlier when the twosome went out against Sungjae Im and Corey Conners in foursomes. They won both matches 4 and 3 and at the time they finished their afternoon match had won as many points (4) as the entire International team which is made up of the best players from every country of the world outside of Europe.

Their point in the afternoon session is the only one the Americans were able to secure. It was a big one -- 11-7 is a lot different than 10-8 -- especially with the horses the U.S. can send out early in the singles matches.

Incredibly Thomas ran his team play record to 16-4-3 in Presidents Cups and Ryder Cups and his rip-roaring club-twirling show remains the epicenter of all U.S. teams no matter the event. Still it was Spieth who picked him up in the afternoon with six birdies including that closing chip in which he had caddie Michael Greller pull the stick and put it right in the middle of the cup.

It gets a bit lost because the ""these guys are best friends"" rhetoric (and subsequent mockery of that easy narrative) drowns out everything else but Spieth and Thomas have been awesome together in team events. They went 3-1-0 at the 2018 Ryder Cup 1-1-0 at last year's Ryder Cup and then 4-0-0 this time around at Quail Hollow which makes their overall team match play record 8-2-0. Their only team losses together are to Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood at the 2018 Ryder Cup and to Jon Rahm and Sergio Garcia at the 2021 Ryder Cup.

You can point to any number of advantages the U.S. enjoys at the Presidents Cup -- better overall players more length off the tee a course where they thrive -- but I keep coming back to this duo and its importance to the vitality of the U.S team. There's nothing like having a pairing you can send out at any time against any competition and be assured that you're going to get a war (and probably a point). Spieth and Thomas are those guys on this team and they held the rope on a Saturday when the other 10 Americans certainly needed it.

Here is a breakdown of each match from the four-ball session on Day 3 of the 2022 Presidents Cup.

2022 Presidents Cup scores results

USA: 11 | Internationals: 7

Day 3 -- Four-ball: Internationals 3 | USA 1

Match United States Tee time International 1 Patrick Cantlay & Xander Schauffele WIN 1 UP Tom Kim & Si Woo Kim 2 Jordan Spieth & Justin Thomas WIN 4&3 Taylor Pendrith & Hideki Matsuyama 3 Tony Finau & Kevin Kisner WIN 3&2 Sungjae Im & Sebastian Munoz 4 Billy Horschel & Sam Burns WIN 1 UP Adam Scott & Cam Davis

Day 3 -- Foursomes: USA 2 | Internationals: 2

Match United States Tee time International 1 Jordan Spieth & Justin Thomas Win 4&3

Sungjae Im & Corey Conners 2 Cameron Young & Collin Morikawa Win 3&2

Adam Scott & Hideki Matsuyama 3 Scottie Scheffler & Sam Burns Win 2&1 K.H. Lee & Tom Kim 4 Tony Finau & Max Homa Win 4&3

Si Woo Kim & Cam Davis

Match 1: Kim/Kim 1 UP over Cantlay/Schauffele

It was the match of the day and perhaps the match of the 2022 Presidents Cup as the Kim and Kim duo was electric from the word ""go"". Raising the roof and pumping up the crowd on the first tee the South Korean tandem was able to hold its own against the American powerhouse of Schauffele and Cantlay.

The two teams traded birdies for most of the front nine. A mental mistake from the internationals on the par-3 10th saw the U.S. lead extend to 2 UP but was quickly rectified with an eagle on the par-4 11th – Tom's second of the day on that hole.

They kept their foot on the gas and after exchanging birdies on the par-5 12th finally tied the match when Si Woo connected from 22 feet for another birdie on No. 13. Tom was set up to take control of the match a couple holes later but he was upended when Schauffele converted an unlikely birdie attempt from off the green to retake the lead.

The American edge was short-lived as the internationals won No. 16 to draw even yet again. While the stage was taken from Kim on 15 it was his and his alone on the 18th green as the 20-year-old Korean connected from 10 feet to secure an all too crucial full point for the internationals.

Match 2: Spieth/Thomas 4&3 over Matsuyama/Pendrith

Expect anything different? At the start it felt as if vintage Hideki was going to be present after he stuck his approach shots on the first two holes. Converting the first he failed to connect on No. 2 and instead saw Spieth take the hole from him and Pendrith. The putter was ultimately Matsuyama's downfall as he received little-to-no help from his Canadian counterpart.

Four birdies from Spieth and Thomas on the front nine was enough to command a 3 UP lead after the front nine. Steady golf from fended off any thought of a comeback from there as this group closed out their match on No. 15 -- just as they did in the morning session. The partnership improved to 4-0-0 on the week.

Match 3: Im/Munoz 3&2 over Finau/Kisner

If the internationals fall short this week Immelman may hang his head wondering why he did not play this duo in foursomes. After tying Burns and Scheffler on Friday Im and Munoz were at it again on Saturday.

Grabbing the lead with a Munoz birdie on the par-3 fourth the two were in constant control of this one. Kisner was not a ton of help throughout the afternoon but did contribute an eagle on the par-5 seventh to draw square.

Im added birdies on the par-4 eighth and the par-4 11th to grab a 2 UP lead and Munoz broke the backs of the U.S. with one of his own on the 13th. A couple exchanges later and the internationals closed the match out on 16. Im and Munoz played their 34 holes of four-ball together in 18 under.

Match 4: Scott/Davis 1 UP over Burns/Horschel

After shedding the partnership of Scheffler Burns was a man possessed alongside Horschel. The men who played the Zurich Classic and QBE Shootout together looked right at home next to each other with Burns taking the lead. The LSU product carded three birdies on his front nine and had the Americans tied heading into the homeward half. Burns added birdies on 11 12 and 14 to finally grab a 1 UP lead over the Australian pair.

Horschel had an opportunity to double the margin on the 15th but was unable to capitalize. This left the door open for the internationals who stepped right on through with an eagle from Davis on the par-5 16th to draw even and a birdie from his blade on 17 to grab their first lead of the match. He added another on the last to play his final three holes in 4 under and make this Presidents Cup a legitimate contest heading into Sunday singles as the U.S. lead has been trimmed to 11-7.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhZGlvdGltZXMuY29tL3R2L3Nwb3J0L2Zvb3RiYWxsL3NpZGVtZW4tY2hhcml0eS1tYXRjaC0yMDIyLXR2LWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sidemen Charity Match on TV 2022: Live stream channel teams and players,"KSI is the most prominent member of the group and will lead Sidemen FC into battle this weekend at The Valley – home of Charlton Athletic.

Mr McCormick's decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Mr Swinney as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down.

Mr Yousaf said he was resigning last week after he decided to end the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Green Party.

Reports of a contest began early on Sunday when Mr McCormick said he had secured the 100 nominations from 20 branches needed to run against Mr Swinney.

But in a statement shared with Sky News the party activist said he had had a ""lengthy and fruitful conversation"" with Mr Swinney adding he had ""met the threshold set by the party rules"".

""John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months"" he said.

""This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver Independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

""I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney's nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.""

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

Who is John Swinney?

What direction will the SNP take?

Earlier on Sunday Mr Swinney warned potential challengers from entering the race saying it would delay the party from ""rebuilding"".

""My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP. I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence"" he told Sky's Trevor Phillips.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

""So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we've had under my leadership and bluntly I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I can do because every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding and I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do."""

McDonald’s is being sued for $10 billion by a media company for allegations of “racial stereotyping” by not advertising with Black-owned media companies according to a press release from Allen Media Group the company suing the fast food chain.

The news: On Sept. 19 U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin from Los Angeles ruled that Byron Allen — of Allen Media Group — could attempt to prove that McDonald’s has violated Californian civil rights laws by refusing to use his networks for advertising.

The judge concluded that Allen has reasonable evidence to prove his claims and will allow him to continue pursuing the lawsuit.

Allen claims that McDonald’s has placed his studio into an “African-American tier” with a separate ad agency that uses a smaller budget per Reuters.

McDonald’s response: Loretta Lynch the fast-food chain’s lawyer states that Allen doesn’t have the evidence to prove these claims according to CNN.

“Their complaint is about revenue not race and plaintiffs’ groundless allegations ignore both McDonald’s legitimate business reasons for not investing more on their channels and the company’s long-standing business relationships with many other diverse-owned partners” Lynch said.

Details: In a statement Allen claims that 40% of fast food customers are Black however McDonald’s spent 0.3% of its $1.6 billion advertising budget on Black-owned media in 2019.

Allen says that the case is “about economic inclusion of African American-owned businesses in the U.S. economy. McDonald’s takes billions from African American consumers and gives almost nothing back.”

About Allen Media Group: Based out of Los Angeles Allen Media Group owns 10 television networks including the Weather Channel and 43 broadcast and cable television programs according to their website."

The RUSH and Medtronic Digestive Diseases Innovation Hub will focus heavily on trialing new technologies for care while improving existing treatment options. For example the Innovation Hub will look to provide cloud enablement within the endoscopy suite.

“We are pleased to continue our collaboration with Medtronic with the rollout of the RUSH and Medtronic Digestive Diseases Innovation Hub which will create endless research opportunities that will truly improve patient outcomes” said Irving Waxman MD director of the Digestive Diseases service line at RUSH. “I am very excited to see where this will lead and how it will help our patients in the future.”

The Innovation Hub could provide a unique opportunity to physicians in RUSH’s GI fellowship program to learn about the latest technology and treatment advances while working with some of the top minds in GI from Medtronic in addition to those at RUSH.

“The educational opportunities for our fellows at RUSH have always been plentiful but including members of Medtronic in our training will further set our program apart” said Michael Brown MD director of the gastroenterology and hepatology fellowship program at RUSH. “Fellows will have the ability to hear and learn from two leading institutions all in one place.”

The partnership comes after RUSH’s rollout of Medtronic’s GI Genius™ intelligent endoscopy system which helps detect colorectal polyps of varying shapes and sizes and alerts gastroenterologists to their presence in real time. The artificial intelligence can increase the adenoma detection rate (ADR) of colorectal polyps by as much as 14.4%.

New research and training opportunities along with innovations such as the use of AI technology set RUSH apart as a leader among the country’s best institutions. U.S. News & World Report ranked RUSH University Medical Center among the best in the nation for gastroenterology and GI surgery. The hospital also earned a top ranking for cancer and high performing status for colon cancer surgery.

As board vice chair at $4.4 billion asset TruStone Financial Credit Union in Plymouth Minn. Crane is one of the youngest people to serve in an executive capacity on that board.

After graduating with a law degree in 2012 he joined medical device company Medtronic as manager global contracts for clinical study administration.

To satisfy his passion for service Crane joined the board of Firefly Credit Union in 2016 and later helped it merge with TruStone Financial where he directs the compensation committee among other duties.

In his younger years Crane played organized sports and knows what it feels like to be part of a winning team. He was a member of the St. John’s University football team as well as a national champion in Australian Rules Football with the Minnesota Freeze.

“We were all focused on a particular goal and worked together to achieve it” he says. “That same drive is evident in the cooperative spirit of the credit union industry. We collaborate whenever possible to deliver on our mission of service.”

From 2020 to 2021 he helped lead TruStone Financial through some big changes including the merger with Firefly. These two complex institutions—each approaching $1.5 billion in assets—successfully merged in a little over a year during the height of the pandemic.

“When a lot of things are happening at once you want Kevin on your side” says James Sackett TruStone Financial’s board treasurer. “Kevin has long had a skill to quickly and effectively navigate just about any situation no matter how big complex and impactful.”

TruStone Financial’s mission is to engage educate and inspire members to achieve lifelong financial well-being.

“It’s truly rewarding to serve as a volunteer to enact the democratic principles and representative aspect of the credit union’s board” says Crane. “We are all working together as a team to execute on the engagement and education of our members.”

Crane is always looking for ways to enhance the member experience.

“We’re doing that with technology partnering with some truly innovative fintechs” he says. “We’re also not forgetting the personal touch and we put considerable time and energy into developing our employees. Ultimately it’s our people who deliver our personal touch.

Remembering our roots as a community-first organization and sticking to our mission vision and core values is how we do it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjNibG1lZGlhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2VtcGxveWVlcy1yZXBvcnQtdGhleXJlLXNhZmUtYW5kLW5vdy1icmluZ2luZy1wdWVydG8tcmljby1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWJhY2stb25saW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Employees report they're safe and now bringing Puerto Rico p,"Employees Report They’re Safe and Now Bringing Puerto Rico Production Back Online

Lessons learned after Maria are helping in the wake of Hurricane Fiona

Sep 23 2022 1:30 PM ET

Employees report they’re safe and now bringing Puerto Rico production back onli…

The power remains out in most of Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Fiona but all Medtronic operations are coming back online anyway.

“All shifts at all sites resumed operations Tuesday morning” said Carlos Rodriguez Senior Manufacturing Director. “Fiona caused some water in a couple of our facilities but we have them under control. And we do not have any major equipment issues. Everything is up and running.”

Medtronic is reaching out to all employees to make sure they’re safe and supported. The company has already reached 98 percent of employees and continues to work to contact the rest. Two thirds of employees made it to work for the first shift on Tuesday and more arrived Wednesday. Those who couldn’t are dealing with emergencies at home such as no power or water. ”We’re doing everything we can to help them” Rodriguez said.

Schools are closed throughout the island and that’s also causing daycare issues for working parents. Several employees report having problems finding enough gasoline to power their home generators and Medtronic is looking into how to help them as well. The company is also providing onsite employees with immediate essentials such as water ice and power stations.

In the mountain community of Villalba employees began returning to work as early as 3:30 a.m. Tuesday despite continuing rain and debris on the roads. “Almost 70 percent of our workers made it here Tuesday and more than 90 percent made it Wednesday” said Mara Cardona Vega senior manufacturing director and site leader in Villalba. “And many of them have water in their own homes. But they’re very committed to our Mission and we’re very proud of everyone.”

Medtronic facilities in Ponce Juncos Humacao and Villalba are resuming operations using massive diesel-powered generators. Each facility has enough backup fuel and water to run for several days and supply lines to bring in additional fuel and water are already in place if needed.

Hurricane Fiona hit Puerto Rico almost five years to the day after Hurricane Maria. Although nowhere near as devastating as Maria damage from Fiona has been significant. In Ponce 70 percent of Medtronic employees live in the area hardest hit by Fiona.

Lessons learned in the aftermath of Maria are helping get Medtronic facilities back online said Manuel Mellado senior manufacturing director at the Medtronic facility in Juncos.

“Water runoff from Maria flooded the main hallway in one of our buildings” Mellado said. “So we reinforced that area and added drainage to move storm water away from the facility. It worked perfectly during Fiona and we’re ready to go.”

And our employees still have the generators we gave them during Maria. So everyone is a lot better prepared.”

Problem is there is an ongoing global shortage of BCG.

Now the California biotech has partnered with the Serum Institute of India in an exclusive deal to manufacture BCG globally.

The arrangement aims to create “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and produce BCG “at large scale” for use in combination with Anktiva in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) ImmunityBio said Thursday.

BCG originally developed as a tuberculosis vaccine is also a standard treatment for NMIBC which accounts for about 80% of around 80000 new bladder cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S.

The FDA has cleared Anktiva and BCG to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ. And ImmunityBio is evaluating the combo in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with papillary tumors and perhaps more importantly in BCG-naïve NMIBC.

In the current indication ImmunityBio will go toe to toe with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 megablockbuster Keytruda and Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ gene therapy Adstiladrin both of which are administered by themselves without BCG. Ironically Merck is currently the sole supplier of BCG in the U.S.

Merck’s TICE BCG has been the lone BCG product in the U.S. since 2012 coming after Sanofi and another drugmaker ran into manufacturing problems. Sanofi officially pulled out of the market in 2016. Merck which had before then not been the major supplier globally for BCG was forced to pick up the slack.

In October 2020 Merck announced a plan to construct a new TICE BCG manufacturing facility in North Carolina. But that project was anticipated to be completed by late 2025 to late 2026 according to a Merck update in January this year. Once operational Merck expects to triple its current BCG capacity and believes believes it will be able to meet demand “for the foreseeable future.”

Merck has been rationing BCG supply since 2019. The New Jersey Big Pharma allocates its limited supply to distributors and wholesalers based on historical purchasing and it doesn’t directly determine the supply to individual healthcare providers.

SII is the largest manufacturer of BCG vaccine globally according to ImmunityBio. The Indian company has two BCG products for oncology use one traditional BCG called Onco-BCG is already commercialized outside the U.S. The new deal will see SII immediately supply that standard BCG for ImmunityBio’s clinical trials once the FDA signs off on the trial protocols which ImmunityBio plans to submit to global regulatory authorities within 30 days.

The second product a recombinant BCG is undergoing midstage testing in Europe. This version includes two gene modifications to improve its profile and according to ImmunityBio it has shown “potent immunogenicity with CD8+ and CD4+ stimulation and improved safety compared to standard BCG.” The two partners are now working to speed up the phase 2 program.

However in both cases the timeline for commercial supplies remains unclear. ImmunityBio will have more clarity on the timeline once it submits the trial protocols to the FDA a media aide to the company told Fierce Pharma.

The good news for ImmunityBio? Anktiva’s current U.S. label doesn’t specify or limit the type of BCG the drug can be used with. This allows the company to explore other alternatives to Merck’s TICE BCG ImmunityBio’s executive chairman Patrick Soon-Shiong M.D. said during an investor call last week.

“We are pleased to partner with the Serum Institute of India so that the power of its large-scale world-class GMP manufacturing capacity can be used to address the issue of BCG shortage which affects thousands of bladder cancer patients annually” Soon-Shiong said in a statement Thursday.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Plaintiffs in Lundy et al v. Meta Platforms claim the social media platform collected location data on Facebook users even when they turned off their phones' location services setting violating both California law and Facebook's own privacy policies.

The settlement was filed Aug. 22 in San Francisco federal court. A preliminary approval hearing is scheduled for Sept. 29 but the payout will still need final approval by a judge before users can receive their share.

Meta didn't respond to a request for comment on the case. In court papers it denied any allegations of wrongdoing and said it had agreed to the settlement ""solely to eliminate the uncertainties burden expense and delay of further protracted litigation.""



in June the company previously agreed to a $90 million settlement following accusations it tracked users' online activity on other sites even after they logged off Facebook. Earlier this year Meta also settled a $650 million class action case claiming Facebook's facial recognition scans violated Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act.



Read on to find out what Facebook's location tracking case is about who is eligible for a payment and when they might be able to claim their money.



For more on class action lawsuits see if you're eligible for a payout from T-Mobile's $350 million data breach settlement AT&T's $14 million hidden-fee case or Roundup weed killer's $45 million settlement.

What is Facebook accused of?

A class action lawsuit filed in 2018 in the US District Court's Northern District of California accuses Meta of recording Facebook users' physical location without permission using their IP address to infer their position in order to serve them targeted ads.

""Facebook has been covertly obtaining detailed location information from users regardless of whether a user has opted in or opted out on his or her device"" the complaint read.



It wasn't until the EU began enforcing the wide-ranging General Data Protection Regulation in 2018 that Facebook ""realized that it had to come clean about its data collection practices in its data policy"" according to the complaint which stated Facebook had previously specifically claimed that collection of any location information was opt-in.

Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Congress in 2018 that the company used shared location data ""to help advertisers reach people in particular areas.""

""For example if people have shared their device locations with Facebook or checked into a specific restaurant we can show them ads from an advertiser that wants to promote its services in their area or from the restaurant [itself]"" he said.

Who's eligible for money in the location tracking settlement?

A preliminary settlement was filed in San Francisco federal court on Aug. 22. If it receives final approval from a judge the settlement will cover anyone with a Facebook account since Jan 30 2015.

How much could I get?

It's not clear how much individual class members would receive yet though 30% of the proposed settlement could go to the plaintiffs' legal fees according to court documents.

How would eligible Facebook users get paid?

Eligible class members will be able to file a claim via a yet-to-be-launched settlement website according to the filing and then receive payment by check or direct deposit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5hbG1heWFkZWVuLm5ldC9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbWV0YS1yZXN0cmljdHMtYmFucy1wYWxlc3Rpbmlhbi1wb3N0cy1vbi1pdHMtcGxhdGZvcm1zOi1yZXBv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta restricts bans Palestinian posts on its platforms: Report,"Not only has the social media giant proven to harbor double standards but a new report now shows that in light of the wars in Palestine it discriminates against posts merely based on them being written in Arabic.

Palestinian content is constantly being censored (Palestinian Return Centre)

Palestinian users were deprived of their freedom of expression during the two-week war on Gaza by ""Israel"" last year by having their content blocked on Facebook and penalizing Arabic-speaking users more heavily than those who spoke Hebrew an independent audit of Meta’s online content handling revealed.



The audit carried out by the consultancy Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) demonstrates Meta's ability to control and manage content and regulations on its social media platforms. Regarding the matter of censoring it represents one of the first insider accounts that spoke out on the failure carried out on a social platform during the conflict and it advocates for Palestinian activists' complaints that online censorship targeted them specifically for speaking Arabic according to reports by The Washington Post and other media outlets at the time.

7amleh the Arab Center for the Advancement of Social Media which is a support group for Palestinian digital rights tweeted: ""The BSR report confirms Meta’s censorship has violated the Palestinian right to freedom of expression among other human rights through its greater over-enforcement of Arabic content compared to Hebrew which was largely under-moderated"".

Israeli occupation forces attacked the residents of the western neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in occupied Al-Quds in May of last year. Soon afterward the IOF stormed the Al-Aqsa mosque and began aggressively bombing Gaza leaving more than 200 Palestinians killed. A few months following the Israeli Supreme Court in occupied Al-Quds ruled to postpone the expulsion of the residents of Sheikh Jarrah from their homes due to concern over escalating tensions with the Palestinian resistance during which the court suggested they remain tenants and that houses be owned by settlers but that was immediately rejected by Sami Arsheed the attorney of residents in Sheikh Jarrah.

When Mona Al-Kurd a Palestinian activist tried live-streaming the ongoing events in the neighborhood trying to expose the Israeli crimes against Palestinian families her streaming was cut off suddenly leading Al-Kurd later to post on her Instagram story explaining that her live-streaming feature was blocked which exposes Instagram’s complicity and censorship of Palestinian content.

Palestinians posted photos of their destroyed homes and of children’s coffins which eventually led to a global outrage to end the conflict. That however was short-lived as content moderation campaigns began rolling in.

Meta's Instagram banned content containing the hashtag #AlAqsa as initially the company stated automated software deployment errors as being the reason behind that but a Meta spokeswoman added that a “human error” was behind the glitch after The Post underlined the issue. According to the BSR report the #AlAqsa hashtag was mistakenly listed under terms linked to terrorism by a third-party contractor's employee that controls content moderation through which the employee wrongly drew “from an updated list of terms from the US Treasury Department containing the Al Aqsa Brigade resulting in #AlAqsa being hidden from search results.""

Years of accounts from Palestinian journalists and activists that Facebook and Instagram appear to censor their posts were confirmed more frequently than those of Hebrew speakers. BSR not only deduced that Facebook was banning or adding strikes to more posts from Palestinians than from Israelis but also that ""rule-breaking"" content in Arabic than that in Hebrew was routinely flagged at higher rates. Meta’s AI-based hate speech systems are blamed for using lists of terms linked to foreign terrorist organizations adding that it would be a higher possibility that an Arabic-written post may have its content marked due to being associated with a terrorist group.

The report claimed that Meta installed a detection software to identify hate and violent speech in Arabic but had not done so for the Hebrew language.

Human Rights Watch had previously accused Meta last year then-Facebook of wrongfully removing and suppressing content by Palestinians and their supporters including content regarding human rights abuses committed by ""Israel"" against Palestinians during the Seif Al-Quds battle.

The BSR report included policy alterations for labeling ""dangerous"" organizations and individuals alongside stipulating more transparency to users when posts are banned redistributing content moderation resources in Hebrew and Arabic based on “market composition” and routing potential content violations in Arabic to people speaking the same dialect as the one in the social media post.



In light of the list of changes Meta’s human rights director Miranda Sissons replied that the 10 of the recommendations would be completely enforced - as of now partly four changes are implemented and the ""feasibility"" of another six is being reviewed and “no further action” on one unidentified change will be taken.

Sissons stated: “There are no quick overnight fixes to many of these recommendations as BSR makes clear” adding: “While we have made significant changes as a result of this exercise already this process will take time — including time to understand how some of these recommendations can best be addressed and whether they are technically feasible.”

7amleh released a statement that the report falsely named the bias from Meta unintentional: “We believe that the continued censorship for years on [Palestinian] voices despite our reports and arguments of such bias confirms that this is deliberate censorship unless Meta commits to ending it"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmZXJsLm9yZy9hL2lyYW4tYW1pbmktd2hhdHNhcHAtbWV0YS1kZW5pYWwvMzIwNDc4MjQuaHRtbNIBR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmZXJsLm9yZy9hbXAvaXJhbi1hbWluaS13aGF0c2FwcC1tZXRhLWRlbmlhbC8zMjA0NzgyNC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta Denies Accusations That It's Working With Iranian Government To Disrupt WhatsApp,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmZXJsLm9yZy9hL2lyYW4tYW1pbmktd2hhdHNhcHAtbWV0YS1kZW5pYWwvMzIwNDc4MjQuaHRtbNIBR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmZXJsLm9yZy9hbXAvaXJhbi1hbWluaS13aGF0c2FwcC1tZXRhLWRlbmlhbC8zMjA0NzgyNC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673E4D9ED0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The lawsuit [PDF] filed in a US federal district court in San Francisco claims that the two applications incorporate use their own browser known as a WKWebView that injects JavaScript code to gather data that would otherwise be unavailable if the apps opened links in the default standalone browser designated by iPhone users.

The claim is based on the findings of security researcher Felix Krause who last month published an analysis of how WKWebView browsers embedded within native applications can be abused to track people and violate privacy expectations.

""When users click on a link within the Facebook app Meta automatically directs them to the in-app browser it is monitoring instead of the smartphone’s default browser without telling users that this is happening or they are being tracked"" the complaint says.

""The user information Meta intercepts monitors and records includes personally identifiable information private health details text entries and other sensitive confidential facts.""

Confronted last month with Krause's findings Meta insisted its code injection was done to respect its users' privacy choices (apart from their choice of default browser).

""We intentionally developed this code to honor people's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) choices on our platforms"" a Meta spokesperson told The Register last month. ""The code allows us to aggregate data before it is used for targeted advertising or measurement purposes.""

Meta communications director Andy Stone offered a similar statement via Twitter.

The code in question allows us to respect people's privacy choices by helping aggregate events (such as making a purchase online) from pixels already on websites before those events are used for advertising or measurement purposes. — Andy Stone (@andymstone) August 11 2022

The complaint which is seeking class action certification contends that Meta's undisclosed tracking violates the federal wiretapping statute the California Invasion of Privacy Act and the state's competition law – based on the conceit that the data Meta obtained enabled it to increase its profits and to gain an advantage over competitors.

""Meta’s injection of JavaScript coincides with recent privacy updates for iPhones and other iOS devices"" the complaint contends pointing to the 2021 introduction of iOS 14.5 and its data-denying App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.

Fluff and nonsense?

The legal salvo makes much of how Meta (then known as Facebook) waged a public relations campaign in an unsuccessful effort to undo ATT on the grounds it would harm small businesses that rely on the social ad biz's data-driven ads.

Meta maintains it is following Apple's ATT rules and Krause does not dispute that.

However Meta's use of in-app browsers in its mobile apps predates Apple's ATT initiative. Apple introduced WKWebView at its 2014 Worldwide Developer Conference as a replacement for its older UIWebView (UIKit) and WebView (AppKit) frameworks. That was in iOS 8. With the arrival of iOS 9 as described at WWDC 2015 there was another option SFSafariViewController. Presently this is what's recommended for displaying a website within an app.

And the company's use of in-app browsers has elicited concern before.

""On top of limited features WebViews can also be used for effectively conducting intended man-in-the-middle attacks since the IAB [in-app browser] developer can arbitrarily inject JavaScript code and also intercept network traffic"" wrote Thomas Steiner a Google developer relations engineer in a blog post three years ago.

In his post Steiner emphasizes that he didn't see anything unusual like a ""phoning home"" function.

Krause has taken a similar line noting only the potential for abuse. In a follow-up post he identified additional data gathering code.

He wrote ""Instagram iOS subscribes to every tap on any button link image or other component on external websites rendered inside the Instagram app"" and also ""subscribes to every time the user selects a UI element (like a text field) on third party websites rendered inside the Instagram app.""

However ""subscribes"" simply means that analytics data is accessible within the app without offering any conclusion about what if anything is done with the data. Krause also points out that since 2020 Apple has offered a framework called WKContentWorld that isolates the web environment from scripts. Developers using an in-app browser can implement WKContentWorld in order to make scripts undetectable from the outside he said.

Whatever Meta is doing internally with its in-app browser and even given the company's insistence its injected script validates ATT settings the plaintiffs suing the company argue there was no disclosure of the process.

""Meta fails to disclose the consequences of browsing navigating and communicating with third-party websites from within Facebook’s in-app browser – namely that doing so overrides their default browser’s privacy settings which users rely on to block and prevent tracking"" the complaint says. ""Similarly Meta conceals the fact that it injects JavaScript that alters external third-party websites so that it can intercept track and record data that it otherwise could not access.""

Meta rejects the lawsuit's claims. ""These allegations are without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously"" a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

""We have carefully designed our in-app browser to respect users' privacy choices including how data may be used for ads."" ®"
MET,MetLife,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NkYXkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jb2x1bW5pc3RzL25laWwtYmVzdC9tZXRsaWZlLXN0YWRpdW0tamV0cy1naWFudHMtajZteDl3ZmzSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzZGF5LmNvbS9hbXAvc3BvcnRzL2NvbHVtbmlzdHMvbmVpbC1iZXN0L21ldGxpZmUtc3RhZGl1bS1qZXRzLWdpYW50cy1qNm14OXdmbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Jets and Giants finally make MetLife Stadium a place to call home?,"It is the least-loved pro sports facility in the area — a soulless hulk sitting in a parking lot in New Jersey that was financed in part by dreaded personal seat licenses and designed by a two-team committee (and looks it).

Newsday’s Tom Rock offered the first best and still-applicable assessment after a media tour before the place opened in the form of this April 8 2010 tweet:

“Overall stadium impression: like a battleship — big gray and expensive.”

Pretty much.

But as lacking as MetLife Stadium is in charm its image would have been helped immensely over these past 13 seasons if it had received a little help from its marquee tenants.

Sure there have been some big games there notably including the Giants’ 29-14 victory over the Jets on Dec. 24 2011 a key step on the road to winning Super Bowl XLII.

But overall . . . meh. The Giants’ and Jets’ lack of success during the past decade too often has rendered the stadium big gray expensive and empty come late autumn.

Shockingly there has been only one Jets or Giants playoff game there — the Giants’ 24-2 rout of the Falcons in the wild-card round on Jan. 8 2012.

Robert Saleh the Jets’ current head coach was on the Seahawks’ staff when they won Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife in 2014 but no head coach has led the Jets into a playoff game there.

One of the most infamous games in the stadium’s history rose from the dead just last weekend when the Dolphins’ comeback from a 21-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Ravens marked an NFL first since the Eagles did it to the Giants in MetLife’s first season in 2010.

All of which is a long way of getting around to the fact that the stadium finally is ready for an early-season close-up this weekend.

The Jets are 1-1 and host the defending AFC champion Bengals on Sunday. The Giants are 2-0 and host the Cowboys on Monday night. They are planning a “white-out” in which fans are being asked to wear white same as the Giants will.

Rarely in recent seasons have the teams been a combined 3-1 after two weeks and the fact that both are at home in Week 3 adds to the football juice even as the Yankees and Mets command most of the local sports attention.

What are the chances that both teams will come through? Not great especially for the Jets who are facing a presumably angry 0-2 Cincinnati team.

But the point here is that there is reason to care and at least a reasonable hope for more games to care about beyond the baseball playoffs.

All of the current generation of New York-area sports arenas — a building and renovating spree that began with the Prudential Center in 2007 and ended with the opening of UBS Arena in 2021 — provide more creature comforts than their predecessors.

But some like Citi Field have more charm than others.

MetLife is one of the others. But here is the thing about that ocean of gray seats which were designed to be neutral — and as far from green or blue as possible:

They are not gray when there are people sitting in them especially when said people are waving white rally towels as Giants fans will be encouraged to do on Monday night.

Jets and Giants fans are desperate for something to get excited about and two winning teams would go a long way toward making people like their stadium or at least dislike it less.

Come midnight Monday a combined 5-1 record would make the place feel a lot more like home.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtqZXRzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2pldHMtYmVuZ2Fscy1nYW1lLXByZXZpZXctNC1xdWFydGVycy1vZi1mb290YmFsbC1wbHVzLWEtc3BlY2lhbC1oYWxmdGltZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jets-Bengals Game Preview | 4 Quarters of Football Plus a Special Halftime,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9tb25kYXktbmlnaHQtZm9vdGJhbGwtd2hpdGUtb3V0LWVzcG4tZWxpLW1hbm5pbmctY2hhZC1wb3dlcnMtd2Fsay1vbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Giants Now,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9tb25kYXktbmlnaHQtZm9vdGJhbGwtd2hpdGUtb3V0LWVzcG4tZWxpLW1hbm5pbmctY2hhZC1wb3dlcnMtd2Fsay1vbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674225AF80>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

So it’s only fitting that he’s expected to make his NFL debut under the bright lights of Monday Night Football against the Dallas Cowboys at MetLife Stadium.

“Big games like this whether it’s the National Championship Super Bowl Monday Night Football where everybody is watching I wouldn’t say it adds pressure to me” Thibodeaux said this week. “But if you do better it will amplify. We’re in New York.”

Kayvon Thibodeaux is expected to make is NFL debut against the Cowboys on Monday night.

Thibodeaux’s long-awaited debut has been delayed by a sprained right MCL injury sustained on Aug. 21 in a preseason game against the Cincinnati Bengals.

He’s been wearing a brace on the knee and he’s listed as questionable officially for the primetime game. But all signs pointed to the rookie from Oregon playing barring some unforeseen last-minute change of plans.

Thibodeaux was going full speed in live drills against offensive linemen despite being listed as limited in practice. He said he was able to “open it up” and was “definitely confident” after making “a lot of progress” in his rehab.

There is actually a chance that both Thibodeaux and second-year pass rusher Azeez Ojulari (right calf) make their season debuts to reinforce a defense that could be without Leonard Williams (sprained right MCL).

“I hope so” head coach Brian Daboll said when asked if he were confident they’d both play. “They’ve taken good steps. I think they are much better than they were the week before. Hopefully they’ll have a good day here and we’re moving in the right direction with those guys.”

Thibodeaux 21 should help a Giants pass rush that has struggled to get to opposing quarterbacks without blitzing. But he also demonstrated strong run defense in the preseason and that could be a big boost against Ezekiel Elliot Tony Pollard and the Cowboys’ ground attack.

He said he hasn’t allowed the injury to frustrate him and he’s excited to show what he can do.

“That doesn’t really frustrate [me]” Thibodeaux said. “You have to have an understanding of where you want to get to. If I tried to focus too much on the now of course I’d be down. But just trying to focus on the future of what we have in store and what I have in store for myself.”

Vegas has no NBA team (yet) but can it support 2 arena projects?

Unredeemed cashout vouchers from Las Vegas casinos on Wednesday Aug. 17 2022 in Las Vegas. The state which gets 75 percent of unclaimed winnings collected $16.5 million from a total of nearly $22 million in unclaimed winnings in the 2021-2022 fiscal year. (Steel Brooks/Las Vegas Review-Journal)

A Louisiana woman has filed suit against MGM Resorts International claiming it shortchanges gamblers when they cash out slot machine vouchers at casino kiosks that don’t pay exact change.

Attorneys for Leane Scherer of New Orleans filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court’s Southern District of Mississippi and hope to make the complaint a class-action suit.

RELATED: Players let $22M in cashout tickets expire last year. Where did the money go?

Representatives of MGM had no comment on the lawsuit Friday.

Attorneys representing Scherer on Friday had no additional comment and did not say how many people they expect to join the lawsuit if it receives class-action status.

Slot machines that dispense vouchers instead of coins started to become popular in the late 1990s. With those machines players insert currency for credits to play. When a player ends play the machine dispenses a voucher with a bar code with the dollar amount won. Vouchers can either be redeemed at a kiosk the cash cage or can be reinserted into another slot machine for further play.

Ticket in-ticket out technology or TITO is an advantage to casino operators who don’t have to constantly refill their slot machines with coins.

In her complaint Scherer said kiosks at MGM’s Beau Rivage in Biloxi Mississippi dispense the cash amount rounded down to the nearest dollar and give another voucher for the change which can be redeemed at a casino cage. Putting the change on a separate voucher was a new phenomenon that began during the coronavirus pandemic due to a shortage of coins.

The complaint said MGM provides no signage at Beau Rivage explaining that players cannot receive the full amount of their winnings unless they go to the cage.

The lawsuit cited Wynn Las Vegas as an example of a casino that adequately informs players that it doesn’t pay change at its kiosks.

“For example the kiosk at the Wynn in Las Vegas bears a sticker that says ‘Machine only dispenses cash ticket will print for change. Please take ticket to the cashier to redeem.’ Defendant’s casinos were far less forthcoming” the suit says.

Under existing policies in several states winnings that are left behind by players can go back to the casino company or to a charitable cause it supports. In Nevada players have 180 days from a voucher’s issuance to claim the winnings. In New Jersey players have a year to redeem and in Pennsylvania three years. In Mississippi players have just 30 days to redeem their tickets before they are turned over to the casino.

“For the last few years defendants have essentially been keeping the change off of hundreds of thousands of gaming vouchers essentially robbing their customers a few cents at a time on millions of transactions” says the lawsuit which was filed Wednesday.

In 2012 Nevada lawmakers passed legislation directing unclaimed slot-machine winnings to the state and to the casinos. Under the law 75 percent of the abandoned funds is turned over to the Nevada Gaming Control Board which forwards the total to the state’s general fund. The remaining 25 percent can be kept by the company as gross gaming revenue.

The law was amended and as of 2021 all casino vouchers including those involving table-game play and sports wagers allow funds to be directed to the state and the casinos after 180 days.

In the 2021 fiscal year Nevada players left a total $22 million in unclaimed tickets.

Called The Mansion at MGM Grand this hotel-within-a-hotel consists of 29 ""Mediterranean-themed residences ranging from 2400 square feet to 12000 square feet"" all within ""an enclave of privacy and pleasure where the sensual riches of Tuscany reach their fullest expression"" according to the website.

Translation: There's a little Tuscan village exclusively for the rich and famous under a glass dome in the shadow of the famous green resort on the Las Vegas Strip. And guests staying in that VIP village get exclusive perks such as private butlers limousine transport highly customized private dining an exclusive pool and more.

Interested in a stay? ""Qualified guests only"" the website warns. But what makes someone qualified?

The Mansion at MGM Grand. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY

A representative for the hotel remained tight-lipped about who qualifies but a call to the reservations desk answered a few questions.

You technically don't need to be a high roller or a Grammy winner as I assumed to book a stay in one of these villas but a reservation request has to be approved by management the phone agent explained to me. That's because those managers give priority (and probably free stays) to the actual high rollers who are dropping hundreds of thousands of dollars in the casino.

But if you're gambling is more modest or even nonexistent anyone who can afford the Mansion — I was quoted $6000 to $7500 a night for a two-bedroom villa — can put in a request and assuming they're not all blocked off by the higher powers there's a fair chance the stay is yours.

One word of advice: Don't try to book a stay here when there's a big event on the books like a fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

Also don't try to book more than 90 days in advance as these larger-than-life villas (including the four-bedroom villa with an indoor pool) seem to be mostly set aside in case a true VIP pops into town.

While The Mansion at MGM Grand is certainly one of the most top-tier experiences in Sin City it's not the only hotel-within-a-hotel in town. In fact there are quite a few on the Strip.

And now the trend of putting another entirely separate hotel hidden or not within another hotel is starting to spread outside the confines of Las Vegas.

Hotels hiding in plain sight

In its most simple form a hotel-within-a-hotel is exactly what it sounds like: a separate hotel tucked away inside a bigger or better-known hotel. In theory there are no set rules and a hotel-within-a-hotel can be whatever a hotelier wants it to be from a set of luxurious villas with a private reception area to an entirely different brand or chain in the same building.

""A hotel-within-a-hotel is a more elevated experience offering elite interiors designated check-in areas exclusive services dedicated staff and upgraded amenities that are completely different from the host hotel"" Benjamin Kott vice president of hotel operations at Aria and Vdara in Las Vegas told TPG. Kott added that MGM has hotels like this in its portfolio including NoMad at Park MGM and Delano at Mandalay Bay.

The NoMad Las Vegas in the Park MGM is a great example of a well-known brand setting up shop within a larger host hotel. The Sydell Group the force behind brands like Line and Freehand originally created the much-loved NoMad New York which closed in 2021. Playing off the success of that hotel Sydell Group which owns Park MGM brought a taste of New York to the Strip in the form of a hotel-within-a-hotel the NoMad Las Vegas which has its own porte cochere or private entrance.

But that's not the only one. The Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas is tucked away in the Mandalay Bay complex and the Nobu Hotel Las Vegas the very first in the Nobu hotel empire that's sweeping the globe is found in Caesars Palace.

While each of these hotels is different in what it offers one of the big perks is that guests in the more exclusive (often more expensive) hotels can still use the amenities of what Kott called the ""host"" hotel. At the Four Seasons in Las Vegas for example guests can swim in the private Four Seasons pool or take advantage of Mandalay Bay's massive pool complex and its real-sand beach.

FOUR SEASONS

But there's another type of hotel-within-a-hotel — one that's created by and within the host hotel to offer an elevated luxurious experience for someone looking for something beyond just a place to sleep at night.

""As the entertainment capital of the world Las Vegas sees a variety of visitors from all over the globe who travel to the city with specific tastes and interests"" said Kott. ""We're seeing now more than ever that our guests want an elevated stay and experiences that showcase more customer service and amenities and hotels-within-hotels offer all that and more.""

At his hotel Aria there are actually two hotel-within-a-hotel experiences: Aria Sky Suites and Sky Villas both of which just went through head-to-toe remodels. At Sky Suites there are 400 suites with one to multiple bedrooms that can be booked directly online by anyone willing to shell out upward of $1100 per night.

The Sky Villas are akin to The Mansion at MGM Grand requiring management approval to release one of the resort's top-tier rooms that would otherwise be given to a high roller. Calling to see what kind of price we might be looking at for one of the Sky Villas a phone representative said he recently saw managers approve a three-bedroom suite for $20000 a night and smaller rooms (they start at 2000 square feet so not that small) for between $10000 and $12000 a night.

But hey that's the price of exclusivity.

""Aria Sky Suites and Sky Villas at Aria are definitely separate experiences from Aria itself in that they both offer complimentary luxury transportation to and from the airport"" Kott explained. ""They also have their own separate entrance and designated check-in area a separate pool area and a 24-hour concierge that gives Sky Suites and Sky Villa guests effortless access to some of the city's best offerings.""

And if you're curious if these hotels-within-hotels are competing against their host hotels the answer is a simple no according to Kott. ""It's a different kind of clientele so it doesn't compete.""

Beyond Las Vegas

Though Las Vegas may hold the crown for most hotel-within-a-hotel experiences it's not the only place you can find the concept.

One place to look for it is Miami where there are a number of properties offering a secret (or not-so-secret) hotel within another.

At the storied Eden Roc Miami Beach which opened in 1955 to the sounds of a live Harry Belafonte performance would-be guests can book a stay at Nobu Hotel Miami Beach which has a pool for guests 21 and older and a private beach area.

Marriott got in on the action by opening The Hotel Beaux Arts part of the Autograph Collection on the top floors of the JW Marriott Marquis Miami. There guests might not have the same exclusive perks as in Vegas but guests can have a more boutique stay in the room while enjoying shared amenities between the two like the Enliven Spa a 19th-floor pool virtual bowling and even basketball courts.

Up in Palm Beach Florida guests can always expect a luxurious stay at The Breakers a palatial oceanfront property that dates back to the late 1800s. But for a much more exclusive stay check into The Flagler Club a boutique-like hotel on the top floors of the resort that comes with Telsa chauffeur service a private lounge and rooftop terrace a dedicated team to help with any needs and more — all for about $1000 more per night than a standard Breakers room.

On the other side of the country in California San Diego's Hotel del Coronado just unveiled an entirely new hotel-within-a-hotel experience alongside its other hotel offerings billed as ""neighborhoods."" The newest hotel The Shore House comprises 75 one- two- and three-bedroom residential-style accommodations right off the beach of the Pacific Ocean.

Though the resort itself is a sprawling complex with accommodation types for every type of traveler The Shore House is an elevated luxury experience that feels more like a vacation rental with a dedicated resort entrance a zero-edge oceanfront pool with private cabanas a poolside bar and access to the resort's other amenities plus a VIP concierge exclusive to Shore House guests. Rates at The Shore House start at $1299 a night.

Bottom line

Hotels-within-hotels aren't a new concept but it's also a growing trend I hope we see more of in the future especially at big resorts like you'll find in Las Vegas and other popular vacation destinations.

While club-level rooms at a lot of hotels do offer special perks like a lounge and a happy hour having an entirely different hotel-within-a-hotel creates a truly distinct experience that can totally elevate a trip (and its price tag).

So the next time you're looking for a place to stay be sure to do a little digging. Who knows there might just be a secret hotel — or Tuscan village — hiding in the shadows.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vcmVjb21tZW5kLmNvbS9lZGl0b3JzLXBpY2tzL21nbS1ncmFuZC1sYXVuY2hlcy1yZW1vZGVsLW9mLXN0dWRpby10b3dlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MGM Grand Launches Remodel of Studio Tower,"MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas has unveiled the room remodel of its Studio Tower reflecting a retro desert feel with a mid-century modern design aesthetic.

While the concept of touchscreens has existed since the 1960s it was only in the past couple of decades that compact and affordable touch sensor panels (such as capacitive and resistive ones) have entered the market revolutionizing consumer electronics and becoming a staple of modern life.

Touch controllers are a vital component of modern display technology.

Still many people believe touch panels lack the tactile feel and feedback of traditional buttons knobs and switches. Some manufacturers are working on new ways to improve the user experience of consumer electronics by creating technologies that mimic the feeling of these components and even infuse touch sensors with mechanical elements.

This article focuses on the control side of this equation diving into the details of three ICs announced in recent months by prominent semiconductor manufacturers. These devices were designed to enhance the input methods of next-generation electronic devices.

Microchip Supports Rotary Encoders on Top of Touchscreens

In June Microchip Technology announced a new type of touch display chip that makes it easier for engineers to integrate the interactive input capabilities of multi-touch displays with the tactile feel of mechanical rotary encoders.

maXTouch Knob-on-Display (KoD) is a family of touch controller ICs that natively support capacitive rotary encoders and mechanical switches mounted onto existing touch displays without needing custom panel shapes and cutouts.

According to the company the Knob-on-Display chips would allow designers to incorporate multiple turnkey knobs of different styles into a single traditional touch display for use in various types of products ranging from in-vehicle systems to smart household appliances.

Microchip aims to simplify the development process of these devices through a comprehensive suite of both hardware and software tools while also improving the user experience and increasing automotive safety. With the new touch controller technology users can manage volume and temperature without looking away from the road and at a display.

The maXTouch KoD family includes two variants (KD and MK) of two different LQFP packaged chips: the 112 touch channel ATMXT2912TD-A and the 97 touch channel ATMXT2113TD-A. The KD chip variants allow manufacturers to create their own knob design based on a reference provided by Microchip in partnership with BNL Bearings while the MK chip variants support Panasonic’s capacitive rotary Magic Knob element.

ST Develops Touch Controller for Flexible AMOLED Displays

Another recent development in touch technology comes from STMicroelectronics with a new touch controller IC. The FingerTip FTG2-SLP is designed to operate with the latest energy-saving and efficiency-oriented AMOLED displays which can dynamically control their refresh rates depending on the types of apps they’re showing.

Created primarily for the smartphone industry the FingerTip FTG2-SLP is a 32-bit Arm Cortex-M4 core-based capacitive multitouch screen controller capable of running in synchronous and asynchronous modes. The device is also said to maintain a seamless interaction between the user and the device with a display refresh rate that changes dynamically.

ST's touch controller comprises advanced features such as enhanced noise suppression and filtering and a fast report rate of 240 Hz. The FTG2-SLP also supports thin flat curved and even flexible LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) AMOLED panels thanks to its differential and node compensation hardware and differential data processing software.

The chip also features a special hibernation mode designed to further increase battery life on top of its low-power displays. ST has already launched production of the FTG2-SLP to find a home in the next generation of flexible and foldable smartphones.

CTT Makes Control SoC for Piezoelectric Touch Panel

Earlier this year Cambridge Touch Technologies (CTT) a company established in 2011 as a spinoff from the University of Cambridge announced the development of a new force touch controller system-on-chip (SoC) to improve the user experience in smart devices.

Named UTA3221 this chip was designed to work in conjunction with CTT’s proprietary UltraTouch sensor platform that combines a thin and flexible piezoelectric film with advanced AI and machine learning algorithms to provide a more pleasant and tactile interaction method.

According to the company its force touch technology can deliver the feel of mechanical buttons while also operating in the rain underwater and even while the user is wearing gloves which is difficult to achieve with other touch input methods like capacitive touchscreens.

The UTA3221 IC itself is a low-powered Arm Cortex-M CPU-based touch controller that comes in a 76-pin QFN package. CTT claims this chip can process up to ten different force touch points at once. It also includes a standout sensitivity and noise floor making it useful for the types of signals generated by piezoelectric devices.

CTT offers samples and evaluation kits to manufacturers and designers interested in incorporating UltraTouch and the UTA3221 into their own technology targeting the automotive industrial and medical fields.

Advancing Touch Input for Consumer Electronics

As embedded microprocessors become more powerful and more versatile combining them with the latest sensor and display technologies is a surefire way to enhance the level of interaction between humans and machines.

Sitting at the forefront of this field are companies like Microchip ST and CTT that offer engineers more options to develop and design systems and products ranging from advanced and alternative tactile touch components to ultra-high refresh and response rate sensors. Touch is likely to remain the primary input method in the smartphone automotive and appliance industries and new advances at the chip level may be key to enhancing the safety and user experience of these consumer electronics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vaGFja2FkYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjMvYWRkLWFuLW9zaHctY2VydGlmaWVkLXN0b3B3YXRjaC10by15b3VyLXRvb2xraXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Add An OSHW Certified Stopwatch To Your Toolkit,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='hackaday.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/09/23/add-an-oshw-certified-stopwatch-to-your-toolkit/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673E5F9FC0>, 'Connection to hackaday.com timed out.

Hallelujah! That’s it just move around a little bit there she goes!” Those were the words used by televangelist and soon-to-be-exposed-as-a-fraud Peter Popoff as he allegedly channelled divine power to cure a woman of her arthritis. She no longer needed her walker and was able to take a few steps though not without holding for dear life to Popoff’s hand.

Pain is a common symptom of existence. Whether we look at Canada or the United States it is estimated that one in five people has chronic pain.

But pain is also a slippery devil. With the pressure of a thousand stares at an event combined with desperation and a religious faith in divine salvation our temporary perception of pain can be drastically altered. I would love to see if this woman really did kiss her walker goodbye after Popoff’s intervention. I can guarantee you she did not. But in the moment her pain probably did go away or was made more manageable.

The experience of pain is so subjective that it does lend itself to be influenced by non-specific placebo effects. If you really believe an ancient herb or state-of-the-art gadget has the power to take your pain away you might feel like your pain recedes at least in the short term.

Given how many of us experience pain regularly it’s no wonder that so many products are sold claiming to relieve us of our burden especially given the limitations and pitfalls of pharmaceutical options. Despair turns patients into customers. “What if it does work?” we ask ourselves.

For 119 dollars (minus shipping) you can buy a rectangular adhesive patch that looks like a giant computer microchip—a “macrochip” if you will. It’s called the Kailo patch and the promotional images on its Amazon store page promise a painless state “in under 60 seconds” with a product that is “100% drug-free and [has] zero side effects.”

You apply the reusable Kailo patch on your body between the pain and the brain and voilà! The patch takes away the pain. And it has even been tested in a clinical trial!

Do the claims add up?

Mind the gap

The Kailo patch is said to work anywhere on your body to “quickly turn off pain in your head neck shoulder back knee hand foot and more” and it claims to do so not by transferring a drug through the skin or by applying an electrical current but by “helping the brain communicate with disrupted areas more effectively.”

It looks to me like the makers of the patch don’t know for certain how it works but they have put forward a proposed mechanism of action which sure sounds scientific. It involves words like “capacitors” “nociceptive signals” and “dysfunctional axons.” Essentially the Kailo patch which has no power supply of its own is supposed to soak in the body’s “ambient energy” and direct it back at the body acting as a bridge between the painful area and the brain which processes pain signals. We are told these signals get naturally distorted and the patch restores proper communication so that the brain can help the body heal itself.

I reached out to two pain experts to get their takes on this proposed mechanism of action.

Dr. Greg Weir a senior research fellow at the University of Glasgow’s Centre for Neuroscience wrote to me that pain is caused by increased electrical activity in the nerves dedicated to sensing it. The proposed mechanism behind the Kailo patch is “totally inconsistent with what we know about pain neurobiology.” We feel pain because our brain communicates a little too well with the part of our body sensing the pain. There is no need to bridge the gap and improve communication here. Quite the opposite in fact: local anesthetics work by turning off the electrical activity of our pain-sensing nerves.

For Dr. Robert M. Caudle a professor at the University of Florida College of Dentistry whose research programme focuses on pain transmission the idea that the Kailo patch acts as a bridge to enhance communication between the pain and the brain “reeks of truthiness and has no substance.”

The patch is said to be made up of billions of incredibly small particles—nanoparticles—of silver and copper that act as little capacitors meaning they can store an electrical charge. I could not find evidence that the patch actually works in the way it is described: that it gobbles up energy from the body stores it and is able to send it back. This is a measurable claim yet where are the measurements? And what good would it do to draw energy from the body and send it back? And what energy? Electrical charges in your body as their website claims? Or something more arcane? Because this whole notion of a breakdown in communication causing illness reminds me of the boogeymen of acupuncture and chiropractic where a mysterious life force is impeded from flowing like a river. The frequent claim that Kailo is “made from 100% naturally occurring elements” and is “completely chemical-free” also sounds like an appeal to the “alternative medicine” crowd. If the patch were chemical free it would not exist as every component of this patch including the silver and copper are chemicals.

Dr. Caudle mentioned to me that one of the biggest problems with pain is “the huge placebo effect.” Surely this is the kind of effect that could be controlled for in a robust clinical trial pitting the real patch against a fake patch devoid of nanoparticles or applying the real patch on the wrong part of the body.

While a clinical trial was conducted its methodology is a head-scratcher.

Trial and errors

The trial that tested the Kailo patch was called the PREVENT study which was financed by the distributors of the patch and run by a research company called Clarity Science LLC.

One hundred and twenty-eight adults with different types of pain were given the Kailo patch for 30 days while 20 adults with pain served as controls: they were put on a waitlist for 30 days and then received the patch for 30 more days having crossed over to the treatment arm of the trial. (By the way don’t let the press releases and sponsored content fool you: there was no placebo arm in this trial.) The reported results are pretty astounding. The first group’s pain levels go down significantly while the control group’s levels go up without the patch only to decrease strongly when using the patch. There were no side effects reported and 91% of participants said they were now using less (sometimes a lot less) oral pain medication because of the patch. It sure sounds like a homerun.

But I noticed some issues with the trial. A control group needs to be equivalent to the treatment group in all measures. This means that the proportion of men and women or the age distribution for example should be roughly the same in the two groups. If they are not comparable any detected difference in outcome could be due to those differences and not to the treatment being tested. The treatment and control groups in the PREVENT study are not equivalent. The types of pain being experienced for example are not equally distributed. While 46% of participants in the treatment group have a pain that affects their muscles the percentage jumps up to 70% in the control group. The use of pain medication is also radically different between the groups. Over-the-counter pain medication was used by over half of the participants in the treatment group and none in the control group while prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were more than twice as likely to be used by the control group. These comparisons are almost always reported by researchers alongside a statistic called the p-value to show that the groups are not statistically different; their omission here is telling.

Another major absence is exactly how these people were recruited and assigned to each group. We know they were enrolled at three different places in the United States but how they were chosen and why they were assigned to the treatment or the control group is never spelled out except to mention that it wasn’t done by chance. Some participants dropped out of the trial though we do not know how many or why. Did they quit the trial because the patch was not working? If so the fact that their data was excluded from the final analysis is certain to bias how well the patch performs.

Finally the subjectivity of pain rears its ugly head here. In the treatment group at least one person reported that before putting on the patch their pain was a 10 out of 10 which the researchers describe as “pain as bad as you can imagine.” I have trouble imagining how someone who is having the worst pain possible could fill out a research questionnaire. Their pain was probably not a 10 out of 10. This is a great example of how malleable a subjective pain scale like this can be. If you believe that this state-of-the-art patch given to you by scientists in lab coats must work you might score your pain as less severe after the 30-day trial period even if an objective measurement (if it were possible) would show no difference.

The fact that using the patch led to a significant decrease in the use of pain medication may look unexplainable if the patch doesn’t actually work. However we do not know how the pain would have evolved without the patch. Patients in the treatment group are not said to have chronic pain; rather they were “diagnosed with a mild moderate or severe pain condition” that was either arthritic neurological or muscular in nature. The last two are not necessarily chronic conditions. This particular pain could be acute and thus resolve itself after a few days. And the control group being so small and so different from the treatment group we cannot use it to clearly see the natural fluctuations of pain when the patch is not applied.

Suffice to say that this one trial financed by the company that makes the patch is not compelling especially in light of the patch’s proposed mechanism of action which sounds scientific but isn’t. Reading the patent application for the device I was surprised to find the suggestion that the Kailo patch might be used to correct color blindness! Combined with the claim that the Kailo patch doesn’t even have to be applied to the skin but works through clothing (even sweatshirts!) and I hope we can agree that this whole story just doesn’t ring true.

The Kailo patch exists because it raised nearly 2 million U.S. dollars on the Indiegogo crowdfunding platform. Despair turns patients into customers yes but also into investors sometimes. We may not hear Peter Popoff screaming “Hallelujah!” when we apply the patch but we should be highly skeptical nonetheless.

Take-home message:

- The Kailo patch is claimed to take away the pain you feel by restoring proper communication between the painful area of your body and your brain and allowing the brain to heal the body

- Its proposed mechanism of action makes no sense given our understanding of the biology of pain

- The clinical trial that tested the patch was financed by its makers compared two groups of participants who were not comparable did not include a placebo and makes no mention of how the participants were recruited and how many dropped out of the trial thus potentially skewing the results significantly

Future Title Performance Gains With DLSS 3 Tech

Moore’s Law has been at the beating heart of technology advancement ever since it was first posited in 1965. Gordon Moore coined the golden rule which observes and predicts that the number of transistors in a microchip double roughly every two years. This is largely accomplished by making transistors ever smaller but eventually the physics of semiconductor fabrication like anything else has its limits.The 2015 International Technology Roadmap pinned 2021 as the year when miniaturization would hit its limit. While further progress can arguably be made it becomes economically infeasible to do so. Now that we are 2022 it is arguable whether we have quite reached this point. For its part Intel believes it has ways of extending Moore’s Law into the Angstrom Era using techniques like the stacked forksheet transistor NVIDIA is not quite so optimistic about beating the limits of Moore’s Law but has some other tricks up its sleeve. We had the opportunity to ask NVIDIA Founder and CEO Jensen Huang about his thoughts on process tech in the wake of GTC 2022 and the launch of the Ada Lovelace GeForce 40-Series graphics cards.Dave Altavilla our Editor-in-Chief asked “How impactful was the move from Samsung 8N to TSMC 4N? It seems TSMC 4N was a major advantage for you [NVIDIA]. I just wanted to understand how process plays in the success of Ada Lovelace because it’s an impressive chip.”The response from Huang was that gains were surprisingly modest. “Processed generationally from 8N to 4N that process gain was probably about 15%. But unfortunately the cost goes up by more than 15%” he explained.While he did not elaborate on just how much cost increased he did liken Moore’s Law to a transistor density versus cost curve that historically had been going up. He stated “But for the very first time starting with about I think around seven nanometer yeah around seven nanometer the curve actually turned down. It didn’t flatten out. It turned down.” The NVIDIA CEO then just put it bluntly noting “Moore’s Law is dead.”As process tech has approached physical limits the intricacy of production has dramatically increased. Jensen explained that its chip development is accomplished in a series of steps with approximately one step completed in fab per day. Current cycle times have ballooned to around four months from start to finish.“It’s not because TSMC is trying to capture more profit. That’s just not true” he assured “That’s a lot of steps. And so you could say that the equipment’s more expensive it takes more time in the fabs.”Huang explains that “the way that we solved it Dave with Ada is architecture .” Ada combines multiple architectures—CUDA Tensor and RT. While traditional progress has been made via CUDA for rendering and rasterization Jensen noted that Tensor and artificial intelligence are the “giant lever” for Ada.“I would say that DLSS produces a better-looking pixel than GroundTruth than the rendered pixel that we computed in the past” elaborated Huang claiming objectivity. He continued saying “And the reason for that is because DLSS learned that pixel not by computing it learned from a 16K image. Not a 4K resolution image a 16K resolution image. And so the pixels that it learned from were beautiful. There were no pixels. It’s close to raw. And so we had AI learn the colors to put in there and it puts in a better looking color.”Interestingly NVIDIA's technology advancement with DLSS 3 does also in a way mark a reduced need for pure GPU rendering at least when graphical demands are high. The CEO has asserted that artificial intelligence does it better. “It’s sufficiently subtle that in my opinion it’s better than GroundTruth” he stated “It’s definitely different than GroundTruth but it’s better than GroundTruth.”To accomplish this graphics rendering has transcended a set of operations running in individually siloed machines across the world. “Ada is generating computer graphics not just at the moment. There’s a supercomputer in the background that was training the neural network” says Huang “And so in a lot of ways Ada is Ada plus the supercomputer we have. And that’s the future. That’s the future and that’s the reason why computer graphics is so amazing.”Huang went on further to note that “...the combination between the supercomputer for priority training and coding the knowledge of pixels into the neural network and then processing the neural network which is structurally really good for tensor core processing we effectively multiply the throughput of our GPUs by a factor of eight. Well that more than overcame the weakness of Moore’s Law.”Speaking about DLSS 3 specifically  Huang reflected “Without the CPU even doing anything we generated an extra frame. It’s not predicting the future yet but it’s close and it predicted an extra frame without the CPU ever having to touch it.” If these frames are accurate and look just as good as traditional rendering—if not better—then we are excited to see what advancements this brings in the future.“Well we just doubled the frame rate but the neural network is doing all the work. And so I think we have to overcome the weakness that we’re at the end of Moore’s Law not by giving up but by coming up with a lot more clever techniques and thank goodness artificial intelligence came just in time.”Some have been resistant to the advent of neural networks and a shift way from the “ground truth” of raw GPU rendering in general. To that end we could ask what the purpose of a graphics card is—Is it not to generate as much pleasing eye-candy as possible?Yes the way this has been accomplished historically is through rendering but it is not the only path forward. Our desires alone cannot beat physics. While AI upscaling techniques have had a shaky start with some peculiar artifacts and quirks the technology has advanced and improved rapidly and dramatically. And of course we can't pretend that traditional rendering has been immune to issues either.The unfortunate consequence as alluded to in the process tech discussion is that costs have increased. Hitting the Moore’s Law wall hurts but AI could likely provide the avenue forward and back to lower cost solutions eventually. For those who expect or depend on “pure” rendering and rasterization though the way ahead will likely only become more expensive."

In July and August 32 students came to CERN to work hands-on with cutting-edge computing technologies through the CERN openlab Summer Student programme. Last week the students presented their projects in a series of five-minute “lightning talks”.

CERN openlab is a unique public–private partnership through which CERN collaborates with leading technology companies – including Intel Oracle Siemens Micron Google and IBM – to accelerate innovation in the computing technologies needed by its research community. Today over 30 joint R&D projects are being carried out at CERN through CERN openlab.

Education and training are important parts of CERN openlab’s mission. Thus each year the companies participating in CERN openlab sponsor a nine-week summer-student programme. The selected students participate in a series of lectures (available free and online here) visit different parts of the Laboratory and work on projects guided by IT experts at CERN. This year projects addressed technologies such as quantum computing supercomputing machine learning and open data.

“During their stay at CERN the students are immersed in an environment of cutting-edge technology and innovative thinking” says Enrica Porcari head of the CERN IT department. “They also bring fresh ideas and approaches to the teams they work with at CERN.”

32 students from 19 countries were selected for the 2022 CERN openlab Summer Student programme from 1770 applications. Their five-minute “lightning talks” summarising their projects can be accessed here: http://cern.ch/go/n9Mr and http://cern.ch/go/t6fX. A panel of judges scored the talks with the top three students receiving prizes from CERN. The top three were as follows:

1st place: Kane Bruce (USA) ‘EOS continuous integration improvements (ARM64 Ubuntu OpenSUSE)’.

2nd place: Jay Patel (India) ‘Generative models using Continuous Variable Quantum Computing’.

3rd place: Leyla Naz Candogan (Turkey) ‘Boosting online recalibration of physics objects for the 40 MHz scouting demonstrator system at CMS’.

This year’s summer students were also joined by the winners of two recent competitions. Jay Patel a computer-engineering student from India was awarded a place in the programme as a prize for having won the QHACK quantum machine-learning hackathon in February. Three other prize winners from the QHACK also came to CERN for a special week-long visit in July. “I was amazed by the work environment at CERN” says Patel. “I really felt welcomed and after doing a master’s in quantum computing I would love to go back and work at CERN.”

Eugenio Marinelli came to CERN after winning the oneAPI Great Cross-Architecture Challenge organised by Intel with support from CERN and Argonne National Laboratory in the US. He used the set of cross-architecture libraries found in the oneAPI toolkit to develop a new application for quickly and accurately decoding digital data stored in synthetic DNA. “My experience at CERN was very good” says Marinelli who is now studying for a PhD at EURECOM in France. “I particularly enjoyed being exposed to the international environment at the Laboratory.”

The process of drying of a little drop of fluid can tell scientists a whole story. For about two decades now the ‘coffee ring effect’ has been known as when a drop of spilt coffee dries up the outermost edge of the dried drop is a little darker than the centre forming a darker ‘ring’. This is caused by the outward drift of suspended coffee particles from the centre causing a denser darkened rim. Now researchers from Indian Institute of Technology Madras have shown that after reaching the rim as the drop dries some of the particles undergo an inward drift too. This research has applications in agriculture forensic science and even disease diagnosis. The present work has been published in the journal Soft Matter.

Inward drift

The work consists of experimental and theoretical parts. Taking polystyrene microbeads of diameters 3 microns 5 microns and 10 microns the researchers suspend them in clean water at concentration of 30000 beads per microlitre for the first two sizes and 10000 beads per microlitre for the last and place a drop of the suspension on a glass plate. They are able to observe the inward drift. “The migration of particles to the edge has been known for more than 20 years now. But after the particles reach the rim they experience an inward drift and this is what we have newly discovered” says Madivla G. Basavaraj Chemical Engineering Department and an author of the paper in an email to The Hindu. He clarifies that while the inward drift would persist for sub-micron-sized particles it would decrease with particle size.

Gapped coffee ring

The inward movement takes place because the particles are ‘squished’ between the solid plate and the evaporating liquid interface. Hence the ‘coffee’ ring is not formed at the point where the liquid touches the solid but there is a small gap between the outermost edge and the ring. Using the theory of evaporating drops the researchers could calculate the rate at which the liquid interface gets flattened. “We could convert the rate of flattening of the interface to the rate of inward movement of the particles. Hence we were able to predict the extent up to which the particles recede namely the stain recedes” says Sumesh P. Thampi also from the Chemical Engineering Department and an author of the paper. Perhaps measuring the gap can help in forensics.

Disease diagnosis

Prof. Basavaraj explains that some qualitative studies have shown that understanding the drying of biologically relevant fluids like blood can help diagnose anaemic and hyperlipidaemic conditions.

“One of the long-term goals of this team is to work with simulated [fluids] as well as blood drawn from different individuals with different conditions to come up with early diagnostic strategies” he says. The researchers hypothesise that size-based separation of different molecules in biological fluids can provide useful information about disease conditions.",,,

This article explains how to set up and use the Microsoft Family Safety app for your child's Android phone.



How to Use the Microsoft Family Safety App

The Microsoft Family Safety app is Microsoft's answer to Google's Family Link app. It provides insights into how your child is using their phone their location and even lets you set time limits on app use and game time.

Using Microsoft Family Safety has a few prerequisites. You need to have a Microsoft Family Group your child needs to have Microsoft Launcher and Edge installed on their phone and you need to add your child as a member of your family group.

To get started visit the Microsoft Family Safety page. If you haven't signed in with your Microsoft account yet you'll be prompted to. Then you can select Create a family group to get started. To create your family group for the first time you'll need to answer a few questions such as your region how many children you have in the family and their ages. When you're logged into your Microsoft account select the Add a member link in the Family section to start adding family members to the group. You'll be prompted to add a new family member to your group. If you're adding a spouse select Organizer. If you're adding a child select Member. Enter the email address the correct Captcha code and select Send invite. When the child account is first added you'll need to configure what organizers in your Microsoft Family Group can see. Under your Child's account select Manage permissions. Enable organizer permissions under all sections. Your child should receive an email with the invite to the Microsoft Family Group. Have them open the email and select Join Now. Once your child has joined the group they'll also need to install the Microsoft Launcher app onto their phone so that you can track their location. Currently this app is only available for Android. Help your child go into the app permissions for the Microsoft Launcher app and enable at least the Location setting. For other Microsoft Family Safety features to work you'll need take make sure your child also has Microsoft Edge installed on their mobile device. You'll need to give the Microsoft Safety Family app some time to sync with the Microsoft Launcher app before you'll see all of the menus appear.

Monitoring Mobile Usage With Microsoft Family Safety

Once the Microsoft Family Safety group is synced there are a lot of things you can see and control on your child's mobile device.

The Activity tab is where you can access all of the settings on one page. This is also where you can enable or disable overall monitoring. One of the first things you should do is enable Activity reporting as well as Email weekly reports to me if you'd like to receive email updates about their mobile usage. The Screen time tab is where you can control at what time of day your child is allowed to use their devices. Currently these settings are only for Windows 10 or Xbox devices and not mobile phones. App and game limits is where you can either block the child from using certain apps or you can set a time range when they're allowed to use them. Content restrictions lets you manage what kind of content or apps your child is allowed to access based on age limit. Toward the bottom of this page you can either always block or always allow specific websites as well regardless of the browser your child is using. On the Spending page you can require your child to ask permission if they ever want to buy an app from the Microsoft Store. You can also add money to their Microsoft account balance. One of the coolest features in Microsoft Family Safety is the Find your child page. On this page you'll see the current location of your child.

Microsoft Family Safety for Android

If your child has an Android phone the Microsoft Family Safety app because it's less intrusive is a useful alternative to other parental control apps.

Keep in mind however that using Microsoft Family Safety requires your child to willingly join your Microsoft Family Safety group and keep the required apps installed. So make sure to talk with your child before setting everything up so that everyone is on the same page regarding appropriate use of mobile devices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL3dpbGwtbWljcm9zb2Z0LWJlLXdvcnRoLW1vcmUtdGhhbi1hcHBsZS1ieS0yMDI1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Microsoft Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL3dpbGwtbWljcm9zb2Z0LWJlLXdvcnRoLW1vcmUtdGhhbi1hcHBsZS1ieS0yMDI1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673FFC6980>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The company is seeking emergency use authorization of its updated vaccine in two age groups – adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and children aged six to 11.

The application for the bivalent vaccine for children between the ages of six months and under six years is expected to be completed later this year the company said in a tweet.

Earlier this week the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it expects COVID-19 vaccine boosters targeting circulating variants of the virus to be available for children aged 5-11 years by mid-October.

Moderna’s mRNA-1273.222 a bivalent booster shot contains the dominant BA.4/BA.5 variants along with the original coronavirus strain.

The updated vaccine is already authorized for adults while rival Pfizer’s bivalent vaccine is authorized as a booster dose for children over 12 years of age.

The U.S. government has ordered more than 170 million updated vaccine booster shots for this fall and said on Tuesday it had sent out over 25 million doses to be distributed.

That duo — Nebraska Total Care and United HealthCare of the Midlands — will have a new partner: Molina Healthcare of Nebraska according to a statement.

Concerns about the past

State officials described the five providers that had submitted bids as excellent contenders for the Medicaid Heritage Health program which provides physical and behavioral health care pharmacy and dental services to about 340000 low-income and disabled Nebraskans.

But of the narrowed choice DHHS chief executive Dannette Smith said: “We’re excited to work with these three health plans to ensure Medicaid members in Nebraska continue to receive the health care that they need.”

“We believe that having three vendors strikes an appropriate balance between affording our members a choice of health plans and creating a favorable market for potential bidders” spokesman Jeff Powell said.

While actual contract costs can vary in any given year Powell said the department anticipates spending $12 billion to $15 billion over the five-year span of the contract or $4 billion to $5 billion per plan.

The next five-year contractual period that begins at the start of 2024 provides two-year optional renewals.

DHHS sought requests for proposals in April and bids were received in July.

Some state senators have expressed concern about the state’s procurement process saying that administrators should consider superior service and not the lowest cost which has caused trouble in past state bidding selections.

They point to the multimillion-dollar mistakes over “bad bids” that were approved for services including the state’s Medicaid managed care program and for two computer systems.

In 2019 the state made what would later amount to a $158 million mistake in awarding a contract to oversee the state’s child welfare system to St. Francis Ministries of Kansas. That financially troubled nonprofit’s $197 million bid was later revealed to be markedly low requiring $158 million more in funding.

‘Listening tour’

State Sen. John Arch of La Vista chair of the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee said Friday his concern has always been that the state follow a “fair and thorough procurement process.”

“I have been assured by the department that this was their goal as well” he said.

Arch said DHHS officials are to brief his committee on Nov. 4.

Medicaid Director Kevin Bagley said he was “extremely pleased” with all bids. “Ultimately while we had to choose three all five bids were impressive and showed high regard for the Medicaid program and Nebraska.”

In the past losing bidders have appealed the state’s selections.

In the latest process bidders were scored based on quality appropriateness and thoroughness a news release said. Stakeholder input also was sought. DHHS interviewed the bidders for more detail.

Administrators said they will work with the selected health plans to transition smoothly. Medicaid officials also are to continue to meet with members of the community across Nebraska about the changes and said they will adjust the plans as needed.

The next “listening tour” is to be held in mid- to- late October.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivQFodHRwczovL29tYWhhLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0YXRlLWFuZC1yZWdpb25hbC9nb3Z0LWFuZC1wb2xpdGljcy9zdGF0ZS1waWNrcy10d28tY3VycmVudC1vbmUtbmV3LWhlYWx0aC1wbGFuLWZvci1tZWRpY2FpZC1tYW5hZ2VkLWNhcmUtY29udHJhY3RzL2FydGljbGVfNTQxNTg5NjItM2I2Mi0xMWVkLWJjZDMtZTNjZTRmYjk3MzhjLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,State picks two current one new health plan for Medicaid managed care contracts,"LINCOLN — Nebraska officials announced Friday that they have chosen three health plans to manage the bulk of the state’s $1.8 billion Medicaid program.

The three are Molina Healthcare of Nebraska Nebraska Total Care and United HealthCare of the Midlands. Two Nebraska Total Care and United HealthCare have current contracts with the state. Molina Healthcare is new to Nebraska but provides Medicaid Medicare and Affordable Care Act marketplace plans in several other states.

“We’re excited to work with these three health plans to ensure Medicaid members in Nebraska continue to receive the health care that they need” said Dannette R. Smith CEO of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.

HHS plans to contract with the three companies to manage physical and behavioral health care pharmacy services and dental benefits for almost all Medicaid patients in a program called Heritage Health. Together they will oversee the care of some 347000 Nebraskans.

The winning bidders were selected from among five contenders. Not chosen were Community Care Plan of Nebraska doing business as Healthy Blue which currently contracts with the state and Medica Community Health Plan which currently offers health coverage to Nebraskans through the ACA marketplace.

It remains to be seen whether either of the losing bidders will appeal the state’s decision as occurred when the current contracts were awarded.

State lawmakers have criticized Nebraska’s procurement process after at least three cases in which the process led to the selection of a low-cost bidder that ended up failing to do the job.

State Medicaid Director Kevin Bagley said he was “extremely pleased” with all five bids. He said they were scored based on quality appropriateness and thoroughness and officials did an optional interview with each bidder to find out more about their plans and priorities.

Bagley said key issues during the interviews included incorporating dental services within the health plans actively using voluntary care and case management to improve members’ lives standardizing certain requirements for providers providing innovations to add value to members’ health care experiences and improving access to providers across Nebraska.

The new contracts are slated to start Jan. 1 2024 six months later than previously planned. Bagley said officials will be working with the three plans during that time to provide for an orderly transition from the current contracts.

In addition he said Medicaid officials will be meeting with people across Nebraska both in person and online to talk about the changes answer questions and adjust plans as needed. A listening tour will be held in mid- to late October with more details to come.

The current Heritage Health contracts date to 2017 when the state signed with three private companies to administer what was then $1.2 billion worth of Medicaid services. Since then two of the original three companies merged which led to the state signing a contract with Healthy Blue.

Heritage Health does not cover nursing home care and other long-term support and services for the elderly and people with disabilities.",,,,,,,,,

NEW YORK -- Apple Music is replacing Pepsi as the new sponsor for the NFL's Super Bowl halftime show.

The multi-year partnership was announced Friday and financial terms weren't disclosed. In a statement the NFL said that it ""couldn't think of a more appropriate partner"" for the show. The halftime show is most-watched musical performance of the year with 120 million people watching this year's performance.

Apple Music's sponsorship begins at the next Super Bowl on February 12 2023 in Glendale Arizona. More details about the show including performers will be released in the coming months on Apple Music's social platforms.

Pepsi has been the NFL's halftime show sponsor for the past decade. However it announced in May that it was ending its halftime show sponsorship however it still remains the league's official soft drink after a 10-year deal struck last May.

Pepsi isn't the only beverage brand dialing back its presence at the big game. Anheuser-Busch announced earlier this year that it ended its more-than-33-year-old exclusive deal with the Super Bowl allowing other alcohol brands to jump in. For example Molson Coors quickly purchased a 30-second spot.

The Super Bowl routinely gets more than 100 million viewers in the United States a gold mine for advertisers. Variety recently reported that Fox which is airing next year's game is ""nearly sold out of commercial inventory"" with several spots going for ""north of $7 million.""

“Guided by my values tendency to question and desire to serve others I am a quiet force.”

Hometown: I’m from Ardmore Pennsylvania.

Fun Fact About Yourself: When I was in undergrad my university sponsored a trip to Las Vegas so I could compete in a food trivia competition. My team won.

Undergraduate School and Major: I graduated from Penn State where I double majored in Spanish and Food Science.

Most Recent Employer and Job Title: I worked at Mondelez International as an Oreo product developer.

What has been your first impression of the Harvard Business School MBA students and alumni you’ve met so far. Tell us your best Harvard Business School story so far. The community’s diverse perspectives level of accomplishment across a breadth of industries and willingness to help among MBA students/alumni has left an extremely positive lasting first impression. It’s difficult to choose one story because there are so many. Some examples that come to mind are the inquiries in the student Slack that immediately receive answers from classmates to conversations that end with an open door message along the lines of “I’d like to help you in any way.”

What makes the case method so attractive as a means to learn and become a better manager? The case method requires students to not only learn the course subject matter within the context of a relevant situation but also incorporate insights of peers. As a result students are equipped to be better managers with strong communication skills who can solve real-world problems in teams.

Aside from your classmates and cases what was the key part of Harvard Business School’s MBA programming that led you to choose this business school and why was it so important to you? If the section experience can be treated separately from classmates and classes the section experience was a key factor in choosing HBS. I sought the resources of a larger program and smaller intimate community that would include people beyond those in the same recruiting pathway or affinity groups. Aside from the section experience the FIELD Global Immersion capstone in the second half of the first year was a key factor in choosing HBS. It provides a unique but shared opportunity among the entire class to apply what we’ve learned during the year to a company while expanding our global perspective.

What course club or activity excites you the most at Harvard Business School? I look forward to the student club conferences that bring in thought leaders in industry and would like to plan a conference in my second year.

When you think of Harvard Business School what is the first word that comes to mind? Why? Possibility. The MBA program is a brief 2-year development in general management that alumni value throughout their personal and professional opportunities after school.

Describe your biggest accomplishment in your career so far: I played a critical role in qualification of manufacturing lines to produce Oreos that delivered a cost savings and improved product quality.

What led you to pursue an MBA at this point and what do you hope to do after graduation? I decided early in my life that I wanted to work in consumer goods as a food scientist to develop new and better food options for people around the globe. After working in research and development for a few years in a number of different roles I learned about other significant functions and aspects of the food industry that interested me along with respective career paths that often required an MBA. I hope to pivot to corporate development within the food industry.

What is one thing you have recently read watched or listened to that you would highly recommend to prospective MBAs? Why? I found the Clear Admit podcast available on Spotify and Apple podcast app to be helpful during the application process with its guests from business schools and tips on applications.

What other MBA programs did you apply to? I also applied to Cornell-Johnson Michigan-Ross MIT-Sloan Northwestern-Kellogg and Wharton.

What advice would you give to help potential applicants gain admission into Harvard Business School’s MBA program? Apply and have confidence in your unique story! I would also remind potential applicants that while the application process is deeply introspective and individualized it is not completely insular. Along with the advocacy of recommenders – two for Harvard Business School – potential applicants can consider leveraging or expanding their support network. For me someone with a less stereotypical pre-MBA background and fewer connections with MBAs the guidance and support from the Forté Foundation were instrumental to my success. There are other formal organizations like Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT) and Access as well as certain school affinity clubs and organic online communities that potential applicants can explore if they have questions.

Dollar sales in the cookie category were $10.8 billion up 9.4% from the same period a year ago IRI said. Unit sales dipped 1.6% to 3.5 billion.

Leading the category was Nabisco with sales of $3.5 billion in the 52 weeks up 3.4% from the year-ago period. Private label cookie sales were $890 million an increase of nearly 15% from the year-ago 52-week period. Pepperidge Farm cookies accounted for $531 million in sales a 3.8% increase from the same period a year ago according to IRI.

As trends in consumer behavior revealed increased preferences for snacking innovation in the category displayed an appeal to seasonal sensibilities. Several cookie companies introduced products in flavor profiles of the season with pumpkin spice emerging as the fall favorite.

While Campbell Soup Co.’s Pepperidge Farm cookies showed solid growth in the past year the company leaned into the strength of its largest snack brand Goldfish with the introduction of a limited-time sweet snack collaboration with Dunkin’ Brands. The release of Goldfish Dunkin’ Pumpkin Spice Grahams followed comments from Mark A. Clouse president and chief executive officer of Campbell Soup during the company’s June 8 conference call to discuss third-quarter financial results. Mr. Clouse said the Goldfish brand has “grown from a favorite kids’ food to a top choice of their teen siblings and their parents.”

Goldfish Dunkin’ Pumpkin Spice Grahams were crafted with coffee drinkers in mind as they resonate with notes of pumpkin donut glaze and warm spices — including cinnamon cloves and nutmeg according to the company.

Nabisco’s parent company Mondelez International has announced plans to invest into segments driven by snacking including biscuits and chocolate.

“Our annual state of snacking survey shows that consumers increasingly prefer snacking over traditional meals” Dirk Van de Put CEO of Mondelez said in a July 26 conference call to discuss second-quarter earnings. “And because snacking plays such an important role in consumers’ lives our core categories of chocolate and biscuits historically have resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions.”

Nabisco released a limited-time cookie in July with Neapolitan Oreos. According to the company Neapolitan Oreos provide “a playful twist on ice cream with a unique waffle cone-flavored base cake.” The cookies feature three crème layers matching those found in Neapolitan ice cream: vanilla strawberry and chocolate.

Mondelez’s belVita cookies brought in $426 million in sales in the 52 weeks ended Aug. 7 according to IRI. In August belVita was ranked as the fastest growing brand globally in “Food & Drink 2022” a report by London-based consultancy company Brand Finance.

The Voortman brand of Hostess Brands Inc. saw a 24% sales jump to $176 million in the same period IRI said.

“Voortman growth continues to be driven by expanding distribution.” Andrew P. Callahan president and CEO of Hostess Brands Inc. said in an Aug. 3 conference call with analysts to discuss second-quarter earnings.

Voortman accounts for approximately 10% of the Hostess sales he said.

“We are by far the leading share within our sugar-free portfolio” Mr. Callahan said. “That subsegment of sugar-free is growing at — consistently growing at two times the rate of total sugar.”

Voortman recently debuted two fall-inspired wafers: pumpkin spice and s’mores. In the summer two limited-edition crème wafer flavors were offered: raspberry lemonade and tropical fruit.

Enjoying a large jump in the 52 weeks ended Aug. 7 Tate’s Bake Shop sales jumped 31% to $170 million according to IRI. Tate’s released a limited edition offering of pumpkin spice cookies with creamy white chocolate chips.

“Consumers’ enthusiasm for pumpkin spice shows no sign of slowing down” said Lauren Sella chief marketing officer of Tate’s. “Tate’s Bake Shop is excited to debut our crispy cookie twist on this classic fall trend. We remain committed to expanding our portfolio to meet the evolving tastes of our customers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhenp1cC5waC9tb25kZWxlei1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXN1cHBvcnRzLWRpc2FzdGVyLXByZXBhcmVkbmVzcy1pbi1ib2hvbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mondelēz International Supports Disaster Preparedness in Bohol,"Mondelēz International Supports Disaster Preparedness in Bohol

Working with Philippine Business for Social Progress to provide preparedness tools to the community

Mondelēz International a snacks company with 59 years of heritage in the Philippines recently launched a partnership with Philippine Business for Social Progress (PBSP) and the municipality of San Miguel in Bohol province. This partnership aims to strengthen the preparedness of the community in facing and recovering from disasters such as typhoons.

It has often been said Filipinos are amongst the most resilient people in the world. No matter the disaster we can pick-up the pieces survive and rebuild again. However there is only so much resilience one can withstand. Instead communities must be like the mighty bamboo – able to face down the strongest winds without falling.

Mondelēz International is the maker of beloved snacks such as Tang Eden cheese Cheez Whiz Oreo Tiger Cadbury Dairy Milk and Toblerone. Its purpose is to empower people to snack right with the right snack for the right moment and made the right way. The latter means making our snacks sustainably using less resources and lessening the impact of our operations on the environment. This focus on sustainability also extends to its community involvement programs such as this partnership with the PBSP. Established in 1970 PBSP is the largest business-led social development organization in the country committed to poverty reduction. PBSP has been at the forefront of advocating for stronger corporate citizenship with the aim of supporting inclusive national development.

Preparedness from Awareness

This partnership involves two areas: preparedness through early warning for typhoons and tools for rebuilding homes that provide livelihood to skilled workers. When Typhoon Odette hit Visayas and Mindanao in late 2021 it caused so much destruction to houses buildings and unfortunately lives. It was seen that an important factor in lessening the impact of a disaster is the capacity of the community to prepare for such an event. After Typhoon Odette’s destruction Mondelēz International and PBSP extended immediate relief to 600 families affected in the areas of Ilog in Negros Occidental; Southern Cebu; Bubong in Lanao del Sur; Siargao in Surigao del Norte and Roxas in Palawan.

San Miguel in Bohol was also affected by Typhoon Odette. To ensure that its 18 barangays are aware of incoming typhoons the partnership will provide them with an early warning system as well as 2-way radios for communicating to areas that are farther from the municipal center and might not have access to other media for information. These devices would help ensure that communities are aware of the incoming typhoon as well as any evacuation warnings from the government.

Building Livelihood

In addition to being aware of incoming typhoons the communities will also be prepared to build back homes in the event of any destruction. The partnership will also provide 59 sets of carpentry tools which skilled workers in the community can use when making house repairs. These tools will be useful for restoring the housing units of the San Miguel constituency and at the same time provide and additional source of income for their skilled workers and laborers.

According to San Miguel Mayor Ian Gil G. Mendez the partnership will provide great assistance and preparedness to their municipality. “Thank you for choosing the people of San Miguel especially our volunteers who helped rebuild the municipality after we were struck by typhoon Odette last year” he shared.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldGluZy1iZWF0LmNvLnVrLzIwMjIvMDkvMjMvY2FkYnVyeS10YXN0ZS1sZWQtY2FtcGFpZ24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cadbury Dairy Milk unveils new taste-led campaign,"Cadbury Dairy Milk has launched a new taste-led marketing campaign to celebrate the ‘nation’s favourite’ chocolate.

Coca-Cola's Global Ventures division will operate under new leadership in 2023 after the US beverage giant announced Evguenia Stoichkova as President.



Outgoing President Jennifer Mann was named as President of the Coca-Cola's North America operating unit in August 2022.



Mann had overseen Coca-Cola's Global Ventures division since 2019 after the US company acquired coffee chain Costa Coffee for £3.9bn ($4.8bn).



Most of Coca-Cola's Global Ventures division’s revenue is generated by Costa Coffee with the organisation also responsible for the Monster beverages Innocent juices and smoothies and Dogadan Tea brands.



Stoichkova currently serves as President of the company’s Eurasia & Middle East operating unit a position she has held since 2021. Stoichkova begins her new role on 1 January 2023 and will report to President and Chief Financial Officer John Murphy.



In July 2022 Coca-Cola credited the continued recovery of the coffee chain in the UK as well as the expansion of the brand globally as positively impacting its 12% second-quarter rise in revenues. In the previous quarter Costa Coffee contributed to a 28% rise in revenues for its Global Ventures division.



Costa Coffee is Europe’s largest coffee chain operating nearly 2800 coffee shops in the UK and Ireland and a further 1100 internationally.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthbWNpdHkuY29tL25hbW5ld3MvcHJvZHVjdHMtcHJvbW90aW9ucy9tb25zdGVyLWFkZHMtdHdvLW1vcmUtdmFyaWFudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Monster Adds Two More Variants,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.kamcity.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /namnews/products-promotions/monster-adds-two-more-variants/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674004E410>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthbWNpdHkuY29tL25hbW5ld3MvcHJvZHVjdHMtcHJvbW90aW9ucy9tb25zdGVyLWFkZHMtdHdvLW1vcmUtdmFyaWFudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNhbmRzcHVyLm9yZy9hLW5ldy1wYXJ0LW9mLXRoZS1kYWlseS1ncmluZC1mcmFwcGVzdGFyLWNvZmZlZS1vcGVucy1pbi13aW50ZXItcGFyay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A new part of the daily grind: Frappestar Coffee opens in Winter Park,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thesandspur.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /a-new-part-of-the-daily-grind-frappestar-coffee-opens-in-winter-park/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674004FD30>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNhbmRzcHVyLm9yZy9hLW5ldy1wYXJ0LW9mLXRoZS1kYWlseS1ncmluZC1mcmFwcGVzdGFyLWNvZmZlZS1vcGVucy1pbi13aW50ZXItcGFyay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vMTAxNDEzMy90aGUtcmVhbC1yZWFzb24tYmFuZy1lbmVyZ3ktd2FzLXN1ZWQtYnktcHJpbmNlcy1lc3RhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Real Reason Bang Energy Was Sued By Prince's Estate,"The Real Reason Bang Energy Was Sued By Prince's Estate

Ah energy drinks. The highly caffeinated sweetly flavored carbonated beverages that provide a temporary jolt whenever needed have been around for decades. According to Thrillist the invigorating libations made their debut in the mid-20th century when Tri-City Beverage launched Dr. Enuf a vitamin- and caffeine-infused drink that claimed to be ""the original energy booster"" in ads. Years later in the 1960s Japanese company Taisho Pharmaceutical Holdings created Lipovitan an innovative effervescent drink containing taurine and B vitamins. Over the years a number of mega-popular energy drink brands have entered the market including Red Bull Monster Rockstar and Bang Energy.

Bang Energy which was founded in 1993 by wellness and fitness advocate Jack Owoc offers a wide variety of flavors in its lineup many of which have quirky catchy names such as Blue Razz Mango Bango Delish Strawberry Kiss and Radical Skadattle (whatever that even means). One Bang flavor in particular however stirred up quite a buzz with a late rock star's fortune resulting in a lawsuit that will go down in history."

It is an important year for quantum computing according to GlobalData’s Technology Media and Telecoms Predictions 2022. In addition to the high levels of hype generated around this disruptive technology significant technical advances have seen companies starting to invest in exploring its potential benefits.

The global quantum computing market size is set to reach $1.77bn by 2026 up from $472m in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate of 30.2% according to Markets and Markets. Pioneering adoption of quantum computing by financial services companies is expected to drive this growth.

Is the financial services industry prepared for quantum?

What does a quantum advantage over classical computing mean for financial services? Increasing the speed and volume of calculations and transactions by multiples represents the biggest change for a post-quantum financial services sector – and the key to identifying the potential benefits of specific use cases is exploration. Early iterations of quantum computing-as-a-service are under way with Big Tech companies Microsoft Amazon IBM and Google offering clients a cloud service for experimenting with quantum simulators (essentially classical computers mimicking quantum computers in the cloud to see what they can do).

This collaborative approach between businesses and tech companies addresses two problems in tandem: first it allows businesses to familiarise themselves with the emerging technology despite quantum supremacy being some years away; second it tackles the biggest business challenge which is identifying the most effective use cases for financial services.

US tech giant IBM’s quantum accelerator programme was set up with exactly that in mind: to allow businesses themselves to find effective quantum computing use cases. Many of IBM’s financial services clients in the accelerator programme have initial concerns about the effect quantum computing will have on cryptography according to Prakash Pattni managing director for financial services – digital transformation at IBM.

“It took a few years for banks to work out where blockchain fits in with cryptography for example and we are now at a stage where blockchain is really taking off” he says.

Pattni likens quantum computing as being at that same early stage of experimentation as blockchain was. Financial services companies are perhaps even more acutely aware of the potential impact of quantum computing on data security because the nature of banking regulation means data has to be stored and kept safe for many years adds Pattni.

While cybersecurity remains a clear concern for clients specific use cases are still being worked out. Again experimentation is key according to Pattni who says: “I think we’ are still at that very early stage in terms of experimentation where quantum is concerned.” According to Gartner 40% of large companies are planning to create initiatives around quantum computing by 2025 but even with accelerator programmes and research and development budgets very specific use cases are still proving hard to identify.

Financial services particularly those which work across multiple markets stand to benefit greatly from efficiencies enabled by quantum computing given that it enables the modelling of multiple permutations of different scenarios or values to solve the most efficient outcomes in a fraction of the time it would take classical computing.

Pattni believes this could be particularly useful in the cross-border fraud detection space saying: “Real-time payments mean the window to look at fraud needs to be in real time too.” As AI is increasingly integrated into banking systems the interface between AI and quantum computing is also a testing ground. Pattni says risk calculation is an area that investment banks are looking at.

“It requires incredibly high levels of compute power to run multiple risk scenarios that regulators don’t like so that is another area where quantum computing could be applied but it is still really early days of experimenting with applications” he adds.

Finance’s first movers in quantum computing adoption

EY’s 2022 Quantum Readiness survey produced in collaboration with the UK’s National Quantum Computing Centre found that 81% of senior UK executives expect quantum computing to play a significant role in their industry by 2030. Despite this most companies are taking a ‘watch and see’ approach. However there are those in the finance sector taking a pioneering approach by testing the technology and ramping up investment in a calculated bet that quantum computing will in fact live up to its hype.

US investment bank Goldman Sachs is actively researching how quantum computing can be applied to the pricing of complex derivatives. Computing a price within a complicated contract or statistical model can be an expensive process. Derivatives are so common in finance that even a small improvement in pricing them or in calculating related quantities could be very valuable according to William Zeng head of quantum research for Goldman Sachs who made the claim in September 2022 for Microsoft Azure’s quantum blog.



In March 2022 Spain’s CaixaBank’s life insurance and pensions company VidaCaixa announced that it is using Canadian quantum computing company D-Wave’s cloud service to build a quantum computing application for its investment portfolio selection and allocation activities as well as its portfolio hedging.

According to CaixaBank this is the first time a financial services company has applied quantum computing in investment hedging in the insurance sector. What normally took the bank several hours of computing time was reduced to just minutes representing up to a 90% decrease. This time reduction facilitates increased modelling complexity which is better adapted to real-time markets optimises invested capital while maintaining constant risk levels and improves the hedging decision-making process. The Spanish banking group is evaluating whether to use the application in other areas of its operations over the coming months.



In March 2022 HSBC announced it will join the IBM Quantum Accelerator programme to progress potential quantum use cases in pricing and portfolio optimisation to advance its net-zero goals and to mitigate risks including identifying and addressing fraudulent activity. The collaboration will also include knowledge transfer through internal training programmes as well as actively recruiting quantum computing research scientists to build a dedicated capability within its innovation team.

Elsewhere Standard Chartered has embarked upon research into quantum computers as part of an academic partnership with the Universities Space Research Association. The partnership is already actively developing what is known as the Quantum Computing System for Financial Services and the bank will use it to address the security challenges posed by a super-powerful quantum computer.

Post-quantum security a pressing matter

Both IBM and Google have road maps to create quantum computers capable of defeating current encryption by 2030 according to GlobalData. Despite the cybersecurity industry developing quantum-resistant encryption before that time future quantum computers could decrypt data harvested today. As a result GlobalData expects companies to implement quantum security solutions in 2022 particularly as cybersecurity has become front of mind for business leaders.

Over the past 12 months interest in quantum security has grown considerably in the financial services sector according to Duncan Jones head of cybersecurity at quantum computing company Quantinuum. “This is partly driven by the stream of announcements from the US government highlighting the urgent need to combat the quantum threat alongside the business opportunities” he says.

In addition as more quantum-enabled business use cases emerge so too do the cybersecurity concerns. Jones and his team at Quantinuum are working on ways to remedy this. Quantinuum’s partnership with cybersecurity software company PureVPN uses Quantinuum’s cyber platform Quantum Origin to create and deploy encryption keys generated using a verifiable quantum process which are more secure than keys from unverified classical computing processes.

Every technology advance creates a commensurate cybersecurity challenge and quantum-proofing financial services companies will continue to be a concern alongside the business growth opportunities according to Jones. “Financial services companies are realising there is a new quantum baseline for security and are factoring this into their cyber planning” he adds.

In July 2022 it became public knowledge that US investment bank JPMorgan Chase had hired assistant professor Dr Charles Lim – a world-renowned expert in next-generation quantum-resistant communication networks at the National University of Singapore – to lead the bank’s quantum communications and cryptography. The move not only demonstrates how quantum computing has become a business concern but also highlighted a global race for talent in the field serving as a warning to other financial services companies that they may want to ramp up their search for quantum computing talent. Historically financial services has attracted the brightest and the best with attractive compensation but the sector is now competing with commensurate employee offerings by Big Tech. A battleground for quantum computing talent is set to continue.

Credit rating financial services company Moody's Analytics announced in September 2022 that it is establishing the Moody's Analytics Quantum Computing Team which is perhaps a sign that quantum computing has become part of the financial services establishment. Early adoption of this technology may seem like a choice in 2022 but it may prove vital in future-proofing financial services companies against the changes that it will bring to the sector. As with any emerging technology there are first movers and those that follow the trend – it is still too soon to tell which approach will reap the most benefits.",,,,,,

In the larger of the moves Morgan Stanley on Tuesday gained from UBS a Lafayette Louisiana team led by brokers Matthew G. Doucet Kevin A. Cook Lacy Foreman Labbe and Jeffrey C. White according to registration records. Known at UBS as The A&L Wealth Group the team had managed north of $650 million in client assets according to a source familiar with their practice.

Spokespeople for Morgan Stanley and UBS declined to comment on the move. The brokers could not immediately be reached for comment.

Doucet an 11-year broker who spent his entire career with UBS ranked second on Forbes’ 2022 list of best-in-state next-gen wealth advisors. The publication said he managed $662 million in AUM with a $1 million account minimum.

Cook a 23-year industry veteran started in 1999 at Edward Jones in nearby Broussard Louisiana and joined UBS in 2011 according to his BrokerCheck.

Labbe and White also started at Jones in 2006 and 2008 and joined UBS in 2012 and 2014 according to their respective BrokerChecks. While at Jones Labbe had worked out of Abbeville Louisiana about 20 miles south of Lafayette and White had worked out of Broussard according to the database.

Their recruitment follows Morgan Stanley’s hire in late July of Robert R. Shelton a 35-year industry veteran who had been with Wells since 2012 and joined the same Lafayette office according to registration records and a source familiar with his practice. Shelton who manages roughly $180 million according to the source started in 1986 with ​​Lehman Brothers—a predecessor to Smith Barney and ultimately Morgan Stanley.

Wells Reels in Florida Team

Separately on Thursday Wells recruited a $210 million-asset Morgan Stanley team led by a 40-year industry veteran and his two sons primarily based in Fort Lauderdale according to a spokeswoman for the hiring firm.

Known as the Savarick Group at their former firm the team is led by Roy Savarick who had joined Morgan Stanley’s Smith Barney predecessor in 1994 and his sons Evan Savarick and Matthew Savarick who had spent their respective 8- and 12-year careers with Morgan Stanley according to registration records. They were joined in the move by another broker Molly Pacheco and client associate Jennifer Harley.

The team generates annual production of about $2 million and also has offices in New York City and Breckenridge Colorado according to the Wells spokeswoman. The brokers could not immediately be reached for comment.

The Savarick team had chosen Wells for its “comprehensive approach to serving the high-net-worth client segment with multiple types of lending capabilities the planning process and fiduciary platform” the Wells spokeswoman wrote in an emailed statement.

A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the move.

The team had managed “just north of $100 million” in client assets at the time of an August 2016 profile of Evan Savarick in Financial Planning.

Roy Savarick while registered with Morgan Stanley had worked out of a Florida office and a residence in Breckenridge west of Denver according to his BrokerCheck which as of Friday only shows a Fort Lauderdale office location for Wells. He had started his career in 1982 with Prudential Securities and has served clients’ families for four generations according to his BrokerCheck report and LinkedIn profile.

Both the younger Savaricks are registered out of the Florida office according to their BrokerCheck records.

Evan Savarick’s record shows a client dispute disclosure from October 2020 alleging that he had failed to follow instructions “with respect to managed accounts” going back to August 2019. The claim was settled by Morgan Stanley for $72500 of $140000 requested in order to “avoid the costs and uncertainties of litigation” and Evan was not asked to contribute according to his broker comment.

Pacheco who is registered in New York City began her career in 2018 with Morgan Stanley according to her BrokerCheck.

Both Morgan Stanley and Wells have offered recruiting deals over 300% of a broker’s trailing-12 production to top teams. Recruiters say the wirehouses are adding fuel to an overheated broker recruiting market and pushing offers by some competitors even higher.

Wells Fargo which also last month hired a J.P. Morgan Advisors duo producing $7 million has around 12300 brokers in its wealth division. Morgan Stanley no longer reports headcount as part of its quarterly earnings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0ZXJuLm55dS5lZHUvZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1zdGVybi9mYWN1bHR5LXJlc2VhcmNoL2FtZXJpY2Etcy1mYWxzZS1pZG9sc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | Scott Galloway | America’s False Idols.,"My first job out of UCLA was in the analyst program at Morgan Stanley in the 1980s. Like most of my analyst class I had no idea what investment banking was—only that we were at the helm of the capitalist bobsled and could make a lot of money. We paid scant consideration to the wider role finance played in society. We were charged with birthing the apex predator of the capitalist species the public company. Our economic mission we were told was noble—we were making money helping other people raise money so they could invest money so they could make more money.



I didn’t appreciate it at the time but Ronald Reagan’s election in 1980 had cemented this ethos in both culture and government policy. At his inaugural address the president had drawn the battle lines: “In this present crisis government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” In his presentation of American decline labor and government had allied to suppress the shareholder class producing an anemic economy that threatened the freedom to be successful. Reagan moved quickly to end the government’s restrictions on American economic might: high taxes on our most productive citizens overregulation of business and the beast of entitlement programs gnawing at the roots of capitalism. The Gipper ripped out liberalism and replaced it with rugged individualism and the “right to dream heroic dreams.”



The results were impressive. When I arrived on Wall Street a few years later the economy was roaring. Gross domestic product grew every year of Reagan’s presidency but one and inflation fell from 14 percent to 4 percent. In an ascending era of shareholder value the Dow Jones Industrial Average which had been drifting downward since the mid-1960s doubled.

With very little fanfare Spinal Elements has quietly grown into one of the largest and most routinely innovative spinal implant company in the United States.

Indeed you probably know its product brands better than you know the company—Mosaic Lucent XP Magnum+ Ventan Sapphire X Luna XD Mercury MIS Ti-Bond Overwatch OmegaLIF and Karma.

How did the startup rise from a family and friends funded labor of love into a $100 million spinal implant company which is advancing fundamental shifts in modern spine surgery? OTW sat down with Spinal Elements President and CEO Jason Blain and Chief Marketing Officer Rick Simmons to find out.

Company Background

Spinal Elements has a unique origin story in that the company had no venture capital backing—ever. It was initially funded solely through friends and family. It wasn’t until 2017 fourteen years after it was founded that Blain and his team agreed to in effect sell and merge with Amendia via a private equity funded company—Kohlberg & Company. For as we said 14 years Spinal Elements employed using the modern lingo an “organic” growth model—which of course gave this young company a hard-earned strength scale endurance and culture.

Spinal Elements’ Jason Blain has around 30 years of experience in orthopedics. Before co-founding the company in 2003 Blain’s ortho background included product development manufacturing and regulatory work at leading med tech companies like NuVasive Inc. Alphatec Smith & Nephew plc. He has stewarded the company’s growth from the ground up and believes that this nontraditional path has allowed innovation to thrive at Spinal Elements.

Rick Simmons who came to the company as part of a technology match with Benvenue Medical not only runs marketing but also leads product development teams at Spinal Elements.

Simmons was also a member of Spinal Element’s original advisory board. He brought to the then young company more than 30 years of marketing sales and business leadership.

Simmons started his medical device career in surgical sports medicine and later moved into spine. He was NuVasive Vice President of Sales & Marketing from 2000-2003 and later worked with early stage marketing development companies designing spinal procedural solutions such as TranS1 where he was VP & General Manager from 2003-2010. Simmons acted as corporate consultant to Johnson & Johnson and DePuy Synthes before taking on the role of Vice President of Sales and Marketing with Benvenue Medical from 2014-2020.

Benvenue’s assets were acquired by Spinal Elements in 2020. Simmons came to Spinal Elements around two years ago.

Spinal Elements Product Philosophy: Easier to Use Better Outcomes Better Work Flow

Or as the company itself promises on its website “Overcoming complexity through elegant simplicity.”

According to Blain and Simmons Spinal Element’s product portfolio was curated to not only improve patient outcomes by tackling many of spine surgery’s unmet needs but also by designing to fit into and complement the surgical team work flow.

The company was for example among the first to market PEEK interbody devices. The first to secure interbody clearance when the Food and Drug Administration down-classified that device. The first to bring to market a standalone cervical implant. And now (check this out at NASS in a couple weeks) the first to present an MIS no screw no rod posterior cortical fixation system.

Today Spinal Elements is pushing toward $100 million in revenue.

Of course Spinal Elements has also brought to market the full complement of spinal instrumentation: thoracolumbar interbody discectomy thoracolumbar fixation cervical biologics and access systems among other products. Additionally the company offers MIS procedural solutions a brand platform named MIS Ultra®.

MIS Ultra® is an integrated suite of instrumentation for advanced anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) cases MIS transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) solutions lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) solutions and a Kambin’s triangle access and interbody solution—brand named OmegaLIF®.

Surgeon First

“Surgeon First” is the Spinal Elements mantra. Which in practice means easier to use instrumentation better workflow and overall consideration of the surgeon’s needs and guidance when it comes to designing and delivering procedural solutions. And easier to use potentially translates into lower risk of unintended consequences and ultimately better patient outcomes. Rick Simmons explained to OTW how the Spinal Elements team bakes into its instrumentation the five essential steps of a surgeon’s workflow:

gaining safe access

optimizing disc preparation

using appropriate expandable interbody spacers

use of appropriate biologics and

stabilizing the posterior elements.

Seeing instrumentation through the eyes of the surgeon sets up everything that follows—design manufacturing marketing and support.

In addition Simmons explained Spinal Elements has worked hard to develop technology that is much more anatomically friendly creating products that address efficient disc preparation a host of expandable technologies that go in small and become bigger and a movement away from dependence on traditional metal pedicle screws and toward organic tissue sparing spine fixation.

Peer-to-Peer Education

Taking a page out of the past giants in spine surgery—AO Foundation and Sofamor Danek—Spinal Elements has invested significantly into a surgeon peer training and education program. For its MIS Ultra® instrumentation Spinal Elements offers year-round training labs at both corporate and remote locations across the United States which provide both lecture and hands-on clinical training.

No Screws No Rods Better Fusion…It’s Karma

What’s in the pipeline for Spinal Elements in the upcoming year? Blain told us that roughly nine or so relatively new spine technologies are in the works including notably the new Karma® MIS system—a no screw no rod better fusion system.

That’s right Karma is a posterior fixation system that requires no screws nor rods and is also a lower density implant than the traditional pedicle screw system. As a true MIS system the instrumentation is delivered via a single portal incision. Finally the system is metal free and again with the surgeon’s workflow in mind designed to streamline and minimize tissue trauma and OR time. Karma said Simmons provides the same level of secure fixation that the traditional open pedicle screw system does including reduced stress shielding and more physiologic loading of the anterior column reconstruction.

“We're kind of moving away from the existing paradigm of stabilization by substraction” said Simmons. “The currency of the business is the metal pedicle screw. Looks a lot like Home Depot hardware to the patient. When they first see those things in an X-ray it can be intimidating.”

Spinal Elements discovered and then developed a very novel design for spine fusion instrumentation that keeps the patient’s anatomy intact and as Simmons described to OTW “delivers the same kind of stabilization you get with a metal construct by fixating to the strongest portion of the vertebra.”

“We're just trying to preserve the native anatomy for the patient and get the same outcome.” explained Simmons. “So that really kind of sets us apart as not just thinking outside the box but also operationalizing it if you will—making it feasible. That puts the company in a very different light I think with most surgeons.”

Finally Spinal Elements is taking the additive manufacturing revolution in some interesting new directions.

According to Blain “We re-envisioned an interbody device as really a graft containment device with structural support…so rather than a block of metal or plastic it's really a vessel for biologics” explained Blain.

“Because fusion is a biologic process we want to maximize the amount and availability of biologic materials. And our solution in 3D printing does just that by kind of flipping the way we think about those interbody devices and what they can do.”

So we're excited to roll out those solutions and that will be a platform for technologies and launches for years to come for us too. We’re excited to get that in the hands of a broader group of surgeons.”

Indeed Spinal Elements is not only the largest spinal implant company you may never have heard of but it is also moving spine surgery into some very interesting directions. Not only MIS which every company is touting but challenging some basic assumptions about how much hardware is actually required for spine fusion surgery.

Finally Spinal Elements is showing what a true partnership between company and surgeon can look like in terms of instrumentation design and delivery.

Blain and Simmons will be hanging out at Booth #2011 at NASS and we urge all of our readers to check these guys out. Tell them Robin sent you and be sure to use the magic phrase “surgeons first”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVjb3JkLm1lZGlhL3VzLXRyZWFzdXJ5LWNhcnZlcy1vdXQtaXJhbi1zYW5jdGlvbnMtZXhjZXB0aW9ucy1mb3ItaW50ZXJuZXQtcHJvdmlkZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Treasury carves out Iran sanctions exceptions for internet providers,"The U.S. Department of Treasury said it is carving out exceptions within its stifling sanctions on Iran for technology companies providing internet access during recent protests.

The sanctions issued by the U.S. government against Iran make it difficult for U.S. businesses to operate in the country.

But in light of the Iranian government’s decision to shut off parts of its network and access to certain platforms the Treasury Department issued a new license allowing technology companies to offer the Iranian people “with more options of secure outside platforms and services.”

Protests in the country erupted this week over the killing of Mahsa Amini a 22-year-old who died while in police custody after being arrested for violations of the country’s headscarf rules. In response to the protests Iran shut off access to mobile networks at various points over the past week.

The government eventually blocked Instagram — one of the only U.S. social media platforms available in Iran and a lightning rod for the protests. After the block on Instagram WhatsApp was blocked as well limiting the ability of Iranians to communicate with the outside world.

Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo said on Friday that the U.S. is expanding the Iran General License D-2 as a way to help the people participating in protests over Amini’s death.

“With these changes we are helping the Iranian people be better equipped to counter the government’s efforts to surveil and censor them” Adeyemo said. “In the coming weeks OFAC will continue issuing guidance to support the Administration’s commitment to promoting the free flow of information which the Iranian regime has consistently denied to its people.”

The carve-outs include a range of communication-related software and services — from social media platforms to map products video conferencing companies and cloud services. The exemptions include anti-virus and anti-malware software anti-tracking software and Virtual Private Networks (VPN).

The notice also provides the Treasury Department with its ability to provide carve-outs of the sanction bans on a case-by-case basis.

Alp Toker director of internet access monitor NetBlocks told The Record that the move was likely directed at people like Elon Musk who on Monday asked for an exemption from sanctions rules after offering his Starlink satellite broadband service to Iranians.

The order also gives other U.S. companies confidence that they can deliver most ordinary internet software and services without running afoul of U.S. sanctions according to Access Now general counsel Peter Micek.

Access Now monitors government internet shutdowns around the world and Micek explained the U.S. regulators have already heavily penalized tech providers for doing business in Iran and with the Iranian government.

Chinese tech giant ZTE agreed to a $1 billion fine in 2018 and has paid several fines in the past over its work in Iran.

“With this updated license the U.S. government is building on previous ‘carve-outs’ to its sanctions on Iran and updating the license for modern day communications and IT services” Micek said.

“The U.S. has added to the list of exempted tools to include services like video conferencing e-gaming elearning platforms automated translation web maps and user authentication services.”

Some experts wondered whether the U.S. Treasury actions were related to controversy around Meta’s role in the shut downs.

Some online have questioned whether Meta and its subsidiary services — Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp — were working with Iran’s government to limit access.

WhatsApp openly addressed the claims on Thursday writing that it is “not blocking Iranian numbers.”

We exist to connect the world privately. We stand with the rights of people to access private messaging. We are not blocking Iranian numbers. We are working to keep our Iranian friends connected and will do anything within our technical capacity to keep our service up and running — WhatsApp (@WhatsApp) September 22 2022

“We are working to keep our Iranian friends connected and will do anything within our technical capacity to keep our service up and running” the company said. Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri released a similar statement about Instagram.

NetBlocks' Toker said the statement from WhatsApp was enigmatic noting that the allegations of some filtering on their end came because users based outside Iran reported issues.

People whose accounts are registered with Iranian phone numbers but who are not using Iranian networks or telecommunications started having issues with their accounts a couple of days ago. This made some believe Meta was coordinating with Iran’s government to some extent.

“The network restrictions we've observed within Iran would not by themselves explain issues outside Iran hence remaining unexplained” Toker said. “This as well as the timing of the U.S. statement has given way to speculation that Meta might have been involved.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlcC5jb20vbW9zYWljLXN0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZGV0cm9pdC1pcy8yMDIyLzA5LzI0L2NoaWxkLWZhc2hpb24tZW50cmVwcmVuZXVyLXRzaGlydC1jbG90aGluZy1saW5lLW5ldy15b3JrLWZhc2hpb24td2Vlay82OTQ5NjgwMjAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Langston Howard's The Top clothing line to be at New York Fashion Week,"Langston Howard 13 year old t-shirt brand developer left meets Michigan Lt.

The love for art and creating started at a very young age for 13-year-old Langston Howard. He designed his first collection in the first grade taking inspiration from the late American painter Jackson Pollock.

That piece lead to another and another and eventually into Langston’s very own collection of artwork that he displays on his T-shirt line ""The Top.""

“When he (Langston) decides to do something he is relentless” his mother Jacqueline Howard said. “It’s like zero to 100 overnight.”

And according to Langston who lives in metro Detroit his newly created clothing brand is already on its way to“The Top.”

“I’m currently designing pieces that will appear in New York Fashion Week"" in 2023 he said.

The Top is a motivational clothing brand designed to inspire its customers of their limitless potential according to its CEO Langston Howard. The apparel which consists of athletic leisurewear along with hoodies face masks and baseball caps boasts original art designs by Langston paired with inspirational quotes spoken by some of his favorite athletes. Since its launch in March The Top has reached over 200 households via sales though its website and has already made an impact on two notable celebrity rappers: Babyface Ray and Big Sean.

“If you ask me how he does it I have no clue” his mother said describing Langston’s first encounter with Detroit native Sean Anderson — aka Big Sean — at the recent Don Weekend in Detroit. She says Langston’s business acumen is quickly developing into a confident one that is best described as “fearless.”

Langston’s mentor Shawn Wilson echoes his mother’s sentiments while reflecting on the encounter Big Sean and Langston shared. Wilson says that on top of Langton’s confidence his maturity level really helps him soar in rooms.

“He’s wise beyond his years” said Wilson CEO of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan (BGCSM). Wilson says Langston’s unique personality and professional qualities were quickly recognized when he applied to be a part of the organization's Fashion and Merchandising Industry Club.

The fashion club Wilson says is a subgroup program of a larger initiative called The Industry Club that the BGCSM created to help youths dive deeper into their passions.

Inside of The Industry Club the group currently has two additional concentrations outside of fashion: the Sports Esports and Entertainment Industry Club and the Data Science and Risk Management Club. Any member of the BGCSM organization who is 14 and up is welcome to apply to the program of their interest. But Wilson says even if you aren’t of age there still is a possibility to get into a program just as Langston got into the fashion industry program when he was only 13 years old.

“He’s very mature” Wilson said. “His concepts and his designs are mature as well.”

For Langston though aside from his mother being a board member for BGCSM his age prevented him from being paid dollar-wise. But his compensation for his work — success and a trip to the Big Apple — was definitely worth it.

And he is following the same steps that he takes to design his retail pieces he says.

“I’ve always been an artist” the 13-year-old entrepreneur said. “So I brainstorm ideas for about a month … then I sketch the design.

“And then after I have the sketch completed and I have the images that I want to be on the design I show them to a graphic designer and they create the design through their platform.”

After those steps are completed the one-young-man operation moves the designs into manufacturing — which he does himself — just the same as how he started his business his mom said.

“He took the money he received for his 13th birthday and invested it into his company” she said. And according to Langston he has made all his initial investment back plus a profit.

In February Langston’s New York Fashion Week pieces will be showcased on a professional runway. But until then the young businessman says he has a new collection that he will be releasing around October and he is interested in adding a luxury brand to his line. But most importantly Langston says he wants to expand The Top so he can help inspire others.

“As time goes on I would like to expand so other people can see they can get to the top too"" he said. “I want to make it bigger and bigger until The Top gets to the top.""

AI is regarded as an umbrella term that encompasses subfields such as machine learning (ML) which also collaborates with a subfield known as deep learning to emulate human-like decision-making.

From healthcare to autonomous cars AI has begun to penetrate every sphere of our lives including in the formal functions of the state such as taxation border security and even public order.

Although the use of AI in criminal justice is meant to maintain law and order in society it can also induce negative externalities amplify pre-existing prejudices and errors and consequently undermine the efficiency of justice and law enforcement.

Crime prevention on the other hand may be characterised as acts and inventions aimed at reducing crime the likelihood of crime and the negative consequences of crime.

In the context of crime prediction and prevention the term AI can be understood as the growing use of technologies that apply algorithms to large sets of data to either assist human police work or replace it according to a Chinese study published in the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

In the policing and security arena there are currently three types of AI systems being used by law enforcement agencies: biological data recognition systems predictive risk assessments and predictive policing. And to run these systems AI software needs to feed an enormous amount of data which is called 'large data'.

To run the aforementioned three systems machine learning uses a method known as data mining to extract usable data from large datasets to detect patterns in a specific data collection.

On the other hand deep learning allows for decisions to be made with little or no human involvement by using an autonomous information extraction process once specific criteria have been established.

Here the large dataset includes variables on crime and criminal history (time weather location age literacy rate education annual income etc.) and biological data (fingerprints photos iris scans DNA body structure and many more).

Researchers from the University of Manchester and the University of Madrid collaborated in 2018 to build an artificial intelligence system that is based on behavioural biometrics and can accurately identify people by analysing their walking patterns with just a 0.7% mistake rate.

Similar kinds of technologies are now being widely used by Chinese authorities to run their mass surveillance on their population.

In modern-day policing especially in crime detection 'descriptive artificial intelligence' primarily generated from descriptive analytics is spreading its sphere of influence as it can consider several separate variables at a time and provide the fastest possible result.

Police in New Orleans USA with the collaboration of Motorola Solutions have adopted this advanced technology to help track suspects vehicles or places. Law enforcement in Russia and the Chinese government in Hong Kong appear to be using similar kinds of programmes to identify anti-government protesters.

While 'PredPol' is the most commonly used AI-based predictive policing algorithm in the United States 'Dextro' an AI software that analyses scenes to detect objects and activities is being used by different police departments. This technology will help identify crimes in progress for live observation and intervention as well as to support investigation later on.

In Brazil the artificial intelligence tool ""Rosie"" is being used to uncover instances of corruption and unusual expenditure by the country's elected lawmakers.

Automated licence plate readers (ALPR) and facial recognition technology (FRT) are already being used in law enforcement.

Courts in the United States have been using an AI-based predictive analytics tool Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) to determine the likelihood of an offender to re-offend if released on bail.

Furthermore researchers at the University of Cambridge pushed AI facial recognition to a new level by developing the Camouflage Facial Recognition System which can recognize any face even if it is hidden by a mask veil or glass.

Even though nations and organisations are spending billions on building and enhancing AI there are very few initiatives to regulate it.

As of 2018-19 data China France the United Kingdom Japan and India spent $2 billion $1.8 billion $1.2 billion $700 million and $408 million respectively on creating AI technologies for their use.

Throughout 2018–2019 the European Commission the European Union's executive body has allocated $24 billion in public and commercial funding for artificial intelligence development and research to maintain competitiveness with other parts of the world and 'avoid brain drain'.

Even as artificial intelligence gains traction in law enforcement and crime prevention there are relatively few rules and procedures in place to manage and regulate this cutting-edge technology so that privacy can be safeguarded and prejudice can be mitigated in the judicial process.

Most countries have comprehensive federal data policy legislation on par with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU) or the General Data Protection Act (GDPA) of the United Kingdom.

In March of this year China passed a new law that requires tech firms to file details of the algorithms with the country's cyberspace regulator.

The EU submitted a draft AI legislation in April 2021 which according to them focuses on ""The specific utilisation of AI systems and associated risks"". But it is still years away from being adopted.

As we are progressing towards Artificial General Intelligence the superior stage to our current Artificial Narrow Intelligence all governments throughout the globe must lay down policies and regulations before it is too late because the boundary between its use and abuse is dangerously thin.

Head of Indexes U.S.

When the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MSCI EM) launched in January 2001 the market cap weight of the Chinese equity market was just above 6%.

Fast-forward two decades and its market cap weight is now equivalent to one-third of the emerging market (EM) equities.

MSCI EM Index – Exposure to China

As the Chinese market continues growing investors with broad EM exposure have been left with a 33% position in a market that has an incredible amount of both headwinds and tailwinds making it complicated to implement their specific asset allocation views.

WisdomTree is launching XC—the WisdomTree Emerging Markets ex-China Fund—allowing investors to unpack the Chinese exposure in their EM position. Investors will now be able to combine XC with other China-specific exposures like the WisdomTree China ex-State-Owned Enterprises Fund (CXSE) to scale their exposure to their desired asset allocation.

Methodology

The WisdomTree Emerging Markets ex-China Fund will track the WisdomTree Emerging Markets ex-China Index (WTEMXC) which rebalances on an annual basis and provides investors with exposure to non-state-owned companies (non-SOEs) in emerging market countries excluding China.

The investment thesis behind excluding state-owned enterprises (SOEs) when investing in emerging markets is one that we’ve written about in the past. Companies in which the local government has a significant ownership interest (defined as greater than 20%) have exhibited conflicts of interest in their management and tend to have lower profitability than their non-SOE peers. Excluding SOEs also tilts a portfolio toward higher growth sectors like Consumer Discretionary Health Care and Communication Services which reflect the current makeup of EM economies.

In the below chart we can see how since the start of 2008 non-SOEs in the MSCI EM Index have outpaced SOEs by more than 2.5% annually.

Despite recent outperformance by SOEs given the macroeconomic and commodity backdrop we still believe that the risks associated with these types of companies are not justified or rewarded:

MSCI EM Universe

The results of applying the same investment strategy to the MSCI EM ex China Index universe are consistent which shows how this is a persistent issue in most EM countries.

MSCI EM ex China Universe

Exposures

Excluding China from a broad EM universe has considerable consequences in terms of fundamentals sector and country exposures.

Given their high valuations excluding Chinese companies from a broad EM universe results in lower valuations as seen in the table below for the MSCI EM ex China Index. An additional thing to highlight in the below table is how WTEMXC’s SOE screen helps achieve a lower valuation and improves aggregate profitability measures like ROE and ROA.

For definitions of terms in the chart above please visit the glossary.

In the below chart we can see how the MSCI EM ex China Index has a higher exposure to the Financials Materials and Information Technology sectors and a lower exposure to the Consumer Discretionary Health Care and Communication Services sectors compared to the MSCI EM Index. WTEMXC’s ex-SOE screen results in a portfolio with improved exposure toward higher growth sectors like Consumer Discretionary Health Care and Info. Tech. and limits exposure to traditional EM sectors like Energy Financials and Materials compared to the MSCI EM ex China Index.

Sector Exposure

In terms of country exposures excluding close to 33% of the weight results in increased exposure to EM countries such as South Korea Taiwan and India.

Country Exposures

Comparing the top 10 holdings we can get a better understanding of the impact of the China exclusion and the application of WTEMXC’s ex-SOE screen.

Conclusion

Given the significant number of headwinds and tailwinds associated with the Chinese market along with its polarizing nature we believe the launch of XC will allow investors to implement their views on China while maintaining a focused ex-state-owned approach.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lZHVjYXRpb24vbmctaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAyMi9zZXAvMjQvYmVzdC11ay11bml2ZXJzaXRpZXMtZm9yLWJpb2xvZ3ktbGVhZ3VlLXRhYmxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best UK universities for biology – league table | Biosciences,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.theguardian.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /education/ng-interactive/2022/sep/24/best-uk-universities-for-biology-league-table (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026740318460>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lZHVjYXRpb24vbmctaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAyMi9zZXAvMjQvYmVzdC11ay11bml2ZXJzaXRpZXMtZm9yLWJpb2xvZ3ktbGVhZ3VlLXRhYmxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9zdG9jay1jb21tZW50YXJ5LzIwMjIvMDkvMjMvMjIxMTY5My9xdWljay10YWtlcy1hcm91bmQtbWFya2V00gFkaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGhpbHN0YXIuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3N0b2NrLWNvbW1lbnRhcnkvMjAyMi8wOS8yMy8yMjExNjkzL3F1aWNrLXRha2VzLWFyb3VuZC1tYXJrZXQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Quick takes from around the market,"Quick takes from around the market

Converge [CNVRG 14.92 11.30%] [link] announced a stock buy-back program with a budget of P1.5 billion which was approved by the board on September 22. CNVRG said that the buy-back was intended to “demonstrate confidence in the Company’s fundamental value”. The stock is down 62% over the past 12 months.

MB Quick Take: Soon after that October 2021 high is when things started going off the rails for CNVRG’s stock price. CNVRG’s American partner Coherent Cloud hastily dumped 5.6% of CNVRG’s outstanding shares in a block sale that seemed to shock the market and catch CNVRG flat-footed. CNVRG tried to make lemonade by soaking up Coherent Cloud’s follow-up sale in May but all the positive spin couldn’t mask the haste of Coherent Cloud’s exit. New subscriber growth has slowed (it’s still going up but the rate of that increase is decreasing) and now there are whispers around town (echoed by COL’s April Tan) that CNVRG may be removed from the MSCI Index in November. Does this buy-back program stop the bleeding? Hard to say. CNVRG does an average of P188 million in value traded each day so this plan represents only about eight full days of trading volume. That said judicious application of a buy-back can have an outsized impact on price as we saw earlier this year with DoubleDragon [DD 6.98 0.43%]. We’ll have to wait and see.



Citicore Energy REIT [CREIT 2.26 1.74%] [link] board approved issuance of P4.5 billion in unsecured fixed rate ASEAN green bonds. P3 billion of that amount will be the ""base"" amount with up to P1.5 billion in additional bonds available through an oversubscription option.

MB Quick Take: This amount would maximize CREIT's available debt quota under the REIT Law which forms the majority of its current P6.5 billion in ""buying power"" (a proprietary REIT stat that I calculate and track that represents the amount of value that a REIT could acquire using a combination of available debt and equity up to the minimum public ownership threshold). Maybe the thinking is to sell the bonds now at a time when rates look like they'll be the cheapest that they'll be before maybe like 2024 and use that cash to download additional assets from CREIT's sponsor/parent to expand capacity. I'm curious to see what kind of rates they'll need to give in order to sell the bonds though.



Solar Philippines [SPNEC 1.24 1.59%] [link] disclosed that its owner Leandro Leviste bought 10 million shares on Wednesday for around P1.27/share. The purchases were done through a private company that Mr. Leviste owns called Countryside Investments Holdings Corporation which now holds 310 million SPNEC shares representing 3.1% of SPNEC’s outstanding shares.

MB Quick Take: SPNEC has been in free-fall since around the time of its stock rights offering offer period. Is Mr. Leviste picking up some more of his own supply on the cheap or is he trying to buy some peace of mind for SPNEC investors who have become increasingly vocal about SPNEC’s poor stock price performance?



Synergy Grid [SGP 12.10 0.17%] [link] declared a Q3 cash dividend of P0.26/share payable on October 19 to shareholders of record as of October 5.

MB Quick Take: These dividends are what have been consumed and excreted through the various segments of the corporate centipede that the company’s owners used to attempt to satisfy the public listing requirements of their nation-wide power transmission franchise. Using SGP’s Thursday closing price of P12.10/share this dividend represents an annualized (estimated) yield of 8.59%. That’s a decent return. Especially for people who bought SGP at ~P11.30/share (9.20% estimated yield) back in March. Less so for people who bought it two weeks ago for ~P13.80/share (7.49% estimated yield).



Bank of Commerce [BNCOM 9.11 4.11%] [source] disclosed that 879 million shares held by subsidiaries of San Miguel [SMC 97.65 0.36%] will come out of mandatory lockup on the night of September 27 and will be available for active trading on the morning of September 28.

MB Quick Take: BNCOM has staged a significant price recovery after a really dark post-IPO period where its price dropped to P8.00/share. That said I don’t think SMC is the kind of company that is likely to drip-sell BNCOM shares on the open market for a little bit of quick liquidity. I mean I’m still going to watch that morning to make sure but it’s just not really the way they do it. Bonds and prefs though? All day long.

About the Up & Running Grant Program

In April 2020 eBay announced Up & Running a $100 million small business accelerator program to address the devastating impacts of COVID-19 to small local retail businesses. Built on eBay’s long-standing commitment to “enabling economic opportunity for all” the program sought to help small businesses without an e-commerce presence transition to online selling.

In November 2020 – to expand on its “Up & Running” pledge – eBay introduced the Up & Running Grant program in partnership with Hello Alice. Now in its third year the program has received more than 45000 applications from entrepreneurs sharing details of their small business and how they plan to use the grant to fuel their growth. Following a comprehensive review 50 sellers are chosen annually to each receive $10000 in cash along with premium access to eBay Academy — eBay's e-learning platform — as well as direct training Q&A sessions and mentorship from ranking eBay sellers. See the 2022 winners in this video here.

The updated release reads:

MUSQUEAM ART DESIGN AND SOCCER CULTURE TO FEATURE IN EA SPORTS™ FIFA 23

Musqueam Artwork will be Highlighted Within FIFA Ultimate Team and VOLTA FOOTBALL through Kits Stadium Design and Stadium Vanity

Today Musqueam Indian Band and Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: EA) are excited to announce a unique collaboration to feature Musqueam culture in EA SPORTS™ FIFA 23.

When the game is released FIFA 23 players will have the opportunity to play at the Musqueam-inspired VOLTA FOOTBALL Pitch – a fictional representation of Musqueam’s real-life soccer field that has brought together Indigenous athletes and fans from across the region since its unveiling in 2012. Through this collaboration Musqueam cultural elements were incorporated into the game including a Musqueam longhouse and artwork from Musqueam visual artists carvers designers and weavers.

Additionally FIFA 23 players will be able to unlock VOLTA FOOTBALL apparel and FIFA Ultimate Team™ kits designed by Musqueam artists along with FUT stadium customization elements that feature a variety of Musqueam motifs and patterns.

As EA SPORTS FIFA is primarily developed at EA Vancouver the collaboration between EA SPORTS and Musqueam was an opportunity to celebrate local creatives and showcase their work to an audience of millions of fans worldwide. With the aim to create more meaningful connections within our communities EA SPORTS collaborated with ten Musqueam artists each bringing a unique perspective and design to the environments and kits that will represent the region to a global audience of the world’s game.

“Through this special collaboration with EA SPORTS Musqueam is showcasing not only our unique and distinctive culture but our thriving soccer community and love of the sport – something we share with many First Nations in this region” said Wayne Sparrow Chief of Musqueam Indian Band. “When Indigenous athletes and gamers see an Indigenous field and kits in FIFA 23 we hope it brings immense joy and pride while sparking countless new ideas for collaborations between First Nations and the sports and video game industries.”

A profound love and shared passion for soccer formed the foundation for this collaboration. Proud stewards peacekeepers and protectors of their land Musqueam athletes are committed to the steadfast pursuit of well-being through rigorous physical mental and spiritual training. Playing with heart character-building sports like soccer are practiced from childhood to adulthood. These practices are a continuation of the intercommunity ties that have existed for thousands of years bringing Musqueam kin into their territory.

“We are honoured to work with Musqueam artists athletes and community leaders to help share their deep and meaningful history and culture with the millions of FIFA fans across the world” said Nicholas Lammie Director of Brand Marketing at EA SPORTS FIFA. “This collaboration was so important to our EA Vancouver Studio Team and we're incredibly excited to bring it to life in FIFA Ultimate Team and VOLTA FOOTBALL.”

In addition to the in-game artwork this collaboration results in a number of community contributions including EA SPORTS creating physical kits for Musqueam soccer players that bring to life the in-game kits as well as funding upgrades to the Musqueam Field including improved storage and equipment management facilities new goals and nets and custom tents to shelter from inclement weather.

Musqueam artists whose artwork features in FIFA 23 include:

There’s a new version of Kubernetes every 3 or 4 months. Customers want to leverage all the innovations in the Kubernetes space but a typical enterprise doesn’t like to change core software that frequently. Enterprises are still used to typical upgrade cycles of 9 to 12 months. There are a lot of things that could go wrong in an upgrade path. Depending on the software upgrades can mean a lot of blood sweat and tears. NetApp Astra Control enables effortless cluster upgrades with a blue-green deployment strategy through application-level replication and data protection.

3. Simplify dev/test workflows with application portability.

The primary reason for containerization is the fast delivery of software and services to your users. That gives your dev teams a lot of flexibility to create and test new features very quickly and most importantly to put them into production. But with different teams working in different TKG clusters you need an orchestration platform that can move applications seamlessly from dev to test and into production.

NetApp Astra Control enables application portability across TKG clusters so you can move an entire application along with its data from one cluster to another no matter where the clusters are located.

4. Allow your DevOps teams to focus on delivering value instead of building DIY solutions for data protection.

Kubernetes is an open framework so of course you can always build a do-it-yourself (DIY) solution. But with the rate of innovation in Kubernetes is this the best use of your resources? By using a proven solution from a trusted VMware partner you can focus on your core business and on delivering services rather than on managing infrastructure and data protection.

Example: NetApp Astra Control versus DIY alternatives for Kubernetes data protection

Evaluator Group compared the costs associated with open-source data protection tools to NetApp Astra Control by installing and operating both solutions to protect containerized applications running on multiple Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters.

Editor’s Note: The description of these videos is explicit and may be disturbing for some readers.

An arrest warrant for Royce Cosmo Fuoco 47 alleges he made copies of videos showing children between the ages of 5 to 13 years old performing sex acts on adult men and videos that included bestiality and rape.

The Wake County Sheriff's Office began investigating Fuoco after receiving a cyber tip authorities said.

The warrants describe videos apparently filmed by an adult man as children performed sex acts on him. In at least one video described in the warrants a man raped a child under the age of 10 and recorded it.

At least one of the children in the videos was between the ages of 3 and 5 and was shown engaging in a sex act with an older female according to the warrant.

Fuoco was charged with 13 counts of felony sexual exploitation of a minor. He's being held under a $2 million bond at the Wake County Detention Center.

In court on Friday Fuoco asked a judge to lower his bond due to ""his long-time public service."" He served as a volunteer firefighter in Wake Forest from 2001 to 2014 according to the town of Wake Forest.

The judge denied his request for a lower bond.

Fuoco is employed full-time by an IT company in the Research Triangle Park. he said in court.",,,,,,,,,

The decision was the outcome of a meeting between Vice President Alhaji Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia some other members of the Economic Management Team the Bank of Ghana the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources Minerals Commission PMMC as well as the leadership of the Chamber to consider the implementation of the BoG’s Gold Purchase Programme in the light of the country’s economic challenges.

Ahead of that meeting Newmont Ghana had already sold 3500 ounces of gold to the Bank of Ghana as part of the programme.

Vice President Dr. Bawumia noted after the meeting that “it was agreed that to help shore up the foreign exchange reserves of the Bank of Ghana starting September 1st the Bank of Ghana will purchase a portion of the output of the gold mining companies on a continuous basis at world market prices but payment will be made in Ghana cedis”.

This will represent a significant and sustainable addition to Ghana’s foreign exchange reserves over time and strengthen the country’s balance of payments position” H.E. the Vice President added.

President of the Chamber Joshua Mortoti stated that “as good corporate citizens the Chamber supports the programme”. Noting that the Gold Purchase Programme will be mutually beneficial to all stakeholders.

On his part the Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber Dr. Sulemanu Koney stated that members of Chamber will further engage the Central Bank to fast-track the implementation of the program.

Discussions on the Gold Purchase Programme started in 2020 between the BoG and gold producing member companies of the Chamber to support the Ghana’s foreign exchange reserves.

Chamber of Mines

The Ghana Chamber of Mines is the main minerals industry association in Ghana. The Chamber represents the collective interests of companies involved in mineral exploration production and processing in Ghana. Its member companies produce over 60 per cent of Ghana’s mineral output. The Chamber has represented the industry’s interests since 1928."

A defamation lawsuit launched by Lachlan Murdoch the eldest son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch against Australian news website Crikey had its first day in court on Friday.

Mr Murdoch who is the Fox Corp chief executive and News Corp co-chairman is suing Private Media over an opinion piece about the storming of the US Capitol.

He claims he was defamed in the article by Crikey’s political editor Bernard Keane which was headlined: “Trump is a confirmed unhinged traitor. And Murdoch is his unindicted co-conspirator.”

The first day of proceedings was taken up by legal argument over the terms of the defence and the case will return to court on October 10.

In its defence filed with the court on Friday Crikey argued the opinion piece was in the public interest.

Last month Crikey posted a full-page advertisement in The New York Times that invited the lawsuit saying it wanted to “test this important issue of freedom of public interest journalism in a courtroom”.

The defamation lawsuit was filed the following day.

The website has framed the battle as one of free speech and highlighted differences in size and wealth between itself and the companies owned by the Murdoch family.

It has launched a Go Fund Me for its defence and in a statement released on Thursday chief executive Will Hayward said: “We think it is important in an open well-functioning society that the rich and powerful can be critiqued.”

In a statement of claim a lawyer representing Mr Murdoch accused Crikey of using the situation for “self-promotion” and to “publicise the Crikey website and increase subscribers” and said the claim of public interest journalism was “disingenuous”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kZXBlbmRlbnRhdXN0cmFsaWEubmV0L2xpZmUvYXJ0LWRpc3BsYXkvY2FydG9vbnMtbmV3cy1jb3Jwcy1uYW5ueS1uZXdzLW1vdmUsMTY3OTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CARTOONS: News Corp's nanny news move,"Mark David is IA's resident cartoonist.

News UK’s TalkTV is shaking up its schedule moving Tom Newton Dunn’s news programme from 7pm to 10pm.

Jeremy Kyle will take on the 7pm slot with a new programme entitled Jeremy Kyle Live from 10 October. He has been sitting in for Piers Morgan at 8pm over the summer.

Kyle said his show “will be making sense of the stories that matter; speaking the language of the British people and providing practical help as we all try and navigate our way through current times”.

As well as moving to 10pm Newton Dunn’s hour-long news programme The News Desk is rebranding to First Edition.

Newton Dunn said: “First Edition is a really exciting opportunity to redefine what a flagship evening news programme looks like. We want to produce a news hour that not just looks back on the day but sets the agenda and looks forward into tomorrow with the help of the next day’s newspaper first editions and a full paper review.

“With TalkTV’s own growing reporting cadre and the world beating journalism across News UK’s titles we are brilliantly placed to do this.”

The rest of the primetime schedule will feature Vanessa Feltz on drivetime between 4pm and 7pm Morgan at 8pm and panel show The Talk at 9pm.

Vanessa Feltz joins TalkTV

22/8/22: Vanessa Feltz has joined TalkTV to present its drivetime show after leaving BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio London replacing Jeremy Kyle in the slot as he prepares to launch a new primetime show.

Feltz will present the TalkTV show which also simulcasts on DAB radio from 4pm to 7pm on Mondays to Fridays a change from her previous early morning and breakfast slots.

Feltz announced she was leaving the BBC last month saying she wanted to “step down to catch up on a much-needed decade’s deficit of beauty sleep”.

She has now said: “The allure of a retirement reclining on a chaise longue while the fragrant Ben peeled me a grape was fleeting. While there are politicians to be tackled fat cats to be flattened scams to expose and Lovely Listeners to champion it’s my mission to breathe fire into the microphone. After an elegant sojourn at the BBC I am effervescent with joy at the invitation to unleash my hitherto hidden side on TalkTV.

“I will relish full-throttled debate and the chance to have a personal passionate point of view at last. Even better I’ll be at the reins of Drivetime. Lord what luxury! After years of 3.30 am starts I’ll have a show without an alarm clock involved. If I terrified Mayor Sadiq Khan so acutely he never dared set foot in my studio on almost no sleep tune in to see what I can achieve on a full eight hours shut-eye.”

Feltz will also appear on the 9pm TalkTV panel show The Talk on two or three nights each week.

Ex-Daily Mirror editor to lead TalkTV

22/6/22: Former Daily Mirror editor Richard Wallace is joining News UK’s TalkTV as head of TV.

Wallace was editor of the Mirror from 2004 to 2012 and later worked for Simon Cowell as SVP TV and production for Syco Entertainment.

Wallace said: “TalkTV is innovating and producing news programming for the streaming age. The role will combine many skills from the newsroom with TV programming. The opportunities for news content are extraordinary right now and News UK’s world class stable of journalism provides a great launch pad.”

The channel launched on Freeview at the end of April with prime-time programming aimed at UK and US market.

So far it has failed to make much impact in TV ratings terms but reached a wider audience on Youtube and social media.

Piers Morgan ratings

News UK has claimed content from TalkTV's flagship show Piers Morgan Uncensored reached 64 million people worldwide in its first week.

This figure includes all online viewing of video content from the programme on Facebook Twitter Tiktok Instagram Youtube Samsung TV Plus News Corp owned websites The Sun and the New York Post and the TalkTV website and app.

It does not include linear TV viewing figures in UK or Australia streaming figures from Fox Nation in the US or radio figures from Talkradio where it is simulcast.

Scott Taunton EVP president of broadcasting at News UK said: ""Piers Morgan Uncensored is reaching audiences around the globe and content from the first week’s shows has seen tens of millions of views across streaming services publishing sites and social platforms.

""We are delighted that this new content has created so much interest and is driving our digital business forward bringing in new audiences and new revenues.""

News UK has also revealed plans for Jeremy Kyle to host a primetime show described as a ""review of the day’s news with viewers at its heart"". He appeared as a surprise guest on Sharon Osbourne's programme on TalkTV's first night but will soon host his own show.

He joined News UK as drivetime presenter on Talkradio in September 2021. His new TalkTV show has not been given a launch date only that it will come later this year. (Scroll down to the ""presenters"" section for more information).

TalkTV's first night ratings saw Piers Morgan beat BBC News Sky News and GB News' viewing averages combined - but the other two primetime programmes fell short of their rivals.

In the channel's first week Morgan had exclusive interviews with Donald Trump and Tyson Fury while journalist Tom Newton Dunn quizzed Boris Johnson.

On Thursday (28 April) in the channel's first week star signing Sharon Osbourne had to fly back to the US from the UK after her husband the rock star Ozzy Osbourne contracted Covid-19. But she vowed to return to the show.

TalkTV is Rupert Murdoch's chance to seize the UK's TV screens once again after he sold his stake in Sky in 2018.

He has signed up big-name talent both on and off screen in Piers Morgan and several of his former Good Morning Britain colleagues.

Press Gazette exclusively reported how News UK built a dedicated studio in west London for Morgan's show in order to contain his ambitions.

TalkTV later released pictures of the new studio:

Morgan told Press Gazette he accepted the job following negotiations with Rupert Murdoch personally because he was ""particularly thrilled"" by the ""all-encompassing"" nature of his deal which includes TV work in the UK US and Australia as well as column-writing work for The Sun and New York Post and book writing. Read our full interview here.

Meanwhile two newly-created studios at News UK's The News Building in London Bridge will house the other primetime programming led by Tom Newton Dunn and Sharon Osbourne as well as half-hourly news and weather bulletins.

Latest updates include the appointment of a royal editor the regular panellists for Tom Newton Dunn's nightly news hour at 7pm and Isabel Oakeshott signing on as commentator panellist and international editor.

Job adverts also indicated TalkTV is planning to air a satirical news programme that sounds similar to Have I Got News For You in style although this is not part of the initial launch.

Comparisons with GB News were rife but it appears TalkTV is confident it can produce a better launch than its rival - which is led by Angelos Frangopoulos who was until 2018 the boss at Murdoch's Sky News Australia. GB News' new chairman Alan McCormick told staff on the day of TalkTV's launch that ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery though we should feel sincerely flattered"".

TalkTV launch date

The new channel launched its primetime programming at 7pm on Monday 25 April.

What is TalkTV?

The TalkTV channel will feature “proper” hourly news bulletins sports and entertainment shows as well as current affairs debate opinion and documentaries News UK has said.

It is launching with three primetime programmes led by Tom Newton Dunn at 7pm Piers Morgan at 8pm and Sharon Osbourne at 9pm and will later build out the offering further.

It will use talent and programming from across News UK including the Sun Times Sunday Times Times Radio Talkradio Talksport and Virgin Radio to air a mixture of new shows and televised content from these brands.

News UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks said: “We are committed to providing choice for television and streaming viewers and bringing the best of our journalism to the screen.

“Taking advantage of modern technology we can produce high-quality shows at low cost.”

Talkradio's Julia Hartley-Brewer Mike Graham Ian Collins and Jeremy Kyle will be simulcast on TalkTV during the daytime before the primetime TV shows come on air.

TalkTV will be available from Monday 25 April on linear TV through the following channel numbers:

Who are the TalkTV presenters?

News UK said it would hire ""exceptional new talent"" to front its evening primetime programming.

Piers Morgan

It has already made a huge deal with Piers Morgan which will see him host a primetime weeknight show on TalkTV as well as Murdoch stablemates Fox Nation in the US and Sky News Australia. He will also write columns for The Sun and New York Post host true crime documentaries and publish his next book through Murdoch's HarperCollins.

Morgan said: ""I want my global show to be a fearless forum for lively debate and agenda-setting interviews and a place that celebrates the right of everyone to have an opinion and for those opinions to be vigorously examined and challenged.""

Murdoch added: ""Piers is the broadcaster every channel wants but is too afraid to hire. Piers is a brilliant presenter a talented journalist and says what people are thinking and feeling.""

His new show titled “Piers Morgan Uncensored” was announced on 9 March and will broadcast at 8pm on weeknights in the UK on TalkTV as well as in Australia and the US.

His producer Winnie Dunbar Nelson told Press Gazette it will ""be a show that champions free speech and celebrates the little guy and gives a big voice to those people in the world who feel voiceless or cancelled or are facing injustice"". She also revealed a larger studio had been built especially in west London to cater to Morgan's needs.

The new studio is located within Ealing Broadcast Centre which opened at the end of 2021. The studio was created by the same designer Jim Fenhagen who previously made sets for Good Morning Britain 5 News and Sky News in the UK and Fox News Studios The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in the US.

TalkTV executive director Erron Gordon said: “I began with an absolutely blank canvas in terms of the studio space - with the simple vision to create something as unique as the show itself.

""Knowing Piers Morgan Uncensored will be broadcast across three continents we have created a truly state-of-the-art environment containing unique design elements not yet seen in British TV news"" he added pointing to a LED archway and 360-degree environment that will allow shooting from every angle.

The studio's LED screens and lighting system can also be turned into a blank canvas to create special event programming led by Morgan.

A new marketing campaign centred on Morgan is based around the strapline: ""Straight talking starts here.""

Jeremy Kyle

Jeremy Kyle will host a primetime show described as a ""review of the day’s news with viewers at its heart"". He appeared as a surprise guest on Sharon Osbourne's programme on TalkTV's first night but will now host his own show.

He joined News UK as drivetime presenter on Talkradio in September 2021. His new TalkTV show has not been given a launch date only that it will come later this year. Until then he will continue his Talkradio show which is simulcast on TalkTV before the TV evening primetime programming begins.

It will be a return to Kyle hosting his own show three years after his eponymous Channel 5 show was axed following the death of a guest.

Kyle said: “I’ve absolutely loved going back to my radio roots these last seven months. It’s been a lot of hard work but a lot of fun too - interviewing everyone from Jacob Rees-Mogg to Eddie The Eagle Edwards but also speaking to listeners every day about the things that mean most to them.

""The radio show has done really well but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to host my own TV show too!”

The News Desk panellists

Tom Newton Dunn will present TalkTV's 7pm weeknight hour-long news and current affairs programme to be titled The News Desk. News UK said a ""world-beating stable of specialist journalists from print and broadcast will join Tom every night to share the very latest in their fields"" including reporters from The Times The Sun Talksport and The Wall Street Journal.

The show will also feature a ""regular rotating discussion panel"". Participants each appearing every week on regular nights will include:

Former Sky News anchor Adam Boulton

Former Evening Standard editor Emily Sheffield

TalkTV political editor and former Telegraph correspondent Kate McCann

Deputy Sun editor-in-chief and former Downing Street director of communications James Slack

Author Douglas Murray

Former Sunday Times political editor Isabel Oakeshott

Tribune writer Grace Blakeley

Politicians and commentators Anas Sarwar MSP Bim Ofalami MP Tan Dhesi MP and Miatta Fahnbulleh will also be regular panellists.

Newton Dunn said of the show and its panellists: “The News Desk’s founding principle is to give viewers top quality news in a straight and balanced way so that we win their trust. We serve no political agenda or ideology. We’re going to do that in a fresh and engaging format and to help us we’re really pleased to have recruited 11 of the sharpest and most perceptive political voices in the UK who will take it in turns to make up our nightly panel.""

Isabel Oakeshott

Ex-Sunday Times political editor Isabel Oakeshott is returning to News UK as commentator panellist and international editor at TalkTV.

The broadcaster said she would be a regular commentator and panellist on Newton Dunn's nightly news show (see below) report on news from across the globe for the channel and appear across the TalkTV schedule.

Oakeshott who has also previously worked as political editor-at-large for the Daily Mail said: “I’m delighted to be returning to News UK which is both a bastion of free speech and home to a wealth of world-class journalistic talent.

""I’m excited to be joining Tom’s show as a regular commentator as it seeks to redefine broadcast news and current affairs for contemporary audiences. And in my new role as international editor I look forward to reporting on the ground on the biggest global news stories across the globe.”

Oakeshott was shortlisted for Scoop of the Year at the British Journalism Awards 2019 for the scoop which she worked on with teenager Steven Edginton revealing leaked private correspondence from the UK ambassador to the US Sir Kim Darroch about Donald Trump that led to the former's resignation.

Tom Newton Dunn

Times Radio chief political commentator and former Sun political editor Tom Newton Dunn will host a nightly hour-long prime time news programme at 7pm on Mondays to Fridays featuring interviews and a discussion panel. It will air ahead of Morgan's show.

[TalkTV's Tom Newton Dunn: 'We're not right wing we are going to surprise you']

News UK promised Newton Dunn's show will be ""straight and balanced with views and guests across the political spectrum"" and will use specialist journalists from across its brands for example the Times politics and Sun showbiz teams.

Newton Dunn who will also executive edit the new programme has stepped down from his Times Radio role which he left The Sun to take on in 2020. He will however continue to co-host the Sunday morning politics show T&G until TalkTV's launch and will continue to appear on the radio station.

He said: ""I’ve been incredibly lucky to play a part in major new media innovations from the birth of Sun Online to most recently Times Radio which has reset the dial on what quality news radio can achieve and I’m pleased to be still playing a part on the station.

""The chance to be at the helm of a new primetime news programme on an innovative new TV channel though really is a career dream come true. We want to bring viewers high quality news in a fresh and different way that best serves them. We can’t wait to start.""

Newton Dunn told Press Gazette in an interview that his show will surprise people ""not just by our balance and our total lack of right wing-ery but also by just how brilliant all our talent is in journalism"".

He also said: ""I think a lot of people are coming to the entire network TalkTV with a fair amount of preconceptions. I think everyone thinks we’re going to be right-wing and that’s probably based on you know perceptions of some of our titles The Sun for example but I think those assumptions and preconceptions are certainly wrong about the titles. They’re definitely wrong about TalkTV.""

Kate McCann

Sky News political correspondent Kate McCann was hired as political editor for the new channel. Before joining Sky in 2018 she was senior political correspondent of the Telegraph and political correspondent of The Sun.

When she was at the Telegraph she secured a leaked copy of Jeremy Corbyn's general election manifesto for the Labour Party in 2017.

McCann has told Press Gazette she was looking forward to the fact TalkTV could “rip up all the rules and start again”.

[Interview: TalkTV political editor Kate McCann says 'dare to be different' is mantra of new channel]

Sarah Hewson

TalkTV has appointed Sarah Hewson as royal editor to appear regularly on Newton Dunn's news programme. Hewson spent 20 years at Sky News in various roles including presenting the breakfast and News at Ten programmes before leaving in December.

Hewson said the morning after TalkTV's launch: “I’m absolutely delighted at this opportunity to work with TalkTV and right from its inception. The launch last night showed how it will be a bold and exciting new channel committed to delivering news with a fresh perspective.

“I have been reporting on the British Royal family for many years but I can barely remember such a busy time especially in this Jubilee year. I think we’ll have plenty to talk about!”

Sharon Osbourne

Television personality Sharon Osbourne has been signed up to front a weeknight current affairs panel show on TalkTV to be named The Talk. News UK says the new 9pm hour-long show ""will bring together five opinionated famous faces - all from different backgrounds and with differing views - to debate the most interesting stories of the day"".

Osbourne departed CBS panel show The Talk that one on CBS in March 2021. Her exit from that programme was the climax of a drama that began with Osbourne defending comments by Piers Morgan about Meghan Markle.

Morgan who previously co-starred with Osbourne as a judge on America's Got Talent tweeted that he was ""so happy to be reunited with my un-cancelled and fabulous friend Sharon Osbourne"".

Who are the TalkTV producers?

Several former GMB colleagues of Morgan who said he wants only ""the very best"" have been hired to work at TalkTV so far.

Winnie Dunbar Nelson who worked with Morgan for almost ten years at Good Morning Britain and CNN has been named executive editor TV for News UK Broadcasting. She had left GMB in early 2020 to join NBC but the pair are now reunited.

Dunbar Nelson has spoken to Press Gazette about working with Morgan and their plans for his show.

Another GMB colleague joining Morgan's team is its launch and series director Erron Gordon who has been hired as executive creative director and head of studio output for News UK Broadcasting.

Reporting to Dunbar Nelson Gordon will be series director for Morgan's show alongside his role leading the creative direction of TalkTV's programming and channel branding including set design on-screen graphics and managing the studio teams.

Gordon said: ""There are very few occasions in your career when you get to create something entirely new. TalkTV is one of those opportunities. I’m truly excited about what News UK wants to achieve with the station – and of course the opportunity to reunite with Piers on his new global show was impossible to resist.""

Gordon's deputy will be Oliver Gardner joining from ITV where he is currently director of Loose Women and previously a GMB director.

News UK said Gardner will assist in the creative direction of programming and channel branding including set design on-screen graphics and sonic branding as well as help manage studio teams and direct primetime programmes.

Gordon said: ""Having worked with him in the past I know he'll bring his excellent attention to detail and creative flare to our output. Ollie is passionate about live television and is the perfect choice to be directing our programmes and helping manage the studio crew as we continue to build a great team of talented creatives and technicians.""

Ben Briscoe currently assistant editor at GMB of six years has been named as series editor of Morgan's show.

Briscoe who has worked at ITV for 16 years said: “Piers Morgan is a unique talent in global broadcasting. It’s both a privilege and a delight to be working with him again on this hugely exciting new international show.”

Another former GMB senior producer Caitlin Black has been appointed as series editor on Newton Dunn's primetime programme.

In addition Vivek Sharma series editor of Steph’s Packed Lunch on Channel 4 and a former deputy editor of ITV's This Morning has been named as executive producer at News UK Broadcasting with responsibility for TalkTV's output.

Sharma who has also previously worked at Good Morning Britain said: “News UK has a rich heritage of world-class journalism. The launch of TalkTV next year will create an important new voice in news and current affairs delivered across a network of linear and non-linear platforms and I’m delighted to be joining the team.”

What is the TalkTV logo?

News UK Broadcasting executive creative director Erron Gordon said the logo was intended to be a ""bold clear recognisable and unique mark one that stands out and cuts-through the rest of the established news and current affairs ‘noise’"".

He added that the colour scheme was intended to ""marry authority with warmth"". The darker blue logo pictured here will be used for primetime coverage with a lighter blue in the daytime.

Gordon said: “The speech bubble is a clear symbol of our intent as a channel to engage with our audience. The fact the speech bubble contains and holds the TalkTV wordmark is a clear indication that the channel is at the centre of all of this enabling people to voice their opinion.”

TalkTV jobs

Earlier this year News UK was advertising for around 20 roles including several for a Have I Got News For You-style satirical panel show.

Others included a planning producer for a nightly debate show to feature a “headline-making” panel of topical guests a scriptwriter producers and a senior planning producer for Morgan's show and numerous specialist and technical roles behind the scenes.

Earlier roles to have closed included a head of production series editor producer assistant producer video editor and social media producer to work on Morgan's programme plus bookers.

Where will TalkTV be based?

TalkTV will be based at News UK's London Bridge office known as The News Building and formerly the Baby Shard. It has been confirmed that Morgan's show will be filmed here.

News UK has already invested in new TV studios at the site which are being used for live news bulletins for Talkradio and other ways of visualising its brands.

Who is behind TalkTV?

According to the FT Murdoch was unhappy with the TV channels on offer in the UK during the Covid-19 lockdown and so decided to launch his own.

Murdoch has a lot of experience with TV owning Fox News in the US Sky News in Australia and until 2018 controlling Sky in the UK for three decades.

Will TalkTV be right-wing?

The exact tone and content of TalkTV has not yet been revealed but the channel is expected to offer a similar political slant to The Sun and Talkradio.

TalkTV will use televised content from across News UK's existing brands and News UK Broadcasting chief executive Scott Taunton said the company already has ""some of the most articulate thought-leaders who reflect many different viewpoints"".

Will TalkTV make money?

Despite plans brewing at News UK to launch a linear TV channel for over a year it briefly decided to make it streaming only after a review of opportunities in the TV market deemed it to be “not commercially viable”.

Brooks said in a staff memo there was demand for alternative news provision but the “considerable” costs of running a channel meant it would not be worthwhile financially. However the company has now changed its tune.

Rob Keery of marketing agency AIP told Press Gazette: “TV has also never been more accessible than it is now thanks to technology advances” citing a move towards programmatic advertising that has opened TV up to companies with lower budgets.

“In spite of the pandemic there were over 850 advertisers that spent £50k or less on TV in 2020 – these sorts of budgets would have been unheard of in the past” he added. “It means that brands who wouldn’t have dreamed of advertising on TV can suddenly level up and find their audience on the biggest screen in the house for minimal outlay.”

He also said TalkTV will “give brands who hesitated to direct ad spend towards GB News a safer home for their ads to appear”.

Media analyst Doug McCabe of Enders Analysis said TalkTV will benefit from being part of a much bigger portfolio including beyond the UK compared to GB News.

TikTok bans political fund-raising ahead of midterms

Less than two months before the midterm elections TikTok is blocking politicians and political parties from fund-raising on its platform reports The New York Times’ Tiffany Hsu.

In a blog post on Wednesday the social media platform said it would prohibit solicitations for money by political campaigns. The company said political accounts would immediately lose access to advertising features and monetization services such as gift giving tipping and e-commerce capabilities.

Over the next few weeks TikTok will clamp down on politicians’ posting videos asking for donations or political parties’ directing users to online donation pages the company said.

Accounts run by government offices will be slightly less restricted. TikTok said such accounts would be allowed to advertise in limited circumstances such as when running educational campaigns about Covid-19 booster shots. But the people operating those accounts must work with someone from the company to run that kind of campaign.

Data shows broad trust gap between news in general and news on social media

People are much less likely to trust news they see on social media search engines and messaging apps than news in general according to a new study. The trust gap is however smaller for news seen on Google reports Press Gazette’s Aisha Majid.

The findings published on Thursday in the report “The trust gap: how and why news on digital platforms is viewed more sceptically versus news in general” are the latest in a long-running project from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism looking at trust in news.

A survey of 2000 people each in the UK the US Brazil and India asked a series of questions designed to examine the relationship between trust in news and how people think about news on digital platforms.

In the UK there was little difference in the level of trust in news overall and the level of trust in news on Google with 52% of people saying they trusted news they saw on the Alphabet-owned platform versus 53% who said they trusted news overall. After Google there is a dip – the next most-trusted platform for news is Youtube on 33%.

By contrast Facebook was among the least-trusted platforms in the UK with just 27% of respondents saying they had faith in the news they saw on there with the same percentage for Twitter. Tiktok (20%) and Instagram (24%) were at the bottom of the ranking.

F-List 2022 unmasks the advertising media and PR agencies working with climate polluters

The F-List 2022 has unmasked the advertising media and PR agencies working with and promoting climate-polluting companies and the fossil fuel industries.

The report by campaign groups Clean Creatives and Comms Declare named 239 agencies around the world who have done recent work for such organisations.

Key findings from the F-List analysis found:

• 239 agencies have done recent work with fossil fuel companies. The vast majority of this work is not shared via agency channels or with clients whose work may be affected by greenwashing claims.

• At least 17 agencies are working for Saudi Aramco the world’s largest polluter including a previously undisclosed Interpublic Mediabrands agency Well7. Interpublic agencies McCann UM and Jack Morton have also led substantial work for Aramco but all holding companies have some connection to the world’s largest oil company and funder of human rights abuses.

• The world’s biggest coal exporter Glencore is being referred to Australian regulators over a brand campaign ad that features EVs solar panels and wind turbines – but doesn’t mention coal. Comms Declare understands Bastion Creative is behind the campaign. This complaint follows the barring of two employees of Anacta Strategies from lobbying the Queensland government. Glencore secured a lucrative bailout while employing Anacta.

• Edelman retains its role as the independent agency doing the most work for fossil fuel companies despite a pledge in early 2022 to review its client policy. Some small signs of progress at the PR giant can be seen but the company remains committed to working with polluters.

Royal family given veto on use of footage of Queen’s funeral

British television channels gave Buckingham Palace a veto on the use of footage from Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral indicating the complicated relationship around the media’s coverage of the monarchy reports The Guardian’s Jim Waterson.

As part of an agreement with news broadcasters the royal household was given the right to request that particular pieces of footage from the funeral services at Westminster Abbey and Windsor Castle were not used again.

Royal staff sent messages to the BBC ITV News and Sky News during the event with the timestamps of footage they wished to exclude from future news broadcasts and social media clips. As a result five short pieces of video featuring members of the royal family were removed from circulation.

Although the sections were relatively brief the decision to give the palace a veto on what footage could be used has caused unease among some journalists who worked on the coverage in ongoing tension at British media outlets between marking the death of a major national figure and allowing news coverage to be shaped by the royal family.

Zan Rowe reveals how Guy Pearce Keith Urban Missy Higgins bared souls on Take 5

Zan Rowe says she just doesn’t believe it when people tell her they don’t like music reports News Corp’s James Wigney.

The versatile TV radio and podcast presenter has been so enamoured of the art form for so many years that she simply can’t fathom that others don’t share her passion at least to some degree.

“Wow that’s a big question” she says when asked what music means to her.

“It’s my memory bank. It’s the thing that gets me going physically and mentally. It’s the thing that triggers me to have a big old weep when I need to. It’s the way that I formed my identity and the way that I continue to form my identity.”

Although music has been Rowe’s job for more than two decades thanks to stints on Triple J Double J and as a regular contributor to ABC News Breakfast she’s never forgotten what it’s like to be a music fan. And where some people find themselves hearkening back to the bands and artists they loved in their formative late teen and early 20s years Rowe says she’s as curious and hungry as ever to seek out new music.

‘Becoming a meme totally helps a show’: is TV being written with epic gifs in mind?

‘Inever jest about cake” quips princess Rhaenyra Targaryen in the first episode of HBO’s Game of Thrones spin-off House of the Dragon. It’s a seemingly charming line delivered while her head lolls on her best friend’s lap helping to build Rhaenyra’s character as someone who doesn’t take herself too seriously. It is also so instantly quotable and therefore T-shirtable that the line is already plastered on fan-made merch reports The Guardian’s Jess Thomson.

But to some viewers it rang false. They had seen this pattern before: show writes meme-able scene; scene becomes meme; instant marketing; profit.

“Ugh someone in the Game of Thrones prequel just said ‘I never jest about cake’ so this is gonna be part of the ‘primarily written with the epic gifs in mind’ genre of shows” tweeted Zack Budryk a reporter at The Hill.

TV programmes and the lines that make us laugh have always been shared and discussed afterwards. So with the universality of Twitter and other social media it’s only natural that programmes’ “relatable” lines moments or scenarios are increasingly meme-ified among their fanbase being shared widely and eventually permuted into other established jokes on the internet. But sometimes it can feel as though shows are being written with the online reaction in mind particularly given that in our internet-saturated age the online temperature can make or break a piece of media.

A defamation lawsuit launched by Lachlan Murdoch the eldest son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch against Australian news website Crikey had its first day in court on Friday.

Mr Murdoch who is the Fox Corp chief executive and News Corp co-chairman is suing Private Media over an opinion piece about the storming of the US Capitol.

He claims he was defamed in the article by Crikey’s political editor Bernard Keane which was headlined: “Trump is a confirmed unhinged traitor. And Murdoch is his unindicted co-conspirator.”

The first day of proceedings was taken up by legal argument over the terms of the defence and the case will return to court on October 10.

In its defence filed with the court on Friday Crikey argued the opinion piece was in the public interest.

Last month Crikey posted a full-page advertisement in The New York Times that invited the lawsuit saying it wanted to “test this important issue of freedom of public interest journalism in a courtroom”.

The defamation lawsuit was filed the following day.

The website has framed the battle as one of free speech and highlighted differences in size and wealth between itself and the companies owned by the Murdoch family.

It has launched a Go Fund Me for its defence and in a statement released on Thursday chief executive Will Hayward said: “We think it is important in an open well-functioning society that the rich and powerful can be critiqued.”

In a statement of claim a lawyer representing Mr Murdoch accused Crikey of using the situation for “self-promotion” and to “publicise the Crikey website and increase subscribers” and said the claim of public interest journalism was “disingenuous”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kZXBlbmRlbnRhdXN0cmFsaWEubmV0L2xpZmUvYXJ0LWRpc3BsYXkvY2FydG9vbnMtbmV3cy1jb3Jwcy1uYW5ueS1uZXdzLW1vdmUsMTY3OTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CARTOONS: News Corp's nanny news move,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='independentaustralia.net', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /life/art-display/cartoons-news-corps-nanny-news-move,16792 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EB4AE30>, 'Connection to independentaustralia.net timed out.

News UK’s TalkTV is shaking up its schedule moving Tom Newton Dunn’s news programme from 7pm to 10pm.

Jeremy Kyle will take on the 7pm slot with a new programme entitled Jeremy Kyle Live from 10 October. He has been sitting in for Piers Morgan at 8pm over the summer.

Kyle said his show “will be making sense of the stories that matter; speaking the language of the British people and providing practical help as we all try and navigate our way through current times”.

As well as moving to 10pm Newton Dunn’s hour-long news programme The News Desk is rebranding to First Edition.

Newton Dunn said: “First Edition is a really exciting opportunity to redefine what a flagship evening news programme looks like. We want to produce a news hour that not just looks back on the day but sets the agenda and looks forward into tomorrow with the help of the next day’s newspaper first editions and a full paper review.

“With TalkTV’s own growing reporting cadre and the world beating journalism across News UK’s titles we are brilliantly placed to do this.”

The rest of the primetime schedule will feature Vanessa Feltz on drivetime between 4pm and 7pm Morgan at 8pm and panel show The Talk at 9pm.

Vanessa Feltz joins TalkTV

22/8/22: Vanessa Feltz has joined TalkTV to present its drivetime show after leaving BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio London replacing Jeremy Kyle in the slot as he prepares to launch a new primetime show.

Feltz will present the TalkTV show which also simulcasts on DAB radio from 4pm to 7pm on Mondays to Fridays a change from her previous early morning and breakfast slots.

Feltz announced she was leaving the BBC last month saying she wanted to “step down to catch up on a much-needed decade’s deficit of beauty sleep”.

She has now said: “The allure of a retirement reclining on a chaise longue while the fragrant Ben peeled me a grape was fleeting. While there are politicians to be tackled fat cats to be flattened scams to expose and Lovely Listeners to champion it’s my mission to breathe fire into the microphone. After an elegant sojourn at the BBC I am effervescent with joy at the invitation to unleash my hitherto hidden side on TalkTV.

“I will relish full-throttled debate and the chance to have a personal passionate point of view at last. Even better I’ll be at the reins of Drivetime. Lord what luxury! After years of 3.30 am starts I’ll have a show without an alarm clock involved. If I terrified Mayor Sadiq Khan so acutely he never dared set foot in my studio on almost no sleep tune in to see what I can achieve on a full eight hours shut-eye.”

Feltz will also appear on the 9pm TalkTV panel show The Talk on two or three nights each week.

Ex-Daily Mirror editor to lead TalkTV

22/6/22: Former Daily Mirror editor Richard Wallace is joining News UK’s TalkTV as head of TV.

Wallace was editor of the Mirror from 2004 to 2012 and later worked for Simon Cowell as SVP TV and production for Syco Entertainment.

Wallace said: “TalkTV is innovating and producing news programming for the streaming age. The role will combine many skills from the newsroom with TV programming. The opportunities for news content are extraordinary right now and News UK’s world class stable of journalism provides a great launch pad.”

The channel launched on Freeview at the end of April with prime-time programming aimed at UK and US market.

So far it has failed to make much impact in TV ratings terms but reached a wider audience on Youtube and social media.

Piers Morgan ratings

News UK has claimed content from TalkTV's flagship show Piers Morgan Uncensored reached 64 million people worldwide in its first week.

This figure includes all online viewing of video content from the programme on Facebook Twitter Tiktok Instagram Youtube Samsung TV Plus News Corp owned websites The Sun and the New York Post and the TalkTV website and app.

It does not include linear TV viewing figures in UK or Australia streaming figures from Fox Nation in the US or radio figures from Talkradio where it is simulcast.

Scott Taunton EVP president of broadcasting at News UK said: ""Piers Morgan Uncensored is reaching audiences around the globe and content from the first week’s shows has seen tens of millions of views across streaming services publishing sites and social platforms.

""We are delighted that this new content has created so much interest and is driving our digital business forward bringing in new audiences and new revenues.""

News UK has also revealed plans for Jeremy Kyle to host a primetime show described as a ""review of the day’s news with viewers at its heart"". He appeared as a surprise guest on Sharon Osbourne's programme on TalkTV's first night but will soon host his own show.

He joined News UK as drivetime presenter on Talkradio in September 2021. His new TalkTV show has not been given a launch date only that it will come later this year. (Scroll down to the ""presenters"" section for more information).

TalkTV's first night ratings saw Piers Morgan beat BBC News Sky News and GB News' viewing averages combined - but the other two primetime programmes fell short of their rivals.

In the channel's first week Morgan had exclusive interviews with Donald Trump and Tyson Fury while journalist Tom Newton Dunn quizzed Boris Johnson.

On Thursday (28 April) in the channel's first week star signing Sharon Osbourne had to fly back to the US from the UK after her husband the rock star Ozzy Osbourne contracted Covid-19. But she vowed to return to the show.

TalkTV is Rupert Murdoch's chance to seize the UK's TV screens once again after he sold his stake in Sky in 2018.

He has signed up big-name talent both on and off screen in Piers Morgan and several of his former Good Morning Britain colleagues.

Press Gazette exclusively reported how News UK built a dedicated studio in west London for Morgan's show in order to contain his ambitions.

TalkTV later released pictures of the new studio:

Morgan told Press Gazette he accepted the job following negotiations with Rupert Murdoch personally because he was ""particularly thrilled"" by the ""all-encompassing"" nature of his deal which includes TV work in the UK US and Australia as well as column-writing work for The Sun and New York Post and book writing. Read our full interview here.

Meanwhile two newly-created studios at News UK's The News Building in London Bridge will house the other primetime programming led by Tom Newton Dunn and Sharon Osbourne as well as half-hourly news and weather bulletins.

Latest updates include the appointment of a royal editor the regular panellists for Tom Newton Dunn's nightly news hour at 7pm and Isabel Oakeshott signing on as commentator panellist and international editor.

Job adverts also indicated TalkTV is planning to air a satirical news programme that sounds similar to Have I Got News For You in style although this is not part of the initial launch.

Comparisons with GB News were rife but it appears TalkTV is confident it can produce a better launch than its rival - which is led by Angelos Frangopoulos who was until 2018 the boss at Murdoch's Sky News Australia. GB News' new chairman Alan McCormick told staff on the day of TalkTV's launch that ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery though we should feel sincerely flattered"".

It will use talent and programming from across News UK including the Sun Times Sunday Times Times Radio Talkradio Talksport and Virgin Radio to air a mixture of new shows and televised content from these brands.

News UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks said: “We are committed to providing choice for television and streaming viewers and bringing the best of our journalism to the screen.

“Taking advantage of modern technology we can produce high-quality shows at low cost.”

Talkradio's Julia Hartley-Brewer Mike Graham Ian Collins and Jeremy Kyle will be simulcast on TalkTV during the daytime before the primetime TV shows come on air.

Who are the TalkTV presenters?

News UK said it would hire ""exceptional new talent"" to front its evening primetime programming.

Piers Morgan

It has already made a huge deal with Piers Morgan which will see him host a primetime weeknight show on TalkTV as well as Murdoch stablemates Fox Nation in the US and Sky News Australia. He will also write columns for The Sun and New York Post host true crime documentaries and publish his next book through Murdoch's HarperCollins.

[Read more: Piers Morgan signs global deal with Rupert Murdoch ahead of News UK TV channel launch]

Morgan said: ""I want my global show to be a fearless forum for lively debate and agenda-setting interviews and a place that celebrates the right of everyone to have an opinion and for those opinions to be vigorously examined and challenged.""

Murdoch added: ""Piers is the broadcaster every channel wants but is too afraid to hire. Piers is a brilliant presenter a talented journalist and says what people are thinking and feeling.""

His new show titled “Piers Morgan Uncensored” was announced on 9 March and will broadcast at 8pm on weeknights in the UK on TalkTV as well as in Australia and the US.

His producer Winnie Dunbar Nelson told Press Gazette it will ""be a show that champions free speech and celebrates the little guy and gives a big voice to those people in the world who feel voiceless or cancelled or are facing injustice"". She also revealed a larger studio had been built especially in west London to cater to Morgan's needs.

The new studio is located within Ealing Broadcast Centre which opened at the end of 2021. The studio was created by the same designer Jim Fenhagen who previously made sets for Good Morning Britain 5 News and Sky News in the UK and Fox News Studios The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in the US.

TalkTV executive director Erron Gordon said: “I began with an absolutely blank canvas in terms of the studio space - with the simple vision to create something as unique as the show itself.

""Knowing Piers Morgan Uncensored will be broadcast across three continents we have created a truly state-of-the-art environment containing unique design elements not yet seen in British TV news"" he added pointing to a LED archway and 360-degree environment that will allow shooting from every angle.

The studio's LED screens and lighting system can also be turned into a blank canvas to create special event programming led by Morgan.

A new marketing campaign centred on Morgan is based around the strapline: ""Straight talking starts here.""

Jeremy Kyle

Jeremy Kyle will host a primetime show described as a ""review of the day’s news with viewers at its heart"". He appeared as a surprise guest on Sharon Osbourne's programme on TalkTV's first night but will now host his own show.

He joined News UK as drivetime presenter on Talkradio in September 2021. His new TalkTV show has not been given a launch date only that it will come later this year. Until then he will continue his Talkradio show which is simulcast on TalkTV before the TV evening primetime programming begins.

It will be a return to Kyle hosting his own show three years after his eponymous Channel 5 show was axed following the death of a guest.

Kyle said: “I’ve absolutely loved going back to my radio roots these last seven months. It’s been a lot of hard work but a lot of fun too - interviewing everyone from Jacob Rees-Mogg to Eddie The Eagle Edwards but also speaking to listeners every day about the things that mean most to them.

""The radio show has done really well but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to host my own TV show too!”

The News Desk panellists

Tom Newton Dunn will present TalkTV's 7pm weeknight hour-long news and current affairs programme to be titled The News Desk. News UK said a ""world-beating stable of specialist journalists from print and broadcast will join Tom every night to share the very latest in their fields"" including reporters from The Times The Sun Talksport and The Wall Street Journal.

The show will also feature a ""regular rotating discussion panel"". Participants each appearing every week on regular nights will include:

Former Sky News anchor Adam Boulton

Former Evening Standard editor Emily Sheffield

TalkTV political editor and former Telegraph correspondent Kate McCann

Deputy Sun editor-in-chief and former Downing Street director of communications James Slack

Author Douglas Murray

Former Sunday Times political editor Isabel Oakeshott

Tribune writer Grace Blakeley

Politicians and commentators Anas Sarwar MSP Bim Ofalami MP Tan Dhesi MP and Miatta Fahnbulleh will also be regular panellists.

Newton Dunn said of the show and its panellists: “The News Desk’s founding principle is to give viewers top quality news in a straight and balanced way so that we win their trust. We serve no political agenda or ideology. We’re going to do that in a fresh and engaging format and to help us we’re really pleased to have recruited 11 of the sharpest and most perceptive political voices in the UK who will take it in turns to make up our nightly panel.""

Isabel Oakeshott

Ex-Sunday Times political editor Isabel Oakeshott is returning to News UK as commentator panellist and international editor at TalkTV.

The broadcaster said she would be a regular commentator and panellist on Newton Dunn's nightly news show (see below) report on news from across the globe for the channel and appear across the TalkTV schedule.

Oakeshott who has also previously worked as political editor-at-large for the Daily Mail said: “I’m delighted to be returning to News UK which is both a bastion of free speech and home to a wealth of world-class journalistic talent.

""I’m excited to be joining Tom’s show as a regular commentator as it seeks to redefine broadcast news and current affairs for contemporary audiences. And in my new role as international editor I look forward to reporting on the ground on the biggest global news stories across the globe.”

Oakeshott was shortlisted for Scoop of the Year at the British Journalism Awards 2019 for the scoop which she worked on with teenager Steven Edginton revealing leaked private correspondence from the UK ambassador to the US Sir Kim Darroch about Donald Trump that led to the former's resignation.

Tom Newton Dunn

Times Radio chief political commentator and former Sun political editor Tom Newton Dunn will host a nightly hour-long prime time news programme at 7pm on Mondays to Fridays featuring interviews and a discussion panel. It will air ahead of Morgan's show.

[TalkTV's Tom Newton Dunn: 'We're not right wing we are going to surprise you']

News UK promised Newton Dunn's show will be ""straight and balanced with views and guests across the political spectrum"" and will use specialist journalists from across its brands for example the Times politics and Sun showbiz teams.

Newton Dunn who will also executive edit the new programme has stepped down from his Times Radio role which he left The Sun to take on in 2020. He will however continue to co-host the Sunday morning politics show T&G until TalkTV's launch and will continue to appear on the radio station.

He said: ""I’ve been incredibly lucky to play a part in major new media innovations from the birth of Sun Online to most recently Times Radio which has reset the dial on what quality news radio can achieve and I’m pleased to be still playing a part on the station.

""The chance to be at the helm of a new primetime news programme on an innovative new TV channel though really is a career dream come true. We want to bring viewers high quality news in a fresh and different way that best serves them. We can’t wait to start.""

Newton Dunn told Press Gazette in an interview that his show will surprise people ""not just by our balance and our total lack of right wing-ery but also by just how brilliant all our talent is in journalism"".

He also said: ""I think a lot of people are coming to the entire network TalkTV with a fair amount of preconceptions. I think everyone thinks we’re going to be right-wing and that’s probably based on you know perceptions of some of our titles The Sun for example but I think those assumptions and preconceptions are certainly wrong about the titles. They’re definitely wrong about TalkTV.""

Kate McCann

Sky News political correspondent Kate McCann was hired as political editor for the new channel. Before joining Sky in 2018 she was senior political correspondent of the Telegraph and political correspondent of The Sun.

When she was at the Telegraph she secured a leaked copy of Jeremy Corbyn's general election manifesto for the Labour Party in 2017.

McCann has told Press Gazette she was looking forward to the fact TalkTV could “rip up all the rules and start again”.

[Interview: TalkTV political editor Kate McCann says 'dare to be different' is mantra of new channel]

Sarah Hewson

TalkTV has appointed Sarah Hewson as royal editor to appear regularly on Newton Dunn's news programme. Hewson spent 20 years at Sky News in various roles including presenting the breakfast and News at Ten programmes before leaving in December.

Hewson said the morning after TalkTV's launch: “I’m absolutely delighted at this opportunity to work with TalkTV and right from its inception. The launch last night showed how it will be a bold and exciting new channel committed to delivering news with a fresh perspective.

“I have been reporting on the British Royal family for many years but I can barely remember such a busy time especially in this Jubilee year. I think we’ll have plenty to talk about!”

Sharon Osbourne

Television personality Sharon Osbourne has been signed up to front a weeknight current affairs panel show on TalkTV to be named The Talk. News UK says the new 9pm hour-long show ""will bring together five opinionated famous faces - all from different backgrounds and with differing views - to debate the most interesting stories of the day"".

Osbourne departed CBS panel show The Talk that one on CBS in March 2021. Her exit from that programme was the climax of a drama that began with Osbourne defending comments by Piers Morgan about Meghan Markle.

Morgan who previously co-starred with Osbourne as a judge on America's Got Talent tweeted that he was ""so happy to be reunited with my un-cancelled and fabulous friend Sharon Osbourne"".

Who are the TalkTV producers?

Several former GMB colleagues of Morgan who said he wants only ""the very best"" have been hired to work at TalkTV so far.

Winnie Dunbar Nelson who worked with Morgan for almost ten years at Good Morning Britain and CNN has been named executive editor TV for News UK Broadcasting. She had left GMB in early 2020 to join NBC but the pair are now reunited.

Dunbar Nelson has spoken to Press Gazette about working with Morgan and their plans for his show.

Another GMB colleague joining Morgan's team is its launch and series director Erron Gordon who has been hired as executive creative director and head of studio output for News UK Broadcasting.

Reporting to Dunbar Nelson Gordon will be series director for Morgan's show alongside his role leading the creative direction of TalkTV's programming and channel branding including set design on-screen graphics and managing the studio teams.

Gordon said: ""There are very few occasions in your career when you get to create something entirely new. TalkTV is one of those opportunities. I’m truly excited about what News UK wants to achieve with the station – and of course the opportunity to reunite with Piers on his new global show was impossible to resist.""

Gordon's deputy will be Oliver Gardner joining from ITV where he is currently director of Loose Women and previously a GMB director.

News UK said Gardner will assist in the creative direction of programming and channel branding including set design on-screen graphics and sonic branding as well as help manage studio teams and direct primetime programmes.

Gordon said: ""Having worked with him in the past I know he'll bring his excellent attention to detail and creative flare to our output. Ollie is passionate about live television and is the perfect choice to be directing our programmes and helping manage the studio crew as we continue to build a great team of talented creatives and technicians.""

Ben Briscoe currently assistant editor at GMB of six years has been named as series editor of Morgan's show.

Briscoe who has worked at ITV for 16 years said: “Piers Morgan is a unique talent in global broadcasting. It’s both a privilege and a delight to be working with him again on this hugely exciting new international show.”

Another former GMB senior producer Caitlin Black has been appointed as series editor on Newton Dunn's primetime programme.

In addition Vivek Sharma series editor of Steph’s Packed Lunch on Channel 4 and a former deputy editor of ITV's This Morning has been named as executive producer at News UK Broadcasting with responsibility for TalkTV's output.

Sharma who has also previously worked at Good Morning Britain said: “News UK has a rich heritage of world-class journalism. The launch of TalkTV next year will create an important new voice in news and current affairs delivered across a network of linear and non-linear platforms and I’m delighted to be joining the team.”

What is the TalkTV logo?

News UK Broadcasting executive creative director Erron Gordon said the logo was intended to be a ""bold clear recognisable and unique mark one that stands out and cuts-through the rest of the established news and current affairs ‘noise’"".

He added that the colour scheme was intended to ""marry authority with warmth"". The darker blue logo pictured here will be used for primetime coverage with a lighter blue in the daytime.

Gordon said: “The speech bubble is a clear symbol of our intent as a channel to engage with our audience. The fact the speech bubble contains and holds the TalkTV wordmark is a clear indication that the channel is at the centre of all of this enabling people to voice their opinion.”

TalkTV jobs

Earlier this year News UK was advertising for around 20 roles including several for a Have I Got News For You-style satirical panel show.

Others included a planning producer for a nightly debate show to feature a “headline-making” panel of topical guests a scriptwriter producers and a senior planning producer for Morgan's show and numerous specialist and technical roles behind the scenes.

Earlier roles to have closed included a head of production series editor producer assistant producer video editor and social media producer to work on Morgan's programme plus bookers.

Where will TalkTV be based?

TalkTV will be based at News UK's London Bridge office known as The News Building and formerly the Baby Shard. It has been confirmed that Morgan's show will be filmed here.

News UK has already invested in new TV studios at the site which are being used for live news bulletins for Talkradio and other ways of visualising its brands.

Who is behind TalkTV?

According to the FT Murdoch was unhappy with the TV channels on offer in the UK during the Covid-19 lockdown and so decided to launch his own.

Murdoch has a lot of experience with TV owning Fox News in the US Sky News in Australia and until 2018 controlling Sky in the UK for three decades.

Will TalkTV be right-wing?

The exact tone and content of TalkTV has not yet been revealed but the channel is expected to offer a similar political slant to The Sun and Talkradio.

TalkTV will use televised content from across News UK's existing brands and News UK Broadcasting chief executive Scott Taunton said the company already has ""some of the most articulate thought-leaders who reflect many different viewpoints"".

Will TalkTV make money?

Despite plans brewing at News UK to launch a linear TV channel for over a year it briefly decided to make it streaming only after a review of opportunities in the TV market deemed it to be “not commercially viable”.

Brooks said in a staff memo there was demand for alternative news provision but the “considerable” costs of running a channel meant it would not be worthwhile financially. However the company has now changed its tune.

Rob Keery of marketing agency AIP told Press Gazette: “TV has also never been more accessible than it is now thanks to technology advances” citing a move towards programmatic advertising that has opened TV up to companies with lower budgets.

“In spite of the pandemic there were over 850 advertisers that spent £50k or less on TV in 2020 – these sorts of budgets would have been unheard of in the past” he added. “It means that brands who wouldn’t have dreamed of advertising on TV can suddenly level up and find their audience on the biggest screen in the house for minimal outlay.”

He also said TalkTV will “give brands who hesitated to direct ad spend towards GB News a safer home for their ads to appear”.

Media analyst Doug McCabe of Enders Analysis said TalkTV will benefit from being part of a much bigger portfolio including beyond the UK compared to GB News.

TikTok bans political fund-raising ahead of midterms

Less than two months before the midterm elections TikTok is blocking politicians and political parties from fund-raising on its platform reports The New York Times’ Tiffany Hsu.

In a blog post on Wednesday the social media platform said it would prohibit solicitations for money by political campaigns. The company said political accounts would immediately lose access to advertising features and monetization services such as gift giving tipping and e-commerce capabilities.

Over the next few weeks TikTok will clamp down on politicians’ posting videos asking for donations or political parties’ directing users to online donation pages the company said.

Accounts run by government offices will be slightly less restricted. TikTok said such accounts would be allowed to advertise in limited circumstances such as when running educational campaigns about Covid-19 booster shots. But the people operating those accounts must work with someone from the company to run that kind of campaign.

Data shows broad trust gap between news in general and news on social media

People are much less likely to trust news they see on social media search engines and messaging apps than news in general according to a new study. The trust gap is however smaller for news seen on Google reports Press Gazette’s Aisha Majid.

The findings published on Thursday in the report “The trust gap: how and why news on digital platforms is viewed more sceptically versus news in general” are the latest in a long-running project from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism looking at trust in news.

A survey of 2000 people each in the UK the US Brazil and India asked a series of questions designed to examine the relationship between trust in news and how people think about news on digital platforms.

In the UK there was little difference in the level of trust in news overall and the level of trust in news on Google with 52% of people saying they trusted news they saw on the Alphabet-owned platform versus 53% who said they trusted news overall. After Google there is a dip – the next most-trusted platform for news is Youtube on 33%.

By contrast Facebook was among the least-trusted platforms in the UK with just 27% of respondents saying they had faith in the news they saw on there with the same percentage for Twitter. Tiktok (20%) and Instagram (24%) were at the bottom of the ranking.

F-List 2022 unmasks the advertising media and PR agencies working with climate polluters

The F-List 2022 has unmasked the advertising media and PR agencies working with and promoting climate-polluting companies and the fossil fuel industries.

The report by campaign groups Clean Creatives and Comms Declare named 239 agencies around the world who have done recent work for such organisations.

Key findings from the F-List analysis found:

• 239 agencies have done recent work with fossil fuel companies. The vast majority of this work is not shared via agency channels or with clients whose work may be affected by greenwashing claims.

• At least 17 agencies are working for Saudi Aramco the world’s largest polluter including a previously undisclosed Interpublic Mediabrands agency Well7. Interpublic agencies McCann UM and Jack Morton have also led substantial work for Aramco but all holding companies have some connection to the world’s largest oil company and funder of human rights abuses.

• The world’s biggest coal exporter Glencore is being referred to Australian regulators over a brand campaign ad that features EVs solar panels and wind turbines – but doesn’t mention coal. Comms Declare understands Bastion Creative is behind the campaign. This complaint follows the barring of two employees of Anacta Strategies from lobbying the Queensland government. Glencore secured a lucrative bailout while employing Anacta.

• Edelman retains its role as the independent agency doing the most work for fossil fuel companies despite a pledge in early 2022 to review its client policy. Some small signs of progress at the PR giant can be seen but the company remains committed to working with polluters.

Royal family given veto on use of footage of Queen’s funeral

British television channels gave Buckingham Palace a veto on the use of footage from Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral indicating the complicated relationship around the media’s coverage of the monarchy reports The Guardian’s Jim Waterson.

As part of an agreement with news broadcasters the royal household was given the right to request that particular pieces of footage from the funeral services at Westminster Abbey and Windsor Castle were not used again.

Royal staff sent messages to the BBC ITV News and Sky News during the event with the timestamps of footage they wished to exclude from future news broadcasts and social media clips. As a result five short pieces of video featuring members of the royal family were removed from circulation.

Although the sections were relatively brief the decision to give the palace a veto on what footage could be used has caused unease among some journalists who worked on the coverage in ongoing tension at British media outlets between marking the death of a major national figure and allowing news coverage to be shaped by the royal family.

Zan Rowe reveals how Guy Pearce Keith Urban Missy Higgins bared souls on Take 5

Zan Rowe says she just doesn’t believe it when people tell her they don’t like music reports News Corp’s James Wigney.

The versatile TV radio and podcast presenter has been so enamoured of the art form for so many years that she simply can’t fathom that others don’t share her passion at least to some degree.

“Wow that’s a big question” she says when asked what music means to her.

“It’s my memory bank. It’s the thing that gets me going physically and mentally. It’s the thing that triggers me to have a big old weep when I need to. It’s the way that I formed my identity and the way that I continue to form my identity.”

Although music has been Rowe’s job for more than two decades thanks to stints on Triple J Double J and as a regular contributor to ABC News Breakfast she’s never forgotten what it’s like to be a music fan. And where some people find themselves hearkening back to the bands and artists they loved in their formative late teen and early 20s years Rowe says she’s as curious and hungry as ever to seek out new music.

It’s a seemingly charming line delivered while her head lolls on her best friend’s lap helping to build Rhaenyra’s character as someone who doesn’t take herself too seriously. It is also so instantly quotable and therefore T-shirtable that the line is already plastered on fan-made merch reports The Guardian’s Jess Thomson.

But to some viewers it rang false. They had seen this pattern before: show writes meme-able scene; scene becomes meme; instant marketing; profit.

“Ugh someone in the Game of Thrones prequel just said ‘I never jest about cake’ so this is gonna be part of the ‘primarily written with the epic gifs in mind’ genre of shows” tweeted Zack Budryk a reporter at The Hill.

TV programmes and the lines that make us laugh have always been shared and discussed afterwards. So with the universality of Twitter and other social media it’s only natural that programmes’ “relatable” lines moments or scenarios are increasingly meme-ified among their fanbase being shared widely and eventually permuted into other established jokes on the internet. But sometimes it can feel as though shows are being written with the online reaction in mind particularly given that in our internet-saturated age the online temperature can make or break a piece of media.

Utilities stall and limit climate action by establishing controlling and funding front groups to spread climate misinformation through advertising on social media.

Utility front groups have spent thousands of dollars on disinformation advertising that target people of color and historically marginalized groups mislead the public on the impacts of gas bans highlight false concerns regarding the reliability of renewable energy and promote “renewable natural gas” and hydrogen despite multiple studies showing these fuels are not viable substitutes for building electrification.

Utility front groups advertise for preferred candidates in elections including Seniors Across America promoting Governor Ron DeSantis followed by a slew of anti-solar advertisements costing up to $60000.

Federal commissions legislators and utility regulators can take action to improve the transparency of utility advertising and limit the spread of disinformation.

Gas and electric utility front groups have spent over $2.4 million over the past 4 years on social media advertisements many of which include targeted messaging to mislead customers on critical climate and energy concerns including the impact of power plant retirements the reasons behind high utility bills and the viability of “renewable natural gas” and hydrogen.

Using data from the Meta Ad Library and existing code developed by Brown University the Energy and Policy Institute launched a new tracking tool that exposes up to $2.4 million in spending by 14 utility front groups in the last year and shows the specific regions that the groups are targeting with the advertisements. The tracker does not show advertising spending by the groups on other social media platforms such as TikTok Twitter or YouTube.

Utility front groups are organizations that appear independent but are established controlled or funded by a gas or electric utility or trade association. These front groups advocate on behalf of utility interests often by amplifying misinformation about distributed renewable energy or electrification while masking or obscuring the utility’s involvement. Just over the last year gas and electric utility front groups spent tens of thousands of dollars spreading misinformation through targeted advertising on the platforms of the social media giant Meta such as Facebook and Instagram. In some cases the front groups have promoted specific candidates over others to influence voters in the weeks before primary elections.

Social media networks expedite the spread of misinformation through algorithms that recommend new connections to people with similar views and then promote content within the network based on engagement with previously viewed material. Additionally research shows people are more likely to trust information from others in their social network propagating “echo chambers” and severe polarization of people uniting around disparate positions.

Social media companies are under scrutiny for promoting misinformation as are the companies using the platforms to spread falsehoods furthering their interests and influence.

In September 2022 the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee Subcommittee Oversight & Investigations led by Rep. Katie Porter examined the role of public relations firms in preventing climate action for their fossil fuel clients.

Other members of Congress are also investigating the firms and fossil fuel companies for their role in the decades-long campaign to mislead the American people about the industry’s role in climate change. Rep. Carolyn Maloney the Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform and Rep. Ro Khanna the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment recently released a report of initial findings that show how oil companies “focus on unproven technologies the companies admit are decades away from implementation” and “[rely] on accounting gimmicks tricky language and delay tactics to claim the mantle of climate leadership while continuing to be a primary cause of an ongoing climate catastrophe.” The report comes nearly a year after the Committee on Oversight and Reform held a hearing to examine the fossil fuel industry’s disinformation campaigns.

Like the oil industry the utility industry knew about the risks that burning fossil fuels posed to the climate for decades before the general public was broadly exposed to the same science. . In the late 1950s the oil industry was studying carbon dioxide in the atmosphere through their trade association the American Petroleum Institute. Several years later a science advisor to President Lyndon B. Johnson warned the utility’s trade association the Edison Electric Institute about the threat that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels could one day pose to the climate. Together the utility and oil industries were told of the climate risks of their products and actions but used doubt and denial in various ways including advertisements to erode public understanding of the science and quell government action. The industry then transitioned to deflecting focus onto the emissions of other countries and sectors and in recent years have “uplifted approaches such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) that have proven unviable to date in the power sector distracting attention from the energy transition” according to a recent study.

Today most utility companies have publicly committed to some type of “net-zero” climate goals but they continue to block meaningful climate reform and invest in fossil fuel infrastructure. EPI’s new tool shows that utilities continue to stall and limit climate action by funding front groups to spread climate and energy misinformation through advertising on social media networks. Below are a few examples of recent utility front group advertisements.

Front groups targeting people of color and historically marginalized groups

Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future is a 501(c)(4) front group with ties to some of the largest utilities in the country including DTE Energy Duke Energy and Southern Company. The front group has spent more than half a million dollars on Facebook and Instagram advertising since 2018 and is among the highest spenders of any utility front groups tracked by EPI.

The non-profit investigative news outlet Floodlight first reported on Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future’s advertisement campaign targeting young liberal and Black and Latino voters to convince them of the benefits of fossil gas in addressing climate change. Internal documents revealed that the campaign had a plan to “redefine the role of natural gas in fighting climate change and protect the social license to operate” and “success for the natural gas industry will be rooted in whether we can message to the left and the Democratic base of Black and Latino and age 18-34 voters as effectively as we have messaged to the right.”

More details from the documents detailed how the front group has a specific focus on Black voters: “Black voters- the core of President Biden’s Democratic coalition – are more likely to support affordability over disruptive changes in energy and climate policy. Black voters also register lower support for the Green New Deal when informed of the practical effects of such policies on energy affordability and reliability.”

The ads for the campaign included the same video with the message that fossil gas is “accelerating the world’s clean energy future” despite the fact that methane is accelerating the climate’s warming with a heat-trapping potency 84 to 87 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. The recent UN IPCC report clearly states that cutting methane emissions is critical to having a chance to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Yet methane emissions are on the rise and U.S. oil and gas drilling is a major contributor to the increase. Rob Jackson a Stanford University scientist who leads the Global Carbon Project which published two studies in July 2020 on this topic said “Natural gas use is rising quickly here in the U.S. and globally. It is offsetting coal in the electricity sector and reducing carbon dioxide emissions but increasing methane emissions in that sector. As a result we’re emitting more methane from oil and gas wells and leaky pipelines.”

Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future’s video for a $10000 campaign to target Black and Latino voters to convince them on the benefits of fossil gas.

Between February and May of this year Natural Allies spent up to $10000 on ads featuring the video created for its advertising campaign.

The Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA) which calls itself “the voice of the energy consumer” but in reality is an advocacy front group for some of the country’s largest utilities fossil fuel corporations and trade associations has spent even more than Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future on Facebook and Instagram advertising. Since May 2018 CEA has spent nearly $700000. It has also deployed similar tactics as Natural Allies dropping up to $8000 on an ad touting two women “running a business in a male-dominated field” and struggling in the face of rising fuel prices.

Seniors Across America is a front group that spent thousands of dollars on Facebook advertisements that urged Floridians to support an anti-rooftop solar bill. Text of the legislation HB 741 was sent to state senator Jennifer Bradley’s staff from a Florida Power & Light (FPL) lobbyist. FPL’s parent company NextEra Energy contributed $10000 to Bradely’s political committee just days after the legislator received the legislation and an additional $10000 weeks later. As the bill moved through the legislature Seniors Across America ran advertisements promoting it targeting those aged 55 and over and claiming that the “stealth solar tax” disproportionately hurt senior ratepayers by forcing them to subsidize customers who could afford to purchase solar for their homes. In fact the bill would have authorized utilities to charge all customers for the recovery of its lost revenue creating the very subsidy Senior Across America claimed solar was causing. Solar allies opposing the bill presented thousands of comments establishing the fact that no solar “cost shift” currently exists in Florida;Governor Ron DeSantis vetoed the bill saying that it would have forced rate increases among FPL’s captive customers. Seniors Across America continues to advertise warnings against “shady solar salespeople.”

Seniors Across America advertised warnings against the “stealth solar tax” to promote FPL’s anti-rooftop solar legislation.

Utility front groups spending thousands fighting against bans on fossil gas

Gas utilities and associated front groups are targeting regions where policies to electrify and prohibit fossil gas in buildings are advancing.

The Affordable Energy Coalition a front group created in March 2021 to attack building electrification policy in the Seattle region spent up to $2500 on an advertisement that ran through May 2022 focused on the Seattle City Council decision to ban fossil gas in new buildings. The front group used another advertisement to suggest vague and dangerous repercussions with no corroboration had the gas ban been in effect during Seattle’s record cold temperatures this past February.

Affordable Energy Coalition’s advertisement stokes unfounded fears on the impacts of building electrification.

Affordable Energy Coalition’s advertising stokes fears that electric heat pumps cannot perform in cold weather. However technological advances to new models of electric heat pumps disprove this concern. For instance a recent study in Maine found that heat pumps perform well in below-freezing weather without fossil-fueled backup. An analysis of the technology’s performance in Minnesota came to the same conclusion.

New Yorkers for Affordable Energy used similar tactics in response to a failed attempt to ban fossil fuels from newly constructed buildings in the near future. The front group is supported by the utilities Dominion National Grid and National Fuel Gas according to LittleSis. The front group focused on a campaign with the false narrative that banning gas appliances would require New Yorkers to spend thousands on retrofitting spending up to $8000 on ads falsely claiming that a gas appliance ban would cost homeowners $30000. However the ban was only for newly constructed buildings and an analysis from the Rocky Mountain Institute found that all-electric homes have lower costs than new mixed-fuel homes with savings on upfront costs and utility bills.

A study published by Stanford University researchers found that even when not running gas appliances release an annual amount of methane equivalent to 500000 cars. Further the nitrogen dioxide emitted from gas stoves inside homes far exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency’s outdoor air quality standards significantly increasing the risk of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease especially in children.

New Yorkers for Affordable Energy makes false claims about the financial impacts of building electrification.

Consumer Energy Alliance made a similar claim concerning costs in support of a bill that almost passed in Virginia that would have prevented municipalities and counties from banning new gas infrastructure and hookups. According to a Rocky Mountain Institute study many residential electrification scenarios for new buildings would reduce the cost for homeowners over the lifetime of the appliances as compared to fossil fuel-burning appliances and cost savings are also possible in retrofitting scenarios. Further with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act the federal government is lowering the energy costs of energy efficient appliances by providing $14000 in direct customer rebates.

Consumer Energy Alliance makes false claims about the financial impact of a gas ban in Virginia.

Advertisements from front groups make false claims concerning the reliability of renewable energy and energy security

Citizens for Energizing Michigan’s Economy (CEME) a 501(c)(4) organization that has received more than $43.5 million from Consumers Energy has spent on advertisements including misinformation about renewable energy and the electric grid. When Michigan legislators introduced a bill in 2021 to lift a cap on utility distributed generation programs CEME ran a misleading ad that falsely claimed “out-of-state special interests” – implying solar companies – caused widespread blackouts on the Texas grid earlier that year. Versions of the advertisement appeared on Facebook feeds in the districts of members of the Michigan House Energy Committee which held hearings on the legislation. Utility companies in Texas – specifically Calpine Vistra and NRG Energy – all have said natural gas shortages affected their ability to operate their power plants. Additionally the Texas Railroad Commission didn’t mandate winterization to prevent oil and gas wells from freezing and failed to ensure that gas producers and pipeline operators sought priority status for power during emergency outages which occurred when the grid operator ordered utilities to perform rotating outages. Coal-fired power plants also failed to operate during the extreme weather event.

Voices for Cooperative Power a front group funded by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association the trade association for electric cooperatives used Facebook ads in an attempt to urge people to call on the Michigan Public Service Commission to “not to allow the premature retirement of power plants unless the utilities demonstrate new operational alternative power plants first.” The ads are likely referring to the J.H. Campbell power plant owned by Consumers Energy. The ads claimed Michigan “can’t afford to go dark” suggesting renewable alternatives could not maintain reliable power or would be too costly. But expert analysis shows that switching to renewables would be the safest and most cost-effective option and modeling by Consumers Energy and environmental groups demonstrated Campbell’s retirement and the plan to purchase the Covert Generating Station accelerating the addition of 8000 megawatts of solar power and 550 MW of battery storage by 2040 with interim targets through this decade improve reliability in the service territory. Testimony filed by Consumers Energy also revealed that electric cooperative Wolverine Power Supply’s competitive business stood to benefit financially if Campbell remained open.

Affordable Energy for New Jersey spent its largest sums on attacks against Governor Phil Murphy’s Energy Master Plan. The 2019 plan outlines a statewide strategy to reach 100 percent clean energy by 2050 which prioritizes the rapid electrification of buildings. In response the front group has deployed a steady onslaught of low-cost frequent advertisements since the beginning of 2022.

The group’s ad topics range from attacks on the viability of electric vehicle batteries to blaming “radical environmentalists shouting down US LNG exports” for Germany’s reliance on coal in the midst of Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The front group also focused on blackouts in June 2022 advertisements in attempts to convey the message that only “base load” can prevent the blackouts. Utilities and groups typically reference coal gas and nuclear as baseload plants. Yet these fuels have no magical reliability properties and are responsible for their own outages. In Colorado during a summer heat wave Xcel Energy averted a crisis by taking control of customer thermostats to relieve demand after the coal plant Comanche 3 “went down quickly.” A year earlier a different Colorado utility Mountain Parks Electric warned customers to conserve energy because wind turbines “iced up” when in fact the causes of the supply crunch were complex and included how the winter conditions also impacted the supply of gas and Wyoming coal plants.

Affordable Energy for New Jersey’s ad touts baseload plants like coal gas and nuclear despite the reliability issues of these plants.

Gas utility front groups promoting RNG hydrogen and “clean” “natural” gas

Partnership for Energy Progress is a 501(c)(4) front group with ties to multiple utilities including Avista Cascade Natural Gas NW Natural and Puget Sound Energy all in the Pacific Northwest. The Guardian reported that the utilities created the group to convince consumers that “natural gas is part of a clean energy future.” The Seattle Times also reported that the group had prepared a $1 million media strategy campaign that would feature paid advertisements focused on “key audiences in Washington and Oregon” mobilize allies in policy debates and create a “positive” message about gas.

The front group has spent over $60000 in 2022 on Facebook and Instagram advertising. Part of the advertisement campaign focused on promoting technologies that gas utilities are bolstering but are false solutions for the purposes of building decarbonization. One of the messages promoted “renewable natural gas” as clean reliable and affordable and capable of being delivered in the existing gas infrastructure and reducing emissions. “Renewable natural gas” or biomethane is non-fossil methane generally captured from agricultural sources or landfills. The other message promoted hydrogen in the same light as renewable natural gas – as a practical solution for gas utilities to reduce emissions. Similar to utilities that have promoted carbon capture and storage even though it remains unworkable to date in the power sector Partnership for Energy Progress advertisements ignore the facts that biomethane and hydrogen while plausibly playing a role in decarbonizing other sectors are not viable alternatives to building electrification. Ample evidence shows both fuel types would lead to higher costs for customers are not available at the necessary scale could be climate intensive due to methane leakage exacerbate air pollution and cause safety risks.

Front groups frequently deployed ads that refer to fossil gas as a “clean” fuel source implying that it is critical to achieving emission reduction targets. The Alliance for Michigan Power used Facebook and Instagram advertisements to encourage that misleading message. The Alliance for Michigan Power is a front group with connections to monopoly utility company DTE Energy which provides both electric and gas service to customers in Michigan.

Alliance for Michigan Power calls on lawmakers to support a mix of power sources to meet net zero carbon emissions – including fossil gas.

Utility front groups involved in advertising for elections

Citizen’s Energizing Michigan’s Economy the front group funded by Consumers Energy ran Facebook ads for eight candidates – seven Republicans and one Democrat – ahead of their August 2022 primary elections. The ads for the Republicans focused heavily on advancing a right-wing agenda promoting “election integrity” gun ownership police “Christian values” and “fight[ing] China.”

In the weeks leading up to Florida’s August 2022 primary elections Seniors Across America spent hundreds of dollars supporting Governor Ron DeSantis who had no Republican primary challenger. DeSantis appointed the Florida Public Service Commissioners who approved Florida Power & Light’s rate hike earlier this year and has passed a host of legislation friendly to FPL and its parent company NextEra. In 2018 DeSantis received $25000 from a dark money non-profit funded by FPL. Despite his veto of the anti-rooftop solar bill written by FPL and supported by Seniors Across America DeSantis has remained silent about FPL’s connection to election scandals criminal trials and ongoing investigations. The ads from Seniors Across America praising DeSantis were followed by a slew of messaging campaigns one warning against “greedy solar companies and their door-to-door salesmen” on which the front group spent up to $30000 and another suggesting the “Top Five Scams” of rooftop solar salespeople which cost up to an additional $30000. These ads ran simultaneously with several ads encouraging primary voting.

Utility front groups also deploy tactics outside of Meta platforms to influence elections. Leading up to Nevada’s 2022 primary election Southwest Gas Corporation – one of the largest gas utilities in the country – gave $10000 its largest contribution at the time to Assemblywoman Lesley Cohen’s Democratic primary opponent Joe Dalia. Residents in Cohen’s district in Clark County also began receiving political mailers smearing Cohen and demanding she return “dirty money” from fossil fuel and energy companies ahead of the primary. The mailers were paid for by the front group Nevadans for Economic Opportunity (NEO) a 501(c)(4) “pro-growth public policy” coalition financially backed by the Retail Association of Nevada (RAN) and the Associated Builders and Contractors of Nevada among others. The address of RAN is also the same one for NEO in the state’s campaign finance disclosure database.

In 2021 Cohen introduced AB380 legislation that would require gas utilities to employ a more rigorous planning process before expanding infrastructure. To combat the legislation Southwest Gas built a coalition of affiliated interest groups. This included the creation of a now-disbanded front group Coalition for Cleaner Affordable Energy. The group sponsored Facebook content to “Stop AB380” and featured RAN’s Senior Vice President Bryan Wachter falsely framing the climate bill as a fossil gas appliance ban.

Appeals to state and federal regulators for greater transparency

Utilities form front groups to intentionally deceive customers and advance their own interests. By utilizing social media for advertising utility front groups rapidly disseminate disinformation without disclosure to viewers about the utilities’ involvement. Meanwhile even if utility involvement is revealed to customers through news sources or watchdog organizations customers are unable to opt out of paying their bills for electricity or gas both necessities of modern life.

The Federal Trade Commission exists to protect consumers from these kinds of deceptive and unfair business practices. Earlier this year 230 groups including the Energy and Policy Institute requested the FTC investigate the utility industry for widespread abuses including political corruption dark-money campaigns and unfair anti-competitive practices including denying customers access to renewable energy.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) could amend the accounting system that all utilities use in rate cases the Uniform System of Accounts to require that utilities record the millions paid in industry association dues as presumptively non-recoverable for rate recovery purposes. This action would at the very least force utilities to justify efforts to recover payments to trade associations engaged in political activities and would reduce costs for wholesale transmission customers who would no longer be required to pay those expenses. FERC can also require more granular disclosure of expenses made by utilities through their annual filings specifically in the accounts where utilities routinely place political expenses. This additional reporting requirement would help discourage utilities from booking the consulting costs of creating a front group and charging it to customers as Southern California Gas Company did several years ago when it formed the front group Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions to advance the utility’s pro-gas position in a California Public Utilities Commission proceeding.

Members of Congress can also include the utility industry in their investigations of the fossil fuel industry. The same questions and requests for documents sent to oil companies from the House Committee on Oversight and Reform could be sent to many in the utility industry as part of an ongoing investigation on climate disinformation. The House investigation included a request for companies to provide documents and communications related to involvement in supporting disinformation and misleading the public to prevent climate action.

State regulators are also capable of intervening on behalf of utility customers. Commissioner Sandra D. Kennedy of the Arizona Corporation Commission demanded that Arizona’s utilities provide comprehensive lists of political contributions lobbying expenses advertising and marketing expenses “Corporate Giving” and a list of compensations for employees and consultants engaged in those activities. In the filing Kennedy indicated that some utilities have “veered off the path of their core mission and instead have focused on solidifying their positions of power” and said that “the level of transparency called for in this letter is essential to maintaining the public’s trust.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vcmVuZXdhYmxlc25vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9jYWxpZm9ybmlhcy00ODUtbXctYmx5dGhlLXNvbGFyLWNvbXBsZXgtcmVhY2hlcy1mdWxsLXBvd2VyLTc5ODk3Mi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,California's 485-MW Blythe solar complex reaches full power,"The 485-MW Blythe solar complex and its 387-MW battery storage system in California’s Riverside County are fully operational the Department of the Interior announced on Wednesday.

The photovoltaic (PV) park consists of four units – two 110-MW plants and another two of 125 MW – and will be capable of generating enough electricity for around 145500 homes. Located on public land areas managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) the solar farm complex was installed in phases that were initiated between January 2015 and November 2020.

The Blythe project was permitted as part of California’s Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP). The scheme was originated as a 1-GW parabolic trough concentrated solar park by Palo Verde Solar I LLC a subsidiary of Solar Millenium which filed for bankruptcy in 2012. The technology was changed to solar photovoltaic (PV) after the project was acquired by NextEra Blythe Solar Energy Center LLC a unit of NextEra Energy Inc.

BLM noted it is currently processing 64 utility-scale clean energy projects on public lands in the western US that could add more than 41000 MW of renewable generation capacity to the western electric grid. Last month it announced the full commissioning of the 457-MW Palen solar complex in California’s Riverside County sited on federal lands.

A one-time $25 million refund will take effect in the month of January 2023  while additional savings will be phased in from 2023 through 2025.

FPL's 2022-2025 rate agreement includes a provision accounting for changes to federal tax law facilitating the quick implementation of bill adjustments.

JUNO BEACH Fla. Sept. 23 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Florida Power & Light Company today announced a plan to refund its approximately 5.8 million customers nearly $400 million in savings resulting from the new federal tax law. The savings are the result of a federal production tax credit (PTC) for the development of solar energy centers which FPL continues to build across Florida as part of the nation's largest solar expansion that today includes 50 operational sites.

FPL solar energy centers that began serving customers in 2022 are retroactively eligible for the PTCs. To quickly provide these savings to customers FPL is planning a one-time $25 million refund in the month of January 2023. Also starting next year and through 2025 the company plans to phase in nearly $360 million in additional federal tax savings for future planned solar projects.

""We recognize that all Floridians are continuing to deal with the challenges of record-high inflation and increased costs of everyday goods and services"" said FPL Chairman and CEO Eric Silagy. ""As we continue working to operate even more efficiently to drive costs out of our business federal tax savings will begin to provide some relief to customers next year as high natural gas prices continue to put upward pressure on bills.""

FPL's 2022-2025 rate agreement which was unanimously approved last year by state regulators and signed by the state's consumer advocate and other organizations includes a provision that accounts for changes to federal tax law. This mechanism will facilitate the quick implementation of bill adjustments over the remainder of FPL's rate agreement.

Despite widespread support for the comprehensive rate agreement which ensures FPL customers pay by far the lowest rates among utilities serving more than 75% of Floridians some groups earlier this year appealed the Florida Public Service Commission's final order to the Florida Supreme Court.

""Ironically these self-proclaimed advocacy groups are now effectively asking Florida's highest court to tear up the very rate agreement that will soon quickly enable customers to begin saving hundreds of millions of dollars on their electric bills over the next three years including a multi-million-dollar lump sum refund to start the new year"" Silagy said.

2023 Bills

As a result of federal tax savings FPL projects its typical 1000-kWh residential customer bill to be $126.65 in January 2023 by far the lowest among Florida's investor-owned utilities which serve more than 75% of the state. The company projects its typical 1000-kWh residential customer bill in Northwest Florida which includes a temporary hurricane surcharge for past Northwest Florida storms to be $156.85. All bills would increase slightly in February in the absence of the one-time refund due to an approved base rate adjustment and higher expected fuel costs in 2023 but still reflect lower base rates as a result of federal tax savings.

FPL's 2023 bill projections do not include higher-than-projected fuel costs in 2022 which the company has paid but are not yet reflected in bills. FPL does not profit from the fuel it purchases to generate electricity at power plants; it passes those costs directly to customers. The company continues to monitor the still highly volatile fuel market to get a more accurate assessment of actual costs for 2022 with the goal of easing the impact for customers. FPL expects to file a mid-course fuel correction by the end of this year or early next year which will result in an additional adjustment to rates in 2023.

Driving down costs while supporting customers

While natural gas prices have increased sharply and the fuel market remains volatile FPL continues to improve the fuel efficiency of its power plants and invest in low-cost renewable energy that is reducing the fuel portion of customer bills. Since 2001 the modernization of FPL's power plant fleet has saved customers more than $12 billion in fuel the company did not need to buy which equates to approximately $4.50 per month or $55 per year on the typical 1000-kWh FPL residential customer bill. In fact FPL's 50 solar energy centers helped customers avoid more than $200 million in fuel costs in just the first seven months of 2022 alone – which equates to roughly $3 per month on the typical 1000-kWh FPL residential customer bill.

FPL is committed to reducing and eventually eliminating the fuel portion of customer bills but it will take time. As natural gas costs are increasingly expensive unstable and hard to predict the company is working to reduce and by no later than 2045 eliminate natural gas from regular operations – and the fuel portion of customer bills along with it.

FPL has long been committed to helping customers find new ways to reduce their energy use which is the best way to save on electric bills. For energy savings tips that can lower residential bills by around $30 a month during the hottest months of the year visit FPL.com/WaysToSave. Customers struggling to pay their bill can call FPL's dedicated customer service team who can work with them to identify payment arrangements and available assistance at the local state and federal level.

“My passion is in bringing people together to advance clean energy at scale.”

Hometown: Bar Harbor Maine

Fun Fact About Yourself: By the time I was 10 years old my family and I had moved across three continents — from Qingdao China to Bielefeld Germany to Maine United States. One could say my parents prepared me for the MBA travel culture at an early age.

Undergraduate School and Major: UNC Chapel Hill – Environmental Science (Quantitative Energy Systems) Economics; JD/MBA at Stanford Law School and Harvard Business School

Most Recent Employer and Job Title: Senior Project Manager M&A at NextEra Energy

What has been your first impression of the Harvard Business School MBA students and alumni you’ve met so far. Tell us your best Harvard Business School story so far. My first impression of HBS students is that everyone is enthusiastic to connect. Similarly people are also quick to come together and mobilize whether it’s organizing a trip hosting virtual happy hours or forming new clubs. In this vein my best HBS story so far is when I went on a trip with four other admits to Peru. I was initially going to Peru with a friend over my birthday weekend; however my friend had to cancel her travels last-minute. A group of HBS students posted their plans to travel to Peru during the same weekend and I reached out. They immediately welcomed me to their group and I ended up having one of my best birthdays in Machu Picchu with them.

What makes the case method so attractive as a means to learn and become a better manager? Beyond learning from peers of different backgrounds and perspectives I love that the case method simulates business environments especially decision-making at leadership levels. Learning how to think on your feet speak with confidence engage others and synthesize differing information and opposing viewpoints are integral aspects to being a good leader. I think the case method effectively teaches both what you want to say and how you say it.

Aside from your classmates and cases what was the key part of Harvard Business School’s MBA programming that led you to choose this business school and why was it so important to you? HBS’s class size was a key factor in my decision. Our class is roughly 1000 students and it encompasses people from vastly different industries geographies educational and personal backgrounds. HBS’s size enables it to have a robust cohort where I could find pockets of any community I wanted to whether professional or personal.

What course club or activity excites you the most at Harvard Business School? Given my passion for clean energy I am most excited about the Energy & Environment Club. A key motivation behind my desire to pursue an MBA was to broaden my exposure to different verticals within the energy space. I am excited to meet classmates with similar passions and learn from their experiences.

When you think of Harvard Business School what is the first word that comes to mind? Why? Intentional. Every aspect of the HBS programming feels intentional from the curated ~90-microcosm sections to the set RC curriculum to the case method – it is clear that HBS has taken the care time and experience to build a program that is targeted to supporting and growing leaders. The HBS community of students are also intentional – they are targeted in their passions and goals and continuously aspire to push themselves and their industries.

Describe your biggest accomplishment in your career so far: Working to develop the two largest solar energy projects in New England and originating what was at the time the largest solar + energy storage deal in Northeast America. Together these projects total over half a billion in CAPEX and generate enough renewable energy to power over 70000 homes. The development life of a utility-scale solar project takes 3-4 years and is a true multi-disciplinary team effort that spans groups across engineering operations finance legal and construction. The two projects in New England were built in my home state of Maine. Visiting the project sites and seeing the operating solar infrastructure was a meaningful full circle for me as growing up in Maine was a key influence to my work in energy and sustainability.

What led you to pursue an MBA at this point and what do you hope to do after graduation? I wanted to pursue an MBA to round out my business skills and broaden my exposure to different verticals within the energy industry. Coming from a STEM background in undergrad I am looking forward to taking classes in areas such as finance operations and leadership. Post-MBA I plan to continue working in the energy industry and want to spend my time as a JD/MBA exploring both the legal and business worlds in this space.

What is one thing you have recently read watched or listened to that you would highly recommend to prospective MBAs? Why? Not exactly read watched or listened but what really helped me as a prospective MBA was speaking with alumni that had graduated for several years. I spoke to people who were 3-10 years post-MBA and found that in addition to providing feedback on their 2-year MBA experience they were able to reflect more broadly on their time in business school and the impact it has made in their careers in the medium-long term.

What other MBA programs did you apply to? Stanford GSB Wharton Booth

What advice would you give to help potential applicants gain admission into Harvard Business School’s MBA program? Make sure your application is cohesive and specific. Cohesive in the sense that your passions and aspirations are consistently conveyed and tied together across your personal educational and professional backgrounds. It should be easy for Admissions to understand what drives you your goals for the future and why an MBA at HBS is best fit for achieving your goals. Additionally make sure you are providing specific details of your contributions in your job and extracurricular activities. Highlight both your successes and the actions you took in achieving your outcomes.

Michael Weiss had access to his clients’ confidential and sensitive business information while working for the Big Four firm according to the SEC’s complaint filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

On four occasions after learning about pending acquisitions prospective business strategies and financial projections concerning four of his client companies Weiss purchased shares of those companies’ respective stocks the SEC said. His alleged misconduct occurred between July 2014 and September 2015.

Weiss perpetrated his scheme “for his personal gain and in violation of the duty he owed to both EY and EY client companies” the agency said.

Weiss signed annual affirmations “indicating that he carefully read understood and agreed to comply with EY’s global code of conduct and insider trading global policies among others as a condition of his employment” the SEC noted.

Weiss was a business development director at EY from August 2003 until January 2021. He worked on more than 50 pursuits of audit and nonaudit business opportunities involving EY clients and prospective clients during that time the SEC said.

The four client companies Weiss allegedly purchased stock in included a global packaging business a personal finance company a multinational investment bank and a freight transportation company.

In June 2014 Weiss learned the global packaging company planned to relocate its headquarters. Before the market opened on July 23 2014 he purchased 5000 shares of the company’s stock according to the SEC.

On Aug. 18 2014 Weiss sold all 5000 of the company’s shares for a profit of $3113. He didn’t report the trades to EY the SEC said.

Weiss made profits of $10286 from his illicit trades of stock from the four companies the agency found. He violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act the SEC alleged.

Weiss “knew or was reckless in not knowing” executing trades for personal gain based on insider information he had gained through his position at EY was a breach of the duty trust and confidence he owed to the firm and the client companies the SEC said.

Weiss will pay $10286 in restitution $10286 as a penalty and $3328 in interest.

“We have no comment further to the complaint and judgment filed (Wednesday)” an EY spokesman said in an emailed comment. “It is worth noting as the complaint states we ‘determined defendant violated several EY policies.’ His employment was terminated in 2021.”

The settlement is subject to court approval the SEC noted."

Example video title will go here for this video

JULIETTE Ga. — When you get in a car accident you expect first responders to provide life-saving care.

But what if they can’t get to you without a 35-minute detour?

That’s what happened in July 2021 when a stopped train blocked a railroad crossing in Juliette Monroe County.

13 Investigates’ Ashlyn Webb took a closer look at the track that’s gone from a headache to a public-safety problem for folks in Juliette.

About 10:30 on the morning of July 30 2021 Monroe County deputies responded to an accident near the railroad tracks on Juliette Road.

According to dispatch records a 73-year-old woman was unconscious after another driver hit her truck. The driver told officers he was under the influence of meth.

But first responders couldn’t get to the scene. A Norfolk Southern train blocked the crossing.

“We constantly called Norfolk Southern asked them to move the train” said Sheriff Brad Freeman. “They gave excuses on why they couldn't move the train.”

Freeman says deputies would have to take a 35-minute detour around the blocked crossing.

“That's a long time” the sheriff said. “Evidence can be destroyed. Suspects can disappear. And as far as the EMS side you're looking at you know the golden hour where you can get a trauma patient to the hospital and possibly save their life.

“Well .if it's taking you 35 minutes to get to the scene” Freeman said “it can be bad.”

While deputies tried to cross their office asked neighboring Jones County to respond. But their crews were also 30 minutes away.

So first responders slid the 73-year-old under a train car on a gurney so she could get medical help.

“It's scary and disturbing” said Andrea Goolsby who lives in Juliette

“The fact that I have a child he and myself both spend so much time on the river.. if something were to happen across those tracks. Who's going to get to us to help us?” Goolsby said. “It's a safety issue. There are people that live on the other side of the tracks that are medically fragile… some terminally ill and having to go 20 miles out of their way. That could be life or death.”

The Federal Railroad Administration says since June 2020 they’ve received at least 92 reports of Juliette Road being blocked.

But people in Juliette say they don’t report most of those cases to the feds. They say the crossing gets blocked weekly sometimes daily for up to six hours.

Our crew was there when it happened on Labor Day.

“Move this train” Goolsby said on the other side of the tracks.

It’s not illegal for a train to block a crossing even for hours. The Federal Railroad Administration says there are no federal rules against it and there’s no Georgia law. But some states like Washington Iowa Illinois and Oklahoma ban trains from blocking crossings for more than 10 minutes. Other states like Alabama have considered laws.

Freeman says with safety concerns mounting they’ve reached out to Norfolk Southern asking for them to fix the problem.

“Basically they were less than polite. Basically informed me that there was nothing I could do and nothing they would do about it” Freeman said.

13 WMAZ’s Ashlyn Webb asked the sheriff “Do you feel like you're being railroaded? Do you feel like the city of Juliette is being railroaded in this?”

“I feel the railroad just has an I-don't-care attitude” Freeman said. “It's like you know obviously the railroad is a corporation. You can't vote for them. You can't boot them out of office and they're going to do what they want to do… and basically dare you to do anything to them.”

In a written response Norfolk Southern said they could not move the train on July 30 2021 because it broke down and needed repairs.

But that’s not always the case when the Juliette crossing is blocked.

The railroad says trains stop at a siding near the crossing when crews take “mandated rest times.” The company says they’re stopping even more in the last year due to staffing problems. They say they’re working to hire more crews.

The Federal Railroad Administration says the new infrastructure law passed by Congress in November included the Railroad Crossing Elimination Program. It will fund projects like creating overpasses and underpasses as well as moving some tracks.

Full Statement from Norfolk Southern to 13 WMAZ:

First the Juliette Rd crossing sits within a siding - a critical element of the railroad that allows trains to ‘meet’ or pass each other. Without the ability to pass train traffic would become completely gridlocked. Trains have to occupy these sidings for different amounts of time depending on a number of factors such as schedule crew time (like airline crews regulation governs the amount of time a train crew may operate a train) or mechanical issues.

Over the last year we’ve experience a number of challenges that have impacted our ability to keep our trains moving as fluid as they can including staffing issues that have made some of these delays worse. We’ve been hiring conductor trainees offering bonuses and pay raises to attract candidates and have high numbers of trainees in our pipeline. Our network will continue to see improvement as these trainees complete training and enter service.

Specific to the issue you are referencing from last summer a train experienced a breakdown at that crossing. Once it was repaired traffic had to be cleared ahead. We were notified by local 911 that an incident was happening and we began to work to get the train moved. We were in constant communication with first responders and we worked with them to stop and hold traffic there when EMS needed to transport the patient. Our Police Communications Center is staffed 24/7/365 and ready to work with first responders in case of emergency.

Regardless we never want to inconvenience any community with a stopped train. Trains do have to stop at times for a number of reasons like mechanical issues or mandated rest time. Our crews work hard to keep trains moving and whenever they do have to stop to minimize how long they are stopped. Outside of daily operations we also work to keep open lines of communication with communities that are seeing specific issues and to work with local leaders to find long-term solutions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZ2lzdGVyaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL2NvbW1pc3Npb24tc2lnbnMtYWdyZWVtZW50LXdpdGgtcmFpbHJvYWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Commission signs agreement with railroad,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZ2lzdGVyaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL2NvbW1pc3Npb24tc2lnbnMtYWdyZWVtZW50LXdpdGgtcmFpbHJvYWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674132ADD0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Coinciding with Rail Safety Week Norfolk Southern (NS) took part in a Operation Awareness and Response first responder training this week in Lafayette Ind.

NS says it is using the OAR program to train first responders and “ensure the general public is aware of rail safe practices throughout NS’s operational markets.”

Below are photos from the training provided by NS including police fire and EMT personnel at the NS rail yard; trainees boarding a custom-built NS “Safety Train” used as their classroom; and the NS HazMat Team demonstrating emergency response.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWlucy5jb20vdHJuL25ld3MtcmV2aWV3cy9uZXdzLXdpcmUvbWFqb3Itc2hpcHBlci1zYXlzLXJlb3BlbmluZy1vZi1odW1wLXlhcmRzLWhhcy1oZWxwZWQtaW1wcm92ZS1yYWlsLXNlcnZpY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Major shipper says reopening of hump yards has helped improve rail service - Trains,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWlucy5jb20vdHJuL25ld3MtcmV2aWV3cy9uZXdzLXdpcmUvbWFqb3Itc2hpcHBlci1zYXlzLXJlb3BlbmluZy1vZi1odW1wLXlhcmRzLWhhcy1oZWxwZWQtaW1wcm92ZS1yYWlsLXNlcnZpY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674132A800>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Co-organized by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and UNDP the session highlighted the importance of adopting mechanisms that build capacity to manage conflict and promote peace in fragile or violence-affected countries.

Kicking off the discussion Mr. Henry Bonsu a broadcaster and media consultant said the event was timely given ongoing efforts to build and maintain lasting peace across the globe.

“As the world experiences a growing sense of insecurity division and instability both local and international actors need to refocus on the value of courteous and constructive vertical (between governments and people) and horizontal (among people and local communities) dialoguing to build trust which is needed more than ever to build resilience in the African context” he noted.

According to UNDP a spike in transnational conflict involving non-state actors and violence erupting in both fragile and previously stable countries has contributed to a tremendous loss in hard-won development gains across Africa with adverse impacts on the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable populations.

UNDP Regional Director for Africa Ms. Ahunna Eziakonwa stressed that the nature of conflict has evolved. “Democratisation appears to be under threat in parts of the continent as evidenced by a recent spate of coup d’états extensions of presidential term limits and disputed elections that represent a disturbing trend. All of this diminishes citizens’ trust in state institutions” she said adding that poor representation of marginalized groups and the lack of inclusion of women and youth further compound the problem.

Against this backdrop UNDP has been promoting trust-building as an integral component of its approaches in borderland regions such as the project on ‘Preventing and Responding to Violent Extremism in Africa’ which applies a development approach towards addressing the root causes of conflict and focusses on restoring vertical and horizontal dimensions of trust within communities and between the local population and state institutions in 24 countries.

She further highlighted that with support from the Government of Japan the Africa Borderlands Centre implemented a ‘Trade for Peace’ project in the Sahel’s Liptako Gourma region that contributed to the promotion of cross-border peacebuilding inclusive prosperity and social cohesion.

Senior Director of the Office for Peacebuilding at JICA Mr. Murotani Ryutaro outlined the approach taken by the development agency in its engagement within conflict-affected areas in Africa by focusing on how to build resilient states and societies. “JICA and UNDP are here to support local leaders actors and communities to build their own systems that are resilient to a variety of shocks” he said.

Mr. Murotani touched on JICA’s engagement with Cote d’Ivoire Sierra Leone and Nigeria to showcase the methods being implemented to aid in the progress of creating societies that are peaceful and resilient.

In Cote d’Ivoire JICA is working on a project that supports the central and northern part of the country through introducing evidence-based planning which could improve vertical trust between the government and the local community. Mr. Yapi Urbain Director of Local Development at the Ministry of Interior and Security in Côte d’Ivoire recalled that following the post-electoral crisis of 2011 the country went through moments of doubt and experienced a brake on its development. But the government has made efforts to restore confidence by setting up frameworks for exchanges including political dialogue and social dialogue. In terms of social cohesion and local development Côte d'Ivoire and Japan through JICA have been implementing two projects COSAY in the capital Abidjan and PCN-CI in the central and northern areas of the country.

Meanwhile in Sierra Leone JICA and the government are working to create a sustainable system to use the Guidelines that shows local government staff how to do their day-do-day work for service delivery resulting in wining trust from local community. Mr. Alusine Joaque Deputy Secretary in Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development said partnerships with JICA and UNDP have helped the government build resilience and trust through promoting dialogues between local institutions and citizens and realize the negative impact of “winner-takes-all” political culture.

In Nigeria JICA is working in the northeast regions with the North-East Development Commission (NEDC) to build capacity of government that could provide effective services to the local population. JICA also aims to contribute to supporting the empowerment of the local communities. Mr. Mohammed G. Alkali Managing Director and CEO of NEDC in the Government of Nigeria said interventions created through partnership such as that of JICA and UNDP are important in encouraging social cohesion in the North-East where violent insurgency has caused high levels of distrust among communities. He also highlighted important lessons learned in his recent visit to Tokyo from Hiroshima’s reconstruction experience after the atomic bomb in 1945.

A UNDP report titled “Assessing the Impact of Conflict on Development in north-east Nigeria” warns that the conflict in the north-east could amount to the loss of 1.1 million lives by 2030 if the current investment deficit in development is not addressed.

On ways to overcome trust-building challenges at the community level in the affected countries Ms. Leonie Abela a peacebuilding practitioner and specialist in community-based conflict resolution said local-level inclusive peace dialogues incorporating community’s livelihood development initiatives could help restore positive bonds between communities and government institutions reinforcing trust state legitimacy and stability.

Restoring vertical and horizontal dimensions of trust within communities and between local population and state institutions is at the core of UNDP’s “Preventing and Responding to Violent Extremism in Africa” project.

South Africa is a country familiar with the importance of rebuilding vertical and horizontal dimensions of trust between state and people. Elaborating on the country’s successful approach to building trust in the immediate period after apartheid ended Dr. Vasu Gounden Executive Director of ACCORD said the first steps included talking between the former regime and the now ruling African National Congress government.

He however stressed the importance of mitigating violence to deliver the peace dividend. “We need to develop but we can’t develop without mitigating conflict. So let's mitigate and develop simultaneously to ensure that we deliver on the peace dividend and build sustainable peace on the continent” he said.

ACCORD is a civil society organization working throughout Africa to bring creative African solutions to the challenges posed by conflict on the continent.

Ms. Ouided Bouchamaoui the 2015 Nobel Peace Laureate from Tunisia stressed the importance of inclusive national dialogue.

With feelings of uncertainty and distrust in leadership growing in Tunisia Ms. Bouchamaoui said political actors have realised the need to enter negotiations with civil society to ensure stability. She emphasized the need for women and youth to have a voice in national dialogues.

Panelists agreed that regular interaction and meaningful engagement between communities and authorities is crucial to building positive bonds to reinforce state legitimacy stability and bring about durable peace.

The event was concluded with remarks by JICA Vice President Mr. Kato Ryuichi appreciating all panelists for presenting lively cases of local level efforts being translated into empowerment of people and social cohesion and underlining the commitment of JICA to promote human security approach with UNDP in Africa to enhance its resilience and to achieve peace and stability.

A mosque at a fishing port in northeastern Japan might seem incongruous to some people but not to the many Muslims from Indonesia Bangladesh and elsewhere who work as technical trainees in the local seafood and construction industries.

The mosque which was completed in July is an essential cornerstone of their daily lives where greetings of “as-salamu alaykum” (peace be upon you) ring out as young people in ethnic clothes enter the building topped with a white dome.

Women wearing headscarves lay out mats for prayers outside the building.

Many of the worshippers came to Japan from Indonesia and elsewhere to work for seafood processing manufacturers fishing boat operators and the construction industry.

Technical interns have become increasingly indispensable for this port city facing the Pacific Ocean which has been suffering from a labour crunch since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster that claimed about 20000 lives.

A 51-year-old Bangladeshi who runs a small construction company built the mosque. Trainees and others showed up at the building site by bicycle on their off days to help paint and weed.

A 27-year-old Indonesian explained that the mosque was essential to him as “I used to have no choice but to go to a mosque in Sendai by train for Friday prayers.”

As a crewman on a trawler for seven years the Indonesian said his work is tough. As he misses his hometown the mosque is like a home away from home for him to see his compatriots from other workplaces.

The Bangladeshi president said he had been concerned about public prejudice against Islam in Japan when he embarked on the mosque construction project.

He visited the city office and the local neighbourhood association beforehand telling them that the facility “has no links with extremists or terrorists whatsoever.”

Plans call for the mosque to be expanded later to accommodate a library and a restaurant to serve food specially prepared for Muslims in halal fashion.

Those images marked a new era of astronomical discovery and signify a herculean human and technological accomplishment—something Kathy Warden Chair CEO and President of Northrop Grumman can speak to firsthand.

I had the chance to connect with Kathy last month and in addition to humoring my questions about space (Northrop Grumman led the development and delivery of the James Webb Space Telescope—a technology marvel) we touched on many dimensions of leadership—from Kathy’s ascent to CEO in 2019 to steering the company through the pandemic a year later; to Northrop Grumman’s focus on inclusive leadership; to her journey into a career that gives her a true sense of purpose.

It was a fascinating conversation—full of both optimism and practicality—and it’s my privilege to share Kathy’s perspective with you today.

Kathy it’s great to see you. You became Northrop Grumman’s CEO in 2019 just before the pandemic began. What have you learned leading through a time of such intensity and change?

The last three years have certainly required resilience and flexibility. Our teams and leaders have been amazing and they continue to show their ability to innovate and adapt even in the new kind of dynamic times we’re living in.

This experience has also underscored the importance of empathy and taking time to truly cultivate trust—and we’ve been intentional about this. We also communicate openly have a clear priority in our people and we are united around our shared purpose.

You used the word “purpose.” Often the idea of purpose is very conceptual but you have taken intentional time to translate Northrop Grumman’s purpose into concrete actions that your people can take each day. What were the practical mechanisms you used to make this happen?

In early 2020—right before the pandemic—we very clearly defined our purpose and a set of guiding values. Really they are a rearticulation of the behaviors we have always valued in our team. We paired those values with leadership behaviors and we provided our leaders with tools and training so they can implement and communicate those values and behaviors with their teams.

This effort has really given our people a north star and empowered them to operate within our value system. And over time it has helped us move faster as an organization.

We are also data-centric and increasingly so. We set quantitative goals and we measure our progress. That keeps us accountable. It helps ensure that we’re not only living our values but we’re also continuing to improve the operational environment within our company as well.

That’s very powerful. One of the things I admire most about Northrop Grumman is your dedication to diversity & inclusion and the degree to which you’ve defined inclusive leadership as being core to your organization. Can you talk about that journey and about what the next chapter looks like for you?

Our culture is incredibly important to me and to our team because it’s at the center of our ability to deliver value to all our stakeholders. I believe that diversity of thought and tapping into people’s broad experiences gives us the ability to innovate. It truly sets us apart from other organizations and makes us all better.

The next stage in our journey is about focusing on a sense of belonging across every part our organization. So we are exploring how we can better position our team members to not only be part of diverse and innovative teams but to continue to grow and feel like they can bring their entire selves to work. And that journey is one that we’ve been on for a while but I don’t believe ever ends.

I have to ask you about the James Webb Telescope. This is such a seminal event for the world not just for the United States. What has it been like to lead through its launch? How has it been received inside your organization?

Well it was a bit harrowing! To lead through the development launch and now the actualization of the telescope—there were so many new technologies we needed to invent to be able to look back 13 billion years in time through light travel and the capture of that light.

But really it’s just amazing to me that we have the technical talent to support such a phenomenal feat. We are producing these stunning images and it is such a motivator—not only to people who were a part of the program—but to the entire Northrop Grumman team who contributed along the way. Not to mention the people around the globe who are getting to see this amazing science. It creates a new sense of curiosity and excitement about space and our understanding of it.

I really hope that capabilities like the Webb Telescope inspire a whole generation of people who might not otherwise have pursued a career in STEM to do so. That may truly be Webb’s greatest legacy.

It’s such an important breakthrough and it will be a gift for generations to come. If I can pivot to the defense industry an industry that is fast-changing with new challenges emerging all the time—What excites you most about the direction in which the industry is moving today?

Certainly recent global conflicts have underscored the need for defense and an evolution of security. It also underscores the complexities of modern warfare which I believe has the potential to change more in the next five years than it has in the last 50.

Being a part of that and looking at how we can rapidly develop technology and bring it into these national security applications is what our company does well. We have this ethos around problem-solving and pioneering that I am very excited to bring to today’s environment; and I believe we have both the mindset and the capabilities to do that.

I’m hearing a sense of optimism in your tone and in your words in describing the future.

I am an optimist. I believe in American ingenuity and in democracy. I also think capitalism drives innovation and entrepreneurship that other systems do not. And so yes I’m very optimistic about our ability to compete not just as a defense industry but as a nation.

Taking a step back—I would love to hear a little bit more about your own path as a leader. What were the most pivotal moments in your journey to becoming the CEO of one of the world’s most important institutions today?

I’m from a small town in Maryland and I was educated in public schools. I am amazed when I look back and see where I am today. I think it was a lot of support and good fortune along the way.

Probably the most significant moment in my career journey was following the events of September 11 2001. I like many others at the time was personally impacted by the tragedy of that day.

Shortly afterward I had the opportunity to take what I thought would be a short work assignment—one within the intelligence community that leveraged my commercial technology experience. That work brought a new sense of purpose and clarity to me and it’s what set me on my current career trajectory and what ultimately led me to Northrop Grumman.

We’re in a world full of uncertainty. As you look ahead what leadership characteristics do you think will be most important as we look to the future?

Grit resilience and determination of course.

We must also be able to effectively rally people around a vision for the future and a set of values—and we must ensure those are upheld throughout the organization. That requires an excellent grip on communication along with a commitment to the highest standards of ethics and integrity.

Finally in times like these the importance of courage cannot be overstated. Courage to act. Courage to make decisions without perfect information. Courage to change course as things become clearer. These characteristics will be critical for leaders for the foreseeable future.

Also called the Southern Cross Integrated Flight Research Experiment (SCIFiRE) the two countries entered this agreement in 2020 to develop HACM prototypes.

Under SCIFiRE the USAF awarded a 15-month HACM preliminary design contract to Boeing Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies.

With a selection of the Raytheon SCIFiRE prototype design the HACM programme will now operationalise this concept for integration with a fighter aircraft to deliver two leave-behind assets with operational utility.

Australia will also provide test infrastructure for HACM’s initial all-up-round flight tests as its contribution to the SCIFiRE agreement.

USAF chief of staff general CQ Brown Jr said: “HACM will provide our commanders with tactical flexibility to employ fighters to hold high-value time-sensitive targets at risk while maintaining bombers for other strategic targets.”

HACM an air-launched scramjet-powered hypersonic munition is being developed to hold long-range high-value targets in highly contested scenarios.

The development of HACM will allow the USAF to enhance interoperability with allies and partner nations and stay ahead of strategic competitors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvdmNvbndpcmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvbWFyeS1wZXRyeXN6eW4tdG8tcmV0aXJlLWFzLW5vcnRocm9wLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS12cC1kZWZlbnNlLXN5c3RlbXMtdW5pdC1oZWFkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mary Petryszyn to Retire as Northrop Defense Systems Sector Head in January 2023,"Mary Petryszyn corporate vice president and president of the defense systems sector at Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) intends to retire on Jan. 13 2023 after a decadelong career at the company.

Utilities stall and limit climate action by establishing controlling and funding front groups to spread climate misinformation through advertising on social media.

Utility front groups have spent thousands of dollars on disinformation advertising that target people of color and historically marginalized groups mislead the public on the impacts of gas bans highlight false concerns regarding the reliability of renewable energy and promote “renewable natural gas” and hydrogen despite multiple studies showing these fuels are not viable substitutes for building electrification.

Utility front groups advertise for preferred candidates in elections including Seniors Across America promoting Governor Ron DeSantis followed by a slew of anti-solar advertisements costing up to $60000.

Federal commissions legislators and utility regulators can take action to improve the transparency of utility advertising and limit the spread of disinformation.

Gas and electric utility front groups have spent over $2.4 million over the past 4 years on social media advertisements many of which include targeted messaging to mislead customers on critical climate and energy concerns including the impact of power plant retirements the reasons behind high utility bills and the viability of “renewable natural gas” and hydrogen.

Using data from the Meta Ad Library and existing code developed by Brown University the Energy and Policy Institute launched a new tracking tool that exposes up to $2.4 million in spending by 14 utility front groups in the last year and shows the specific regions that the groups are targeting with the advertisements. The tracker does not show advertising spending by the groups on other social media platforms such as TikTok Twitter or YouTube.

Utility front groups are organizations that appear independent but are established controlled or funded by a gas or electric utility or trade association. These front groups advocate on behalf of utility interests often by amplifying misinformation about distributed renewable energy or electrification while masking or obscuring the utility’s involvement. Just over the last year gas and electric utility front groups spent tens of thousands of dollars spreading misinformation through targeted advertising on the platforms of the social media giant Meta such as Facebook and Instagram. In some cases the front groups have promoted specific candidates over others to influence voters in the weeks before primary elections.

Social media networks expedite the spread of misinformation through algorithms that recommend new connections to people with similar views and then promote content within the network based on engagement with previously viewed material. Additionally research shows people are more likely to trust information from others in their social network propagating “echo chambers” and severe polarization of people uniting around disparate positions.

Social media companies are under scrutiny for promoting misinformation as are the companies using the platforms to spread falsehoods furthering their interests and influence.

In September 2022 the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee Subcommittee Oversight & Investigations led by Rep. Katie Porter examined the role of public relations firms in preventing climate action for their fossil fuel clients.

Other members of Congress are also investigating the firms and fossil fuel companies for their role in the decades-long campaign to mislead the American people about the industry’s role in climate change. Rep. Carolyn Maloney the Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform and Rep. Ro Khanna the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment recently released a report of initial findings that show how oil companies “focus on unproven technologies the companies admit are decades away from implementation” and “[rely] on accounting gimmicks tricky language and delay tactics to claim the mantle of climate leadership while continuing to be a primary cause of an ongoing climate catastrophe.” The report comes nearly a year after the Committee on Oversight and Reform held a hearing to examine the fossil fuel industry’s disinformation campaigns.

Like the oil industry the utility industry knew about the risks that burning fossil fuels posed to the climate for decades before the general public was broadly exposed to the same science. . In the late 1950s the oil industry was studying carbon dioxide in the atmosphere through their trade association the American Petroleum Institute. Several years later a science advisor to President Lyndon B. Johnson warned the utility’s trade association the Edison Electric Institute about the threat that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels could one day pose to the climate. Together the utility and oil industries were told of the climate risks of their products and actions but used doubt and denial in various ways including advertisements to erode public understanding of the science and quell government action. The industry then transitioned to deflecting focus onto the emissions of other countries and sectors and in recent years have “uplifted approaches such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) that have proven unviable to date in the power sector distracting attention from the energy transition” according to a recent study.

Left: A print advertisement from the Information Council on the Environment (also known as Informed Citizens for the Environment) which was formed in 1991 to “reposition global warming as theory (not fact).” Right: A Facebook advertisement from Natural Allies for Clean Energy Future which has a media campaign plan to “redefine the role of natural gas in fighting climate change and protect the social license to operate.”

Today most utility companies have publicly committed to some type of “net-zero” climate goals but they continue to block meaningful climate reform and invest in fossil fuel infrastructure. EPI’s new tool shows that utilities continue to stall and limit climate action by funding front groups to spread climate and energy misinformation through advertising on social media networks. Below are a few examples of recent utility front group advertisements.

Front groups targeting people of color and historically marginalized groups

Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future is a 501(c)(4) front group with ties to some of the largest utilities in the country including DTE Energy Duke Energy and Southern Company. The front group has spent more than half a million dollars on Facebook and Instagram advertising since 2018 and is among the highest spenders of any utility front groups tracked by EPI.

The non-profit investigative news outlet Floodlight first reported on Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future’s advertisement campaign targeting young liberal and Black and Latino voters to convince them of the benefits of fossil gas in addressing climate change. Internal documents revealed that the campaign had a plan to “redefine the role of natural gas in fighting climate change and protect the social license to operate” and “success for the natural gas industry will be rooted in whether we can message to the left and the Democratic base of Black and Latino and age 18-34 voters as effectively as we have messaged to the right.”

More details from the documents detailed how the front group has a specific focus on Black voters: “Black voters- the core of President Biden’s Democratic coalition – are more likely to support affordability over disruptive changes in energy and climate policy. Black voters also register lower support for the Green New Deal when informed of the practical effects of such policies on energy affordability and reliability.”

The ads for the campaign included the same video with the message that fossil gas is “accelerating the world’s clean energy future” despite the fact that methane is accelerating the climate’s warming with a heat-trapping potency 84 to 87 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. The recent UN IPCC report clearly states that cutting methane emissions is critical to having a chance to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Yet methane emissions are on the rise and U.S. oil and gas drilling is a major contributor to the increase. Rob Jackson a Stanford University scientist who leads the Global Carbon Project which published two studies in July 2020 on this topic said “Natural gas use is rising quickly here in the U.S. and globally. It is offsetting coal in the electricity sector and reducing carbon dioxide emissions but increasing methane emissions in that sector. As a result we’re emitting more methane from oil and gas wells and leaky pipelines.”

Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future’s video for a $10000 campaign to target Black and Latino voters to convince them on the benefits of fossil gas.

Between February and May of this year Natural Allies spent up to $10000 on ads featuring the video created for its advertising campaign.

The Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA) which calls itself “the voice of the energy consumer” but in reality is an advocacy front group for some of the country’s largest utilities fossil fuel corporations and trade associations has spent even more than Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future on Facebook and Instagram advertising. Since May 2018 CEA has spent nearly $700000. It has also deployed similar tactics as Natural Allies dropping up to $8000 on an ad touting two women “running a business in a male-dominated field” and struggling in the face of rising fuel prices.

Seniors Across America is a front group that spent thousands of dollars on Facebook advertisements that urged Floridians to support an anti-rooftop solar bill. Text of the legislation HB 741 was sent to state senator Jennifer Bradley’s staff from a Florida Power & Light (FPL) lobbyist. FPL’s parent company NextEra Energy contributed $10000 to Bradely’s political committee just days after the legislator received the legislation and an additional $10000 weeks later. As the bill moved through the legislature Seniors Across America ran advertisements promoting it targeting those aged 55 and over and claiming that the “stealth solar tax” disproportionately hurt senior ratepayers by forcing them to subsidize customers who could afford to purchase solar for their homes. In fact the bill would have authorized utilities to charge all customers for the recovery of its lost revenue creating the very subsidy Senior Across America claimed solar was causing. Solar allies opposing the bill presented thousands of comments establishing the fact that no solar “cost shift” currently exists in Florida;Governor Ron DeSantis vetoed the bill saying that it would have forced rate increases among FPL’s captive customers. Seniors Across America continues to advertise warnings against “shady solar salespeople.”

Seniors Across America advertised warnings against the “stealth solar tax” to promote FPL’s anti-rooftop solar legislation.

Utility front groups spending thousands fighting against bans on fossil gas

Gas utilities and associated front groups are targeting regions where policies to electrify and prohibit fossil gas in buildings are advancing.

The Affordable Energy Coalition a front group created in March 2021 to attack building electrification policy in the Seattle region spent up to $2500 on an advertisement that ran through May 2022 focused on the Seattle City Council decision to ban fossil gas in new buildings. The front group used another advertisement to suggest vague and dangerous repercussions with no corroboration had the gas ban been in effect during Seattle’s record cold temperatures this past February.

Affordable Energy Coalition’s advertisement stokes unfounded fears on the impacts of building electrification.

Affordable Energy Coalition’s advertising stokes fears that electric heat pumps cannot perform in cold weather. However technological advances to new models of electric heat pumps disprove this concern. For instance a recent study in Maine found that heat pumps perform well in below-freezing weather without fossil-fueled backup. An analysis of the technology’s performance in Minnesota came to the same conclusion.

New Yorkers for Affordable Energy used similar tactics in response to a failed attempt to ban fossil fuels from newly constructed buildings in the near future. The front group is supported by the utilities Dominion National Grid and National Fuel Gas according to LittleSis. The front group focused on a campaign with the false narrative that banning gas appliances would require New Yorkers to spend thousands on retrofitting spending up to $8000 on ads falsely claiming that a gas appliance ban would cost homeowners $30000. However the ban was only for newly constructed buildings and an analysis from the Rocky Mountain Institute found that all-electric homes have lower costs than new mixed-fuel homes with savings on upfront costs and utility bills.

A study published by Stanford University researchers found that even when not running gas appliances release an annual amount of methane equivalent to 500000 cars. Further the nitrogen dioxide emitted from gas stoves inside homes far exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency’s outdoor air quality standards significantly increasing the risk of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease especially in children.

New Yorkers for Affordable Energy makes false claims about the financial impacts of building electrification.

Consumer Energy Alliance made a similar claim concerning costs in support of a bill that almost passed in Virginia that would have prevented municipalities and counties from banning new gas infrastructure and hookups. According to a Rocky Mountain Institute study many residential electrification scenarios for new buildings would reduce the cost for homeowners over the lifetime of the appliances as compared to fossil fuel-burning appliances and cost savings are also possible in retrofitting scenarios. Further with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act the federal government is lowering the energy costs of energy efficient appliances by providing $14000 in direct customer rebates.

Consumer Energy Alliance makes false claims about the financial impact of a gas ban in Virginia.

Advertisements from front groups make false claims concerning the reliability of renewable energy and energy security

Citizens for Energizing Michigan’s Economy (CEME) a 501(c)(4) organization that has received more than $43.5 million from Consumers Energy has spent on advertisements including misinformation about renewable energy and the electric grid. When Michigan legislators introduced a bill in 2021 to lift a cap on utility distributed generation programs CEME ran a misleading ad that falsely claimed “out-of-state special interests” – implying solar companies – caused widespread blackouts on the Texas grid earlier that year. Versions of the advertisement appeared on Facebook feeds in the districts of members of the Michigan House Energy Committee which held hearings on the legislation. Utility companies in Texas – specifically Calpine Vistra and NRG Energy – all have said natural gas shortages affected their ability to operate their power plants. Additionally the Texas Railroad Commission didn’t mandate winterization to prevent oil and gas wells from freezing and failed to ensure that gas producers and pipeline operators sought priority status for power during emergency outages which occurred when the grid operator ordered utilities to perform rotating outages. Coal-fired power plants also failed to operate during the extreme weather event.

Voices for Cooperative Power a front group funded by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association the trade association for electric cooperatives used Facebook ads in an attempt to urge people to call on the Michigan Public Service Commission to “not to allow the premature retirement of power plants unless the utilities demonstrate new operational alternative power plants first.” The ads are likely referring to the J.H. Campbell power plant owned by Consumers Energy. The ads claimed Michigan “can’t afford to go dark” suggesting renewable alternatives could not maintain reliable power or would be too costly. But expert analysis shows that switching to renewables would be the safest and most cost-effective option and modeling by Consumers Energy and environmental groups demonstrated Campbell’s retirement and the plan to purchase the Covert Generating Station accelerating the addition of 8000 megawatts of solar power and 550 MW of battery storage by 2040 with interim targets through this decade improve reliability in the service territory. Testimony filed by Consumers Energy also revealed that electric cooperative Wolverine Power Supply’s competitive business stood to benefit financially if Campbell remained open.

Affordable Energy for New Jersey spent its largest sums on attacks against Governor Phil Murphy’s Energy Master Plan. The 2019 plan outlines a statewide strategy to reach 100 percent clean energy by 2050 which prioritizes the rapid electrification of buildings. In response the front group has deployed a steady onslaught of low-cost frequent advertisements since the beginning of 2022.

The group’s ad topics range from attacks on the viability of electric vehicle batteries to blaming “radical environmentalists shouting down US LNG exports” for Germany’s reliance on coal in the midst of Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The front group also focused on blackouts in June 2022 advertisements in attempts to convey the message that only “base load” can prevent the blackouts. Utilities and groups typically reference coal gas and nuclear as baseload plants. Yet these fuels have no magical reliability properties and are responsible for their own outages. In Colorado during a summer heat wave Xcel Energy averted a crisis by taking control of customer thermostats to relieve demand after the coal plant Comanche 3 “went down quickly.” A year earlier a different Colorado utility Mountain Parks Electric warned customers to conserve energy because wind turbines “iced up” when in fact the causes of the supply crunch were complex and included how the winter conditions also impacted the supply of gas and Wyoming coal plants.

Affordable Energy for New Jersey’s ad touts baseload plants like coal gas and nuclear despite the reliability issues of these plants.

Gas utility front groups promoting RNG hydrogen and “clean” “natural” gas

Partnership for Energy Progress is a 501(c)(4) front group with ties to multiple utilities including Avista Cascade Natural Gas NW Natural and Puget Sound Energy all in the Pacific Northwest. The Guardian reported that the utilities created the group to convince consumers that “natural gas is part of a clean energy future.” The Seattle Times also reported that the group had prepared a $1 million media strategy campaign that would feature paid advertisements focused on “key audiences in Washington and Oregon” mobilize allies in policy debates and create a “positive” message about gas.

The front group has spent over $60000 in 2022 on Facebook and Instagram advertising. Part of the advertisement campaign focused on promoting technologies that gas utilities are bolstering but are false solutions for the purposes of building decarbonization. One of the messages promoted “renewable natural gas” as clean reliable and affordable and capable of being delivered in the existing gas infrastructure and reducing emissions. “Renewable natural gas” or biomethane is non-fossil methane generally captured from agricultural sources or landfills. The other message promoted hydrogen in the same light as renewable natural gas – as a practical solution for gas utilities to reduce emissions. Similar to utilities that have promoted carbon capture and storage even though it remains unworkable to date in the power sector Partnership for Energy Progress advertisements ignore the facts that biomethane and hydrogen while plausibly playing a role in decarbonizing other sectors are not viable alternatives to building electrification. Ample evidence shows both fuel types would lead to higher costs for customers are not available at the necessary scale could be climate intensive due to methane leakage exacerbate air pollution and cause safety risks.

Front groups frequently deployed ads that refer to fossil gas as a “clean” fuel source implying that it is critical to achieving emission reduction targets. The Alliance for Michigan Power used Facebook and Instagram advertisements to encourage that misleading message. The Alliance for Michigan Power is a front group with connections to monopoly utility company DTE Energy which provides both electric and gas service to customers in Michigan.

Alliance for Michigan Power calls on lawmakers to support a mix of power sources to meet net zero carbon emissions – including fossil gas.

Utility front groups involved in advertising for elections

Citizen’s Energizing Michigan’s Economy the front group funded by Consumers Energy ran Facebook ads for eight candidates – seven Republicans and one Democrat – ahead of their August 2022 primary elections. The ads for the Republicans focused heavily on advancing a right-wing agenda promoting “election integrity” gun ownership police “Christian values” and “fight[ing] China.”

In the weeks leading up to Florida’s August 2022 primary elections Seniors Across America spent hundreds of dollars supporting Governor Ron DeSantis who had no Republican primary challenger. DeSantis appointed the Florida Public Service Commissioners who approved Florida Power & Light’s rate hike earlier this year and has passed a host of legislation friendly to FPL and its parent company NextEra. In 2018 DeSantis received $25000 from a dark money non-profit funded by FPL. Despite his veto of the anti-rooftop solar bill written by FPL and supported by Seniors Across America DeSantis has remained silent about FPL’s connection to election scandals criminal trials and ongoing investigations. The ads from Seniors Across America praising DeSantis were followed by a slew of messaging campaigns one warning against “greedy solar companies and their door-to-door salesmen” on which the front group spent up to $30000 and another suggesting the “Top Five Scams” of rooftop solar salespeople which cost up to an additional $30000. These ads ran simultaneously with several ads encouraging primary voting.

Utility front groups also deploy tactics outside of Meta platforms to influence elections. Leading up to Nevada’s 2022 primary election Southwest Gas Corporation – one of the largest gas utilities in the country – gave $10000 its largest contribution at the time to Assemblywoman Lesley Cohen’s Democratic primary opponent Joe Dalia. Residents in Cohen’s district in Clark County also began receiving political mailers smearing Cohen and demanding she return “dirty money” from fossil fuel and energy companies ahead of the primary. The mailers were paid for by the front group Nevadans for Economic Opportunity (NEO) a 501(c)(4) “pro-growth public policy” coalition financially backed by the Retail Association of Nevada (RAN) and the Associated Builders and Contractors of Nevada among others. The address of RAN is also the same one for NEO in the state’s campaign finance disclosure database.

In 2021 Cohen introduced AB380 legislation that would require gas utilities to employ a more rigorous planning process before expanding infrastructure. To combat the legislation Southwest Gas built a coalition of affiliated interest groups. This included the creation of a now-disbanded front group Coalition for Cleaner Affordable Energy. The group sponsored Facebook content to “Stop AB380” and featured RAN’s Senior Vice President Bryan Wachter falsely framing the climate bill as a fossil gas appliance ban.

Appeals to state and federal regulators for greater transparency

Utilities form front groups to intentionally deceive customers and advance their own interests. By utilizing social media for advertising utility front groups rapidly disseminate disinformation without disclosure to viewers about the utilities’ involvement. Meanwhile even if utility involvement is revealed to customers through news sources or watchdog organizations customers are unable to opt out of paying their bills for electricity or gas both necessities of modern life.

The Federal Trade Commission exists to protect consumers from these kinds of deceptive and unfair business practices. Earlier this year 230 groups including the Energy and Policy Institute requested the FTC investigate the utility industry for widespread abuses including political corruption dark-money campaigns and unfair anti-competitive practices including denying customers access to renewable energy.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) could amend the accounting system that all utilities use in rate cases the Uniform System of Accounts to require that utilities record the millions paid in industry association dues as presumptively non-recoverable for rate recovery purposes. This action would at the very least force utilities to justify efforts to recover payments to trade associations engaged in political activities and would reduce costs for wholesale transmission customers who would no longer be required to pay those expenses. FERC can also require more granular disclosure of expenses made by utilities through their annual filings specifically in the accounts where utilities routinely place political expenses. This additional reporting requirement would help discourage utilities from booking the consulting costs of creating a front group and charging it to customers as Southern California Gas Company did several years ago when it formed the front group Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions to advance the utility’s pro-gas position in a California Public Utilities Commission proceeding.

Members of Congress can also include the utility industry in their investigations of the fossil fuel industry. The same questions and requests for documents sent to oil companies from the House Committee on Oversight and Reform could be sent to many in the utility industry as part of an ongoing investigation on climate disinformation. The House investigation included a request for companies to provide documents and communications related to involvement in supporting disinformation and misleading the public to prevent climate action.

State regulators are also capable of intervening on behalf of utility customers. Commissioner Sandra D. Kennedy of the Arizona Corporation Commission demanded that Arizona’s utilities provide comprehensive lists of political contributions lobbying expenses advertising and marketing expenses “Corporate Giving” and a list of compensations for employees and consultants engaged in those activities. In the filing Kennedy indicated that some utilities have “veered off the path of their core mission and instead have focused on solidifying their positions of power” and said that “the level of transparency called for in this letter is essential to maintaining the public’s trust.”",,,,,,,,,

Excitement from some disbelief from others and outright scorn from many. In building a GPU that promises to outperform the best graphics cards Nvidia has gone big — big and expensive. AMD on the other hand is using a more cost-effective technology that could make its upcoming RDNA cards more appealing more affordable choice.



While we're not privy to Nvidia's Bill of Materials (BOM) the high price of Nvidia's GPUs is largely due to the company's refusal to embrace ""Moore's Law 2.0"" and look to things like chiplets. AMD started beating Intel on CPUs when it switched to chiplets especially on cost and now they're about to do the same for GPUs. Putting the analog memory interfaces on an older process with RDNA 3 is a brilliant approach since analog scales very poorly with newer process nodes. The same goes for cache.

Looking at the AD102 die shots Nvidia has posted so far we know the die size is 608mm^2. That's only slightly smaller than GA102 at 628mm^2 but now Nvidia is on a cutting edge TSMC 4N process node instead of Samsung 8N. Pricing on the wafers definitely shot up and we had multiple stories in the past year about TSMC raising prices. That's all coming to bear.



The AD102 die pictured below — which is a rendering but it's the best we've got — shows some clear details of how and why Nvidia's latest tour de force costs more than the previous generation chips. Flip through the gallery for annotated versions of the image.

The twelve Graphics Processing Clusters (GPCs) are easily distinguishable from the rest of the chip and each of those has 12 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs). All of the GPCs and SMs together take up about 45% of the total die area. Where does the rest go?



The twelve 32-bit GDDR6X memory controllers use up most of the outside edge of the die with the PCIe x16 connector using about a third of the bottom edge. The memory controllers and related circuitry take up a hefty 17% of the die area give or take. But that's not the only part of the memory subsystem as Nvidia has a much larger L2 cache than on previous designs.



You can see the six 16MB chunks of L3 in the center section of the die with some related routing and other circuitry (ROPs?) around it. The L2 cache blocks are at least 15% of the total die area while the entire center portion of the die (L2 plus other logic) takes up 25% of the total. The remainder of the die at the bottom is dedicated to things like the dual NVENC encoders the PCIe interface and physical display interfaces. It's about 7% of the total and then there are a few other miscellaneous bits scattered around that take up the last ~6% of the die.

The point of discussing those die areas is to help put things in perspective. Nvidia with its monolithic approach on the AD102 chip has dedicated roughly 33% of the total die area just to memory interfaces and L2 cache. AMD's MCD (Memory Chiplet Die) approach used with its Radeon RX 7000-series and RDNA 3 GPUs will apparently move nearly all of that off the main chiplet and it will reportedly use TSMC N6 instead of TSMC N5 reducing price and improving yields at the same time.



TSMC doesn't reveal its contract negotiations with large partners like Apple AMD Intel or Nvidia. However there are reports that TSMC N5 (and thus 4N which is more or less just ""refined"" N5) costs at least twice as much as TSMC N7/N6. With a 608mm^2 die size for AD102 Nvidia can only get around 90 full dies per wafer — and for reference that's only about two more chips per wafer than GA102.



If TSMC 4N costs more than twice as much per wafer as Samsung 8N that means AD102 costs more than twice as much per chip as the previous generation GA102 and the RTX 3090. Gordon Mah Ung of PC World asked Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during a Q&A session about pricing. I'll go ahead and quote it directly to put things in context.



Gordon: [RTX] 4000 is finally here which for you I'm sure feels like a huge launch. The reaction universally I'm seeing out there is ""Oh my God. It costs so much money."" Is there anything you would like to say to the community regarding pricing on the new generational parts? As well as can they expect to see better pricing at some point and basically address all the loud screams that I'm seeing everywhere?""



Jensen: ""First of all a 12 inch wafer is a lot more expensive today than it was yesterday. And it's not a little bit more expensive it is a ton more expensive. Moore's law is dead. And the ability for Moore's law to deliver the same performance half the cost every year and a half is over. It's completely over. And so the idea that the chip is going to go down in cost over time unfortunately is a story of the past."" (Emphasis added.)



Of course there's a lot more to building a graphics card than just the GPU. Memory PCB VRMs PMICs capacitors and all sorts of other bits are involved. Prices on many of those have increased over the past two years as well. Nvidia also has to put a lot of effort into the research and development of GPUs and related technologies. And the final design has to take all of that into account and then ultimately turn into a successful product.



So how much does a new part need to cost in order to make for a profitable product? That's more difficult to say.

One more interesting thing about the RTX 40-series announcement is that Nvidia has revealed three different graphics card models and each one uses a different GPU. Again that sort of approach has to increase costs and it means Nvidia also needs to figure out how to best allocate its wafer orders. The AD102 chip in the RTX 4090 is the new halo part with a large die and all the trimmings. AD103 cuts down the memory interface and the core counts and then AD104 cuts them down even further.



Nvidia hasn't released die shots or renderings of AD103 and AD104 just yet but we do have the full specs. They're quite a bit smaller and much of that comes from reducing core counts memory interfaces and L2 cache size. The 4080 models will naturally be higher volume products than the 4090 though it's worth pointing out that the 4090 potentially has 70% more compute 50% more memory bandwidth and capacity and uses 41% more power all while ""only"" costing 33% more. In other words RTX 4080 16GB pricing is proportionately worse than the RTX 4090.



We can do the same for the RTX 4080 12GB. The 4080 16GB offers 21% more compute 33% more memory capacity 42% more memory bandwidth but only uses 12% more power. It also costs 33% more. Both of the RTX 4080 models look overpriced and underpowered compared to what we've seen in previous Nvidia architectures where the halo cards cost substantially more while only moderately increasing performance.

When RTX 30-series launched Nvidia started with the RTX 3090 and 3080. Both used the GA102 chip just with fewer cores enabled on the 3080. Next came the RTX 3070 and 3060 Ti both of which used the GA104 chip. Eventually Nvidia would add GA106 to the family used in the RTX 3060 and 3050 — and there was GA107 for the mobile RTX 3050 Ti and 3050 but that never came to desktops. Ultimately just looking at the desktop cards Nvidia had three different GPUs that powered ten different graphics cards. Now Nvidia has announced three cards using three GPUs and it has to figure out how to balance the number of each chip.



I can't help but wonder what the full RTX 40-series product stack will look like by the end of 2023. Word is that there are still two more Ada GPUs in development (AD106 and AD107). At some point Nvidia will start getting more binned chips that can function as something other than the three announced SKUs and then we'll likely start seeing more graphics card models.



AMD in contrast appears set to announce perhaps a single core GPU on November 3 which will use chiplets. Current information says the GCD (GPU Chiplet Die) will measure just 308mm^2 about half the size of AD102 and it will link up with up to six MCDs (Memory Chiplet Dies) that are all relatively small (38mm^2). That's about the same size as AD104 (294.5mm^2) and if rumors are correct AMD's Navi 31 will be packing up to 12288 GPU shader cores — 60% more than Nvidia's RTX 4080 12GB in roughly the same size chip.



AMD could launch RX 7900 XT RX 7800 XT and maybe even RX 7800 using the same GCD only with different numbers of GPU cores enabled and with 6 5 or 4 MCDs. Yields would be significantly better than AD102 and costs would also be much lower. AMD might even be able to compete with AD104 on pricing while delivering significantly higher performance at least in games that don't leverage DLSS 3 and/or extreme ray tracing effects. Advantage: AMD.

There's also the question of why the RTX 4080 12GB isn't just called the RTX 4070. Talking with Nvidia during a briefing this exact question came up: What was the thought process behind calling the 12GB chip a 4080 instead of a 4070 especially since it's a different chip?



Nvidia's Justin Walker Senior Director of Product Management said ""The 4080 12GB is a really high performance GPU. It delivers performance considerably faster than a 3080 12GB... it's faster than a 3090 Ti and we really think it's deserving of an 80-class product.""



Frankly that's a crap answer. Of course it's faster! It's a new chip and a new architecture; it's supposed to be faster. Remember when the GTX 1070 came out and it was faster than a 980 Ti? I guess that wasn't ""deserving"" of an 80-class product name. Neither was the RTX 2070 when it matched the 1080 Ti or the 3070 when it matched the 2080 Ti.



But then we get the performance comparisons where Nvidia says the 4080 12GB will be ""up to 3x faster than the 3080 12GB."" And that's where you have to start to wonder because obviously that's with DLSS 3 in heavy ray tracing games. What will happen when you're not playing games that meet those criteria?

Based on Nvidia's benchmarks it's going to be a mixed bag. The first three games in the above chart on the left don't use DLSS or DLSS 3. The RTX 4080 12GB is often tied with or slightly slower than an RTX 3090 Ti when DLSS 3 and ray tracing aren't part of the equation. How often will that be the case on future games is far more difficult to predict.



In a lot of ways the RTX 40-series launch so far feels very reminiscent of the RTX 20-series launch. Nvidia is once again hyping up ray tracing and DLSS only we're now in round three of that story. The RT hardware is far more capable DLSS 3 is supposed to be a lot better as well but will all the big games support both technologies to sufficient levels? Undoubtedly the answer is no; some will some won't.



Meanwhile generational pricing has increased (again) and the specs on some of the models certainly look questionable. RTX 4080 12GB feels far too much like it really should have been the RTX 4070 right now and Nvidia could have started tacking on Ti and Super or whatever to create other models.



The RTX 3080 10GB will apparently still linger on with a $699 MSRP for the time being. That certainly can't last not when an eventual RTX 4070 will inevitably displace it on performance and features. But Nvidia and its partners need the unwitting to buy up the existing inventory of RTX 30-series cards for the highest prices they can still get before they're ready to move down the stack to the rest of the Ada Lovelace lineup.

We're still waiting for full details on AMD's RDNA 3 lineup as well and as discussed above the design decisions AMD made — specifically with GPU chiplets — should result in lower prices that Nvidia can't possibly match. AMD may not take the outright performance crown but if it can come close while undercutting Nvidia's prices it might not matter. Add to that Intel's Arc A770 and A750 which could launch in the near future as well. We'll see who emerges as the victor in the GPU market in the next couple of months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9udmlkaWEtY29uZmlybXMtYWRhLTEwMi0xMDMtMTA0LWdwdS1zcGVjcy1hZDEwNC1oYXMtbW9yZS10cmFuc2lzdG9ycy10aGFuLWdhMTAy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA confirms Ada 102/103/104 GPU specs AD104 has more transistors than GA102,"NVIDIA Ada GPUs have significantly higher ROP count

NVIDIA is clarifying the specs for RTX 40 series.

The company released full info on the die sizes and transistor counts on AD102 AD103 and AD104 GPUs. All three are to launch in the following weeks. NVIDIA already provided important figures for AD102 GPU the flagship processor intended for RTX 4090 graphics card but the details on AD104 and AD103 were still missing. Ryan Smith from AnandTech reports on the exact figures:

AD102 : 608 mm² die 76.3B transistors

: 608 mm² die 76.3B transistors AD103 : 378.6 mm² die 45.9B transistors

: 378.6 mm² die 45.9B transistors AD104: 294.5 mm² die 35.8B transistors

What this means is that all three xtor density higher than 121M per square mm (it is actually identical for AD103 and AD104). Furthermore AD104 with 35.8B transistors means it has 7.5B transistors more than Ampere GA102 GPU flagship (28.3B). To put that into perspective GA102 is more than twice as large as AD104.

NVIDIA Ada GPUs VideoCardz.com AD102 AD103 AD104 Architecture Ada Lovelace Ada Lovelace Ada Lovelace Process Node TSMC 4N (5nm) TSMC 4N (5nm) TSMC 4N (5nm) Transistors 76.3B 45.9B 35.8B Die Size 608 mm² 378.6 mm² 294.5 mm² Transistor Density 125.5M 121.1M 121.1M Streaming Multiprocessors 144 80 60 CUDA Cores 18432 10240 7680 Tensor Cores 576 320 240 RT Cores 144 80 60 ROPs 192 112 80 L2 Cache 96MB 64MB 48MB SKU RTX 4090 RTX 4080 16GB RTX 4080 12GB

NVIDIA Ada GPUs have a much higher count of Render Output Unit (ROP) than the predecessor going up to 192 ROPs for AD102. The AD103 GPU has just as many ROPs as GA102 (112) while AD104 had 80. Higher ROP count should improve rasterization performance.

NVIDIA has introduced some changes to the architecture such as removal of NVLink as explained to make room for other logical blocks. But at the same time the L2 cache has significantly increased. NVIDIA has now confirmed the exact size for each SKU: AD102 96MB AD103 64MB and AD104 48MB. It is confirmed that both RTX 4080 models have fully unlocked L2 cache on respective GPUs so 4080 16GB has 64MB while 4080 12GB comes with 48MB.

Furthermore HKEPC reports that NVIDIA also clarified what TSMC 4N really means which is not to be confused with N4. This process is a die shrink of TSMC 5N process but it is still a 5nm architecture. The only problem with this ‘clarification’ is that NVIDIA themselves provide wrong information on 4nm process as shown below (slide from this week’s Editors Day).

NORFOLK Va. – Old Dominion won its first Sun Belt Conference football game Saturday night in memorable fashion.



The Monarch defense forced two second-half turnovers that led to touchdowns and ODU twice rallied from second-half deficits to claim a 29-26 victory over Arkansas State before a boisterous crowd of 20655 at S.B. Ballard Stadium.



It wasn't an artful game – ODU's offense was shut out in the first half – but in clutch situations when the Monarchs needed big plays players on both sides of the ball made them.



""This was obviously a great win"" said Ricky Rahne ODU's Thurmond Family Head Coach. ""I thought we did some great things in the second half.



""The defense played well throughout and made some plays obviously there at the end to give us a chance to win it.



""But I thought the offense in the second half made the plays they needed to win the game.""



Defensive end Deeve Harris a transfer from Minnesota returned an interception 16 yards for a touchdown late in the third quarter that briefly gave ODU a 21-19 lead.



Then late in the fourth with Arkansas State leading 26-21 safety Terry Jones forced a fumble recovered by defensive tackle Tyre Bibby that led to the game-winner.



The fumble recovery gave ODU a first down at the 29. On fourth down and 3 at the 23 ODU quarterback Hayden Wolff threw a pass intended for Javon Harvey who was pulled down by Arkansas State defensive back Kenneth Harris. That drew a flag for pass interference.



That gave ODU a first down at the seven. Wolff then passed to tight end Zack Kuntz for the touchdown.







ODU went for two and Obie Sanni the 5-foot-9 196-pound redshirt freshman from Aurora Colorado broke a tackle to give the Monarchs a 29-26 lead with 6:33 left.



ODU then needed two stops from its defense and got them.



On fourth down and two at the Arkansas State 40 a pass from quarterback James Blackman fell incomplete.



Arkansas State regained possession in the final minute at its own two after a 38-yard punt by Ethan Duane but could not move the ball. On the game's final play a desperation pass led to two laterals and then a fumble.



ODU (2-2 overall 1-0 Sun Belt) mustered just 126 offensive yards in a first half in which the Monarchs only came close to scoring once when freshman Ethan Sanchez missed a 48-yard field goal.



But the Monarch offense emerged from that nightmarish start with its batteries recharged.



ODU began the second half by driving 78 yards in five plays as Kuntz (34 yards) and Ali Jennings III (33) each hauled in long passes. Jennings' catch was originally ruled a touchdown but after review the ball was placed at the one.



Keshawn Wicks the redshirt freshman from Moncks Corner South Carolina scored on the next play.







Arkansas State retaliated quickly with Blackman finding wide receiver Jeff Foreman on a 49-yard touchdown pass which gave the Red Wolves a 19-7 lead.



ODU again quickly responded with Wolff finding Jennings with a 77-yard touchdown pass the longest play of the season.



ODU's defense which has forced a ton of turnovers this season then forced the first of two. With defensive end Marcus Haynes hanging onto him Blackman threw a pass intercepted by Harris who returned it 16 yards for a touchdown.



It was the second interception of his career and third career TD. A Sanchez PAT gave ODU a 21-19 lead.



The lead was short-lived as the Red Wolves drove 60 yards with AJ Mayer scoring from 23 yards to with 12:10 left.



ODU's defense then stepped up again forcing a fumble that led to the game-winner.



Linebacker Jason Henderson broke a school record with 21 tackles and linebacker Ryan Henry added 12. The Monarchs had seven sacks each by a different player.



Arkansas State had 22 first downs to ODU's 12 and 397 offensive yards to ODU's 330. But ODU forced two turnovers and had none and that proved to be critical. Wolff completed 19-of-32 passes for 279 yards and two touchdowns.







Rahne said he can't really explain why the Monarchs were shut out in the first half and scored 29 points in the second half.



""Yeah everyone asked me that"" he said. ""If I knew that we wouldn't have a tale of two halves.



""I just told the guys that we have to have more belief. And I felt like I needed to have more passion in the second half.



""They need to see me excited and they need to see me yelling and stuff. So maybe I have to do that more in practice too.""



Rahne smiled when asked about the significance of his team winning the first Sun Belt football game.



""You work just as hard for every single win so they're all big"" he said. ""You want to start off the season on the right note. You want to start off conference play on the right note.



""That was a good football team we played tonight. They're probably better than their record last year (2-10) indicated and even better than their record this year (1-3 0-1). This was a good victory.



""Obviously we didn't play our best football in the first half. And I don't think we played our best football in the second half.



""But we did a lot of things that gave us a chance to win the game.""



NOTES: Running back Keshawn Wicks and safety Tahj Ra-El made their first career starts … Wicks scored the first touchdown of his career in the third quarter … Wolff's 77-yard TD pass to Jennings in the third quarter was the fifth longest pass play in ODU history and longest since David Washington hit Jonathan Duhart for an 83-yard gain at UTEP in 2016 … The 140-yard receiving game was the sixth time Jennings has been over 100 yards … Linebacker Jason Henderson registered his fourth-straight double-digit tackle game to begin the year … Henderson's 21 tackles breaks the school record of 18 held by Henderson earlier this season and TJ Ricks who had 18 in 2015 against Charlotte … The 21 tackles is the sixth most in Sun Belt Conference history and the most by an FBS player so far this season … Deeve Harris' three touchdowns are the most by an ODU defensive player in program history as well as the two interception returns for a touchdowns … The seven sacks is tied for the second most in a single game. It tied the seven ODU recorded against Albany in 2017 … Ryan Henry recorded a season-high and tied his career-high with 12 tackles … ODU won its FBS conference opener for the second time. ODU beat Rice in 2014 in the Conference USA opener.

""From the Earth to Mars in a Rocket of Languages"" an event at Old Dominion University's Michael and Kimthanh Lê Planetarium at 5 p.m. Sept. 30 will showcase how people across cultures interpret the red planet.

Close to 20 local and international poets - from Cameroon Quebec France Spain India Italy and more - will read their poems about Mars in their native languages.

Local poets - including several ODU faculty members - will read at the Planetarium and international poets will be Zoomed in to read their works among the constellations of the Planetarium walls. Translations of their poems will be displayed as they read.

Open to the public the free event is organized by Peter Schulman Eminent Scholar and professor of world languages and cultures at ODU and Justin Mason director of the Planetarium.

""I hope to show how our planet can be connected through languages rather than divided by them"" Schulman said. ""By having poets from around the world read their poems about Mars in their respective languages and merge with our local ones here in Norfolk we can show how linked we can be as we look toward far-off planets like Mars ... and how not so far off it may seem within the dreamy confines of the stars and planets at the Planetarium.""

The event is a precursor to ""Mars Fest"" the second public arts festival from Oct. 14 to 16 at ODU where a large-scale sculpture of the planet created by UK-based artist Luke Jerram will be displayed on 43rd Street outside the Barry Art Museum.

Here is a full lineup of the poets set to speak at the Planetarium:

Foxconn is back; Intel too?,"Will India get its wafer fabs this time around? Foxconn is back; Intel too?

I can’t help but get a sense of deja vu whenever we talk about semiconductor manufacturing in India. At the outset geopolitics impacting global supply chains (such as a likely hostile takeover of semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse Taiwan by China) suggests that a country like India must reduce its heavy reliance on imports of electronic components by setting up local semiconductor plants.

Semiconductors are the world’s fourth-most-traded product after crude oil refined oil and cars. About 50% of $134 billion of total electronics products demand is imported according to an April 2020 joint report by the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA) and Frost & Sullivan. By 2025 the total product demand is expected to touch $368 billion the report adds.

However imports could be reduced to 29% saving $76 billion of foreign exchange while simultaneously creating thousands of jobs if India manages to fulfil its dream of setting up wafer fabs.

That said the country’s history with this sector does call for a healthy dose of scepticism even as I believe that this time India may get its act right if state politics does not prevail over economic sense.

THE STORY SO FAR

Few know that India’s tryst with semiconductors started in the 1960s when Fairchild Semiconductor considered building a fab here but bureaucratic hurdles forced them to move it to Malaysia. India’s semiconductor ambition however truly took shape when Semiconductor Complex Ltd started the country’s first fab in the early 1980s. The state-run company began with a 5000 nanometre (nm) process in 1984 and quickly advanced to the 800 nm technology which at that time was near the cutting edge. Unfortunately the entire complex was gutted in a mysterious fire in 1989 a setback that India never quite recovered from.

However India continued to dream of placing itself on the world map of semiconductor (wafer fab) manufacturing to reduce electronic imports and keep pace with countries such as Taiwan China South Korea Japan Singapore and the US without much success.

India again flirted with the idea of creating wafer fabs in 2007. At that time there were talks of major chip makers including AMD and Intel considering the possibility of putting India on the global semiconductor map but both denied such moves. Intel on its part announced plans to set up plants in China and Vietnam that very year. In 2008 media reports claimed that Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries was looking to set up an over $5 billion photovoltaic (PV) cell manufacturing facility in Jamnagar but the company never confirmed the plan.

In 2011 the Centre constituted an empowered committee to identify technology and investors and recommend incentives to be provided to set up two fab facilities in the country. The committee had issued a global expression of interest (EoI) inviting technology providers and investors to set up the fabs following which this committee submitted its recommendations to the government in March 2013.

Five months later on 13 September 2013 the Cabinet gave in-principle approval to a proposal for setting up two wafer fabs that were expected to provide direct employment to about 22000 people and indirect employment to about 100000. Apart from Hindustan Semiconductors Ltd Jaiprakash Associates along with International Business Machines Corp. and TowerJazz had proposed to set up a Rs26300 crore fab in Greater Noida. Hindustan Semiconductors’ consortium included French-Italian electronics and semiconductor manufacturer STMicroelectronics and Malaysia-based wafer manufacturer SilTerra Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. The consortium had proposed to invest Rs25250 crore in setting up a fab facility in Prantij near Gandhinagar. In March 2007 too Verma said Hindustan Semiconductors would set up 10 chip manufacturing plants costing up to $4.5 billion by 2010. However nothing saw the light of day -- while Jaiprakash Associates withdrew from the race in 2013 itself HSMC’s consortium did not put the money on the table.

Source: BCG-SIA April 2021 report

In February 2015 the government reconstituted an empowered committee to reinvigorate India’s push to build semiconductor fabrication plants. Hence there was excitement when in August 2015 Terry Gou founder and chairman of the world’s largest contract manufacturer Foxconn announced the company’s intention to set up 10-12 factories in India over the next 10 years for electronics manufacturing including a $5 billion investment (scaled up for an initial $2 billion investment figure) in Maharashtra. Hon Hai Technology Group also known as Foxconn internationally is a Taiwanese multinational electronics manufacturer ranked 22nd in the 2021 Fortune Global 500.

I had interviewed Gou back then and he was certainly bullish about his plans. The land for this purpose was allocated in Navi Mumbai. However in January 2020 the deal was scrapped due to various factors including land acquisition issues.

Incidentally in January 2015 SunEdison Inc and the Adani Group too had signed an agreement to establish a joint venture to build a solar photovoltaic (PV) factory in India with an investment of up to $4 billion. The deal however did not materialize.

NEVER SAY DIE: KEEP CHIPPING AWAY

India did not give up. In December 2021 the government approved a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for semiconductor and display board production to attract an investment of Rs 76000 crore in semiconductor production over the next 5-6 years. With the promise of serious money on the table companies have once again resurrected their plans.

This May Israel-based ISMC Analog Fab Private Ltd said it would invest ₹22900 crore in Karnataka to set up a chip-making plant. The International Semiconductor Consortium (ISMC) is a joint venture between Abu Dhabi-based Next Orbit Ventures and Israel’s Tower Semiconductor. And Singapore firm IGSS Ventures said it would invest $3.2 billion in Tamil Nadu to set up a high-tech semiconductor park in the state.

INTEL INSIDE TOO?

You may recall that while American chip giant Intel has always shied away from setting up a wafer fab in India it announced the acquisition of Tower Semiconductor for $5.4 billion in February. So Intel will after all be involved if this ISMC joint venture gets the Indian government sanction.

Source: Intel (The company has 15 wafer fabs in 10 locations around the world)

MAHARASHTRA OUTSIDE

While Foxconn is back in action Maharashtra unfortunately is not. This time around the state has lost the Foxconn-Vedanta semiconductor plant deal to Gujarat over land issues. The result: Foxconn and Vedanta will be setting up a semiconductor fab unit a display fab unit and a semiconductor assembling and testing unit on a 1000-acre land in Gujarat’s capital Ahmedabad. With an investment of ₹1.54 trillion the production will begin two years from now. Vedanta had sought 1000 acres (405 hectares) of land free of cost on a 99-year lease and water and power at concessionary and fixed prices for 20 years in April.

Of course Vedanta Resources Ltd chairman Anil Agarwal said his company is also considering a second chip and display manufacturing facility in India asserting that India would need at least two such factories to become a hub of chip manufacturing and meet the needs of the country and the world. The three proposals for wafer fabs that are worth $13.6 billion have sought government support to the tune of $5.6 billion.

WHAT THEY PLAN TO MAKE

Vedanta Displays is expected to set up a display FAB unit at an investment of ₹94500 crore while Vedanta Semiconductors plans to set up an integrated semiconductor manufacturing unit and OSAT facility for ₹60000 crore. Foxconn will be the technical partner. OSAT is short for Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test and as the name suggests is a third-party service comprising semiconductor assembly packaging and testing of Integrated Circuits (ICs) by global suppliers.

“The proposed semiconductor manufacturing fab unit will operate on the 28nm technology nodes with wafer size 300 mm; and the display manufacturing unit will produce Generation 8 displays catering to small medium and large applications” the companies said in a joint statement on 13 September. The company aims to be the raw material supplier to the entire chain of industries such as electric vehicles automobiles cellphones laptops etc. and will thus promote electronics manufacturing in the country.

Semiconductor chips as we know are ubiquitous in our computers smartphones sensors cameras mobile communication devices cars aircraft medical equipment defence system and entertainment gadgets to name a few. Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications too require new semiconductor architectures with faster data movement between processor and memory. Other areas like cloud computing machine learning connected cars/automotive 5G and the internet of things (IoT) too will continue to drive the need for a new breed of chips.

In addition numerous large-scale IT hardware electronics manufacturing and electronic component companies are part of the Indian government’s PLI scheme that is aimed at enhancing the electronics ecosystem.

As we saw history has not been kind to India’s semiconductor plans. The Indian government for instance has found it hard to get chip makers to invest mainly because of India’s deficient infrastructure and land laws. For instance some experts say manufacturing even a single chip requires hundreds of gallons of pure water--not very easy to find in India in the required quantities. A reliable power supply is another major hurdle.

Further fabrication “typically requires as many as 300 different inputs including raw wafers commodity chemicals speciality chemicals and bulk gases” according to an April 2021 joint report by Boston Consulting Global (BCG) and the Semiconductor Industry Association. Moreover there are 400 to 1400 steps in the overall manufacturing process semiconductor wafers depending on the specific product.

India to be fair excels in chip design with hundreds of designers including subsidiaries of world-class chip makers. Nearly 3000 chips are designed annually employing 30000 engineers. As a result India has a thriving design market (fabless ecosystem) contributing $33.1 billion in value addition according to IESA. But countries such as China and Taiwan score when it comes to integrated device manufacturing: they perform every step of the chip-making process including design manufacturing testing and packaging.

Chip fabrication units are also highly capital-intensive and typically require huge investments which the government recognizes. Vedanta Foxconn JV IGSS Ventures and ISMC have proposed to set up “28 nanometres (nm) to 65 nm fabs with a capacity of approximately 120000 wafers per month”.

But the cost of building wafer fabs is prohibitive. The cost of building and equipping 5 nm production lines is about $5.4 billion according to IESA. It takes 12-24 months to create the fab shell and another 12-18 months to ramp up to full capacity. Even with govt subsidy and 55% capacity utilization it shall take a minimum of 10 years for such a fab to break even by which the tech may have become obsolete. This is why the semiconductor fab firms must continually invest to future-proof their technologies.

In its 2021 policy the government offered to defray costs in the following manner:

-- 28nm or Lower - Up to 50% of the Project Cost

-- Above 28 nm to 45nm - Up to 40% of the Project Cost

-- Above 45 nm to 65nm - Up to 30% of the Project Cost

This would have put semiconductor fab makers at a disadvantage in India since they’re developing 28 nm to 65 nm chips that would have given them a 30-40% subsidy. However on 21 September the Cabinet approved uniform fiscal support of 50% of project cost for all technology nodes which is a shot in the arm of the industry.

BUT WHY IS INDIA FINE WITH 28-65 nm FABs?

Semiconductors according to BCG-SIA can be classified into three broad categories -- Logic (42% of industry revenues) Discrete Analog Other (32% of industry revenues) and Memory (26% of industry revenues). Some experts divide the categories into ‘Logic’ ‘Analog’ and ‘Micro’. But the broad idea remains similar. Logic is an integrated circuit (ICs) that can be likened to the “brains” of computing. They include microprocessors microcontrollers and products such as cellular modems WiFi or Bluetooth chips etc. to connect to a wireless or wired network to transmit or receive data. Discrete products include diodes and transistors. Analog products include voltage regulators and data converters that translate analog signals from sources such as voice into digital signals.

It’s important to understand that about 65% of global semiconductor revenues are from general-purpose components that are used across multiple applications. Mobile phones for instance use discrete and analog products to enable features such as cellular connectivity camera and power consumption management. But they also use logic which includes microprocessors and memory chips for storage of digital content on devices. In 2019 alone 290 million mobile handsets worth $30 billion were produced in India according to the IESA-EY report.

Chips found in today’s smartphones computers gaming consoles and data centre servers are manufactured on 5-10 nanometer nodes (a term that refers to the size in nanometers of the transistor gates in the electronic circuits). Commercial chip manufacturing using 3 nm process technology is expected to begin around 2023. Wafer manufacturing notes the BCG-SIA report still takes place across a wide range of nodes from the current “leading node” at 5 nm used for advanced logic to the legacy nodes above 180 nanometers used for discrete optoelectronics sensors and analog semiconductors. In fact the report points out that “only 2% of the global capacity is currently on nodes below 10 nanometers”. A state-of-the-art semiconductor fab of standard capacity requires roughly $5 billion (for advanced analog fabs) to $20 billion (for advanced logic and memory fabs) of capital expenditure including land building and equipment.

It’s sensible that India is dabbling in the 28-65 nm range for wafer fabs since the upfront investments will be lower than that for logic and memory fabs even as the shelf-life of these nodes is much longer. This strategy may help India finally get its act right.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlZGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWVyb3NwYWNlLWRlZmVuc2UvbmV3c1ZpZXcva2VkMjAyMjA5MjMwMDE40gExaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAua2VkZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzQW1wL2tlZDIwMjIwOTIzMDAxOA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ETRI bolsters semiconductor technologies for use in aerospace defense,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlZGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWVyb3NwYWNlLWRlZmVuc2UvbmV3c1ZpZXcva2VkMjAyMjA5MjMwMDE40gExaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAua2VkZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzQW1wL2tlZDIwMjIwOTIzMDAxOA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674219B520>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Photo: Toyota USA-Kenworth

That's what the joint collaboration between Kenworth Trucks and Toyota USA is trying to prove ostensibly with more success than what fuel cell detractors are likely to admit. With their combined efforts Toyota supplied the fuel-cell electric drivetrain and Kenworth supplied their instantly recognizable T680 semi-truck rolling chassis for the new engine to sit comfortably inside. It's all under in the name of completing Toyota-Kenworth's Zero- and Near-Zero Emissions Freight Facilities (ZANZEFF) initiative to bring environmentally sustainable long-haul trucks to American roads.Under normal circumstances this truck would sport a 12.9-liter PACCAR MX-13 straight-six engine jetting in the neighborhood of 450 horsepower and between 1500 and 1850 lb-ft (2033.7-2508.2 N-m) of torque alongside a 12-speed semi-automatic gearbox. The new T680E ditches all of that in favor of electric motors powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Dubbed ""Project Ocean"" this new drivetrain reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 74.66 metric tons annually per truck. Multiply that by every big rig in America and you can almost see a thick film of smog over the Continental U.S. begin dissipating.Kenworth-Toyota claims this Hydrogen-truck can crank 670 peak horsepower and an eye-watering 1623 lb-ft (2205.9) of torque. Moreover it can haul a load of 82000 lbs (37194.5 kg) for a distance between 400 to 500 miles (643.7 to 804.6-km) with a single load of fuel. Needless to say this has the potential to revolutionize American intermodal freight trucking. Doing so in a way not seen since the Scottish immigrant to Cleveland Ohio turned Bicycle maker Alexander Winton invented the first semi-truck in the late 19th century.If this is indeed the case it all starts with trial runs hauling freight for the Port of Los Angeles  the busiest cargo seaport in North America and one of the largest in the world. ""Collaborating with original equipment manufacturers like Toyota and Kenworth on this demonstration project is an important step toward bringing next-generation technologies to market"" said Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka. ""We're grateful to CARB for its generous grant to support this effort and look forward to additional zero-emission vehicles operating at the Port of Los Angeles.""Meanwhile the Shell Oil Company's American subsidiary is playing a vital role in the ZANZEFF project in its own right. Supplying a steady stream of cryogenically-chilled hydrogen for Toyota-Kenworth's fleet of Port of LA EV trucks. ""Shell anticipates a great use-case for hydrogen in Commercial Road Transport here in California and the success of the ZANZEFF project has been an important step in achieving commercialization"" said Wayne Leighty Shell Hydrogen Mobility Commercial Head North America.""Collaborations across both the private and public sectors is key to advancing zero-emissions heavy-duty mobility and we are grateful to CARB Port of Los Angeles and ZANZEFF members for their support."" If successful full-scale production of the fuel-cell powertrains designed for Kenworth trucks will begin at the Toyota Motor Manufacturing facility in Kentucky beginning next year. In the meantime Port of LA truckers will put these rigs through their paces the same as they would a tried and true Cummins diesel.Unlike said Cummins these trucks produce zero greenhouse gasses while giving a performance that at least on paper matches that of diesel engines to a stunning degree.

Palo Alto Networks (PANW 0.61%) recently completed its three-for-one stock split. Tech stock splits have been hot in 2022 even amid a vicious bear market. Companies with high stock prices might be announcing these splits to try and attract investor attention and attract investors who are not as willing to spend large amounts of capital per share.

As for Palo Alto Networks it hasn't needed much help. Even before the stock split was announced shares of the leading cybersecurity company were already handily beating the S&P 500. But here's the real reason for the stock split -- and the real reason this company is worthy of your attention.

The real reason for this stock split

Companies often split their stock to attract investor attention. In fact Palo Alto Networks isn't the only cybersecurity company to split this year. Fellow security leader Fortinet (FTNT 0.09%) completed a stock split just a couple months prior. There are some additional benefits to stock splits like increasing access to retail investors with a lower share price although that benefit is dissipating today. Many online stock brokers allow for fractional share purchases eliminating the need for a company to lower its price per share. Nevertheless a split announcement tends to generate lots of positive media buzz.

Why else split a stock? A lower stock price can often help a company better manage the stock-based compensation it pays to employees. Stock-based compensation is common in the tech world as it helps a company attract and retain talent. It has become deeply ingrained in the tech start-up and business culture of Silicon Valley. But stock-based comp is also often a hang-up for many investors. A company with out-of-control stock-based comp has an increasing pool of shares outstanding which dilutes the value of ownership for existing shareholders that aren't employees.

Palo Alto Networks falls into this camp. During its recently completed 2022 fiscal year (the 12 months ended in July 2022) stock-based comp totaled $1.07 billion. That totaled over 19% of fiscal 2022 revenue or about 2.1% of the company's market cap at the conclusion of the fiscal year. During the first few years of his tenure CEO Nikesh Arora oversaw nearly a dozen acquisitions of small cybersecurity peers to bolster Palo Alto Network's technology. That has contributed to the high level of stock-based comp. However now that the frenzied pace of acquisitions is likely over (though more acquisitions could be coming but at a slower pace) Arora has said that driving down stock-based comp is a priority.

A stock split might help this security leader accomplish this as a smaller share price could help the company manage the value of new stock awarded to employees -- both existing and future hires.

Declining share counts bolster profitability

Getting stock-based comp under control and driving down share count could be a huge boost to Palo Alto Networks' shareholders. Over the last five years Palo Alto Networks' total shares outstanding have increased by nearly 8.6%. Acquisitions and employee equity awards were the driver partially offset by share buybacks -- which the company has been able to fund with its positive free cash flow and excess cash on balance.

In spite of this rising share count though Palo Alto Networks has still delivered fantastic returns. Both revenue per share and free cash flow per share (a metric that factors in a rising share count) have both increased at a healthy pace.

There's room for improvement though. As Palo Alto Networks business matures revenue and profit growth will naturally slow. That's where slowing and eventually reversing total shares outstanding can deliver more shareholder returns. Fewer shares means more profit to go around for those shareholders remaining. A stock split can also help with managing share buybacks as the company repurchases stock off the open market.

As of this writing Palo Alto Networks trades for 29 times enterprise value to free cash flow. For a business that has demonstrated its ability to maintain a double-digit-percentage growth rate for many years and sustain positive and growing free cash flow along the way it's a reasonable price tag. Don't buy because of the stock split but rather on the prospect Palo Alto Networks could be gearing up for a bigger push to return more value to shareholders in the coming years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlY3VyaXR5bWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzk4MzgxLXRoZS1oaWRkZW4tZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1jb3N0cy1vZi12cG4tZ2F0ZXdheXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The hidden environmental costs of VPN gateways,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlY3VyaXR5bWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzk4MzgxLXRoZS1oaWRkZW4tZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1jb3N0cy1vZi12cG4tZ2F0ZXdheXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674105C040>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Fortinet VMware Cisco Drive SD-WAN Gartner Magic Quadrant

Single-Vendor SASE Surge Expected to Fuel Convergence of SD-WAN SSE Capabilities

Image: Gartner

Perennial leaders Fortinet and VMware and a surging Cisco set themselves apart from the rest of the pack in SD-WAN according to the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant report.

Platform security giant Fortinet and virtualization behemoth VMware once again took the gold and silver in ability to execute in SD-WAN with Cisco leapfrogging both Versa Networks and Palo Alto Networks to capture the bronze. Gartner sees a large and growing gap in execution ability between those three and the other vendors it designated SD-WAN leaders: Palo Alto Networks Versa Networks and HPE Aruba.

""When clients are asking about who's included in RFPs who's being finalized who's being selected there is separation"" Jonathan Forest Gartner senior director and analyst tells Information Security Media Group. ""There is separation by some of the higher market share vendors.""

Cisco Fortinet and VMware respectively were the three SD-WAN market share leaders in 2021 with Versa Networks and HPE Aruba capturing fourth and fifth place market research firm Dell'Oro Group said in March. The worldwide SD-WAN market expanded by 35% in 2021 to more than $2 billion and the eight largest SD-WAN vendors accounted for more than 80% of revenue last year Dell'Oro Group found.

From a completeness of vision perspective Gartner found Palo Alto Networks and VMware were once against neck and neck with Palo Alto Networks taking the gold this time around. Fortinet leapfrogged Cisco and Versa Networks for the bronze in completeness of SD-WAN vision with Cisco and Versa falling to fourth and fifth place. HPE Aruba was last among the leaders in both execution ability and completeness of vision.

""There is some stability"" Forest says. ""There's enough deployments enough evidence of product deployment capabilities and overall everything we evaluate in the Magic Quadrant to make that assessment on what these vendors have done. So I do believe there's a track record and a certain level of maturity in this market.""

Outside of the leaders here's how Gartner sees the SD-WAN market:

Visionary: Juniper Networks

Juniper Networks Challenger: Huawei

Huawei Niche Players: Cradlepoint Barracuda Networks Nuage Networks Peplink Citrix and Forcepoint

""Things can change on a dime"" Forest says. ""Acquisitions can happen that can change things pretty quickly as can new development of products and new positions on innovation that disrupt the market. Things can always change.""

The Surge of Single-Vendor SASE

Gartner expects the share of organizations procuring both SD-WAN and security service edge from the same supplier will increase from 10% this year to 50% in 2025. Although secure access service edge is today dominated by multivendor solutions with orchestration tying them together Gartner says single-vendor SASE will simplify sourcing and offer a tighter technical integration and better user experience.

Most organizations today are using different vendors for SD-WAN and SSE due to unique requirements or differences in opinion between the networking and security departments Forest says. But as refresh cycles occur smaller vendors without rigid specific requirements will begin selecting one supplier for both SD-WAN and SSE and adoption will slowly move upstream to the midmarket and lower enterprise.

Some large enterprises with unique requirements will maintain separate SSE and SD-WAN vendors for the foreseeable future but Forest believes most customers will eventually converge on a single vendor to reduce complexity and simplify management. The consolidation to date has primarily been driven by SD-WAN vendors and the leading cloud security vendors are just beginning to buy their way into SD-WAN.

""Clients want less vendors"" Forest says. ""It's less complexity which from the security side makes sense because that reduces risk. Cost is part of it but not a driver. It's more about manageability and just reducing the attack surface.""

Fortinet Focuses on App Connectivity SD-Branch

Fortinet's SD-WAN business has focused over the past year on secure application connectivity SASE use cases SD-Branch opportunities and public cloud integration says Vice President of Products Nirav Shah. The company has built ZTNA enforcement into its SD-WAN offering to ensure adversaries aren't able to move laterally across the customer's entire application landscape in the event of compromise he says.

The company's SD-Branch investments will address the needs of big retail and healthcare environments by integrating LTE and 5G inside the SD-WAN appliance providing retail locations with 5G connectivity as well as Dual SIM card Shah says. And from a SASE perspective Shah says Fortinet offers customers flexibility by delivering its security and networking capabilities either on-premises or through the cloud (see: Ken Xie on Why Fortinet Is Leaning Into SD-WAN OT Security).

""We continue to lead the SD-WAN market and continue improving in execution and vision"" Shah tells ISMG. ""If you compare from last year to this year we are the only leader to improve in both execution and vision at the same time. No other vendor in the leadership quadrant could do that. So that speaks volumes to how well we are addressing any concern that customers or analysts have.""

Gartner criticized Fortinet for an average customer experience limited mind share in networking and limited third-party SSE integrations. Shah says Fortinet has invested heavily in building its networking practice out and becoming a key player in both wired and wireless LAN. From a partnership perspective Shah says Fortinet plans to deliver single-vendor SASE and isn't looking to team up with competitors.

""Our SD-WAN is a foundation for SASE because we can do the security and networking convergence that customers want"" Shah says. ""We want to take advantage of providing a single-vendor SASE architecture. And that's why you will not see Fortinet integrating with the other SSE players out there.""

VMware Doubles Down on 5G Integration Security Services

Over the past year VMware has enhanced its security capabilities and integrated private 5G services into its SD-WAN offering says Karl Brown senior director of product marketing for SD-WAN. Healthcare organizations manufacturers and retailers want to connect intelligent devices to 5G during their digital transformation efforts to improve service quality reduce latency and better support branch locations.

The company supports the security needs for cloud and SaaS applications through a bundled offering that allows customers to view analytics around application performance and network traffic and easily apply policies across all applications Brown says. VMware delivers its cloud web security technology from 150 cities to give users a direct path from where they're located to where their apps are hosted (see: VMware Doubles Down on Multi-Cloud Lateral Movement Defense).

""We make it extremely easy for our customers to connect their remote branch locations to cloud and SaaS applications"" Brown tells ISMG. ""We take away the complexity of trying to put appliances in multiple cloud locations and interconnect the users with those applications in the cloud. We make it extremely easy to deliver high-performance SaaS applications.""

Gartner criticized VMware for basic on-premises security product dependency and concerns around the Broadcom acquisition. Brown says Menlo Security's cloud protection offerings are fully integrated and benefit from close collaboration around the road map. VMware wants to extend its on-premises security offering beyond an existing firewall that's often used by customers in branch office locations.

""There is a segment of our customer base and potential customers that would like additional security in the appliance which would augment our cloud-delivered security services"" Brown says. ""We do fully intend to deliver upon that request from those customers.""

Cisco Emphasizes Network Visibility Public Cloud Partners

Cisco has strengthened its SD-WAN offering by providing more network visibility deep integrations with public cloud providers and additional security features and performance says Jay Chokshi director of product management for secure SD-WAN and SASE. Cisco has unveiled enhanced firewall capabilities and troubleshooting analysis as well as a Meraki platform with 33% enhanced performance he says.

Integrating Meraki and Viptela with ThousandEyes gives customers visibility into networks they don't control allowing them to spot outages and deep breaches across the broader internet sooner Chokshi says. Cisco also created a robust secure connection to public cloud that's simple to set up and makes it easy for customers to move applications to the cloud and access data in the cloud he says.

""The networking and security constructs are becoming increasingly complex"" Chokshi tells ISMG. ""The networks are becoming very complex. So bringing simpler security to the operations piece is very important. I think that's a big thing.""

Gartner criticized Cisco for having multiple platforms an average product and an average customer experience. Chokshi says Cisco has driven simplified operations across its products by investing in user experience and creating a simple intuitive workflow experience. Meraki allows Cisco to address SMBs' need for simplicity and lean operations while Viptela offers sophisticated features for enterprises.

""The market is very big. There are different segments of the market that have different needs"" Chokshi says. ""We have been able to bring a lot of what our customers are asking for by offering both Meraki and Viptela. In addition many of our customers are leveraging both the portfolios in their network.""

Palo Alto Networks Takes 5G Digital Experience to Next Level

Palo Alto Networks has bolstered its SD-WAN offering with native integrated 5G autonomous digital experience management and tighter SASE connections says Kumar Ramachandran senior vice president for SASE products. Integrating Prisma SD-WAN with Prisma Access' ZTNA capabilities gives customers the flexibility to select what components they want based on their deployment he says.

Native integrated 5G means customers will enjoy the best possible performance and availability in branch offices while no longer deploying a separate device Ramachandran says. And autonomous digital experience management provides deep visibility into application experience network behavior and user behavior automating application delivery and the resolution of performance issues he says (see: Why Would Palo Alto Networks Want Startup Apiiro for $600M?).

""Our SD-WAN solution is very focused on delivering the best possible user experience irrespective of the connectivity"" Ramachandran tells ISMG. ""You get this very very powerful user experience-based approach.""

Gartner criticized Palo Alto Networks for below-average customer experience below-average sales execution and limited on-premises security with SD-WAN. Ramachandran says the company has focused on bolstering both direct and MSP sales via a managed services partnership with AT&T. The company offers a full-blown firewall in the branch though he says most clients prefer cloud delivery.

""The cloud offers lots of advantages over taking a different security box and deploying it in the branch"" Ramachandran says. ""We get the elasticity of the cloud at the branch.""

Versa Networks Pursues Simplification Via AI ML

Versa has created a natural language processing chatbot and anomaly engine for network and security insights to more effectively leverage AI and ML-based technologies around SD-WAN says CEO Kelly Ahuja. Automating functions helps enterprises go faster save money and be agile by having machines do the basic work meaning organizations no longer need an army of employees troubleshooting security issues.

Vera's new chatbot allows users to ask questions in the management console using normal language and applies fixes with the click of a button greatly simplifying how enterprises interact with Versa's system Ahuja says. And the anomaly engine examines telemetry wherever software is running correlates data from all of those places identifies patterns and reports abnormalities back to customers she says.

""From a technology standpoint our solution is head and shoulders above the market based on what our customers are telling us"" Ahuja tells ISMG. ""In certain segments and certain geographies we're actually beating many of the other competitors hands down.""

Gartner criticized Versa Networks for product complexity poor customer experience and less DIY experience. Ahuja says Versa has done a lot of work to simplify its workflows with a well-lit path and said it provides comprehensive capabilities around routing appliances and security. Most customers are served via Versa's 150 service providers though many Global 2000 firms run directly on Versa he says.

""We have the most comprehensive understanding of the market and a full solution that covers both networking and security which is where the market is heading"" Ahuja says. ""So we are very very well-positioned to continue to lead the market and build and grow the business.""

HPE Aruba Doubles Down on Single Console Branch Security

HPE Aruba has worked in recent years to collapse WAN edge functions around routing firewalls and optimization into a single management console to simplify management and reduce human error says Derek Granath senior director of SD-WAN product and technical marketing. The company has teamed up to leverage user and device identity and role-based access control to enable segmentation he says.

The company has replaced branch firewalls by adding security functions at the branch such as dynamic path control and unified threat management and integrating with Palo Alto Networks and Check Point offerings he says. HPE Aruba also has increased its intrusion detection capability over the past year with prevention technology correlation of user identity and defense and mitigation features that isolate traffic he says.

""We've always been about improving performance on the WAN"" Granath tells ISMG. ""We have certain features that we think we do better than anybody such as our ability to run reliably on the internet even when it becomes impaired because of congestion.""

Gartner criticized HPE Aruba for an incomplete security road map limited geographic and vertical strategy and below-average customer experience. Granath said HPE Aruba has customers in every vertical and excels in financial services technology manufacturing and retail. From a security perspective HPE Aruba automates integrations with Zscaler and Netskope to make accessing SSE easier he says.

""There's no single SASE vendor that can tick all of the boxes for security and all of the boxes for the network"" Granath says. ""A dual or multivendor solution means customers don't have to compromise on either the security side or the network side.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vc3RheXNhZmVvbmxpbmUub3JnL2NhcmVlci1lZHVjYXRpb24vbXktY3liZXItam91cm5leS1tb25pcXVlLWhlYWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My Cyber Journey – Monique Head,"Monique Head Founder of CyberTorial.org and Sr. Partner Information Security Communications Awareness & Education at Netflix

Monique Head is respected across the industry as a dynamic accomplished bilingual Senior Cybersecurity Leader and Educator with progressive experience in guiding cybersecurity training & awareness compliance and strategy development for industry leaders like Palo Alto Networks PayPal HP and Visa.

She is the founder of CyberTorial a non-profit with a mission to uncover the unrealized and untapped potential of minority women by creating experiences that educate and improve cybersecurity acumen with the end goal being to get young females of color interested in cybersecurity as a profession.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

NCA: What were early signs growing up that hinted cybersecurity might be your place?

Monique: You have to understand when I was growing up computer science not to mention cybersecurity were not career choices offered to me…Of course my father always encouraged me and tutored me in math early on so that gave me a strong background. But during that time it wasn’t something where someone said “Oh you can work with computers.” I didn’t even know what it was till I got to college. And that’s one of the things that propels me today educating young people to let them know what is possible early enough to prepare themselves. Like so many young people I was focused on popular professions that I saw everyday like modeling and video production. So that was my focus early on while also learning about technology in school.

I would say early on I had a hacker mentality; I was always thinking outside the box asking “why”. I was always looking for an alternative way. I was always trying to understand how something worked. I remember sitting at the dining room table questioning my parents on some issue with the response “Well why? Why?”

My mother would get frustrated and respond “Why are you just asking ‘why’ all the time?” I think when you understand the “why” then you can control the narrative going forward or you can understand how to navigate and work within that realm.

NCA: What is your educational background?

Monique: It says on my resume industrial engineering for my bachelor’s which is true but actually my focus was Furniture Manufacturing and Management Engineering.

That is a long way from technology and cybersecurity but that was my academic journey. While I was in college in the summer we had to actually go out in the forest we had to cut down a tree. After we cut down the tree we had to take it to a kiln to have the wood split and dried. We made furniture from the original source all the way to the finished product which had nine or 10 different finished layers on it. Even today I like building furniture as a hobby.

NCA: What got you interested in cybersecurity as a career?

Monique: In college my best friend was in computer science. I found out I liked computer science too but I couldn’t go into it because I had a scholarship specific to Furniture Manufacturing. I started taking all the classes I could as electives in computer science. And I took one class in C++ where we had to make these little LEGO pieces move. When I saw that my code made the LEGO ferris wheel move I was hooked!

NCA: How did you get started in the cybersecurity field?

Monique: I was a consultant working for a company and we helped to train teachers on how to use computers in the classroom with their students. This got me interested in technology as well as sharing knowledge with others and I pursued a Master’s in Instructional Design. A few years later I got my first assignment to create a social engineering cybersecurity module and I was hooked.

I loved the subject matter so much meaning how you can educate people to be safe to be secure. I enjoyed working with developers and software engineers to figure out how to take this more complex idea and simplify it so others can understand how to protect themselves online. And so I’ve been doing this ever since.

NCA: You received the 2019 Women in IT Award and the Security Champion 2019 for Silicon Valley as well. What do these awards mean to you?

Monique: I can only speak for myself but I think some women in particular women of color benefit from seeing people who look like us get public acknowledgement for some of the great work we do. There are those lurking questions: Could I have done that better? Am I on the right track? Am I making a difference? The awards helped to validate me. It helped me to understand hey I’m doing some great things. to do. It gave me the fortitude to go forth and to try to do even more to support others in the same way I have received support from my tribe.

NCA: What does it mean to be a woman in cybersecurity?

Monique: I think it’s an exciting time for women right now. We do see that with the shortage in the cybersecurity labor market there is a greater shortage of women in cybersecurity. But the thing is that’s seeing the glass half empty. Let’s look at filling that glass with talented women and people of color as well. And I might add companies should not focus on just entry level positions but positions of leadership where the status quo can evolve.

In that way we can actually do certain things to become more a part of the narrative to make things happen more equitably. Our time is now – we can empower ourselves to rise to be bigger and better and effect more change.

NCA: What inspired you to found CyberTorial?

Monique: CyberTorial is my ‘next BIG thing’. I started thinking: What about people at home? They need to know how to be safe online as well as people in the workplace. And again the shortage of women and minorities in the cybersecurity field needs a new approach. Not to mention that our young girls need to be taught as early as possible how to safeguard themselves online.

When children learn to walk you teach them to look both ways before they cross the street to be safe and cautious. We must do the same thing with social media and any other technology that is out there. So young people know not just how to use social media but how to do with skepticism in mind.

That’s where the idea for CyberTorial was born to help young girls understand how to navigate the internet in a safe way. We are introducing the first female cyberhero CyReina. We are in our first year and are launching a crowdfunding campaign to help build our animated modules. Check out our CyberTorial website AND join our fundraising campaign – one day we hope to be on TV with entertaining modules free to all young people.

NCA: How has your passion for instructional design methodologies helped to optimize learning ecosystems?

Monique: In my current role I do cybersecurity communications awareness and education. So again that focuses on content but I really think a lot about the technology side of education. xAPI is a technology that will expand how we can record learning events beyond the traditional online platforms used today – this is the future.

Experience API (xAPI) is a relatively new protocol for learning technology that makes it possible to gather information about the many different experiences of a person both online and offline. This API collects data on a person or group’s activities across numerous technologies in a consistent format.

Monique: It works with knowledge sharing whether you are on social media a website sharing information via interactive video or you’re reading a blog to gain information. It’s a way to harness and track that exchange of information and knowledge.

NCA: What do you think the cybersecurity industry should be focusing on as it pertains to improving diversity and inclusion across the board?

Monique: In industry in general we must do more to educate recruiters so they understand that what powers success and innovation is diversity – diversity in thought and diversity in how you carry out your mission.

For that type of diversity you need to have people that come from all walks of life whether it be color origin nationality or whatever. That’s really important. They must look at what makes things tick. You shouldn’t just look at the package. You have to look at what’s inside the package.

NCA: Do you think the bachelor’s degree route into cybersecurity jobs needs to change?

Monique: If we continue to look at just the traditional four-year college education and you do get some great people that way but there are a lot of good talent with a two-year degree and that’s a great way to start off too. There are some people who complete a training program to learn where they need to go and that is another path. Organizations like Minorities in Cybersecurity Cyversity or Black Girls Hack which partners with CyberTorial can help someone find the path that works best for them.

There are a lot of different ways that people start off and we must look at all these different sources because college is so expensive you are only going to get a pool of people who have the money to afford that education not necessarily the pool of the best talent.

NCA: What do you think needs to happen on a leadership level?

Monique: We strive to get people into entry level positions from cyber security but what really needs to happen is diversity in leadership. We need to see diversity in leadership more CISOs of color as well as women. More people in the executive suite. If we make a difference there then the change will trickle down- it will happen organically. But if we just concentrate on these entry level positions then I think we’re putting a temporary band-aid on the problem.

NCA: Can you talk to us about misconceptions and stereotypes that are going on about the cybersecurity field?

Monique: I think one of the common stereotypes includes cybersecurity is for the techy nerdy person who is great with technology and that they have no people skills at all. That’s not the case at all I should know I can be nerdy and I like it. People need to know that cybersecurity is an industry. You need people from all walks of life technically inclined and otherwise. You need people with a business mindset. You need people who know how to help educate others. You need to have people who do all different types of job. It’s not just for the technically inclined but for those positions that support technology as well.

NCA: What would you say to someone trying to get into the industry now?

Monique: This is what I tell young people today – be willing to work at it. Don’t expect instant gratification but keep at it perseverance. Everything that is worth having is worth working for and it happens over time. It’s good to have some type of roadmap a strategy in place to guide you that way you can keep your eyes on the prize and work toward it.

Have a certain amount of time where you’re saying ‘I’m willing to work at it. I want to get to this point by this time in my career so on and so forth.’ Look at it from that perspective.

Also expand your network! Meaning make sure that you network and you connect with people who are like-minded and also those that are not.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Sometimes TikTok is about a little chaos.

Executives from Paramount and Netflix shared advice on how to connect with Gen Z and talk TikTok on the app at a dinner on Tuesday hosted by Variety and TikTok the outlet reported.

Here are some takeaways from the conversation for brands and entrepreneurs.

'You've Got to Sprinkle a Little Chaos on It'

The key to Tiktok is embracing a certain vibe said Jonathan Helfgot vice president of film marketing at Netflix who discussed how they promoted ""The Gray Man.""

Related: 3 Ways TikTok Can Help Your Business Grow

The action movie which was released in July clocked in as one of Netflix's most-watched movies of all time and was part of a viral social strategy that had 430 million views on TikTok.

""You can't just take this thing that you're going to put somewhere else and put it on TikTok"" Helfgot advised.

""You've got to sprinkle a little chaos on it"" he added a term he said he heard from an executive in Netflix's social media department.

Helfgot also said brands need to provide ""a little bit more personality"" in TikTok content.

Embrace creativity scroll endlessly

Paramount had successful marketing run on TikTok with its May movie ""Top Gun: Maverick"" as per Khartoon Weiss TikTok's global head of agency and accounts.

The hashtag TopGunMode where people joke about being in ""top gun mode"" after something good happens or make videos of themselves in planes has over 13 billion views.

Danielle De Palma executive vice president of global marketing at Paramount said the company tried to build a connection to ""Top Gun"" with younger people who had maybe not heard of it especially by showing off stars who were not Tom Cruise. The hashtag also had paid partnerships with multiple high-profile TikTokers.

De Palma talked about connecting with the ethos of the app — and embracing the enormous change it has wrought on marketing.

""I do think we've seen a pretty seismic shift with the proliferation of TikTok over the last couple of years… I think it's changing the way that we're cutting creative. It's changing the way that we're working with creators"" De Palma said.

""I feel like we're constantly on the platform to see how people are expressing themselves"" she added.

Hang with the experts

You can also leverage communities already thriving on the app. Helfgot said they promoted ""The Gray Man"" by engaging with the people in the popular #filmtok community.

Many communities on the app have the name of their focus with ""tok"" on the end (i.e. #witchtok) and at least some of them are becoming highly influential.

The New York Times wrote about #booktok's influence on the publishing industry in July.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVkaXNjb3Zlcm11c2ljLmNvbS9uZXdzL2otYmFsdmluLWFubm91bmNlcy1sYXVuY2gtb2YtYmlsaW5ndWFsLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtd2VsbG5lc3MtYXBwLW95ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,J Balvin Announces Launch Of Bilingual Mental Health Wellness App 'OYE',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVkaXNjb3Zlcm11c2ljLmNvbS9uZXdzL2otYmFsdmluLWFubm91bmNlcy1sYXVuY2gtb2YtYmlsaW5ndWFsLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtd2VsbG5lc3MtYXBwLW95ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EB4BC40>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The short version is that Swift who has a sponsorship deal with Coca-Cola would not do a Super Bowl show because the game had been sponsored by rival Pepsi. That is no longer the case.

And when Apple Music announced at midnight ET on Friday that it was the game’s new halftime sponsor well that had significance.

The Haboob blog is not a T-Swift fan but we have been told Swift has made a habit of dropping songs and albums at the stroke of midnight. She also uses “midnight” often in her songs. “Midnights” is the title of her upcoming album.

Early Friday Swift dropped a song title as part of that next album just as Apple Music made its vague announcement about the Super Bowl halftime show agreement.

Oh by the way: Apple Music and Swift have done a commercial together.

Anyway if you an Arizonan and Taylor Swift fan thinking of reasons to attend the Super Bowl on Feb. 12 in Glendale you might want to start saving up for that ticket.

How to Cancel Paramount+,"Formerly known as CBS All Access Paramount+ launched in 2021 to bring together the ViacomCBS brands (now known as Paramount Global). That means CBS MTV Nickelodeon Paramount Pictures Smithsonian Channel VH1 and now Showtime are all in one place.

In a world of ever-increasing streaming video services it's hard to go wrong when you can watch Avatar: The Last Airbender Daria Dexter Halo Homeland Nathan For You NCIS RuPaul's Drag Race Star Trek: Discovery Paramount's catalogue of new and classic films and live NFL soccer golf college basketball and college football coverage all on the same platform.

But if you're left unsatisfied or simply don't have the time to take full advantage when you're already paying for Netflix and HBO Max it may be time to cut ties with Paramount+. Here's how to cancel or at least downgrade your account.

Cancel Paramount+

You must visit the Paramount+ website to make changes to your account. If you plan to cancel head to the site and choose your profile. Hover over your profile icon in the top-right corner and select Account. Select the Cancel Subscription link under the Subscription & Billing section.

In a bid to keep your business Paramount may throw a special discount your way. I received 50% off my plan for two months when I tried to cancel the service. If you're determined to continue you can reject this offer. Check the box and then click Yes Cancel to make it official.

Change Plans

Now if you want to keep Paramount+ but wish to save some extra money you can adjust your plan accordingly. From the Account page on the web click the Edit Plan link next to your active plan. You can then select a new plan and click Switch Plan to confirm.

If you subscribe to the $9.99 Premium plan you can save some money by dropping to the ad-supported $4.99 Essential plan. If the $12.99 Premium with Showtime is too much you can make it $7.99 with ads or drop the bundle altogether.

For additional savings you may also want to switch to an annual plan which will be about 16% cheaper than your current plan. Click the link at the bottom of this page to see yearly rates for these plans. Paying $99.99 for a full year of Premium will cost closer to $8.30 a month. At $49.99 a year for the Essential plan you would pay just over $4 a month.

T-Mobile customers and Walmart+ subscribers can also get the Paramount+ Essential plan for free so check out those deals if you can."

You don’t realise how entangled our lives are with the private digital services that underpin our economy until they’re gone. It’s a lesson that the professional polemicist and free speech advocate Toby Young is learning quickly as he finds himself and the organisation he set up in 2020 the Free Speech Union locked out of their PayPal accounts.

The online payments company through which Young gathered donations for his group – which has campaigned for the reinstatement of social media accounts for those who expressed scepticism about the Covid vaccine and has defended gender-critical academics – also shut the account of Young’s website the Daily Sceptic and his personal one.

On the face of it this sounds like a troubling development. It’s eminently possible to disagree with Young’s stance on key issues such as when it comes to trans people while also finding it concerning that his ability to operate in the world can be cut off without explanation. Organisations including Big Brother Watch – which isn’t exactly neighbours with Young on the political spectrum – have written an open letter about PayPal’s decision.

Yet the issue highlights one of the key misunderstandings that we often have about Big Tech platforms. Just because they appear to be public utilities and are ubiquitous we expect them to be required to follow a more significant scrutinised code of conduct. But they’re not. They’re private companies with their own rules and regulations. If we don’t like it we can lump it: as an ardent supporter of conservative causes Young will know that competition in a free-market economy is king.

But scratch beneath the surface of Young’s claims and you begin to realise that the ban may be more justified than people think. This isn’t just a rabble-rouser trying to keep the home fires burning in a fictitious bubbly culture war. A Times report has alleged that one of the reasons why PayPal closed the accounts down was for spreading Covid vaccine misinformation – a real harm that puts lives at risk. The R value of false information discouraging people from taking up the offer of perfectly safe vaccines outstrips that of the virus that has killed to date 6.5 million people.

Young denies he is anti-vax or that he has ever published misinformation telling the Times that while the Daily Sceptic does “have reservations about the efficacy and safety” of Covid vaccines “we do not take a position on whether people should take them or not but encourage them to do their own risk assessments”. He also does not believe this could have been why the accounts were closed: “If the Daily Sceptic is guilty of that sin… why has PayPal demonetised my account and the Free Speech Union account?”

PayPal declined to comment on specific cases but said that it “regularly assesses activity against our long-standing acceptable use policy and will discontinue our relationship with account holders who are found to violate our policies”.

The payments company does have a long-standing issue with banning companies and individuals from using its services or withholding their cash without justification. I’ve previously reported on PayPal holding back far more money than Young would likely have in his accounts – and have been inundated with similar stories. Those examples seem to have little explanation unlike the banning of Young’s accounts which have been pinned to allegations that he spread misinformation.

The decision is also not as dramatic as Young – whose career has relied on over-egging his strife like a put-upon puppy – makes out. He’s not being silenced and is not a cri de coeur for certain griftier fringe personalities. He’s still entitled to his opinions no matter how wrong they may be.

It’s just that PayPal has decided it doesn’t want him to profit from them.

It’s an approach that Young would likely recognise from one of the favourite cases of the anti-woke free speech brigade: if a bakery is allowed to withhold business from customers wanting it to bake a gay cake why can’t PayPal withhold its services from someone with whom it disagrees?

The corporate impact investing initiative is being launched by PayPal and the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) along with the Telus Pollinator Fund for Good and the Visa Foundation according to a Thursday (Sept. 22) press release.

By connecting company leaders with a new set of tools and resources the corporate impact investing initiative aims to help companies better deliver on environmental and social commitments. The group has issued an open invitation to companies to engage and contribute.

“Leveraging corporate treasury for impact investing is a strategic way for corporations to align shareholder and community interests” PayPal Acting Chief Financial Officer and SVP Capital Markets Investor Relations and Treasurer Gabrielle Rabinovitch said in the press release.

“Over the last two years we expanded our impact investing capabilities and as a result we were able to allocate $400 million in treasury investments toward closing the racial wealth gap in the United States and committed an additional $100 million towards global gender equality” Rabinovitch added.

The GIIN Initiative helps corporations get involved with impact investing using their own financial assets and capabilities. Those interested can share insights and help develop resources and tools as part of a multi-year effort.

From there GIIN and interested corporations will assess the results of using impact investing vehicles and partnerships to satisfy corporate environmental and social objectives. They will then collaborate to produce a landscape report according to the release.

“This initiative is an important lever to help unlock much-needed capital and technical skills that are currently sitting on the sidelines” GIIN CEO and Co-founder Amit Bouri said in the release.

“Corporations are critical to scaling the most promising solutions for the pressing challenges in our local communities and around the world.

As he tweeted yesterday: ‘Big Tech companies that feel they can bully people for questioning mainstream groupthink don’t deserve anyone’s business.’

PayPal has been in the news for cancelling the account of the Free Speech Union who it says violated its ‘Acceptable Use Policy’ although it has not explained on what exact charge. The Free Speech Union has in recent years defended those who have been censured or lost their job for expressing unfashionable opinions whether they be on lockdown or the trans issue so it could be on many contentious topic.

The union’s founder Toby Young has been politely bemused. Many members of the public have been less restrained also vowing to close their PayPal account. But Jack Dee’s intervention has been the first of its kind by a celebrity.

Predictably Twitter went beserk with many up in arms accusing Dee – without a hint of irony – of being a fascist in siding with the Free Speech Union. Oh yes the fascists those well-known martyrs to free speech.

This situation represents a grim truth of our times: that untrammelled free speech is now the preserve of the rich

While it’s tempting to view Dee’s public stance in a positive light – as evidence that he has reached that stage of life where he doesn’t care what the mob thinks – it represents a grim truth of our times: that untrammelled free speech is now the preserve of the rich.

Most popular Mark Galeotti What the Shoigu reshuffle means for Putin’s war machine

Like J. K. Rowling or Ricky Gervais Jack Dee has got to that stage of financial security where fear of being cancelled or publicly shamed doesn’t matter. Sure like Rowling he may lose some work. He will face the scornful opprobrium of fans who feel betrayed. He may lose friends. But in material terms little is at stake.

The same can’t be said for the rest of us. For most people the wrong opinion still carries the tacit risk of public censure or losing one’s job. And it was precisely these people that Free Speech Union has been speaking up for: the casualties in our culture wars those who have lost their livelihoods for expressing views that PayPal would presumably also find beyond the pale.

The case of Enoch Burke in Ireland the teacher who refused to use a pupil’s preferred pronouns is the most recent example. His failure to comply ultimately (and after a contempt of court ruling) landed him in prison earlier this month (he’s still there). Here is the most severe warning to the little people as to the perils of speaking your mind. J.K. Rowling can be as gender-critical as she likes. Had she been in his position she probably would have just resigned before the matter spiralled out of control. Because she wouldn’t need a teacher’s salary.

Many ordinary people this side of the Irish Sea have also felt the strong arm of the state merely for expressing counter-cultural opinions (and yes to be a conservative to believe in biology really is ‘counter-cultural’ these days.) The most prominent cases include Marion Millar in Scotland who was taken to court and threatened with prison after she tweeted a picture of a ribbon in Suffragette colours which the most affronted police trans activists took to be a hate crime. Then there was Jennifer Swayne in Wales whose house was raided by the police after she placed gender-critical stickers on lamp-posts.

In July Hampshire Constabulary deployed officers to the residence of an Aldershot man who had posted online Progress Pride flags in the shape of a swastika. That event came to public awareness when the actor-turned-campaigner Laurence Fox posted a video of the event online. This is significant. While the Aldershot man had put himself in jeopardy Fox is a vociferous counter-cultural public persona and thus enjoys immunity as a result. He now features on GB News. Again – as the cliche goes – it’s one rule for them and another for the rest of us.

In this climate no wonder most ordinary people are now afraid to speak their minds. Censorship in Western culture is indeed a problem but so is self-censorship. A study in August 2020 by Washington University in St. Louis found that more Americans than ever – 40 per cent -– were now choosing to keep their mouths shut than express their opinions.

We live in a culture of fear of self-imposed silence as well as silence imposed from above. The only relatively normal people who dare speak out freely on these matters are journalists such as Young as it is part of our livelihood.

And I had the opportunity to move up in the business from there. What’s probably unique in my experience is that PepsiCo has afforded me a lot of opportunity to do a lot of cross-functional experiences so I’ve had the chance to run large front-line teams I’ve done a couple of account executive roles for different styles of accounts I’ve worked in the supply chain side of the business and did finance and HR for a little bit. All of that has led to me having a really cross-functional background [within the business]. The two key roles I held before joining the Australia team were around enterprise customer teams and most recently was with Walmart in Arkansas leading the strategic agenda for PepsiCo – that’s our largest customer in the United States. IR: What are some of the lessons you’ve learned throughout your time in the retail industry that have helped to inform the way you work today? KF: I’ll give you three. My first one is that when I was younger and I got to my first large general management role I had a sizeable team of mostly front-line employees and what I learned in retrospect was the importance of a “people first” agenda. Sometimes in business you want to chase KPIs or you have a desire to win but there’s really an art in how you bring people along through that journey. I had a problem where we had some of the best performance of any team in the United States but our people weren’t happy and I got a lot of feedback about that. It was a crucial moment in my career because it taught me about inspiring joy and growth in others because if you can do that you’ll get the results you’re after. It was a fundamental change and I tell people when I mentor that there’s two questions that everyone wants to know when they work for you: the first one is whether they can trust you and the second one is whether you have their best interests at heart. If you can answer yes to both of those all of the results will come. And that really plays into my second lesson. There’s a customer called Dollar General – it’s a unique channel to the U.S. – and I went there to create a team. The first thing we wanted to do was to create a really diverse team which really taught me the power of having people from different backgrounds and ages all the different elements of diversity both visual and invisible. It was amazing because those differences of thoughts led to some of the most creative ideas of a team that I’d had the opportunity to work on and we had a great retail partner to back them up. I think my last one is to never be comfortable with the status quo. When I went to Walmart we had an amazing team with amazing resources but we could rapidly see that the world was changing. This was pre-pandemic. We made this bet that the customer was going to shop differently moving forward and that we needed to have an omnichannel team. We got approval and created the first dedicated omnichannel team that was truly end-to-end for everything in the Walmart ecosystem. By having that transparency where you could see all the way through a campaign or an idea carried by great people we were able to make a big step-change in performance for them. IR: What have been some of the biggest challenges you’ve faced in your career and how have you dealt with them? KF: I think it’s easy as a leader to get really focused on ‘horizon one’ or what’s right in front of you because it’s usually the most pressing and demanding of your time. And I believe that the best leaders have to constantly think about what is needed for the future and to always be working on ideas for horizon two or three or what’s coming next so that when you get there you’ve got amazing plans that are ready to activate. And I think the other one is making sure as you’re progressing through your career to keep a really good balance. Balance is different amongst everyone and it’s across your tasks in what you’re focusing on and then balance in your personal life. I think about times in my life where I’ve gotten out of balance and you’re leaning too far one way or the other and life has a way of reminding you sometimes shockingly how fragile every day is and that you need to enjoy the time. I very much fall in the camp of ‘I work hard at work and when I’m not at work I enjoy what I’m doing outside of work’. That’s a lesson I did not get right early in my career and now I spent a lot of time focusing on that.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVxdWl0eXBhbmRpdC5jb20vcGVwc2ljby10by1pbnZlc3QtcnMtMzc0MC1jci10by1lc3RhYmxpc2gtZm91ci1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLXVuaXRzLWluLXVwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PepsiCo to Invest Rs 3740 Cr to Establish Four Industrial Units in UP,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.equitypandit.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /pepsico-to-invest-rs-3740-cr-to-establish-four-industrial-units-in-up/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673EC4AE00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVxdWl0eXBhbmRpdC5jb20vcGVwc2ljby10by1pbnZlc3QtcnMtMzc0MC1jci10by1lc3RhYmxpc2gtZm91ci1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLXVuaXRzLWluLXVwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

But as the NFL season kicked off this month the Big Pharma’s marketing strategy is going the extra yard.

That’s according to data and analysis shared with Fierce Pharma Marketing by real-time ad tracker iSpot.tv. These data find that since Aug. 22 ads for Comirnaty have aired 749 times on national linear TV with a particular emphasis on NFL games which started Sept. 9.

In fact almost 30% of Comirnaty TV ad impressions appeared during NFL games and more than 63% of national TV ad spend for the brand was allocated toward the NFL according to iSpot's analysis.

“On the NFL end Comirnaty is also pretty visible as one of the 30 most-seen advertisers over the first two weeks of the regular season” an analyst from iSpot told Fierce Pharma Marketing. “It’s by far the most-seen pharma spot during NFL games.”

There are only four prescription medicine brands appearing during NFL games so far this season. Besides Comirnaty the other three are Bristol Myers Squibb’s blockbuster cancer drug Opdivo and its autoimmune med Zeposia as well as AstraZeneca’s diabetes drug Farxiga.

But iSpot’s data show that Comirnaty as a brand is “significantly higher than the rest by both spend and impressions” during NFL games. Its estimated spend is $9.5 million with 31 airings nearly double its nearest rival in Opdivo which had an estimated TV spend of just over $5.1 million with 10 airings.

This comes as sales of Pfizer’s vaccine which soared to a major $36 billion last year are expected to slow down in 2022 and beyond given that the immediate threat of pandemic COVID is according to U.S. President Joe Biden now “over” and fewer people are getting a vaccine.

Pfizer is however now gearing up for COVID booster season alongside rival Moderna. Both nabbed FDA authorizations for their respective variant-specific shots last month.

The new Comirnaty ads and the ramping up of its marketing spend for the NFL season mark a notable change for Pfizer.

The DTC ad work for the vaccine began last December well after Pfizer won its first Comirnaty full approval in August 2021. Companies aren't allowed to do any DTC marketing for products under emergency authorization but that all changes with full approval.

Nonetheless Pfizer's first TV spot called “Remarkable” did not mention Comirnaty by name nor did it talk about vaccinations broadly or even the COVID-19 pandemic specifically. Instead the campaign focused on how society was yearning to get back to normal and how that drove Pfizer's mission.

Related Pfizer offers a soft sell with a strong message on vaccines in first COVID ad

The second ad “Don’t miss your shot” was a little more direct but not by much. It came shortly after ""Remarkable"" in December 2021 and once again did not showcase Comirnaty nor mention COVID. It did however talk up the availability of vaccines and portray the importance of not missing your opportunity to get your shot.

But the branding strategy has changed over Pfizer's two latest TV ads. Launched a month ago on Aug. 22 and called “Hard on everyone” the 60-second spot followed Pfizer's July full approval for Comirnaty in teens. For the first time the Big Pharma takes a directly branded approach that it didn’t in earlier commercials.

Pfizer talks up how the last two years of COVID have been tough and has a specific focus on teens. It directly says in the ad that there is a vaccine for 12- to 15-years-olds and mentions Comirnaty by name at the end of the spot.

And in the main ad used for the NFL spots “More” launched Sept. 8 a narrator tells the story in rhyme about the “normal” things that happen in everyday life with the tagline “the more you want to do the more we want to do.”

This is a specific plug for Pfizer’s new COVID boosters. The Comirnaty name isn’t used in the ad itself but logos for Pfizer and its partner BioNTech are shown at the end of the spot and there's a clear message for people to get their COVID booster shots this fall and winter.

There is a slight marketing issue for Pfizer when it comes to the Comirnaty name and its new booster. This bivalent booster has an emergency use authorization but not full FDA approval and therefore has limits on how it can be marketed. Also its official title is Pfizer-BioNTech omicron BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine.

That may explain why it is not using Comirnaty in its booster DTCs but it is cropping up in another ad.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yNC9oZWFsdGgvcGZpemVyLWNlby1wb3NpdGl2ZS1jb3ZpZC0xOS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFGaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wOS8yNC9oZWFsdGgvcGZpemVyLWNlby1wb3NpdGl2ZS1jb3ZpZC0xOQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla tests positive for Covid-19 again,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.cnn.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/09/24/health/pfizer-ceo-positive-covid-19/index.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267421F4610>, 'Connection to www.cnn.com timed out.

The potential of this new tech could transform science leaders at the company said. Vincent Kalut / Photonews via Getty Images

Annaliesa Anderson a leader in vaccine research shared how the pandemic changed Pfizer.

Anderson said employees embraced a ""light-speed mentality"" of doing things faster and simpler.

The company will apply mRNA tech to other areas and use new ways of thinking to solve problems.

This article is part of a series called ""Culture of Innovation"" exploring how companies are setting the stage for innovation transformation and growth.

The world isn't the same place it was three years ago and neither is Pfizer.

The biopharmaceutical giant along with its partner BioNTech was one of the first to develop a marketable vaccine for COVID-19 using nascent mRNA technology. It was one of the fastest developments of a vaccine for modern medicine forcing execs to ask what's next for a company that had shown it could compress the drug-creation process.

Pfizer which has said it expects to pull in $32 billion in sales from its COVID vaccine this year knows that it's set a high standard for innovation collaboration and R&D. COVID-19 forced a ""paradigm shift"" within the company where execs and employees alike had to think and act differently according to Pfizer's Uwe Schoenbeck chief scientific officer of external research development and innovation.

""Pfizer's pandemic response focused on external partnership reduction of bureaucracy and a purpose-driven culture"" Schoenbeck told Insider. ""It taught us that what seems impossible at one point in time can be achieved but also that it requires us to do things differently.""

For Pfizer priorities for the future include using mRNA technology to develop vaccines for other diseases like respiratory syncytial virus known as RSV the flu as well as better treatments for cancer.

The mRNA or messenger RNA technology instructs cells to generate a protein that can then trigger an immune response. This type of technology along with others can speed up the drug-discovery process.

Below is a conversation with Annaliesa Anderson Pfizer's senior vice president of vaccines research and development.

These interviews have been lightly edited for length and clarity.

How did the pandemic change Pfizer as a company? What old ways went out the window because of COVID-19 and what new strategies or new ways of thinking did you adopt?

We began communicating much more quickly — not waiting three days for an appointment to meet with someone.







We also changed our processes. You're no longer setting a strategy and then sitting back and watching that strategy unfold. You're looking at that strategy and reassessing it as you get new data. We asked ourselves ""Does something need to be done in the way that we have done it before? Or can we look at things in a different way?""

A big piece of this was the fact that it was a technology that was unproven mRNA. So we took I wouldn't say ""a risk."" I would say ""an opportunity"" to really validate that technology.

What's a top priority at Pfizer in terms of innovation?

We now have the proof of concept for mRNA. So that's very exciting. mRNA technology has tremendous potential for other disease areas such as oncology and rare diseases. And so now the question is ""how can we now kind of move this technology into those areas?""

The flu is another area that we're working on. We've just started our phase-three study of a quadrant flu vaccine made out of mRNA. We see it has several advantages over current flu vaccines including higher efficacy.

There is rapid change happening in medicine and science. What are you most excited about?

Our work on an RSV vaccine for older adults is a great story of partnership and innovation. People have been looking to develop RSV vaccines for over six decades. We've been able to show in early studies that our vaccine was highly effective at preventing RSV.

We've deployed what we call a ""light-speed mentality."" Would we have done it so quickly back in the day? No we wouldn't. Hopefully the next step is to submit it to the agencies for licensure and then hopefully be able to have a vaccine that can prevent a really severe disease that has a high burden on healthcare and hospitals.

You mentioned a 'light-speed mentality.' Can you explain that?

Light-speed mentality is thinking through what's the best way to achieve what we need to achieve in a more straightforward route than we might have normally done it.

It's about how you can move a vaccine forward with urgency without compromising safety.

Drug companies have typically been very secretive with their intellectual property. How do you think about collaboration now? And will there be more mergers and acquisitions?

Many companies including Pfizer have strategies where we build from within we partner and we also make strategic acquisitions. I think that that will remain pretty constant. I think there's a big interest in vaccines now. We're seeing a lot of smaller companies come through and start to really build some momentum in the vaccine space. So there will continue to be interest there.

Pfizer recently pledged to hire 500 refugees as a response to the recent Afghan and Ukrainian refugee crises. How do you expect this to enhance innovation?

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaW5jaW5uYXRpL25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWF0dG9ybmV5LXByaXNvbi1yZWxlYXNlLWFwcGVhbC5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYml6am91cm5hbHMuY29tL2NpbmNpbm5hdGkvbmV3cy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtYXR0b3JuZXktcHJpc29uLXJlbGVhc2UtYXBwZWFsLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G.

Phillips 66 Big 12 Championship

T-Mobile Center Kansas City Mo.

",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL2JlZm9yZS15b3UtYnV5LWNoZXZyb24tb3ItZW50ZXJwcmlzZS1wcm9kdWN0cy1zdG9jL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Before You Buy Chevron or Enterprise Products Stock: Here's 1 Energy Dividend Stock I'd Buy First,"There are some important factors that make Phillips 66 the better investment right now.

The past year has been painful for stock investors. The S&P 500 index which tracks 500 of the largest U.S. stocks is down 11% at this writing on Sept. 21 and over 19% below its 52-week high. Every single sector is down at least 4% from its high. The only stock sector that's delivered blowout returns so far this year is the energy sector; the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF is up 70.5% in total returns with almost 7% of those gains due to dividends.

Needless to say this has investors -- especially those looking for dividends -- very interested in energy stocks right now. Two in particular are getting a lot of attention: Chevron (CVX 0.22%) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD 0.59%). This makes sense considering they're both cash-cow giants with strong dividends yielding 3.6% and 7.2% respectively at recent prices. But before buying either of these two giants investors should also take a close look at Phillips 66 (PSX -1.44%) another diversified giant with a 4.6% yield and a better record of growing its payout.

What makes Phillips 66 different

While both Chevron and Enterprise Products are strong companies (I own Enterprise Products too) there are some characteristics of Phillips 66 that are very compelling. Most importantly they're things that can make it a strong investment across the energy cycle supporting its dividend when we go from today's high oil prices to periods of oversupply that send prices -- and profits for oil producers -- down.

Like Chevron Phillips 66 is a diversified integrated oil and gas company. Its operations include midstream operations to gather pipeline and store oil gas and natural gas liquids; refining and petrochemical operations; and a downstream marketing business to sell and deliver those products to market. Its operations are international giving it access to oil and gas from some of the largest and lowest-cost oil and gas fields on earth.

But where Phillips 66 differs from Chevron is that it does not have any upstream operations meaning it does not produce any oil or gas. There's obvious downside to not being a producer as it means missing out on the upside of high oil prices. You can see how Chevron's free cash flow has essentially tracked oil prices up and down over the past decade:

Cash flows at Phillips 66 and Enterprise Products have also moved up and down with oil prices but not nearly to the extremes that Chevron's has; that's by and large because its fixed costs to produce oil don't fall when the market price for crude does but they also don't go up when oil prices are higher.

So while it benefits from higher prices it also feels the impact of falling prices on its bottom line in a way that Phillips 66 and Enterprise Products don't. And over time that lack of downside exposure to falling prices makes Phillips 66's dividend more secure in my book.

The counter-argument is that since it doesn't produce oil it has to buy it to refine it meaning it pays higher prices when oil prices are up so that's bad for its bottom line. That's only partly true. Yes it does pay the higher price but since refined products like gasoline and jet fuel are priced based on crude prices Phillips 66 isn't really hurt by that. To the contrary one of its advantages is its advanced refineries. Since not all crude oils are the same chemistry not all oils can be processed at any refinery. Phillips 66 has a long history of being able to buy lower-cost crudes other refiners cannot process boosting its refining margins.

On the other end of the spectrum is Enterprise Products. And while it's a wonderful company it's less diversified and very focused on the midstream space where all the logistics of oil and gas happens. It's proficient at it having generated a 12% return on invested capital on average over the past decade. This focus on the midstream has been very good for slow and steady distribution growth but it hasn't made for a great total return investment. Both it and Chevron have underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the past decade.

Phillips 66 on the other hand has actually performed modestly better than the market. It was a rare strong-performing energy stock during the tech stock boom of the past decade.

A massive part of that higher return has been Phillips 66's superior dividend growth. Since becoming a stand-alone public company in 2012 Phillips 66 has increased its dividend almost fivefold while Chevron's and Enterprise Products' payouts have grown 58% and 50% respectively. It's also made some serious moves to position itself as a leader in biofuels something that should pay off as we transition away from fossil fuels in the coming decades.

Why Phillips 66 is especially attractive now

In recent months falling oil prices and economic worries have caused investors to send even energy stocks down; of this group Phillips 66 shares are down more than 25% and are actually down more than 30% from their pre-COVID highs. I think Mr. Market has once again overreacted due to near-term concerns creating a wonderful price point to buy this long-term winner at a great price. With a dividend yield well above 4.5% and a long record of stellar dividend increases Phillips 66 looks like a better buy than Chevron or Enterprise Products right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbmNhY2l0eW5vdy5jb20vcG9uY2EtY2l0eS13aWxkY2F0cy12YXJzaXR5LXRlYW0tdHJhdmVsaW5nLXRvLWVkbW9uZC10by1wbGF5LWRlZXItY3JlZWstaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ponca City Wildcats Varsity Team Traveling to Edmond to Play Deer Creek High School,"The Ponca City High School Varsity football team will be in Edmond tonight to take on Deer Creek High School.

At least six venture capital funds that target fintech investments have been launched since 2021 by veteran investors who have looked to add community banks as limited partners according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The fund investments often include partnerships that incorporate offerings from the fintechs into the banks' operations and some of the fintech companies develop products to enhance practices of fair lending and financial inclusion.

Venture capital professionals who connect banks with fintechs now see an opportunity to get more regulatory clarity in qualifying banks' investments in fintechs for Community Reinvestment Act or CRA credit as regulators look to expand the scope of CRA assessment and take digital banking efforts into consideration.

""We are absolutely paying attention to it and will certainly consider that as a part of the future"" said Carey Ransom managing director at BankTech Ventures. The firm closed its first fund of $115 million in August backed by over 100 banks and other investors as limited partners to invest in fintechs.

Community Reinvestment Act interest

Although BankTech Ventures has seen banks' interest it opted not to take the mandate of earning CRA credit for banks in this first fund. It requires dedication to set up a fund with an explicit focus on community development and since regulators' reevaluation of CRA rules is still in process it did not want to anchor the whole fund's strategy on something uncertain right now Ransom explained.

""I'm very confident that some of the investments that we have and are making in the first fund could qualify for CRA"" Ransom said in an interview. But now it remains a question how a bank can claim the credit by such an investment in a pooled fund rather than in a fund dedicated to community development purposes Ransom added.

What will help is a clearer process for banks to recognize qualified activities for CRA credit and regulators appear headed toward that direction. In May the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to revisit regulations that implement the CRA and collected comments from the public until August.

""One of the good things they do in this proposal is that they will start listing what are eligible activities for community development consideration"" said Corey Carlisle Varo Bank's head of public policy. Regulators proposed to create a new process to give banks some surety about CRA qualification before they make an investment Carlisle said.

Concerns in practices

The current CRA framework was established in 1977 and has not been substantially revised since 1995. The fintech community has advocated for expanding the scope of the law to address nonbanks including fintechs as well as banks' engagement with fintechs.

One concern in linking fintech venture investments to CRA credit is the viability of the fintech startups said Adam Rust senior policy advisor at National Community Reinvestment Coalition.

""It is possible that a fintech could reach an underserved audience but that's a pretty uncertain statement to make"" Rust said in an interview. A lot of fintech startups may not have established a customer base when they raise capital and could fail over time Rust said.

Measuring the impact of fintech solutions on financial equity and inclusion can be a time-consuming and complex endeavor. Between 2017 and 2019 it took the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 22 months to conclude a study on lending marketplace Upstart Holdings Inc. and the watchdog validated that Upstart extended credit access to a broader consumer base at a lower cost compared to traditional models.

Fintech innovation to continue

While the dialogue about CRA modernization will continue there is no shortage of banks' interest in investing in fintechs built on a mission. For instance Atlanta-based neobank Greenwood Inc. said it aims to design a digital mobile banking app that caters to Black and Latino customers. The fintech secured $40 million in equity financing in March 2021 from investors including Truist Ventures the corporate venture arm of Truist Financial Corp.; Bank of America Corp.; PNC Financial Services Group Inc.; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; and Wells Fargo & Co.

Fintech funds are gaining traction from those in and near the banking industry. In addition to investments from community banks Castle Creek Launchpad Fund I LP also drew investors of banking executives and professionals and JAM Fintop Blockchain LP is also backed by nonbank investors as well including blockchain technology company Figure Technologies Inc.

CMFG Ventures the corporate venture arm of CUNA Mutual Holding Co. also sees healthy innovation from fintechs with a goal to alleviate some of the inherent biases in loan decisioning and it has invested in such companies as Home Lending Pal said Sam Das managing director at CMFG Ventures. Home Lending Pal uses artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to connect borrowers with mortgage lenders.

""It's a great combination of new revenue opportunities and being ahead of the curve of financial inclusion while also embracing new forms of technology to make it happen"" Das said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vYmFuay1yZWd1bGF0aW9uLzIwMjIvY29uZ3Jlc3MtZHJpbGxzLWJhbmstYnJhc3Mtb24tYXV0aG9yaXplZC1wdXNoLXBheW1lbnRzLWZyYXVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Congress on Authorized Push Payments Fraud,"The top brass of the country’s seven biggest financial institutions faced lawmakers in a second meeting on Capitol Hill about accountability consumer protection and compliance with private peer-to-peer payment network Zelle emerging as a hot-button issue.

Zelle has been in the hot seat over authorized push payment fraud and is owned by Early Warning Services LLC a FinTech company owned by all but one bank in attendance — Bank of America Corp. Truist Financial Corp. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. PNC Financial Services Group Inc. U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo & Co. plus Capital One Financial Corp.

Complaints are on the rise from banking customers unknowingly authorizing payments to scammers using Zelle and not being able to get their money refunded.

“Zelle is not safe. You built the system you profit from every transaction on the system and you tell people that it is safe. But when someone is defrauded you claim that’s the customer’s problem” said Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) during the Senate Banking Committee hearing on Thursday (Sept. 23). The CEOs met with the House Banking Committee on Wednesday (Sept. 22).

Lawmakers grilled the CEOs about the many reports of fraud and scams on Zelle which has processed more than 5 billion transactions and handled nearly $1.5 trillion in payments since its inception in 2017. The bankers indicated that they are working together to implement new policies to protect consumers using the network.

The owners of Zelle are collaborating to provide better guardrails on the network by closing accounts of customers who receive the fraudulent funds Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan said during the testimony. The network also removed lenders who didn’t police clients accused of defrauding customers at other banks he said.

Regulation E governs how banks handle electronic fund transfers. If a fraudster gets into a customer’s account and sends money banks must provide a refund. But if a customer sends the money which is what happens in a fraudulent Zelle transaction Regulation E doesn’t apply.

“Anything that’s unauthorized we do cover” J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon told senators. “So you’re really talking about authorized transactions that we have an enormous amount of systems to stop. And the amount of fraud relatively is very small for this free-of-charge service.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZGVsYXdhcmVidXNpbmVzc3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL21ibmEtZnJlZWRvbS1hd2FyZC1yZWNlcHRpb24v0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWxhd2FyZWJ1c2luZXNzdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvbWJuYS1mcmVlZG9tLWF3YXJkLXJlY2VwdGlvbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MBNA feted at du Pont Freedom Award reception,"WILMINGTON – In many ways the reception for the annual Pete du Pont Freedom Foundation’s Freedom Award recipient Thursday night was more of a homecoming for MBNA Delaware’s once mighty credit card operation.

While the MBNA name may no longer exist after being acquired by Bank of America in 2006 for $35 billion its impact on Delaware’s banking industry continues to linger with local leaders at Bank of America JPMorgan Chase PNC Bank Goldman Sachs College Ave Student Loans and more having spent time at the company. That legacy is due to the fact that in the late 1990s MBNA was the largest private employer in the state with more than 26000 associates.

Many of those former MBNA associates gathered in the Gold Ballroom of the Hotel DuPont on Thursday to watch former Chief Operating Officer John Cochran and Chief Administrative Officer Lance Weaver receive the annual Freedom Award – it was the first time the award had been given to a company rather than an individual.

As a legacy of the late Gov. Pete du Pont the Pete du Pont Freedom Foundation is a nonprofit that promotes and supports entrepreneurism in the state and nation. Thère du Pont son of the late governor and chair of the foundation’s board said it wasn’t just the financial success of the company that warranted its honor.

“Maybe even remarkable and more instructive for the entrepreneurs in this room is the conscious effort that team made early on in their work to create a culture” he said. “They were practically just a startup with about 150 people in a renovated A&P Supermarket in Ogletown when the leaders wrote down the precepts as they’re called. They weren’t goals for new accounts or loan growth. They were a statement of expectations of how MBNA people would treat each other how they treat their customers and how they wanted their operation to run.”

In his remarks Cochran recalled just how intertwined the MBNA story was with Gov. du Pont.

In 1981 the company was still a $100 million loan portfolio of the Baltimore-based Maryland National Bank with a more than 20% prime lending rate and an operation that lost $7 million on the bottom line. They sought interest rate relief from the Maryland legislature but were rebuked. Management at the bank were advised to begin seeking a buyer for the credit operation.

“It was going to be a fire sale. But then the Financial Center Development Act was signed into law by Pete du Pont in February 1981. The timing was perfect. It couldn’t have been any better for our credit card program and Charlie Cawley” he said.

It famously moved to the 19000-square-foot former grocery store with about 50 people turning a profit in the first year. Within 10 years they would employ 10000 people and occupy 5 million square feet of space largely on the back of affinity cards or branded credit cards issued with universities organizations sports teams and more.

MBNA was led by the late Cawley a tenacious and gifted leader and board chair and CEO Alfred Lerner whose legacy continues in Delaware through the business college named in his honor at the University of Delaware.

Cochran recalled Cawley’s undying devotion to customer service creating the nation’s first 24/7 customer service hotline for a credit card and consistently challenging company leaders to cut through red tape to improve a customer’s experience. It was spurred in part from one letter from a Maryland National Bank executive about the troubles his wife had in contesting a charge that made its way to Cawley.

“The management team was called to a conference room to listen to Charlie read all of the customer service dispute letters he could get his hands on and at the end of each reading Charlie would say ‘Think of yourself as this customer. How would you feel?’ The meeting went on for several hours and continued at 7 a.m. the next morning and many mornings after that” Cochran said.

Afterward customer service was rebranded customer assistance phones were required to be answered within two rings and all paychecks were branded with the line “Brought to you by the customer.”

Weaver concurred with the customer focus and recalled a time when then-DuPont CEO Jack Krol called the company to seek a credit line increase while he was out Christmas shopping. Unsatisfied that the hotline told him it would take a few days Krol called Cawley.

“Then Charlie gets us all into a room and tells the story John just told him. So Charlie said ‘You idiots don’t seem to understand that this is a customer calling in and they want more of our product. Our product is credit. They want more of our product and you’re telling him we’ll get back to him in a few days?” Weaver said.

After that incident near-instant credit checks and approvals became the norm for MBNA and today is an industry-wide standard.

MBNA and DuPont would cross once more in the late 1990s when Krol called Weaver about the prospect of selling its Louviers property near Newark. After much negotiation – and Cawley’s unexpected demand to also acquire the neighboring DuPont-owned golf club – Weaver closed the $14 million deal creating what is today known as the Deerfield office complex and golf course.

Weaver noted that MBNA also worked to serve all of its employees with the company building a hiring program for people with cognitive disabilities after Cawley was approached by some local advocates. When they later came back to inform Cawley that the benefits package offered by the company wasn’t meeting their needs the founder demanded that leadership tailor a new package to do so.

In the end the memory of MBNA lives on beneath Delaware’s still growing banking industry but for one night it was back in the spotlight.

“I often get asked what the magic of MBNA was and the magic was its people” Weaver said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDkyMzAwNTQ1My9lbi9IYXJyaXMtV2lsbGlhbXMtQWR2aXNlcy1ESC1Vbml0ZWQtRnVlbGluZy1Tb2x1dGlvbnMtb24taXRzLVNhbGUtdG8tV2luZC1Qb2ludC1QYXJ0bmVyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harris Williams Advises D&H United Fueling Solutions on its Sale to Wind Point Partners,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.businesswire.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/home/20220923005453/en/Harris-Williams-Advises-DH-United-Fueling-Solutions-on-its-Sale-to-Wind-Point-Partners (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674008F8B0>, 'Connection to www.businesswire.com timed out.

But will it be enough?

Three years in the making the finishing touches are being put on the $20 million Second Avenue Commons which will be a no-questions-asked so-called low barrier shelter accommodating all homeless people even those with drug problems and pets.

The product of a public-private partnership spearheaded by PNC Bank the health care systems and the city and county the five-story 42000-square-foot building will provide 95 beds and 45 units of single-occupancy housing for homeless people. But while that would have addressed most of the homeless population when it was planned the need is far greater today.

""Originally when it was designed the idea was that the Second Avenue Commons would be able to meet all of the demand of the homeless but even since that time there's been an increase of the homeless and unstablely housed in our county"" said Light of Life Rescue Mission Director Jerrel Gilliam.

The city is experiencing an explosion in homelessness brought on by factors like the pandemic the end of the eviction moratorium and the opioid crisis. With an estimated 900 homeless currently in Allegheny County tent encampments line the waterfronts and existing shelters are over-capacity. Gilliam says the new Light of Life shelter on the North Side with 50 beds is now also putting 25 cots each night in its cafeteria.

""We do not see that as a long-term way to care for those who are experiencing homelessness"" Gilliam said.

Even so many of the homeless prefer their tents to shelters.

""Sometimes it feels like a jail or an institution you know what I mean?"" one person said.

Meanwhile city council members have asked Mayor Ed Gainey and County Executive Rich Fitzgerald to find an empty hotel or some other large building to temporarily house more people experiencing homelessness while they pursue the long-range solution of getting people into permanent housing.

""We see our shelter as not a permanent place but a temporary place that is safe that engages people with services so that they can move on"" Gilliam said.

The dedication ceremony will be held Thursday and the shelter is expected to be open in a few weeks.

The city and county continue to meet about developing both a short and long ranged strategy to address the homeless problem and this shelter will certainly play an intergral part."

Paz Olivares Droguett for NPR

In the middle of the desert in northern Chile massive pools of Caribbean blue water sit next to what appear to be snowdrifts.

But this is a lithium mine.

The pools are filled with salty groundwater that contains lithium. It's a key component in the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for electric cars solar panels and other green technologies.

""It's really really a beautiful place"" says Marcelo Valdebenito a public relations officer for Albemarle Corp. the Charlotte N.C.-based chemical company that operates the mine. ""This is the lithium that powers the world.""

Indeed the world is hungry for the silvery-white metal. The International Energy Agency is projecting a more than 40-fold increase in demand for lithium by 2040. Lithium prices have hit record highs this year.

Despite growing concerns about the environmental impact of lithium extraction skyrocketing demand is good news for mining companies in Chile. The South American country is the second-largest lithium producer after Australia. And Argentina Bolivia and Chile are known as the ""lithium triangle"" together holding more than half of the world's proven lithium reserves.

Annual production at the Albemarle mine has increased from 22000 tons to 84000 tons since 2016 says Ignacio Mehech the company's country manager in Chile.

""We are growing as the demand is growing and today we are a much bigger company"" Mehech told NPR adding that the company now has 1000 employees in Chile up from 250 five years ago.

South America could power up

Even so the region's lithium output is just a fraction of what it could be leading to fears of an eventual bottleneck in world supplies.

Bolivian President Luis Arce has pledged to make his country ""the world capital of lithium"" and supply 40% of global demand for the metal by 2030. But due to technological challenges and community resistance as well as heavy state intervention in the economy the industry has been slow to develop. Production in Bolivia remains negligible.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

Economic turmoil has kept Argentina from opening more mines.

Meanwhile Chile has high taxes and strict mining regulations says Mehech. The red tape for production permits involves securing approval from the nation's nuclear energy commission since the metal can be used in nuclear power and weapons.

""It is very difficult and that's why you don't see more lithium companies in Chile"" Mehech says of Albemarle which he says is one of just two companies producing lithium in Chile.

Mining raises environmental concerns

But some Chileans prefer a go-slow approach.

Left: Workers monitor the 150 precipitation pools at the Albemarle mine. Center and right: Salt a byproduct of the brine evaporation process is piled up at the Albemarle lithium mine in the Atacama Desert on Aug. 24. Paz Olivares Droguett for NPR

They include microbiologist Cristina Dorador who has spent years studying the salt flats of the Atacama Desert. She says lithium mines extract huge amounts of groundwater. Ten-times saltier than seawater this brine is then placed in enormous evaporation pools. After 18 months the resulting 6% lithium solution is then turned into a white lithium powder and exported for use in batteries.

Dorador says removing so much groundwater will inevitably make the Atacama Desert — home to Chile's lithium mines — hotter and drier. She recently co-authored an investigation linking lithium mining to an 11% reduction in the local flamingo population over the past decade.

""With so much pressure from the world to produce more lithium"" she says ""the price is going to be paid by Chile's environment.""

Why not make the batteries too?

Another critic is Andrés Díaz who directs the Center for Energy and Sustainable Development at Diego Portales University in Santiago the Chilean capital. Instead of just lithium he thinks Chile should produce and export higher-valued lithium-ion batteries that the country currently imports from Asia at a steep cost.

To move in that direction Albemarle signed an agreement with the Chilean government to spend $300 million on research and development here by 2043.

""For us it doesn't make any sense to export lithium and then buy from other countries batteries with a material that we produced at the very beginning"" Díaz says.

Evaporation pools at the Albemarle mine on Aug. 24. Paz Olivares Droguett for NPR

Mehech acknowledges that lithium mining uses a lot of groundwater but claims the tradeoff is worth it. He points out that the amount of water required to produce enough lithium for an electric car battery is about the same amount needed to produce a half pound of beef or 11 avocados.

The avocados he says will last for just a few days ""but a lithium battery lasts for 10 years and then you can recycle it.""

Since then the resort went on to welcome Gilded Age holidaymakers like the Vanderbilts Astors Pews and Rockefellers and has hosted everything from the WWII-era convalescence of a Purple Heart-decorated JFK to the post-lockdown birthday celebration of a triple Grammy-decorated Ludacris. While much has changed since the days of the stagecoach—the option to arrive by helicopter for starters—one essential element has coursed through every phase of the resort’s existence.

That element of course is water. The source long prized by local indigenous communities for its healing and life-sustaining properties is a network of mineral-rich geothermically heated underwater streams that emerge into a succession of palm-flanked pools. And thanks to a new Watsu pool Castle Hot Springs’ latest season promises the most sublime soaking ops to date.

The new Watsu pool at Castle Hot Springs. Castle Hot Springs

For the uninitiated: Watsu is a blend—both linguistic and therapeutic—of water and shiatsu a Japanese form of bodywork. In theory the therapist-led rhythmic treatment unblocks and balances energetic flow. In practice however the blissed-out state of oblivion you’ll achieve as you swirl and float through the enveloping warmth beneath the palm fronds rock walls and desert sky will leave you utterly unconcerned about what energy has moved where (and utterly unconcerned about most things to be fair).

WATCH

“It was a natural progression for the resort” says owner Mike Watts who bought the fire-scarred largely torn-down property in 2014. He unveiled its dazzling reincarnation in 2019 and has clinched every conceivable hospitality award since. “Our wellness programming is firmly rooted in the stunning nature surrounding us and the new Watsu pool is also outdoors in our geothermal spring canyon which enhances the experience.”

Thus the new Wellness through Water Package which includes an hourlong Watsu session—among other water-related experiences—over the course of a three-night minimum stay. Not that you need to book the package to experience the new spa menu’s focus on the springs: Plenty of à la carte treatments from a mineral-rich scrub to a stream-side reiki session draw on the local waters.

A Spring Bungalow. Castle Hot Springs

For that matter so does the expansive resort garden where a tasting tour is a must—if only to experience how potently (and for salt lovers divinely) the springs’ particular mineral mix can affect the flavor of certain plants. These pair perfectly with Lithium Lager the house beer crafted by Wren House Brewing Company using Castle Hot Springs water.

Of course while the springs are the uncontested star of the show there’s a lot more to experience here. Some other offerings to consider: the Crater Canyon Exploration which takes you on a guided tour through a private slot canyon; an assortment of adventure- Western- and Zen-focused packages; a partnership with hop-on semi-private jet service JSX; and sleep retreats next January and May with Dr. Rebecca Robbins a famed researcher author and instructor at Harvard Medical School. Then again you may find that in a place so inherently dreamy you won’t need the extra help.

J Randall Powers Interior Decoration is designing interiors for not only the shared spaces but also private residences for those who want a move-in-experience.

The sales office for the luxe residential tower 1661 Tanglewood echoes the Randy Powers' interior design of the building that is expected to break ground in 2023.

Simply visiting the posh sales office for the luxe 1661 Tanglewood residential high-rise provides incentive enough for one with ample resources to seriously consider staking a claim on one of the dwellings in the forthcoming development.

The 33-story residential tower rising above the live oaks at Tanglewood Boulevard and San Felipe is the project of Tanglewood Corporation the family owned business that dates back to the late 1940s when founder William Giddings Farrington began acquiring acreage in what was then uninviting prairie. Today the company and this legacy project is headed by Farrington’s grandson Kendall Miller.

“Our family’s initial inspiration to redevelop our cornerstone site at 1661 Tanglewood was not only to expand upon the foundation of the neighborhood conceived and cultivated by previous generations but also to reach new heights in the quality and character of the city we love” Kendall Miller tells PaperCity.

In the hands of renowned designer Randy Powers the sales center in Uptown Park echoes many of the sophisticated notes that are set to be at the core of the high-rise design. Tanglewood Corporation enlisted J. Randal Powers Interior Decoration to assist with design elements throughout shared spaces and within the domiciles of the high-rise too.

The 3600-square-foot sales center in a space which used to house a Ceron salon has been transformed into a tastefully lavish setting with specific room design based on that of the residential tower. One enters to find 12-foot-high ceilings rich custom millwork museum lighting and wide-plank hardwood floors all of which will be found in the residences along with La Cornue kitchen ranges European-sourced marble countertops in the kitchen fireplace mantels by Chesneys plumbing fixtures by Waterworks and Stark carpeting.

A number of the so-called “mansions in the sky” will be fully furnished by Powers for those who desire a move-in ready experience. Several of the units in the building designed by Jackson & Ryan Architects will be reserved for buyers who wish to build out their spaces independently.

Notable furnishings from the shared spaces to be carried over to the high-rise include a marble mantle by Chesneys chairs upholstered by Rose Tarlow a pair of antique consoles a pair of Alberto Giacometti floor lamps and a duo of 15th century Venetian lion figures.

“Space is the greatest luxury” Powers says in a statement “and luxury at 1661 Tanglewood begins with the stately scale of the residences which enables soaring ceilings (more than 12 feet high throughout primary living rooms) multiple fireplaces wine rooms butler pantries and bathrooms and closets of considerable size.

“These residences are as timeless warm and gracious as the finest single-family homes.”

State-of-the-art technical presentations take potential buyers on a detailed journey through the high-rise with renderings floor plans and views specific to each the 33 floors.

With an estimated $3 million spent on the sales center design one has an inkling of 1661 Tanglewood’s pricing though the firm is still working on details. In any event several of the corner units are on reserve.

Beginning on October 3 the sales center will be open by appointment only. Ruthie Porterfield and Mary Elizabeth Hahnfeld both of Martha Turner Sotheby’s International Realty are serving as directors of sales for 1661 Tanglewood.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYmV0YWtpdC5jb20vbWV0YXZlcnNlLXN0YXJ0dXAtdGVycmF6ZXJvLXNlZWtzLXRzeC12LWxpc3RpbmctdGhyb3VnaC1yZXZlcnNlLXRha2VvdmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Metaverse startup TerraZero seeks TSX-V listing through reverse takeover,"TerraZero is owned by the parent company of crypto trader Netcoins.

A portfolio company of Netcoins parent company Bigg Digital Assets is preparing to go public on the TSX-V through a reverse takeover.

TerraZero Technologies a metaverse development group has signed a letter of intent with Whatcom Capital II Corp. that would see TerraZero become publicly traded following a reverse takeover.

TerraZero wants to develop acquire and finance what it described as the metaverse’s “most promising companies entrepreneurs and developers.” The startup also said it owns digital real estate and provides offices and services within the metaverse.

Bigg which invests in crypto products and companies owns 30 percent of TerraZero.

Whatcom is a capital pool company that completed its initial public offering (IPO) on the TSX-V in 2021 going public with gross proceeds of $755000.

Founded in 2021 TerraZero has 28 employees and consultants and claims its clients include CBC Salesforce and PwC among others.

While metaverse companies aren’t common on the TSX-V TerraZero would not be the first. At least a couple of firms trade in exchange-traded funds on the TSX-V with investments in a number of markets including some in the development of the metaverse.

TerraZero founder and CEO Dan Reitzik called the company well-capitalized and revenue-producing. “I see the metaverse as simply the next version of the internet as we know it today but instead of a 2D environment it is a 3D environment providing greater engagement between brands and consumers and between people themselves” Reitzik said.

“There will soon be significant consolidation and opportunities in the metaverse and Web 3 space and TerraZero will be positioned to capitalize on these as needed” he added.

Besides TerraZero Bigg includes the Blockchain Intelligence Group Netcoins and Luxxfolio as portfolio companies. Blockchain Intelligence Group monitors risk from crypto transactions while Luxxfolio operates an industrial-scale cryptocurrency mining facility in the United States.

Netcoins is a crypto trading platform registered as a restricted dealer in Canada with the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC). Netcoins experienced a security breach in April that allegedly allowed a customer to fraudulently withdraw an estimated $1.58 million CAD.

Bigg announced in early September that it would launch an American subsidiary Netcoins USA based in Wyoming. The US subsidiary is scheduled to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2022 in four states: California Pennsylvania Michigan and Virginia. Netcoins plans to launch additional states in Q1 2023 pending approvals.

Other Canadian startups are eyeing the metaverse although not with aspirations of listing publicly. Montréal-based software startup Lighthouse Labs plans to build what it describes as “the open metaverse navigation engine” for blockchain-based virtual worlds after securing $9.1 million in seed funding in May.

The biggest player in the metaverse Meta announced in March that it plans to hire up to 2500 employees across Canada over the next five years as part of a new Canadian engineering hub. The company noted that the Toronto hub will play an important role in the creation of Meta’s metaverse. However since that announcement Meta said it would have to slow down the rate of hiring and has been making layoffs.

And as the biggest player in the metaverse Meta hasn’t been doing terrifically well. A story in Quartz noted: “Ever since Facebook became Meta things have not looked up. As Facebook user growth stalls and ad revenue slows the metaverse’s sluggish pickup with clunky hardware isn’t making up for it. Meta’s stock has halved from a year ago.”

Mark Binns Bigg’s CEO remarked: “Bigg invested in TerraZero as an early stage private company knowing that our support coupled with their leadership and vision could create a true leader in the emerging Web 3 and metaverse space.”

Photo: Shutterstock

In 1995 Barings a British merchant bank collapsed because Nick Leeson – a trader working in the bank’s Singapore office – had been speculating in shares for years without the bank’s approval.

Although Leeson’s investments initially paid off handsomely over time they accumulated considerable losses which Leeson attempted to cover with increasingly risky transactions.

When his house of cards finally hit the deck Leeson pulled the over 200-year-old bank down with him.

Leeson received a prison sentence and subsequently published a book Rogue Trader recounting the experience which was later turned into a film with the same name.

Leeson’s actions could prompt psychological musings about what fuels speculative behaviour in the financial markets and risk-related behaviour more generally (in fact Leeson studied psychology after his release).

Own versus corporate interests

Leeson’s conduct also illustrates what social theorists refer to as principal-agent problems which concern situations where a person or group of people (the principal) delegates decision-making competence to another party (the agent).

The problem arises when the agent has an incentive to act in a way that prioritises their own interests above those of the principal.

In Leeson’s case he was employed to administer the bank’s money through investments but he did so in a way that exceeded his authority in the hope of obtaining personal bonuses.

The agent failed to act in the principal’s interests and that ended up costing them both dearly.

I chose to begin with a case that is almost 30 years old because it neatly illustrates the fundamental problem between agents and principals.

Since Leeson’s downfall computer algorithms have begun gaining ground and dominating the financial markets and so it is no longer clear whether or not the agent is a person.

Before I discuss the implications of this it is relevant to dive a little deeper into classic principal-agent debates.

How do you get an agent to act in the principal’s best interests?

Principal-agent problems arise in many kinds of contexts but few are as spectacular as the Leeson example.

Originally economists Michael Jensen and William Meckling formulated the principal-agent problem as a description of the relationship between company shareholders and the management.

The management can be said to act on the shareholders’ behalf but the latter has no guarantee that the former are not putting their own interests first.

Over the years researchers have proposed various solutions for managing the basic problem of potential conflicts of interest when delegating decision-making competence so that the principal’s and agent’s behaviour align.

For example it has been suggested that the agent’s behaviour can be aligned with the principal’s by introducing special financial incentives or clear contractual frameworks.

Another suggestion highlights that to the extent that the agent’s tasks can be clearly and precisely specified the principal can more easily monitor any deviations from the agent’s authority and instructions.

From humans to all-dominating algorithms

At their core social theory discussions of and potential solutions to the principal-agent problem both revolve around the agent being seen as a person:

The principal-agent problem arises because the interests of a physical individual (or group of individuals) can conflict with those of the principal.

This perspective neatly encompasses the Barings bank example. By speculating beyond his mandate Leeson could obtain considerable personal bonuses but at significant risk to the bank.

Banks worldwide still employ large groups of individuals to invest in financial products. However in recent decades the financial markets have undergone a transformation that reveals the principal-agent problem in a new light.

Rather than people made of flesh and blood now primarily fully automated algorithms are sending buy or sell orders to stock exchanges.

Calculating the scope of these algorithms is difficult but estimates indicate that fully automated algorithms in some markets – for example some stock markets – are responsible for 99% of the total volume of orders.

How first-generation algorithms work

Financial algorithmic trading can be divided into two generations since first-generation algorithms follow strategies defined by humans whereas second-generation algorithms develop their own strategies.

The first generation of fully automated algorithms took off in earnest at the beginning of the 21st century. The hallmark of first-generation algorithmic decision-making is that humans design it from end to end.

Typically the work procedure entails a trader working with comprehensive market research and defining a potential investment strategy which is converted into computer code by a team of programmers.

The result is a classic ‘if… then…’ kind of logic with the algorithm being designed to act in a particular way under specific market conditions.

This could for example mean that the algorithm rapidly buys a stock if it spots demand for that stock is suddenly increasing – and then sells it again seconds (or microseconds) later if the price has risen.

Even tiny gains per algorithmic transaction can be attractive if thousands of them are conducted every minute – which is what many first-generation algorithms do.

Lost USD 460 million in 45 minutes

And what do these first-generation algorithms have to do with the principal-agent problem?

In some ways nothing. After all the algorithm making certain investment decisions has no will of its own or independent interests to promote. Its transactions are based solely on the instructions it is given.

Yet this form of algorithmic trading entails principal-agent problems though of a more indirect form.

Perhaps the individuals developing the algorithms are prioritising their own interests rather than those of their company (the principal).

In fact sociological studies of companies specialising in this form of algorithmic trading indicate that often they are set up so that their teams of algorithmic traders compete with each other.

Members of management have trouble keeping track of which algorithms their traders are developing and how the internal systems interact with each other – for instance they can trade with and against each other which can be both illegal and result in losses.

It is therefore hardly surprising that it can all go horribly wrong. The worst example is the American company Knight Capital which back in 2012 lost USD 460 million in just 45 minutes because its system suddenly and unexpectedly activated some old algorithms.

The company ended up being acquired by a competitor.

Algorithms now have ‘a free hand’

Since the mid-2010s an increasing number of companies have begun supplementing or entirely replacing their first-generation algorithms with a new generation of algorithms.

These second-generation algorithms are based on various forms of machine learning and are designed to develop their own investment strategies based on vast volumes of market data.

Unlike first-generation algorithms which as mentioned are designed completely and utterly by humans and where specific (teams of) individuals propose ideas for certain investment strategies with second-generation algorithms humans play a more limited role.

Naturally some individuals develop the specific machine-learning architectures and some individuals select and clean the data fed into the algorithms.

But unlike their predecessors the whole idea of second-generation algorithms is for the algorithms themselves to work out which when and how many shares and other financial products to buy and sell.

[How do you control what you do not understand?]

This semi-autonomy where algorithms make real-life investment decisions simultaneously involves a reunion with and a reconfiguration of the principal-agent problem.

In principle second-generation algorithms can teach themselves to make profitable investments in a way that is either unethical or directly illegal – and that is definitely not in line with the intentions of the individuals who developed the basic architecture in the first place.

As with the Leeson example this can incur considerable risk for the company (the principal).

From a principal-agent viewpoint the challenge is that as investment decisions are now being made by algorithms undesirable conduct cannot be regulated with conventional methods such as elaborately detailed contracts or financial incentives.

Challenges like this have sparked suggestions that such self-learning algorithms should be wrapped in a thick ‘straight jacket’ of controls that for instance limit how much they can invest.

Such control mechanisms are important but fail to address the more fundamental problem characterising the most sophisticated machine-learning architectures the so-called ‘deep neural networks’:

These can be so complex that not even the individuals who developed them can figure out why the algorithms are making specific investment decisions.

When that is the case defining the correct control mechanisms is difficult.

Time to rethink the financial markets

This also highlights the key change in the financial markets in recent decades.

Whereas Leeson’s dubious conduct could perhaps be attributed to psychological factors and constituted a principal-agent problem that could in principle have been managed with an agreement between the relevant parties second-generation algorithms cannot be understood in terms of a psychological or traditional solution based on the principal-agent theory.

Since second-generation algorithms dominate the financial markets we must rethink how these markets are understood analysed and regulated.

Here psychology steps back and data science takes centre stage.

The challenging task is now to find methods that explain how at first glance non-transparent second-generation algorithms function – specifically how they make concrete investment decisions. One branch of data science is currently working on precisely that.

Only when the internal dynamics of neural networks can be explained down to the ground will it be possible to understand and regulate real-life markets in a satisfactory manner.

The world of sports has also had its share of ruling powers and though their prominence is much shorter lived the imprint they leave on respective fan-bases keeps the flame of loyal fervor burning for generations. Regardless of athletic discipline individual or franchise one team has resoundingly usurped any other claim to that crown in recent years—Formula 1’s Mercedes-AMG Petronas.

Mercedes-Benz had early success in motorsport with its famed “Silver Arrows” race cars piercing through the competition as early as 1934 and continuing on into the 1950s. But the already storied marque’s success became truly epic when after a hiatus from competition since 1955 it once again entered the premier race series as a constructor in 2010 becoming Mercedes-AMG Petronas two years later. Since 2014 it has won every World Constructors’ Championship through last season. Sure Ferrari has garnered twice as many but it has taken 70 years to get them.

Concurrent with the team’s streak Sir Lewis Hamilton had consecutively earned the World Drivers’ Championship title up until last year when the deciding final race in Abu Dhabi concluded in controversy leaving him equal for now with Michael Schumacher in the title tally.

WATCH

The road this season though has been uncharacteristically bumpy for the three-pointed star as new regulations and specifications resulted in Silver Arrows that have not been on point. A few hours after the last qualifying session for the Italian Grand Prix in Monza Toto Wolff the team’s principal and Ola Källenius the global CEO of Mercedes-Benz sat down with Robb Report to discuss the end of last season their current expectations and what continues to drive the dynasty.

First off walk us through the decision-making process that led to not contesting the Drivers’ Championship last season.

Toto Wolff: Ola and I were 100 percent aligned in our initial reaction of “that didn’t possibly happen; we’re not going to allow this to happen.” We came together in a meeting room with the engineers and a lawyer and discussed the alternatives. The first thing you need to do is protest to appeal the result which we did. And then we looked at all angles and it became pretty clear the same evening that even if we were to win the case they would probably struggle to undo the final result. But we left our options open. It was quite a process because we realized we owed it to Lewis. It was a tough tough decision.

Ola Källenius: Whereas we felt very strongly that we were in the right were we going to unravel the whole world championship? Does that even make sense? If we try to fight them how does that reflect on us? Are we perceived as a sore loser? So we said “okay let’s just be rational about this move on and we fight next season.” It was literally four days after the race when we ultimately made the decision not to uphold the appeal.

Are you satisfied with the changes the FIA made in the aftermath?

Wolff: I think that like everything it can always improve. With any sport there will always be a team that is not happy with the referee and you just need to accept that. I think the FIA learned a lot from that. It was a controversy that was absolutely not necessary. There’s a new race director in place and a new president who is definitely a strong advocate for transparency. These are the positives.

Källenius: The FIA made a genuine effort to understand what happened and changed the structure of running the race. As Toto said in a split second a referee can misjudge the situation. In some sports like American football or now soccer the team has challenges and there’s an instant replay. You can’t do that going 180 mph which means that human judgment in Formula 1 is always going to be there. I don’t think that discussions about calls will ever ultimately go away. But the FIA did do a very genuine analysis and have attempted to improve the governance. And more often than not it works.

As seen with Abu Dhabi and this year’s Dutch Grand Prix the safety car and virtual safety car have had a major bearing on how certain races have ended. In your opinion what if anything needs to be improved with how they are implemented?

Wolff: With the VC [virtual safety car] and also the normal safety car you can be on the receiving end or you can benefit from it. Normally when in the lead of the race you don’t want it because you need to decide whether you stop for new tires and lose position or stay out with the old ones. This was the first race of the year [Dutch Grand Prix] where we were in the lead . . . and the VC comes out. Tough luck.

Källenius: I agree the concept of the virtual safety car is good. It’s a necessary tool to run a safe race and it was applied correctly in the last race. We were just unlucky because we were in the lead—that’s the bottom line.

What were the regulation changes this season that posed the greatest challenge for the team?

Wolff: The mechanical and aerodynamic basis of the car was changed. The cars generate downforce in a very different area than the years before; now they generate downforce through the floor and the regulations constrained very much what we were able to do. It was meant to mix the field up and give the smaller teams a chance to come forward but it actually didn’t change a lot. It’s still the usual suspects in the front middle and rear—except we moved out of position because we got the physics wrong. It was literally deciding on prioritization of a certain area of the car that we got wrong as a team.

How easy is that to remedy as the season progresses?

Wolff: First of all it’s a moving target. We’ve had a few moments this year where we thought “now we understand” but we didn’t. There seems to be a picture developing of where we got it profoundly wrong but it’s inherent in the car design and not something we can change during the season.

Considering the overall success of Mercedes-AMG Petronas what are key components to a winning team?

Wolff: We have the might of the Mercedes company in the background with its huge branding power that attracts the right people and retains our talent. We got Lewis Hamilton on board based on the vision Mercedes had back in the day. And then on the other side we have the flexibility in the long leash that’s been given by Ola and Mercedes to act as a midsize racing team. That combination is one of the very important contributors.

Källenius: But you still have to make it work. When Toto came on board as a partner as an investor and as our new leader of motorsports the first thing he said was that all our facilities are not where they need to be for a championship-winning team. So you have got to put in the infrastructure and that was done. He took the guys that were there assembled a couple of others and then created magic with those people. Other teams have the physical infrastructure as well but you have got to have that group of people that trust each other have the right leadership stay calm and make it happen in any situation of adversity. Those are the ingredients.

Toto what have the team’s uncharacteristic struggles this season taught you on a personal level?

Wolff: We had eight consecutive World Championships and that hasn’t been done in any other sport so we pushed the needle quite far. We knew that one day it was going to be difficult. All of these years we’ve been preaching about our values how we would react when it happens and how we would continue to empower and trust. But when you are in that situation it’s actually different.

Personally I’m actively learning to look at myself from the outside and asking if I’m staying true to what I’ve been preaching all those years. I’m very emotional and there are certain pressures the team feels with me getting involved in many areas. Every day I need to be introspective and ask myself if I’m doing the right thing here. But in the end I need to stay authentic to who I am and what I am. I will be able to write more about what happened this year than all the other eight.

Ola how does your skillset complement that of Toto’s when it comes to the team?

Källenius: In the beginning Toto reminded us that we were sitting on a sport franchise like a Champions League football club in Europe. Whereas Toto has done the heavy lifting and unearthed the value of what this team is those aspects from the corporate side whether it’s working with sponsors or creating business relationships are where I’ve been able to pitch in.

Wolff: Ola runs a multinational company but has a profound understanding of motor racing and Formula 1—he was there before I was. Sometimes when I need to make decisions and I question or doubt I have a sparring partner in Ola. And if I need a second opinion I know I’m going to get a competent answer. That’s important for me.

Do you communicate with each other during races?

Källenius: We do but try not to overdo it. The passion gets the better of me. We have one little group thread an open forum but sometimes I just send a direct message to Toto giving him unsolicited advice that he carefully chooses to ether listen to or not listen to.

Have you been surprised by George Russell’s consistency this season?

Wolff: He was a very very good kid in the Junior Formula. He won his rookie season in F4 his rookie season in F3 his rookie season in F2 and he did a brilliant job at Williams. So we knew about his talent and way of working diligently then realized very early that he can be a world champion. We are not benchmarking him for that directly this year because he’s driving a product that’s not good enough.

When it comes to identifying a rising talent what are some of the intangibles that you look for in a driver?

Wolff: You can clearly see that there is a nature thing—a genetic predisposition and cognitive ability. But it needs to be nurtured. Nature alone doesn’t work. Nurture alone doesn’t work. You have these exceptional talents that come up from time to time . . . [Editor’s note: At this point in the interview Lewis Hamilton walks in unexpectedly]. That’s an exceptional talent [gesturing to Hamilton]. Lewis we were asked what we look for in a driver at the early stage of development.

Hamilton: When you jot it down let me know.

Källenius: The first time I met Lewis was when he was 15 or 16 years old maybe even before that. I remember talking to him briefly and thinking “this guy has it.”

Hamilton: What’s important also is that it takes many people to manifest. You guys told me about that believed it was possible and created the opportunity. Obviously as an individual I was trying to manifest getting to Formula 1 and being at the top but it has taken all of us being connected. Without the support of Mercedes I would not be here today.

Wolff: Determination.

Källenius: Yes determination. Talent alone is not going to get you there.

How do you balance keeping your drivers on that competitive edge while also building camaraderie within the team?

Wolff: Fundamentally teammates are direct competitors. You need to accept that these two will sometimes have diverse objectives. If a driver is intelligent and knows about a long-term future with a team generally they can tame the lion. But there will always be situations where it comes out. You can’t expect a lion in the car and a puppy outside. This is a natural tension or pressure point that’s just part of the job.

Källenius: The first great racer to realize that he needed to beat his teammate was [Juan Manuel] Fangio. He was the first guy that came up with the concept that each driver should have his own mechanics crew as there are two competitions going on—one against everybody else and one against your teammate. That concept from 1954 or thereabout is still true today. You still have two pit crews and two race engineers totally focused on making their guy win. You have to have that tension.

How has the business model of Formula 1 teams and their perceived value changed in recent years?

Källenius: For us the brand building and strong brand messaging is still the core commercial value of what we’re doing here. But Toto had a very strong belief that this needs to be a franchise and have franchise value. I don’t think he would have invested some of his own money if he didn’t think it could yield a return. Here we are 10-plus years later and he proved it. Of course a lot happened to the sport with the growing popularity and Liberty Media’s further expansion into the US which we love. We have now put teams where they can have revenues above their costs—just a small detail if you want to run a business with a financial future. We have a double dividend now; the brand value plus a financial dividend which had been unheard of in Formula 1. It’s a game changer and Toto is one of the leaders that has pulled the whole grid with him.

Wolff: Because the sport is growing from strength to strength our top-line revenue is growing strong. And because of the cost cap that was implemented we have a stable cost base and good visibility of future profits. When McLaren or Ferrari gets a sponsorship pitch I’m actually happy about that because all of us need to grow together.

Do you think the internal combustion engine will always be a part of Formula 1?

Källenius: We talk about this a lot. There’s no doubt we need to go CO2 neutral. It’s not even a discussion. We have made a clear plan for Mercedes as a whole as has the Formula 1 team. We’ve got to decarbonize full stop. But how do you keep the speed and spectacle of the greatest racing series and go zero emission? The energy density of batteries is not yet at the point where you can do that. One day they probably will be but we don’t know when that day is. For 2026 we have decided that the relevance of the electric piece will grow and for combustion Formula 1 will be producing CO2-free fuels.

Wolff: Formula 1’s aim is to be the fastest laboratory in the world and develop a high-performance fuel that’s 100 percent sustainable and available at the pump station for your road car. If we can be pioneers in developing such a fuel and showcase it on the racetrack that is part of the energy transition. In my opinion whenever batteries are in a position where we can properly race with them Formula 1 is probably going to go electric.

Carlyle has announced a senior hire to support its growing board and advisory practice.

The executive search firm founded in 2002 has appointed Alice Deakin as its new principal bringing more than 20 years of finance commercial and leadership experience gained from working across the technology professional services media and financial services sectors.

She held the chief financial officer role at IndigoVision before going on to help run Deloitte’s CFO programme where she was a director and also led the education function at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland before establishing her own board coaching practice.

Fiona James-Martin partner at Carlyle said: “From her experience of being a CFO at a listed company to helping senior finance professionals develop towards and transition into CFO roles during her time at Deloitte Alice is a fantastic fit for both our team at Carlyle and our client base in Scotland London and beyond.

“Her insight into the intricacies of how Boards operate is particularly relevant for where Carlyle is growing.”

Deakin said: “Carlyle has built a pre-eminent position in the market working with many of the leading corporate brands across multiple industry sectors and the firm’s offering is underpinned by a strong and respected research capability.

“It’s great to be on board with continuing growth and exciting times ahead.”

Meanwhile Lucy Seligman is Carlyle’s latest addition to its research and market intelligence team taking up the role of researcher.

The firm also recently welcomed its latest graduate marking the seventh year of its graduate programme.

Duggie Carlyle founding partner at Carlyle said: “We have always had a strong focus around investing in our people which is paying dividends in the talent we are attracting and with the calibre of assignments we are securing.”

He added: “Post-Covid has been a buoyant time at the senior level with much of our portfolio growing or looking to augment their leadership teams for the future.

“Undoubtedly there are challenging times ahead but we plan to continue focusing on our clients the quality of reporting and delivery and the development of our services brand and people.”

Carlyle’s primary services are executive search board and advisory senior interim and market intelligence.

In March Carlyle’s annual salary survey in partnership with digital industry trade body ScotlandIS revealed findings on the wages of c-suite executives in high-growth technology businesses in Scotland comparing base salary and equity levels at various stages of funding.

In addition to continued activity in the financial services sector with long-term clients like Tesco Bank M&G Wealth and Hastings Direct Carlyle has seen strong demand at board level from technology and venture capital-backed businesses including xDesign Zumo Forensic Analytics and Frog Systems.

The firm has also recorded growth in the food and drink sector with leadership assignments with Baxters Macphie and the recently-completed search for new Scotland Food & Drink chief executive Iain Baxter.

Dreams and aspirations of a scholarship for a full year of higher studies were fulfilled for yet another batch of young students at Janaadhipathi Balika Vidyalaya Galle last week. At the school’s annual Diri Daru scholarship award ceremony on 7 September at the school’s auditorium a team from Hettigoda Group led by their Chairman Asoka Hettigoda presented scholarships to 30 students.



Hettigoda Group has fully sponsored more than 500 numbers of scholarships during the past 17 years. An eagerly awaited and much valued annual school event the ceremony was attended by the Principal Chandani Batagoda Primary Principal two Vice Principals staff students of the school and their parents.



Siddhalepa Diri Daru scholarship launched in 2007 evaluates the eligibility of the students in the application process for scholarships on criteria developed by a team from the Hettigoda Group. Criteria for selecting the best overall students include recognising leadership skills high achievers in examinations sports and extracurricular activities to motivate students to excel in their future studies.



Originally named Anula Devi Balika Vidyalaya the school in Galle was completely devastated in the December 2004 Tsunami and rebuilt under ‘Project Sri Lanka’ Tsunami Reconstruction Venture with an investment of Rs. 140 million. Today Janadhipathi Balika Vidyalaya is a fully equipped school with over 3000 girls.



“Our Group’s commitment towards our future generation will continue unabated in future years despite the country going through its most severe economic crisis right now negatively impacting all businesses affecting their bottom lines and their resources for CSR projects” Group Chairman Asoka Hettigoda said.



Following the early direction and commitment towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives by the Group’s Founder and late Chairman Deshabandu Ayur Dr. Victor Hettigoda (LittD) who initiated the Group’s first CSR activity during the Sri Paada season the Group continues this unbroken tradition for over 40 years and has expanded its CSR initiatives to most of the country’s leading places of worship.



School herbal garden project is another green initiatives of the group which encourage schoolchildren to grow and learn the value of indigenous plants. The annual art exhibition titled the Kekulu National Art exhibition has also grown in propensity over the years to be established as an important national program to discover and encourage young talent across schools in the outstations.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

Depending on your lease agreement it might even be required. Renters insurance is a type of insurance policy that protects your personal belongings (like your computer) in the event that it is lost stolen or damaged due to an incident in your home — such as a fire or sewage backup. You can also get extra protection for certain valuables like professional cameras jewelry fine art and more. Moreover renters insurance can also protect you in the event that a visitor gets hurt in your apartment or condo since you can sometimes be liable for this by covering their medical expenses so you don't have to take on that huge out-of-pocket cost. If something does happen to your personal property or someone gets hurt in your apartment and you get hit with their medical costs you'll need to file an insurance claim and submit any necessary documentation (i.e. photos receipts bills etc.). You'll pay your deductible and the insurance company will cover the rest. Hopefully you won't have to file a claim but if you do many insurance companies try to make the process as simple as possible so you can get paid with ease. If you aren't sure which renters insurance company would be best for you CNBC Select rounded up some of the best contenders to make the choice easier. We evaluated insurance companies based on monthly cost policy coverage and opportunities to save among others (see our methodology below).

FAQs How does renters insurance work? To sign up for renters insurance choose your desired insurance company and enroll for coverage. You'll need to choose a certain coverage amount which will depend on what kinds of liabilities and items you're looking to protect. For instance if you're looking to cover personal property you might opt for $30000 in coverage. If you're protecting your personal liability you might go for $100000 in coverage. This is the maximum amount you'd be reimbursed in the event of an incident. You'll pay a monthly premium for the policy which can cost just a few dollars but will depend on the company's rates. If you never have to file an insurance claim your monthly premium will essentially just be another monthly ""bill"" that you pay. If you do need to file a claim though you'll typically pay an upfront deductible. A deductible is a portion of the cost to replace the items that you must pay before your insurance kicks in and covers the rest. Usually the larger your monthly premium the smaller your deductible will be. So while insurance doesn't necessarily make it totally ""free"" to replace lost or damaged items or pay for personal liabilities it can significantly reduce your out-of-pocket cost. What does renters insurance cover? Renters insurance usually covers your stolen or damaged personal property bodily injuries that a visitor sustains while on your rented property water backup vandalism and damage from fires. Renters insurance can also cover high-value items like jewelry and fine art but you'll usually need to tack on extra coverage typically at a small additional cost. Renters insurance usually doesn't encompass damage from floods or power outages. It's also important to note that renters insurance protects the policyholder meaning your roommate and their belongings are not covered under your insurance unless they are added to your policy. What's the difference between renters insurance and homeowners insurance? Renters insurance is meant to provide coverage for belongings while homeowners insurance provides coverage for the actual building you live in and associated structures like a garage or shed. Homeowners insurance is also usually required when you buy your property but if you're a renter you may not always be obligated to take on a renters insurance policy. How do you file a renters insurance claim? The process for filing an insurance claim may vary slightly from one company to the next. Typically you'll need to provide photos of the damage receipts and any other documentation or proof that is related to the claim you're filing. This will help the company assess the damages. Once your claim is approved the timeline for payout will also vary from company to company.

Bottom line

Though it can often feel like another bill that you have to pay renters insurance can really come in handy if your valuables were to be stolen or damaged by circumstances beyond your control. Instead of having to foot the entire cost of replacing those items the insurance company will reimburse you once you pay your deductible amount. Hopefully you never need to file a claim but renters insurance can always provide that peace of mind of knowing that you're covered if anything were to happen.

The commission's action clears the way for the Saracen Casino Resort in Pine Bluff to contract with IGT for the multijurisdictional wide area progressive system MegaJackpots.

With the commission's approval Saracen Casino Resort will join participating casinos in Louisiana Nevada New Jersey and South Dakota an IGT official said in a letter dated Aug. 30 to Arkansas Racing Commission Director Smokey Campbell.

The racing commission's rules approved in 2019 allow the state's casinos to start wide area progressive systems said Jennifer Rushin tax division manager for the casino gaming section at the state Department of Finance and Administration.

""They are slot machines that are linked to other states' slot machines and you get the larger jackpots at the top and the vendor is responsible for the large jackpot provided it is hit here"" she said.

Saracen Casino Resort plans to ""bring in primarily the Wheel of Fortune product which is far and away the most popular product"" said Carlton Saffa chief market officer for Saracen Casino Resort. The IGT platform is considered to be the industry standard he said.

""We will begin to tell Arkansas as soon as we can get the machines in assuming you all approve this that our machines quite literally will be linked to the Las Vegas strip"" he told the racing commission. ""That's what Amendment 100 [to the Arkansas Constitution] has allowed us to do.""

Afterward Saffa said he's confident the casino's machines will be linked to the slot machines on the Las Vegas strip by the end of this year.

System links will be installed to the Money Mania game which has a primary reset amount of $100000 and three separate Wheel of Fortune games with primary reset amounts of $200000 $500000 and $1 million respectively an IGT official said in a letter to Campbell. The games range from a penny-based game to a $5 game.

Afterward Saffa said the largest jackpot paid at Saracen Casino Resort is $132000.

The largest jackpot paid at Southland Casino Racing is $131000 said Glen White a spokesman for Southland's parent company New York-based Delaware North.

""We haven't made a decision on No. 1"" he said referring to a question about whether Southland plans to contract with a company that offers multi-state progressive jackpot games on slot machines.

A spokesperson for Oaklawn Racing and Gaming didn't respond by early Thursday night to questions about the largest jackpot paid by Oaklawn and whether Oaklawn plans to contract with a company that offers multi-state progressive games on slot machines.

Amendment 100 to the Arkansas Constitution -- approved by voters in November 2018 -- authorizes the state Racing Commission to issue four casino licenses.

The licenses are authorized for expanding gambling operations at Oaklawn Racing and Gaming in Hot Springs and Southland Casino Racing in West Memphis and for casinos in Jefferson and Pope counties with the endorsement of local officials.

Casinos are currently operating in Hot Springs Pine Bluff and West Memphis.

Last November the Pope County casino license was handed to Cherokee Nation Businesses to build Legends Resort & Casino after the Arkansas Racing Commission ruled to nullify the license previously awarded to Gulfside Casino Partnership. The Pope County casino license has long been a source of turmoil for the county and the state resulting in numerous court cases. On July 11 the Russellville Planning Commission approved the proposed project.

In August Secretary of State John Thurston said the Fair Play for Arkansas 2022 committee failed to submit sufficient signatures of registered voters to qualify its proposed constitutional amendment aimed at removing Pope County as a state-licensed casino site for the Nov. 8 general election ballot.

One of the two requirements to qualify a ballot measure for the ballot is the secretary of state's certification that the sponsor submitted the required number of valid signatures of registered voters on a petition. The other requirement to qualify a ballot measure for the ballot is that the state Board of Election Commissioners must certify a proposed ballot measure's popular name and ballot title under state law.

In August the state Board of Election Commissioners declined to certify the popular name and ballot title for the Fair Play for Arkansas 2022 proposed constitutional amendment. The board approved a motion by board member Bilenda Harris-Ritter not to certify the ballot title for the proposed ballot measure because it didn't refer to the existing casino license in Pope County and is misleading.

According to a new Bloomberg report however major steps have been taken to improve the studio's 'frat-boy culture' resulting improved working conditions for its staff.

The report states that Rockstar has ""attempted to reinvent itself as a more progressive and compassionate workplace"" a claim based upon interviews with ""more than 20 people"" who either worked or still work at the company. ""The transformation of Rockstar includes changes to scheduling converting contractors to full-time employees and the ouster of several managers that employees saw as abusive or difficult to work with"" writes Bloomberg's Jason Schreier.

More specific changes to Rockstar's work culture include ""new mental health and leave benefits"" and a new policy referred to as ""flexitime"" which ""allows staff to immediately take time off for every extra hour they work."" Rockstar's management has also apparently promised that development of Grand Theft Auto 6 will not requires ""excessive overtime"" (which it's important to stress is not the same as no overtime whatsoever).

Not every alteration has necessarily been for the better. One of the key purported changes at Rockstar is a ""new management structure"" implemented after the departure of design director Imran Sarwar who ""was accused by several employees of bullying and abuse"". But Sarwar was replaced by three other directors which the report says led to a ""too many cooks"" situation that resulted in contradictory decisions being made about GTA 6's design. Similarly Rockstar has added more producers to the project a move that has been received positively but ""has also caused bottlenecks"".

There is also apparently little pressure to finish GTA 6 as GTA 5 is still selling copies by the bucketload and GTA Online remains extremely profitable. This has led to some conflict and even resignations with a group of Edinburgh-based developers allegedly ""telling colleagues they were sick of the lack of progress."" Other employees however are reportedly ""content"" with the more relaxed approach to development.

This latest report into Rockstar's changing culture tracks with previous investigations into the studio's attempts to reinvent itself. The big question is whether or not these changes will stick when the company commits to a firm release date for GTA 6.

At a ceremony filled with music and an ongoing art installation by student Ana Monteiro which honored the history of the site as the original home of Native Americans and the 19th-century Halsey Street Episcopal Church the facility was hailed as a marriage of form and function.

“This building perfectly exemplifies the seamless relationship between physical infrastructure and social infrastructure. It demonstrates how much space and place can invite intellectual and cultural and social interaction. You build it and they will come—and make a difference in the world"" said Rutgers-Newark Chancellor Nancy Cantor. “We wanted to make this a meeting place a center of innovation dialogue debate and collaborative learning.”

She reminded students at the event that the HLLC was created for them and their dreams of building a more equitable world. “You make real what it means to celebrate the lived experiences of our students the next generation of changemakers doubling down on social justice’’ she said.

Created in 2015 the Rutgers-Newark HLLC is an intergenerational learning and residential community that enrolls scholars ranging in age from 18 to 60. They encompass a diversity of experiences including first-generation college students transfer students and those who are parents. Half are from the city of Newark. The program has been recognized nationally for reimagining honors programs including the use of an in-depth holistic admissions process to identify exceptional students.

The 320000-square-foot HLLC building located on New Street can house 390 students and includes a range of learning and meeting areas designed to foster conversation. The Global Piazza between Halsey and Washington Streets features a variety of illuminated words in 20 languages and is open to the public. It will be bordered by street-level shops eateries gallery space and facilities to support urban entrepreneurship.

At the ceremony Rutgers University President Jonathan Holloway praised the HLLC as the embodiment of American ideals. “It speaks to what drew me to Rutgers. It represents the democratic possibilities of this country a place that draws together people from different races ethnicities economic situations neighborhoods and communities and exposes them to life changing opportunities.’’

He added “Excellence can be found everywhere. We just need to look for it find it and nurture it. We know from looking around this room that seeking and cultivating talent produces amazing results.’’

HLLC Dean Timothy Eatman extolled the importance of diversity. “The notion of diversity swirls within this place and we will make sure that these scholars don’t forget it’’ he promised.

He noted that one goal of the HLLC was to ensure that it is replicated beyond the city a process that is underway as other schools in the U.S. have shown interest in incorporating aspects of the program. He quoted the chancellor. “She said it was insufficient for it to just be in Newark.’’

Two HLLC students and a graduate also spoke at the event.

Spoken word artist Sherish Taqueen described the HLLC as a catalyst for creativity and intellectual excitement. “It encouraged every idea and soon the ideas began to overflow’’ she said. “The journey you begin here is one that is endless.’’

Veronica Torres a Criminal Justice major described a sense of belonging and security. “I have never been so supported in a space as I am in this building.’’

Graduate Ty-Lynn Johnson a Rutgers Business School alumnus and now an investment analyst at Black Rock said support from his HLLC network helped him overcome self-doubt and seize opportunity. As he struggled against “imposter syndrome’’ an HLLC friend encouraged him. “He said ‘you need to be in that seat because if you’re not more of you will never get in that seat.’’’

In addition to the speakers there were musical performances by a drum group led by Timothy Ogunbiyi and Melaine R. Hill an assistant professor of American Literature in the Department of English and nationally renowned gospel violinist. Vincent Mann Turtle Clan Chief of the Ramapough Lenape Nation gave a “land acknowledgement’’ to open the ceremony. Shane Harris Prudential Financial vice president for social responsibility and president of the Prudential Foundation also gave remarks highlighting their gift to the HLLC to create the Prudential Scholars Program as a signature investment made in the future of Newark.

The Prudential Scholars Program is supported through a $10 million gift to the Pro-Social Entrepreneurship Pathway an HLLC academic program that includes the Urban Solutions Lab where students explore ways to remake urban America with a special focus on efforts within Newark. The lab is also supported by the PSE&G Foundation. The Science Technology Engineering Arts and Math (STEAM) Pathway an additional program supported by the PSE&G Foundation provides opportunities to integrate science across disciplines.

The Price Humanities Scholarship Program created with funding from the Mellon Foundation fosters the next generation of humanities scholars. The Rutgers-Newark BOLD Women’s Leadership Network launched with support from the Helen Gurley Brown Foundation helps women HLLC scholars develop leadership skills and pursue career objectives.

Also supporting academic programs within the HLLC space is Fiserv Inc. which is funding the Fiserv-RU-N Program for Inclusive Innovation an effort that will serve as a research and incubation space for the RU-N community and local businesses in addition to providing RU-N student scholarships. The program center is located on the ground floor of the HLLC building bordered by the piazza.

As part of the establishment the firm said it had appoint four non-executive directors to the board of the Dale Managing Agency.

The firm said that the new members are John Hastings-Bass chair of the board; Heather McKinlay chair of the audit committee; Alan Grant chair of the risk committee; and John Hume.

Duncan Dale chief executive of DPL said: “This is fantastic news and a major milestone in the development of Dale Underwriting Partners” said. “It has always been our long-term goal to establish our own managing agency to give us the independence and accountability for the strategy execution and governance of the business. Naturally I would like to thank our amazing team. Their hard work dedication and resilience have brought us to this point.”

He added: “This is a tremendous endorsement of our team and to supplement the 50 managing agents currently managing live syndicates in the Lloyd’s market is an honour and privilege. I would like to thank all of the team at Asta for their tremendous support for the past nine years. This has paved the way for us to take the next step in the evolution of our business at Lloyd’s. We are also extremely grateful for the hard work and commitment to making this happen by the teams in Lloyd’s the PRA and FCA and look forward to working with them into the future.”

It was just over a year ago when the firm was given ‘in-principle’ to establish its own managing agency. Back then Lloyd’s gave approval and it was left for the firm to approach the FCA and the PRA for their assent. DPL is the holding company of Dale Underwriting Partners which began trading with effect from 1 January 2014 with the creation of Lloyd’s Syndicate 1729.

Since then the business has grown significantly and in 2021 DUP announced a new joint venture Dale DUAL MGU Limited with capacity provided by Aviva for property insurance.

Also joining the Dale Managing Agency will be Duncan Dale; Dominic Peters active underwriter; and Carol McCarthy (finance director).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tZi9hbmFseXNpcy9uZm8tcmV2aWV3LWljaWNpLXBydWRlbnRpYWwtbmlmdHk1MC1lcXVhbC13ZWlnaHQtaW5kZXgtZnVuZC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NDM5NDQzOS5jbXPSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL21mL2FuYWx5c2lzL25mby1yZXZpZXctaWNpY2ktcHJ1ZGVudGlhbC1uaWZ0eTUwLWVxdWFsLXdlaWdodC1pbmRleC1mdW5kL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NDM5NDQzOS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NFO Review: ICICI Prudential Nifty50 Equal Weight Index Fund,"Scheme name

ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund has launched ICICI Prudential Nifty50 Equal Weight Index Fund which will invest in constituents of Nifty50 Equal Weight Index. The fund will be managed by Kayzad Eghlim and Nishit Patel The NFO will close for subscription on September 28.This is not the first scheme to replicate the Nifty 50 Equal Weight Index. Currently there are three other similar schemes that track the same index: DSP Nifty50 Equal Weight Index fund ABSL Nifty50 Equal Weight Index Fund and HDFC Nifty50 Equal Weight Index Fund. Among them DSP Nifty50 Equal Weight Index Fund is the oldest scheme with 20.52% returns in three years.An equal weight index has empirically higher dividend yield a more diversified portfolio and can offer relatively better returns over a longer period of time.Nifty50 Equal Weight Index represents an alternative weighting strategy which is relative to market capitalization weighted- Nifty 50 Index. The weightage of constituents in the index are aligned equally at every rebalancing/ reconstituting date. Index is re-balanced on a quarterly basis and reconstituted on a semi-annual basis.Nifty 50 equal weight index concentrates on sectors like financial services automobile and automotive components FMCG healthcare and IT. According to the fund house an investor who wants to earn higher returns and meet long term financial goals should consider investing in this scheme.“Since indices perform differently under variable market conditions it is prudent to diversify across indices with different weightage methodology. Nifty50 Equal Weight Index is less concentrated in the top 5 sectors as compared to the Nifty 50 Index thus providing an excellent diversification opportunity. Also there is no size bias as the index tries to reduce the impact of bigger companies on the index performance” says Chintan Haria Head- Product Development & Strategy ICICI Prudential AMC.We have always advised investors to not invest in new fund offers until they are offering something unique or something that is not available in the market. As said earlier there already are three schemes tracking the Nifty Equal Weight Index.“Long term or equity investors who want to take lesser risks should go for the equal weight index fund. It will give them decent returns over a period of time. All companies in the equal weight index are assigned equal weightage as compared to Nifty50. The equal weight reduces the risk which makes them a good pick for the conservative investors” says Palaniappan Chokkalingam Director Prakala Wealth Management.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbW9uZXkvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS90d28tNS1zdGFyLXJhdGVkLWJsdWVjaGlwLWZ1bmRzLWZhaWxlZC10by1iZWF0LWJlbmNobWFyay1yZXR1cm5zLWluLTUteWVhcnMtMTE2NjM5NDEzNzk0NzYuaHRtbNIBkwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbW9uZXkvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS90d28tNS1zdGFyLXJhdGVkLWJsdWVjaGlwLWZ1bmRzLWZhaWxlZC10by1iZWF0LWJlbmNobWFyay1yZXR1cm5zLWluLTUteWVhcnMvYW1wLTExNjYzOTQxMzc5NDc2Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two 5-star rated bluechip funds failed to beat benchmark returns in 5 years | Mint,"Blue chip funds invest in the equity securities of large-cap firms.

PUBLIC servants are expected to receive a three per cent pay increment by December as part of a deal reached in 2016 to award them increments every three years.

Department of Personnel Management (DPM) secretary Taies Sansan said they were now working with the Finance and Treasury departments to ensure that all 129000 public servants received the adjustments to their pay and allowance by the end of the year.

The Government had allocated K42 million in the Supplementary Budget approved in Parliament for the public servants’ pay rise.

“The increment also comes with the agreement for the DPM to continue the public servants’ medical and life insurance scheme” Sansan said.

The DPM yesterday signed an agreement with the Public Employees Association (PEA) for the increment on salaries and allowances from 2022 to 2024.

Sansan said the PEA sought a 7.5 per cent increment in 2019 which the Government did not respond favourably to in 2020 and 2021 because of the impact of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) on the economy.

“This resulted in the PEA lodging the claims to the Industrial Registrar in November 2021 as a disputed matter for registration purposes to the Public Service Conciliation and Arbitration tribunal” she said.

“The tribunal through all parties took into account the State’s affordability and awarded the three per cent of general salary increase in February 2022.”

Sansan thanked the PEA for accepting the Government’s financial position and accepting the three per cent increment.

“The prudential 7.5 per cent general wage increment was reduced by more than half to three per cent for the period 2017 to 2019 that has been fully implemented by the Government” she said.

PEA acting president Brett Philip urged public servants to be productive and efficient in their duties.

He told public servants that their trade union was a responsible one which “understands the economy the Covid-19 pandemic and the Special General Order No. 11 of 2019 that delayed their efforts to have the agreement signed sooner.

The three per cent pay increment was a three-year award agreed to by the Government in 2016.

The last increment was paid in 2019."

Launched in 2019 by The Globe and Mail the Canada’s Top Growing Companies program ranks participating private and public Canadian businesses on three-year revenue growth. This is a voluntary program. We accepted entries from businesses through to May 2022.

Applicant companies had to submit a ballot complete a full application survey and supply supporting financial documentation to our research team for both 2018 and 2021. We evaluated companies based on the most recent fiscal year for which financial statements were available. In some cases companies were evaluated on calendar years instead of fiscal.

In order to qualify a company had to have at least $2 million in annual sales in its most recent fiscal year. Companies had to be for-profit Canadian-run headquartered in Canada and independent.

When cable provider Cogeco Communications Inc. CCA-T launched in Portugal in 2006 the company hailed it as a pivotal move for its expansion into European markets. But six years later it sold the division at a steep loss.

The lessons of that failed foray into a new market have not been forgotten at the Montreal-based company which is taking a far different approach with its ambitious U.S. expansion plan. Less than a decade after entering that market earnings from its U.S. business represent 50 per cent of the company’s total revenue and Cogeco has become the eighth-largest cable provider in the country.

“We are growing our coverage or our footprint every year” said Cogeco chief executive Philippe Jetté in an interview with The Globe and Mail. “There’s a lot of activity there.”

Analysts were skeptical when the company launched its U.S. strategy – understandably so after Portugal and less-than-successful business lines such as data centres. But they and investors are coming around as U.S. growth escalates and as Cogeco plots its move into wireless services.

Step into the ring: Mirko Bibic has a plan to fix Canadian telecom

Canadian telecoms agree to provide services to competitors’ customers during outages

Historically Cogeco’s main business line has been cable connections in Quebec and Ontario. But a decade ago most of Canada was covered by at least one incumbent and all cable licences had been allocated Mr. Jetté said. “There were limited areas we could go to.”

During the 1970s and 80s several large Canadian telecoms built out their cable networks and quickly reached most major markets he said. In the U.S. such widespread development by major players never happened to the same degree leaving many suburban and rural areas serviced by small community-based operators.

Through a series of five cable-company acquisitions – bookended by its 2012 purchase of Atlantic Broadband for US$1.36-billion and its 2021 takeover of WideOpenWest Inc. (WOW!) for US$1.13-billion – Cogeco expanded its operating zone to 12 states spanning the eastern seaboard from Maine to Florida. After its acquisition of WOW! Cogeco rebranded its U.S. operations under the name Breezeline.

For its past quarter ended May 31 Cogeco reported revenue from its U.S. broadband services of $366-million a 35-per-cent increase year over year. Revenue from Canadian broadband services meanwhile was up 2.5 per cent year over year at $362-million. Cogeco will report its fourth quarter earnings at the end of October.

“We view Cogeco Communications’ current network expansion and rebranding initiatives as laying a crucial foundation for future growth” Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce analyst Stephanie Price said in June. She added that the company’s exposure to less-densely populated areas in both Canada and the U.S. deserves “credit not recognized by the market.”

When Cogeco first announced its new direction recognition was even sparser.

The purchase of its Portuguese cable enterprise Cabovisão – Televisão por Cabo S.A. in 2006 for $660-million immediately faced widespread disapproval sparking worries that reconstructing the business would sidetrack executives and become a drag on earnings. The day the acquisition was announced Cogeco shares dropped 17 per cent. Then the global recession and subsequent European debt crisis slashed household spending and competition became fierce. In February 2012 Cogeco sold the subsidiary to a European telecommunications company for just $59.3-million.

Meanwhile shareholders were warily watching as Cogeco poured capital into another venture: data centres. Between 2009 and 2019 it acquired several enterprise data-service businesses highlighted by its $526-million acquisition of Peer 1 Network Enterprises a Canadian internet-infrastructure provider.

But the company faced increasing competition from the likes of Amazon AMZN-Q and Google GOOGL-Q. Analysts questioned how quickly Cogeco’s further investments – including a $100-million facility in Montreal – would turn a profit. In a 2019 move that one analyst called “inevitable” Cogeco sold its data centre holdings to a U.S. investment bank for $720-million.

Yet the company’s executives remain confident that there is still an upside for the company in the U.S – so confident that in 2020 Cogeco shot down a US$7.8-billion cash takeover offer from Rogers Communications Inc. RCI-B-T and U.S. partner Altice USA ATUS-N. The company has a dual-class share structure giving the Audet family control over the takeover bid decision.

While analysts are positive about Cogeco’s long-term outlook some have expressed concerns about shorter-term threats such as fixed wireless an alternative to broadband internet.

Over the past year with growing accessibility to 5G networks mobile providers have used excess spectrum capacity to aggressively build out fixed wireless services in less populated areas; in the first quarter of 2022 they represented 51 per cent of all new internet hookups according to CIBC data. Fixed wireless connects devices to the internet via an antenna which receives signals from a tower rather than an underground cable.

While the internet connection is typically slower and less reliable fixed wireless does not require a cable or fibre coming into the home and therefore is a good option where it is expensive to put down cables – historically Cogeco’s main markets.

Mr. Jetté said he does not believe the technology is a threat calling it a “transition phase” for the industry and adding that its network capacity will soon be used up. So far fixed wireless has little overlap with Cogeco’s territory.

The company’s customer base is also being affected by inflationary pressures forcing the low-end segment to cut spending and services according to Bank of Nova Scotia analyst Maher Yaghi. “While the stock has few catalysts in the short term we believe [Cogeco] has to be looked at from a long-term perspective” he said.

However the company could benefit from public funding in the U.S. for rural expansion as it has in Canada (last year Cogeco received more than $200-million from the federal and Quebec governments to build out its rural network). The U.S. government is set to release US$43-billion through the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program a portion of which Cogeco could receive to build out its network.

Yet the company’s direction in Canada stands to change in the next few years. Cogeco is also looking at an opportunity to roll out a mobile-phone service which would allow it to offer more complete product bundles.

The CRTC is currently determining the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) framework which determines the price resellers must pay to access incumbents’ networks.

Until now companies have been required to make private deals with Rogers Bell BCE-T and Telus T-T which own the networks and Cogeco has not yet signed such an agreement.

“We are asking for reasonable rates” Mr. Jetté said. “High enough that the party that leases is incentivized to build their own network not to lease forever but low enough to support competition and affordability through the price for consumers.”"

They could do even more for climate mitigation,"For more than 200 years Maine's North Woods in excess of 10 million acres have supported a timber-based economy along with wildlife and outdoor recreation.

This is the largest undeveloped forest east of the Mississippi River and it's almost entirely privately owned which makes it vulnerable to fragmentation and development.

But there's something else these woods could provide for the future: climate mitigation along with a robust rural economy.

This story is part of our series "" Climate Driven: A deep dive into Maine's response one county at a time .""

At a state-of-the-art sawmill in Portage the Maine Woods Company a division of Seven Islands employs about 50 people and is the largest producer of hardwood maple lumber in the northeast. Every log is graded for its value inventoried and stripped of its bark. And every part of the wood is used.

""The grade lumber will be made into strip flooring"" said general manager Scott Ferland. ""And on the higher end of things will be quality kitchen cabinets crown moldings and high end furniture.""

Kris Bridges / for Maine Public With more than 800000 acres Seven Islands is one of the largest landowners in Maine. And for decades the family-owned company has been independently certified in ""sustainable forestry"" a management strategy that considers biodiversity water soil and other factors before deciding which trees should be cut and which should be left to grow.

Across the street Seven Islands also operates a wood chip mill that processes about 350000 tons of wood chips a year. The chips are a byproduct of the lower-quality trees that are removed from the forest. Most of it goes to the pulp and paper industry. Some is also used for heating.

""As you remove the wood you're actually improving growing conditions"" said Dan Lamontagne president and CEO of Seven Islands. ""So having markets for low-quality wood is really critical.""

With more than 800000 acres Seven Islands is one of the largest landowners in Maine. And for decades the family-owned company has been independently certified in ""sustainable forestry"" a management strategy that considers biodiversity water soil and other factors before deciding which trees should be cut and which should be left to grow.

And that's where the practice of pre-commercial thinning comes in. It's similar in concept to weeding a garden.

""What we really do is come in and try to help nature out and we thin that stand out. And by managing that density we're able to concentrate the growth onto the residual trees"" Lamontagne said. ""So you grow trees larger faster and in essence you're also storing more carbon in those trees as a result.""

Through photosynthesis trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their trunks at different rates depending on the average age and number of trees in a stand. But they also release it when they're cut down decay or are burned.

Allowing them to get bigger and older before they're harvested is considered ""climate smart.""

According to the Maine governor's Forest Carbon Task Force the North Woods already remove at least 60% of the state's annual carbon emissions through photosynthesis. But the figure gets larger when the storage of carbon in forest products such as building and shipping materials and furniture are added to the mix. Then it's 75%.

Research from the New England Forestry Foundation suggests there is the potential to sequester and store even more with improved forest management conservation and expanded markets for wood. But Alec Giffen a forest scientist with NEFF said the challenge for landowners is that it takes up-front investments to do timber stand improvements and that investment isn't recovered until trees are harvested several decades later.

""Landowners need to have incentives that are going to enable them to do these practices more broadly than what is currently possible"" Giffen said. ""And this is where carbon can be a game changer because in the past all landowners get paid for is wood.""

Kris Bridges / for Maine Public Research from the New England Forestry Foundation suggests there is the potential to sequester and store even more with improved forest management conservation and expanded markets for wood.

Giffen who serves on Maine's Climate Council and is a former director of the Maine Forest Service said the time has come to start paying landowners for the public benefits they provide: wildlife habitat outdoor recreational opportunities and storage of carbon.

""And we've done an analysis"" he said. ""If we increase the stocking to what our standards suggest would be optimum which is about 25 cords per acre the amount of additional carbon that would be stored...is over 500 million metric tons of CO2.""

Giffen says that's the equivalent of taking 1 million cars off the road for over a century and he thinks the potential for the New England region is huge — about 30% of the carbon savings needed in the next 30 years.

The research is currently being peer-reviewed. But Dr. William Moomaw a climate scientist and professor at Tufts University is skeptical that significant carbon savings can be achieved so quickly in a forest that is continually harvested.

""I don't see how this beats the climate goals that have been set for example by the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report"" Moomaw said.

That report called for setting aside 30-50% of lands waters and oceans in order to have a functioning climate system around the world. It also warned that reducing carbon emissions through renewable energy won't be enough to head off the worst effects of climate change. Carbon removal will also be needed.

""So I just think we need to make some decisions you know? Which are the forests that are going to be our production forests and which are the forests that are going to be our other service forests that are going to provide us with carbon removal water quality and quantity and then all of the other recreational benefits?"" Moomaw said.

Andrea Colnes deputy director of the New England Forestry Foundation said the question is not whether or not we can lock up our forests and put them away.

Kris Bridges / for Maine Public At a state-of-the-art sawmill in Portage the Maine Woods Company a division of Seven Islands employs about 50 people and is the largest producer of hardwood maple lumber in the northeast. Every log is graded for its value inventoried and stripped of its bark.

""Because that's not how society works and that's not how people live"" she said. ""We live in houses. We use paper. We need to find ways much as Seven Islands is demonstrating... in how we manage our forests so we can deliver on ecological values as well as climate values.""

When it comes to climate there is also concern from within the forest products industry about promising too much. Patrick Strauch executive director of the Maine Forest Products Council and a member of the Maine Climate Council said mills and loggers need to be supplied with enough fiber to maintain their livelihoods. He says the Maine woods are already doing a good job sequestering and storing carbon.

""I want to make sure we don't have unrealistic expectations about how much more we contribute to that effort"" Strauch said.

The New England Forestry Foundation will have the chance to demonstrate how both can be done.

Recently NEFF and more than 20 partners were awarded a $30 million grant by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a climate commodities pilot project on 100000 acres. Andrea Colnes said that funding combined with money in the Inflation Reduction Act should help accelerate climate smart forest management.

An ambitious law that promises to accelerate the state’s clean energy transition CEJA provides a detailed framework for greater utility transparency and accountability to update electricity distribution infrastructure to ensure a clean energy future.

Distribution grids have always played a critical role providing the power commercial and residential customers need day in and day out. But the distribution system will be even more important when making a rapid clean energy transition particularly considering the role distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar battery storage and electric vehicles can play in helping Illinoisans dump fossil fuels. Utilities will have to connect these resources to the distribution grid with additional transparency and oversight.

Given the exponential growth of utility distribution grid investments regulators and stakeholders also will require an open distribution grid planning process. The most recent data from the US Energy Information Administration shows that major US utilities invested nearly $60 billion in 2019 an increase of 6 percent from 2018 and 64 percent from 2000.

Illinois utilities contributed to that trend. According to the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) Ameren’s distribution grid expenditures nearly doubled between 2012 and 2020 jumping from $456 million to $857 million. Over the same period ComEd grid investments went from $1.3 billion to $2.2 billion.

Utilities must submit their plans by January 2023 and will have to provide details about how they will invest in the distribution grid infrastructure for the next five years. The ICC will review the plans and issue a decision by end of 2023. Thanks to the CEJA law however there are now opportunities for stakeholder involvement in utility distribution grid decisions.

Starting with stakeholders

Indeed CEJA spelled out a distribution grid planning process that starts with stakeholders which include utilities community organizations and businesses. As a result the ICC held 15 workshops from December 2021 through to May 2022 for stakeholders to share their perspectives and discuss the distribution grid’s role in accommodating clean distributed energy resources. They also reviewed cost-benefit analyses and debated how they should be used when determining the best investments.

Consensus was not the goal but the ICC facilitator report indicated there was mutual agreement on the need for transparency and public education about the grid planning process as well as on the importance of continued stakeholder collaboration.

Utilities have a clear to-do list

Following the series of workshops the ICC asked Ameren and ComEd to submit their multi-year integrated distribution plans. Called an “initiating order” the ICC request provided the utilities a to-do list that includes:

Following the ICC-required process to develop the plan including stakeholder engagement.

Defining the distribution system’s operational characteristics including detailed information about distributed energy resources such as type (solar wind storage) size and location.

Providing information about outage frequency and duration.

Providing investment information from the previous five years and estimates for the following five years. The utilities must include information about their investments to connect distributed energy resources as well as about any charges they made developers and customers pay to connect distributed energy to the grid.

During the workshops stakeholders made recommendations for what the ICC should add to its list of requirements in its initiating orders. The Environmental Law and Policy Center for example asked the commission to incorporate requirements based on its experience in Colorado and Minnesota which include asking utilities to address such issues as affordability grid innovation pilot projects and the use of state policy and high-growth scenarios in forecasts for distributed energy resource adoption.

To enable additional opportunities for collaboration and stakeholder input Ameren and ComEd have been hosting meetings to discuss relevant issues including distributed energy resources and how the grid can best accommodate new technologies.

The two utilities must now prepare their plans to meet heightened expectations for reliability resilience and affordability and enable a clean energy future. I expect them to consider the value clean distributed energy resources can bring to the grid and their Illinois customers. Another crucial aspect will be how their plans will meet CEJA’s requirement to deliver 40 percent of the benefits to environmental justice communities and neighborhoods where residents historically have been excluded from economic opportunities defined by CEJA as equity investment eligible communities.

The Union of Concerned Scientists will be working with our coalition partners to ensure the utilities’ plans are ambitious and help advance Illinois’ clean energy transition."

Hurricane Fiona is now heading toward Bermuda and then eastern Canada as a major hurricane with winds of up to 130 miles per hour (215 kilometers per hour). The storm has killed at least eight people.

Fiona hit Puerto Rico five years after Hurricane Maria knocked out all power on the island in 2017.

Poweroutages.com which estimates power outages based on utility data said 1.033 million customers were without service early Thursday based on what it called limited information available from LUMA Energy which operates Puerto Rico’s grid.

There were roughly 1.168 million without power early Wednesday out of 1.468 million total customers according to Poweroutages.com.

That pace of restoration is much faster than after Maria when almost all 1.5 million customers had no power for a week when the now bankrupt Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) was still operating the grid.

It took PREPA about 11 months to restore power to all customers but Maria was a much more powerful storm than Fiona.

Maria hit Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 155 mph while Fiona hit as a Category 1 storm with winds of 85 mph.

LUMA Energy said late Wednesday that it had restored service to nearly 376000 customers. LUMA has said “full restoration could take several days.”

LUMA is a joint venture owned by units of Canadian energy firm ATCO Ltd (50%) and U.S. energy contractor Quanta Services Inc (50%).

PREPA still owns much of Puerto Rico’s power infrastructure. LUMA won a contract to operate the grid in 2020 and started managing that system in 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FtZXJpY2FzL21lZGljYWwtZGV2aWNlLW1ha2Vycy1zZWUtbGl0dGxlLWltcGFjdC1maW9uYS1wdWVydG8tcmljby1vcGVyYXRpb25zLTIwMjItMDktMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medical device makers see little impact from Fiona on Puerto Rico operations,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/medical-device-makers-see-little-impact-fiona-puerto-rico-operations-2022-09-23/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FtZXJpY2FzL21lZGljYWwtZGV2aWNlLW1ha2Vycy1zZWUtbGl0dGxlLWltcGFjdC1maW9uYS1wdWVydG8tcmljby1vcGVyYXRpb25zLTIwMjItMDktMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Providing its Snapdragon Digital Chassis to the automotive industry has been a major driver of Qualcomm expanding its total addressable market to $700 billion by the end of the decade. Just two months ago the company counted its automotive design win pipeline at $19 billion. This week at an Automotive Investor Day event in New York City the company updated that design win figure to $30 billion.

CEO Cristiano Amon contextualized Qualcomm’s automotive growth as part of a unified technology roadmap predicated on three pillars: “You need to be always connected to the cloud 100% of the time. You have a new architecture for computing at the edge which is about heterogeneous and efficient computing…And the ability to scale artificial intelligence at the edge.”

Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Digital Chassis comprises technologies for digital cockpits car-to-cloud connectivity an auto connectivity platform and an ADAS/autonomous driving platform. “The opportunity is very significant in auto” Amon said. “We’re not just a modem company; we’re not just an RF company; we’re not just a CPU or GPU company…We have all of them.”

Specific to the automotive end market Amon called out that digitalization is “happening at [an] unprecedented pace” driven by trends around intelligent transportation systems new vehicle architectures the transition to electrification connectivity automated driving and perhaps the most fundamental change the transition of cars into platforms for new service delivery that changes the way auto sellers relate to customers. For more on that evolving dynamic check out coverage of this conversation between Qualcomm SVP and GM of Automotive Nakul Duggal and Stellantis Chief Technology Officer Ned Curic.

Back to the Automotive Investor Day event Qualcomm announced it’s working with Mercedes-Benz on bringing Snapdragon Digital Chassis to future vehicles specifically digital cockpits and automotive connectivity for vehicle telematics.

Mercedes Chief Software Officer Magnus Ostberg said in a statement “For many years Qualcomm Technologies has helped us deliver innovative solutions to our customers. Our strong relationship is vital to guiding the automotive industry through a time of exceptional growth and technological disruption.”

To the big picture Amon noted that two months ago the automotive design pipeline was at $19 billion and is now up to $30 billion. This he said “really reflects how uniquely positioned the Snapdragon Digital Chassis is and how we’re really creating a platform for the automotive industry…It really reflects the success of Qualcomm’s diversification strategy and execution of the connected intelligent edge.”

The amount is up more than US$10 billion since its third quarter results were announced in late July.

The US chip maker currently dominates the automotive connectivity chipset market with more than 80% share.

The automotive industry has been undergoing unprecedented transformation. The rise in electric and autonomous vehicles led to a growing demand for personalized in-car experiences and thus the increasing compute power required for connected cars. Riding on this market is Qualcomm with its Snapdragon Digital Chassis which has granted the US chip maker a US$30 billion worth of pipeline for its automotive business.

To recall just recently in late July Qualcomm during its third quarter results announced that its pipeline stoof at US$20 billion and in less than three months the amount has increased by US$10 billion. The San Diego-based company attributed the jump in future business to its Snapdragon Digital Chassis product used by car makers and their suppliers.

For context the Snapdragon Digital Chassis by Qualcomm can provide assisted and autonomous driving technology as well as in-car infotainment and cloud connectivity. Now considering how electric vehicles and autonomous features are increasing in cars the number of chips used by automakers are also surging. In general since the pandemic the automotive market has been a key growth area for chipmakers.

APPLE: BYE QUALCOMM HELLO TSMC?

“Qualcomm is a leader in essential technologies for the Connected Intelligent Edge” said Qualcomm Incorporated’s CEO Cristiano Amon. “Our One Technology Roadmap scales across virtually every industry including automotive. The Snapdragon Digital Chassis combined with our relationships with automakers has resulted in a $30 billion design-win pipeline. We are winning the digital future of automotive.”

On the other hand Qualcomm’s CFO Akash Palkhiwala shared “When you think about a per car basis a lower tier car we have an opportunity of approximately US$200 stretching all the way to $3000 at the high tier.” “Going forward Akash said the mix will continue to shift towards the high end so the opportunity will keep expanding.

In fiscal year 2022 Qualcomm estimates its automotive business revenue will be about US$1.3 billion from us$975 million the previous year. Then by fiscal year 2026 it estimates that to rise to over US$4 billion and in fiscal year 2031 to over US$9 billion. The automotive market size as a whole could grow to as large as US$100 billion by 2030 Qualcomm predicts.

On that note according to the latest research from Counterpoint’s Global Automotive NAD Module and Chipset Tracker global automotive connectivity module and chipset shipments grew by just 3% year-year-year in the first half of 2022. China came out as the largest region as electric vehicle players including new start-ups such as NIO Xpeng Motor and Seres are offering infotainment systems with large displays and smart cockpit solutions that have a wide array of features and ADAS that requires embedded connectivity.

“But during H1 2022 automotive connectivity module shipments in China declined by almost 7% YoY due to slow car production caused by supply chain disruption and Covid-19 restrictions” the report claims. In contrast North America remained more resilient with automotive connectivity module shipments increasing by 27% YoY during the first six months of this year.

The Counterpoint report also noted that Qualcomm holds a dominant position in the chipset market with more than 80% market share. “The strong product portfolio and partnerships with major tier-1 suppliers and automakers are all helping Qualcomm. And now Qualcomm is offering complete solutions for automotive digital transformation starting with hardware and extending to cloud services with the Snapdragon Digital Chassis. This one-stop solution is helping ecosystem players reduce time to market and be more competitive” the report stated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZnV0dXJlcy50di90b3BpY3MvbWVyY2VkZXMtYmVuei10by1pbnRlZ3JhdGUtcXVhbGNvbW0tcy1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLWRpZ2l0YWwtY2hhc3Npcy1pbnRvLXVwY29taW5nLXZlaGljbGVzL3MvOTYzZGY3MDgtZmI1OS00ZDRmLWJmZjgtMGZmOTI1ZDUwOTZj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mercedes-Benz to Integrate Qualcomm's Snapdragon Digital Chassis Into Upcoming Vehicles,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.autofutures.tv/topics/mercedes-benz-to-integrate-qualcomm-s-snapdragon-digital-chassis-into-upcoming-vehicles/s/963df708-fb59-4d4f-bff8-0ff925d5096c on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZnV0dXJlcy50di90b3BpY3MvbWVyY2VkZXMtYmVuei10by1pbnRlZ3JhdGUtcXVhbGNvbW0tcy1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLWRpZ2l0YWwtY2hhc3Npcy1pbnRvLXVwY29taW5nLXZlaGljbGVzL3MvOTYzZGY3MDgtZmI1OS00ZDRmLWJmZjgtMGZmOTI1ZDUwOTZj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvbWVyY2VkZXMtdG8tdXNlLXNuYXBkcmFnb24tZGlnaXRhbC1jaGFzc2lzLXNvbHV0aW9ucy1mb3ItaXRzLXVwY29taW5nLXZlaGljbGVzLTE5OTQ5OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mercedes To Use Snapdragon Digital Chassis Solutions for Its Upcoming Vehicles,"Technology is advancing faster than ever; you either keep up the pace or get left behind.

At the center of it all lies the technology to underpin that transformation — and the partnerships too between FIs providers and OEMs in the bid to disrupt everything from paying at the pump to parking.

U.S. chip designer Qualcomm on Thursday said its automotive business “pipeline” increased to $30 billion up more than $10 billion since its third quarter results were announced in late July as reported by Reuters. A robust chip pipeline we note indicates that the demand is there for the manufacturers to build — as quickly as possible — the vehicles of the future.

For Qualcomm The demand is tied in part to the company’s Snapdragon Digital Chassis product that is in turn used in the production supply chain — by equipment manufacturers and the suppliers — to enhance vehicles’ connectivity. That connectivity enables everything from infotainment delivered to passengers as they’re in the vehicles to autonomous driving and automatic parking.

Partnerships between the chipmakers and the automakers abound. In Qualcomm’s case it is expanding its existing partnership with Mercedes Benz where the latter will use the Snapdragon Cockpit for its in-car infotainment system beginning next year.

The partnerships also expand beyond the equipment and the technology providers. The path to forging the connected economy on wheels has all manner of stakeholders.

JPMorgan reached a deal with German carmaker Volkswagen to buy almost 75% of its financial services unit — spotlighting the appeal of (and we would argue the necessity) in-car payments technology.

Cars Become Devices

JPMorgan CEO of Merchant Services Max Neukirchen told Karen Webster that the car is “becoming a device” connecting us to a range of activities including payments. And we’re moving beyond the fragmentation of apps that have separate functions — to pay tolls pay parking meters etc.

As is germane to the VW deal he told Webster the advanced technology will cement OEMs’ direct connection to their end users but without having to do the heavy tech lifting in enabling the payments and the commerce aspects on their own.

The disruptions are in evidence with other partnerships too which use technology to turn vehicles into point of sale (POS) terminals. In July Sunoco said it would link with fleet payment solutions platform Car IQ which will allow secure fuel payments without a physical credit card. The initiative is being rolled out at almost 5000 Sunoco locations across the U.S. In terms of mechanics drivers using Car IQ Pay at Sunoco stations only need to enter the pump number top up their fuel and drive away.

As the connected economy evolves open innovation — and open collaboration — will guarantee the future of mobility and speed it along said Kevin Mull director of mobility solutions at Bosch in a recent conversation with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. Against that backdrop the lines between the original equipment manufacturers and suppliers are disappearing.

We’re not all that far from a future where the parking experience itself is automated connected and fully contactless. Picture the seamlessness as a driver arrives at a parking facility pulls into a designated drop zone steps out of the vehicle and taps “park” on a smartphone app. The autonomous-driving car drives off and finds its own parking space while the consumer walks away. (Uber in this case might seemingly be headed for some disintermediation especially when it comes to getting to the airport.)

As Webster herself noted in a recent column there’s cross-pollination in the works that will drive us to (literally) drive these mobile endpoints – and connect commerce in the meantime. There’s a positive ripple effect that has deep reach. PYMNTS data has shown that a 10% increase in the use of digital tools in transportation and mobility use cases spurs activities in other use cases such as streaming and gaming and even ordering groceries."

Raymond James & Associates did not clearly communicate to compliance and supervisory staff procedures regarding a group the business formed to help protect senior and at-risk clients resulting in a compliance officer misunderstanding the purpose of the group’s investigations the SEC alleged in its order filed Thursday. As a result activities by a former registered representative at the firm Frederick Stow who was misappropriating funds from two elderly customers’ accounts were allowed to continue according to the agency.

Stow who eventually admitted his misconduct was sentenced to five years in prison by the Department of Justice in May 2021 after pleading guilty to securities fraud wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.

Stow’s activities took place from October 2015 through April 2019. In June 2018 a branch manager at Raymond James engaged with his supervisors and a firm compliance officer regarding concerns he had about Stow after reviewing the accounts of elderly customers according to the SEC.

The supervisors and compliance officer ultimately determined to escalate their concerns to the senior and at-risk clients group which had been formed by Raymond James in 2017. What they didn’t know however was that the group was charged with investigating “whether a person outside the firm could be taking advantage of a senior customer” the SEC stated. So when the group did not act after the compliance officer had referred Stow’s accounts to it the compliance officer and supervisor accepted the findings.

“Because there was no change in circumstances to warrant an additional inquiry beyond what had already been completed Raymond James did not conduct any further meaningful supervisory inquiry specifically directed at Stow’s potential theft” the SEC stated.

Stow’s performance would further decline as he continued to misappropriate money from the customer accounts. In May 2019 he confessed his crimes to the branch manager according to the order.

Raymond James failed to reasonably supervise Stow within the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act the SEC alleged. Without admitting or denying the agency’s findings Raymond James agreed to pay the fine and consented to a censure.

They are the first women in Florida to open a registered non-depository trust company. Core challenge: Building a trusted brand for the targeted customer base mostly individuals and families with assets from $1 million to $10 million. What’s next: The founders seek to combine face-to-face marketing with social media and other outreach initiatives to build brand awareness. The pair projects Adelphi will be profitable by year three.

Katie Pemble and Gentry Barnett Byrnes have individually climbed to the top of some steep career mountains over the past 30 years — along the way developing a tight-knit finish-each-other's sentences kind of friendship.

Pemble was Pinellas market president for Bank of America and later president of what was St. Petersburg-based C1 Bank before Bank of the Ozarks acquired it in 2016 for $402 million. She left C1 in 2015 but stayed close to the banking industry getting into financial and wealth management and earning a certified financial planners license. Barnett Byrnes meanwhile is an attorney. She started her career with a focus on elder law and estates before shifting away from the law and into the trust business. She held leadership posts in trust units at Bank of America and Wells Fargo before being named chief fiduciary officer of Raymond James Financial in 2013. Assets under management at the Raymond James trust unit grew from $2.5 billion to $8.5 billion under Barnett Byrnes’ leadership when she also opened three offices outside Florida.

One thing the pair of accomplished businesswomen had never done? Start a business together. That includes a trust company which is regulated by the state to handle fiduciary services for clients for investment management wealth strategies and trust administration needs. And it turns out in something of surprise to the pair no women in Florida had ever founded or run a trust company before either. That makes the duo’s entry in the field — St. Petersburg-based Adelphi Trust Co. — a milestone for both Pemble and Barnett Byrnes and the trust industry.

Adelphi which in Greek is traced back to “of the same womb” or family of the same ancestor officially opened for business Aug. 12. “We think we are at the right time for women to be in this space” Pemble says in an interview in the firm’s office on the 12th floor of the City Center building in downtown St. Pete.

“Our focus with our clients is planning with and for the entire family; multiple generations” Pemble 57 adds in an email. “So Adelphi seemed perfect to us to capture our family focus and with a clear nod to the femininity of its creation.”

Barnett Byrnes adds that on a personal level starting a trust as opposed to continuing to grow one at Raymond James has opened a new level of passion for the industry. “The trust space is where you can really build relationships with clients” says Barnett Byrnes 54. “I’m working harder than I’ve ever worked in my career but I’m having more fun than I’ve ever had in my career.”

Big ideas

While the Adelphi founders are proud of their trailblazing status they are also confident they can compete against any entity in the small — yet highly profitable — trust company sector in Florida. There’s 12 other registered non-depository trust companies in Florida data from the Florida Office of Financial Regulation shows a list that doesn’t include banks with trust divisions. “There’s just not a lot of us” says R. G. “Kelly” Caldwell CEO of Venice-based Caldwell Trust Co. which was founded in 1993 and has some $1.4 billion in assets under management.

Seven of Florida’s independent trust companies now including Adelphi are based on the west coast of the state. Nine of the 12 operational in 2021 were profitable according to OFR quarterly reports.

Adelphi projects it will hit profitability by 2025 in year three. Its strategy to get there to a large extent is to go where competitors aren’t going. One example: some trust entities both independent and units of big banks only take clients with $15 million or more in assets. Some set a baseline of $30 million. Adelphi plans to focus on the underserved $1 million to $10 million market.

Pemble the firm’s CEO and board chair and Barnett Byrnes the chief fiduciary officer each invested $260000 into the startup phase of Adelphi with 4.6% ownership stakes. They also have 43 investors who contributed $5 million including a nine-member board of high-powered Tampa and St. Pete business leaders. Adelphi officials declined to disclose financial projections for assets under management or other metrics. The firm through mid-September had four people on its management team with plans to add one more in the first quarter of 2023.

There for you

The trust industry might be small in Florida in terms of the number of companies that do it on an independent basis but it's big in volume: billions in assets were held in the state’s 12 trust companies through the end of the first quarter according to OFR data.

Caldwell says that figure is primed to grow significantly both at his firm and in the industry. One reason he says is small banks have for the most part dropped or scaled back on trust services in the past few years. That’s largely because it’s not a core competency and requires too much work and expense. Most large and regional banks have trust departments but in many cases Caldwell says those units have turned into afterthoughts as many institutions focus on other services that can turn a profit quicker.

Finally banking industry consolidation has left many customers frustrated with no go-to person to call. That leaves a gap for people and families with multimillion-dollar accounts who seek a financial partner with consistency Caldwell says. “We’re going to be here for you” he says “while the big banks might send you to 1-800 land.”

Caldwell says one key to the success at his firm founded by his dad Roland Caldwell has been in getting internal infrastructure in place before a growth surge — an important but tricky balance. It’s why seven of the company’s 40 employees are in non-revenue producing IT roles so the company stays ahead of technology. As it steers toward $2 billion in assets Caldwell has sought to do the same thing with operations compliance and in leadership bringing in senior leaders so he’s no longer mired in day-to-day tasks. “Everytime you grow as a company you have to take the next big leap” in the core aspects of what has made the company successful in the first place he says. “And we have been able to take those steps.”

The biggest challenge Caldwell Trust Co. faces says Caldwell is the same one that other trust companies are grappling with. Same as just about any other industry: recruiting and retaining top talent. “The pool of talent isn’t there” says Caldwell.

Fast paced

Pemble and Barnett Byrnes haven’t faced the staffing challenge in a big way — yet.

RIght now the pair is more focused on the market opportunity — which they see in multiple layers. One big one is the sheer volume of wealthy residents moving to Florida. A recent study from data firm SmartAsset for example found that the Sunshine State gained 20263 high-income households even before the pandemic. New York and California respectively have lost 19912 and 19299 high-earning individuals and families.

In addition Pemble cites studies from Mckinsey & Co. and others that show baby boomers are projected to transfer $70 trillion to Gen X and Millennials between 2018 and 2042. “The demographics of wealth are changing dramatically nationally and in Florida and the pace of that change is projected to increase exponentially over the next 20 years” Pemble says.

To seize the opportunity in that shift Pemble and Barnett Byrnes say they intend to build Adelphi a bit differently than some more established firms especially in terms of marketing and outreach. “For years much of the marketing we have done is eyeball to eyeball” says Pemble.

But they are plowing ahead into the digital generation knowing they need to meet customers where they live and spend time.. “Social media can be a cost-effective way to get our name out there” Pemble says.

The idea for Adelphi isn’t just based on market need or finding a better way to do trust management or even being the first women to launch a trust business in Florida. The idea also stems from a kinship Barnett Byrnes and Pemble share. Many years ago they worked in the same building in St. Pete with different companies. Pemble says she would often call Barnett Byrnes for legal and technical trust questions.

Then during the early days of the pandemic the pair would take Saturday walks around parks in St. Pete. “We talked about if we were to start a business what it would look like” Barnett Byrnes says.

Next up were conversations around Pemble’s dining room table chats that were essentially visioning sessions. They mapped out everything from compliance and customer service to operating systems and risk mitigation. One quick agreement: spending more money on IT infrastructure in the beginning was better than being caught without what they needed down the line.

The passion for Adelphi and working together has grown from those walks and dining room talks to now the new office. Florida Office of Financial Regulation officials visited the office Aug. 12 to drop of Adelphi's charter in person. It was a meaningful moment for both Pemble and Barnett Byrnes as they reflected back on their careers while looking ahead to building something of their own. “Both of us” Pemble says “have a real entrepreneurial spirit.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sZWdhY3lyZW1lbWJlcnMvamFtZXMtamltbXktYWJlcmNyb21iaWUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY1OTAxMDDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"James ""Jimmy"" Abercrombie Obituary (1977 - 2022)",ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/legacyremembers/james-jimmy-abercrombie-obituary?id=36590100 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sZWdhY3lyZW1lbWJlcnMvamFtZXMtamltbXktYWJlcmNyb21iaWUtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY1OTAxMDDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvc3BvcnRzL25mbC8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL25mbC0yMDIyLWJlc3QtcGhvdG9zLXdlZWstMy84MDg2NDI4MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NFL 2022: Best photos from Week 3,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvc3BvcnRzL25mbC8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL25mbC0yMDIyLWJlc3QtcGhvdG9zLXdlZWstMy84MDg2NDI4MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267413BB8B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

USA TODAY

After back-to-back road games to start the season the Tampa Bay Buccaneers open up their 2022 home slate Sunday against the Green Bay Packers.

Here’s everything you need to know about this Week 3 NFC showdown:

Top Storylines

Tom Brady vs. Aaron Rodgers

Every time a pair of future first-ballot Hall of Fame quarterbacks face off it’s must-see TV.

Tom Brady has matched up against Aaron Rodgers and the Packers twice since signing with the Bucs and he’s bested him on both occasions both in 2020.

Tampa Bay dominated on defense in a 38-10 victory in Tampa then upset the Packers at Lambeau Field in the NFC title game on their way to a Super Bowl LV win.

This time Rodgers returns to Raymond James Stadium without his top target in Davante Adams but Brady will also be missing his best pass-catcher in Mike Evans.

This game will be a test for these legendary passers as they work with inexperienced receiver groups.

Next Man Up

Evans will miss Sunday’s matchup thanks to a one-game suspension for his role in last week’s fight between the Bucs and the New Orleans Saints.

Evans knocked Saints cornerback Marshon Lattimore to the ground after the latter exchanged heated words with Brady and shoved Leonard Fournette leading to an all-out brawl.

Both Evans and Lattimore were ejected from the game but only Evans got a suspension which was upheld upon appeal earlier this week.

With some of his other receivers still banged up Brady will need someone from the bottom of the depth chart so step up such as Russell Gage Breshad Perriman Scotty Miller Jaelon Darden or even new addition Cole Beasley.

Injury updates

The Bucs will be without at least two of their Pro Bowl wide receivers for this one and might be missing a third.

Not only is Evans out but Chris Godwin will miss his second straight game with a hamstring injury while Julio Jones is questionable with a knee injury.

Starting left tackle Donovan Smith is doubtful for the second week in a row though he did return to practice on Thursday before resting on Friday.

Defensive lineman Akiem Hicks is expected to miss about a month with a foot injury so he’s already been ruled out for Sunday as well.

Packers wide receiver Sammy Watkins is the only Green Bay player who has officially declared out for the game.

Matchups to Watch

Bucs OT Tristan Wirfs vs. Packers OLB Rashan Gary

While left tackle might be a question mark for the Bucs heading into this game they’ll at least be able to count on their All-Pro on the right side.

Wirfs has quickly become one of the most dominant offensive tackles in the entire NFL and he’s still just scratching the surface of his lofty potential.

He’ll have his hands fill with fellow Big Ten product and former first-rounder Gary who has taken his pass-rushing game to new heights.

Packers RBs vs. Bucs LBs

Rodgers might not have the pass-catchers he once did but he’s got a dominant ground game that features the two-headed monster of Aaron Jones and AJ Dillon.

Thankfully for the Bucs they have a dynamic tandem of their own at linebacker with Lavonte David and Devin White both of whom have the athleticism instincts and physicality to contain Green Bay’s versatile backfield.

Bucs QB Tom Brady vs. Packers QB Aaron Rodgers

They won’t be on the field at the same time but you can bet that Brady and Rodgers both know what they’re up against on the opposite sideline and will want to raise their game accordingly.

Both of these legendary passers will have to bring their best performances especially given what they’re missing in terms of their supporting cast.

They’ve given us plenty of iconic performances in the past and another one wouldn’t be surprising here.

Prediction

These teams look a bit different than the ones that faced off twice in 2020 which an increased emphasis on solid defense and a reliable ground game over high-powered passing attacks.

That could keep it more low-scoring than some might expect but don’t be surprised if both quarterbacks still try to take some big shots downfield when the opportunities present themselves.

So far this season the Bucs have been the most dominant defense in the league getting after opposing quarterbacks and forcing tons of turnovers and they still haven’t had the benefit of their home crowd.

That’ll change Sunday and should help propel Tampa Bay to their third straight victory to start the year.

Sept. 22 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Raytheon Missiles & Defense a Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: RTX) business in partnership with Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) has been selected to develop the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile for the U.S. Air Force (USAF). HACM is a first-of-its-kind weapon developed in conjunction with the Southern Cross Integrated Flight Research Experiment (SCIFiRE) a U.S. and Australia project arrangement.

Under this contract the Raytheon Missiles & Defense and Northrop Grumman team will deliver operationally ready missiles to the USAF.

""Raytheon Missiles & Defense continues to be at the forefront of hypersonic weapon and air-breathing technology development"" said Wes Kremer president of Raytheon Missiles & Defense. ""With advanced threats emerging around the globe the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile will provide our warfighters a much-needed capability.""

The Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile is an air-breathing scramjet powered munition. Scramjet engines use high vehicle speed to forcibly compress incoming air before combustion which enables sustained flight at hypersonic speeds – Mach 5 or greater. By traveling at these speeds hypersonic weapons like HACM are able to reach their targets more quickly than similar traditional missiles allowing them to potentially evade defensive systems.

""The Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile creates a new class of strategically important weapons for the U.S. military"" said Mary Petryszyn corporate vice president and president Northrop Grumman Defense Systems. ""Our scramjet propulsion technology is ushering in a new era for faster more survivable and highly capable weapons.""

Raytheon Technologies and Northrop Grumman have been working together since 2019 to develop produce and integrate Northrop Grumman's scramjet engines onto Raytheon's air-breathing hypersonic weapons. Their combined efforts enable both companies to produce air-breathing hypersonic weapons the next generation of tactical missile systems.

But a benchmark from the company is poking a hole in some of those claims.

After Nvidia announced the products it released an image that shows the performance gains consumers can expect from next-generation GPUs which will span three models: The RTX 4080 12GB the RTX 4080 16GB and the RTX 4090.

Nvidia RTX 3090 TI Founders Edition . د.إ 4299.00 Buy now ↗

The benchmark compares the new crop of graphics cards against an RTX 3090 Ti which launched in March for $1999 as the most powerful model in the older RTX 3000 series.

Nvidia has been happy to boast that the RTX 4090 will offer a two- to four-times performance gain over the RTX 3090 Ti which sounds like an enticing selling point. The same benchmark—which tested the games on the highest settings running at 4K—even shows the RTX 4080 models handily beating the older GPU by a huge margin.

But if you look closely the RTX 4090 can only offer a 4x improvement for so-called “next-generation titles.” This includes an upcoming version of Cyberpunk 2077 that adds a new “Overdrive RT mode” for better graphics and Nvidia’s own tech demo Racer RTX which isn’t even a real game.

On existing PC titles performance gains fall to 2x; the RTX 4090 drops even lower. It's also interesting to note how the gap between RTX 4080 models and the RTX 3090 Ti begins to close for currently available games. In fact the 12GB RTX 4080 model can underperform against the 3090 Ti.

The GPU maker also held a Q&A on Reddit where it revealed the biggest gains in the benchmark are dependent on frame-rate boosting DLSS technology ratcheting up performance.

The non-DLSS supported games are highlighted in red.

“This chart has DLSS turned on when supported but there are some games like Division 2 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla in the chart that don’t have DLSS so you can see performance compared to our fastest RTX 30 Series GPU without DLSS” Nvidia wrote.

Indeed none of the three games—Resident Evil Village Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and The Division 2—officially support Nvidia’s DLSS technology according to the company’s list. It also explains the stark drop-off in performance gains for the RTX 4000 series: Without DLSS support the GPUs can no longer reach a 2x performance increase compared against RTX 3090 Ti.

That means the RTX 4000 series will probably offer a more muted upgrade when it comes to raw performance over the last generation. It also shows Nvidia is heavily relying on DLSS to prop up performance claims for next-generation GPUs.

One of the main features for the new graphics cards is DLSS 3 an improved version of the frame-rate boosting tech that’s exclusive to RTX 4000 series. In a presentation to journalists Nvidia showed the technology can offer a massive FPS uplift of two to even six times.

But the catch is that DLSS 3 is entirely dependent on games adopting the technology. Nvidia says so far over 35 games plan on adding DLSS 3 with the first coming in October. However the technology promises to be easy for software developers to adopt especially since it’s being added to game engines including Unreal Engine 4 and 5.

Still consumers should take Nvidia’s claim about the 2x to 4x performance gain with a heavy grain of salt until the tech press can get their hands on the GPUs.

Gigabyte has published the complete physical specifications bringing us closer to understanding the newest flagship from AORUS.

Gigabyte's AORUS GeForce RTX 4090 Master GPU Has A Total Volume of Over 4000mm2 Almost 10 Times More Than A RX 6400 Low Profile GPU

The new AORUS GeForce RTX 4090 Master GPU will be the first Ada series RTX 40 GPU from Gigabyte's AORUS Xtreme line. Photos from the company have been posted showing a small dual-slot input and output bracket. This development is surprising as the graphics card from AORUS would technically require four slots on a corresponding motherboard.

The Gigabyte AORUS Master GPU will also be fashioned with three fans measuring eleven centimeters each. The card will have a length of 35.8 cm and a width of 16.2 cm. Most if not all Mini-ITX graphics cards are as minute as seventeen centimeters.

The AORUS Master GeForce RTX 4090 GPU has a volume of 4383 mm³ and is much larger than Gigabyte's main ITX graphics card. The new card from AORUS is five times the size of the leading company's graphics card. This size difference is significant as the RTX 30 and RTX 40 series of GPUs are much different between the generations.

Out of a majority of graphics card manufacturers Gigabyte is a select set of companies that do not equip triple- or quad-slot I/O brackets to the company's GPUs. The leading company shares a similar design with AORUS when it comes to both frames and PCBs. The company may change cooler plans in the future to an AIO cooling kit or submit to water blocks to cool their GPU series.

An Mhodhscoil on O' Connell Avenue Limerick city is the very first school in the county to avail of the Safe Routes to School scheme launched last year with the aim to support ""walking scooting and cycling to primary and post-primary schools.""

Hildegarde Naughton TD Minister-of-State with responsibility for transport said that the newly designed Roden Street ""is a credit to the school and the pupils who have led this.""

""What I want to see is further projects like this rolled out right across the county €24m has been allocated by my department to Limerick City and County Council"" she said.

She noted a real ""calm atmosphere"" outside the school gates adding that the stress levels have been reduced for teachers and parents in what she described as a ""safe space"" for students to walk or cycle to school.

Brian Leddin TD who helped push for the scheme in Limerick said the new safety measures ""gives young people new independence and a healthy way to get around and explore their community.""

The Irish speaking primary school was one of 170 successful applicants to the first round of the programme which saw a total of 931 applications from across the country.

In Limerick An Mhodhscoil is one of eight Limerick schools which were successful in the first phase and the the very first in the city and county to see works completed.

The new school street features brand-new paving and pencil style bollards and is a collaborative project with Limerick City and County Council Safe Routes to School Green Schools and Active Travel Limerick.

George a fourth class student in the school took time out of his regular morning commute before the first bell tolls to tell Limerick Live what he thought of his school's fresh new look.

""I think it's a big addition to the school it makes everything look so much nicer. The new school street is a lot better for our cyclists and pupils. We have also introduced a new creche bus lane and have redone our school crossing.

""It's so much safer now and I am very proud of it all"" he concluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As the new school year begins a common sight for Alpine School District students and teachers at several Lehi schools has been mountains of black plastic garbage bags spilling out of school dumpsters which are usually kept neat and emptied frequently. However in recent weeks school officials have seen these formerly well-maintained bins overflowing with trash.

Staff from a range of schools have reported stinking piles of waste that have become increasingly inconvenient and odorous as they grow.

Alpine School District (ASD) has a garbage collection contract with Arizona-based Republic Services a billion-dollar publicly held company.

ASD administrators have been barraged with a flurry of complaints from school officials parents and students about the ever-growing piles of trash. ASD maintenance officials reported that complaints have been referred to Republic Services.

Clark Estaban Head Maintenance Coordinator for Alpine School District expressed frustration with Republic Services as the issue has been ongoing. “I have contacted Republic Services on missed pickups more than I can count.”

Estaban said Republic Services informed him they were experiencing “staffing issues” something Republic Servicesechoed in a statement “Republic Services of Utah is currently experiencing some service delays. Many industries are facing staffing challenges at this time and the environmental services industry is no different.”

The company also added “We are always recruiting and hiring great people to join our team and offer a competitive salary generous benefits paid vacation safety bonuses and numerous career advancement opportunities.”

Many companies have been facing record employee shortages. Over the last several months inadequate labor supply and lack of adequately trained staff have been issues plaguing businesses of all sizes all around the country and companies operating in Utah are no exception.

However frustrations are growing for school officials students and teachers as dumpsters on Lehi’s school grounds continue to overflow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTY3NjI3L2RlZnVuZC1zb2NpYWwtd29ya2Vyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Defund Social Workers,"Whose conscience is cleaner than that of a social worker? Few jobs demand as much selflessness or let you be of greater service to those in need; in few jobs will you get paid less while helping people more—the typical measure of occupational rectitude. The social worker cares about people not status or money. Toiling in the dense bureaucratic thickets of state agencies and adjacent nonprofits she soothes the angry comforts the sick and connects the poor with the resources they lack. (As a rule we think of social workers as women; upward of 80 percent of them are.) In the moral sweepstakes her only close competitors are teachers and nurses. Her mere existence stanches the blood pouring from liberals’ hearts.

Since mid-2020 as outrage over police violence reached an apex and calls to defund police departments gained momentum it has seemed obvious to many on the left that social work is the solution. If nearly a quarter of the people shot by officers are in a mental health crisis the argument goes social workers should respond to certain emergencies rather than cops: Fund social services not police. A 2020 study by Data for Progress found that 68 percent of voters supported the creation of a “new agency of first responders.” In Eugene Oregon 17 percent of public-safety calls are currently handled by a three-decades–old program called Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets frequently cited as an example of how this approach might work. With CAHOOTS a medic and a crisis worker (who may not be a licensed social worker) respond to calls involving mental health homelessness or substance use. Olympia Washington launched a similar program in 2019; Denver started a pilot the following year; last year in Harlem New York City debuted B-HEARD. The National Association of Social Workers released a brief supporting the creation of such “innovative approaches.” It seems like common sense the idea that you could reduce violence by diverting money from bloated police departments and sinking it into programs populated by social workers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZGFsbGFzaW5ub3ZhdGVzLmNvbS90aGUtbGFzdC13b3JkLWlkcHMtYnJhbmRvbi1idXNjaG9sZC1vbi13aHktd29ya2ZvcmNlLXRyYWRlLXByb2dyYW1zLWFyZS12aXRhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Last Word: IDP's Brandon Buschold on Why Workforce Trade Programs Are Vital,"The Last Word: IDP’s Brandon Buschold on Why Workforce Trade Programs Are Vital

“It’s imperative that we always keep an eye on the future. Without any real focus on our youth there will be a lack of innovation—and ultimately no torch to pass on.”

Brandon Buschold

President

Integrated Defense Products

.…on his company’s plans to get involved in local trade programs with its HQ move from California to Rockwall.

Buschold is part of the team at California-based Integrated Defense Products relocating to its new headquarters in Rockwall’s Technology Park. The company recently broke ground on the 21000-square-foot facility but Buschold is already thinking ahead.

IDP aims to employ 40 works in Rockwall when the facility’s up and running with 25 to 30 coming from the local talent pool. Buschold says IDP plans to get involved in local trade programs hoping to help train the next generation of workers in the manufacturing engineering and production fields.

He’s not alone. Workforce training and development has been at the top of the list for many in North Texas recently. Dallas College has made it a major part of its agenda for the region and in July was awarded a $5 million Apprenticeship Building America grant by the U.S. Department of Labor for its apprenticeship programs.

And just last month Dallas College in partnership with several other North Texas higher ed institutions and biomedical businesses received an $8.8 million grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration to help train workers for scores of local biotech businesses.

Also four North Texas organizations are getting more than $1.3 million to help with workforce development and job placement from nearly $6 million in Texas Talent Connection grants.

Businesses are doing their part too like Phoenix-based Republic Services which announced last October it was opening an $18 million Technical Institute in Southwest Dallas to train diesel technicians.

From companies to nonprofits to government entities across the region training the North Texas workforce of the future isn’t just an agenda. It’s a vital mission one that seems destined to shape what our region will become tomorrow.

By Mike Berger

Canton Fire Captain Wendell Robery will soon take over as the town’s next fire chief pending contract negotiations after being offered the position at Tuesday night’s Select Board meeting.

Select Board members said it was a tough choice between two excellent finalists in Robery and Lt. Jamie Meier with Board Chair John Connolly citing experience as one of the deciding factors.

Robery is a 34-year CFD veteran having served the past 27 years combined as a lieutenant and captain and has another four years before he is required to retire.

He believes the department is in “great shape” and he will work to continue the programs built up by Doody especially apparatus and equipment. Robery said he intends to set goals for each firefighter-paramedic and as a leader wants to inspire them to do things they never thought they could accomplish. He is a big proponent of leading by example and stepping up to do extra work when needed.

Robery will replace longtime Fire Chief Charles Doody who is leaving the department after 27 years to become the new town administrator effective October 1.

Meier joined the CFD in 2002 and became EMS coordinator in 2010. He has served as firefighter union president and was promoted to lieutenant five years ago. He has also worked with the Canton Alliance Against Substance Abuse and with the Mass. Firefighter Academy on recruitment training.

A search committee initially selected four candidates all within the CFD and all were viewed as worthy choices.

The other major news at Tuesday meeting concerned the town’s Mattress Recycling Program as the Select Board accepted Town Administrator Charlie Aspinwall’s recommendation to offer two options for the removal of mattresses and box springs.

The move was necessitated by the state Department of Environmental Protection’s “2030 Solid Waste Master Plan” which added mattresses and textiles to the list of materials banned from disposal or transport for disposal in the commonwealth. Beginning on November 1 residents will have two fee-based options for the removal of mattresses. One is a drop-off at the Pine Street transfer station which will cost $40 per unit ($80 for a mattress and box spring). The other option is to arrange curbside pickup with Green Team which will charge residents $75 per unit. Further details will be posted on the town website or added to upcoming tax or water bills.

Select Board members acknowledged the November 1 date does not give residents a lot of advance notice and member Lisa Lopez said any resident who is thinking about getting rid of mattresses or box springs should do so before November 1 if they want to avoid the fee. Beginning on that date Republic Services the town’s trash/recycling contractor will no longer accept any mattress removal requests from Canton residents.

The agenda of the minister’s visit also included numerous bilateral and multilateral meetings as well as many high-level events.

The issue of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine was the key topic of Minister Rau’s meetings with his counterparts as well as consultations among allies. The subject was also covered during the EU foreign ministers’ meeting with the participation of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell a meeting of EU and NATO heads of diplomacy held at the initiative of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken as well as during a Security Council session on the situation in Ukraine.

The head of the Polish MFA highlighted the need to ensure stability and predictability in international relations. The foreign minister expressed his deep concern over undermining the generally accepted norms and mutual commitments provided under international law. Minister Rau recalled that the Russian aggression requires a multidimensional and strong response of the international community. He argued that those guilty of violations of international law should be held accountable.

The New York visit was also an opportunity for Minister Rau to emphasise the importance that Poland attaches to the adherence to human rights.

Six weeks. Five countries. This summer Erin Bury and her husband packed up their six-month-old baby and took a trip that wouldn’t have been possible just a few years ago. “We had friends getting married in Tuscany and instead of just going over for the wedding we thought why don’t we extend?”

It wasn’t just the fact that their infant isn’t crawling yet that made this summer opportune. Bury the founder and CEO of online will-planning platform Willful says she wanted to test out her own “work from anywhere” policy a trend that’s blurring the lines between business and pleasure travel. Despite a push back to the office this summer for many businesses nearly half of Canadian employers are extending remote work to attract and retain talent according to data from the staffing firm Robert Half.

“Our trip never ever would have been possible in past jobs or if COVID hadn’t happened” Bury says. “In my previous role I ran a marketing agency for six years and even though we had work from home policies there was a perception it was something you did occasionally and that people working from home weren’t as productive. I was not a work from home person myself.”

Not only has Bury come around – Willful now subleases its Toronto office space – but her company has introduced new policies such as greater schedule flexibility built around mandatory but abbreviated “core hours” to ensure overlap across time zones to enable employees to collaborate while working from wherever they want. “We have someone working from Colombia right now from Ireland from Paris you name it” she says.

But it’s not just employers who are shifting to meet the needs of travelling staffers. For many such workers WFH doesn’t mean “work from home”; it means “work from hotel.” And in the rush to become their new home – and office – both new and legacy hotel brands are moving to address their needs.

“Hotel rooms were really built for a world where we lived at home and worked at the office and just stayed overnight in the hotel room” says Will Lucas founder and CEO of the hotel group Mint House. “But that’s not really what many of us are doing any more. The traditional hotel room becomes less and less palatable the longer you’re staying there. You’re going to want a kitchen you’re going to want groceries you’ll want a dedicated workspace because instead of just sleeping and showering there you’ll need a place to actually work.”

More than a quarter of employed Canadians – and 38 per cent of Gen Z workers and 35 per cent of millennials – planned to take a blended business and leisure trip referred to as “bleisure” within the travel industry this year according to booking engine Kayak.

But there’s no one way to workcation. For nearly seven in 10 workers such a trip typically lasts between one and four weeks while roughly 10 per cent of trips are shorter than that as people tack on a few extra days at a conference destination or add a couple of work days to extend a long weekend getaway. And more than 20 per cent leverage remote work policies to travel for a month or more found a U.S. survey by Passport Photo Online.

Either way the workcation trend means more nights away from home and heightened requirements for where you stay. Vacation home rentals once seemed a natural fit. But with the average cost of one night in a studio or one-bedroom in Toronto on Airbnb now clocking in at just $33 less (before cleaning and service fees) than a hotel as a recent analysis by the hospitality data companies STR and AirDNA found and social media backlash over associated fees and house rules there’s an opening for brands that can offer the best of both worlds.

The good the great and the meh of hotel loyalty reward programs

“We’re taking the very best elements of a traditional hotel and the very best elements of a high-end Airbnb and putting them together” Lucas says of Mint House which has 23 fully serviced apartment-style properties in 14 U.S. cities. “It’s the consistency reliability trust and security that you would get in a branded hotel but combined with the comfort amenities and privacy that you get at an Airbnb. We call it residential hospitality.”

Mint House launched in 2017 and its leadership includes veterans of Four Seasons and Starwood Hotels and Resorts which was acquired by Marriott in 2016. “The trend we saw coming was probably accelerated by 10 years because of the pandemic” Lucas says.

With an inventory that includes both entire hotels and dedicated floors within residential buildings the company focuses on technology to bridge the gap. “We power Mint House with a fully mobile and digital guest experience” he says. “Digital check-in keyless entry through your phone. … We have a program called Stock Your Stay so through SMS or the app you can order groceries and they’ll be in the fridge when you walk in the door. We offer live exercise classes through a partnership with Fitness Mirror in many of the rooms.” Mint House at 70 Pine the group’s 132-suite New York property was the highest-rated hotel in the U.S. on TripAdvisor for 2021.

But it’s not just upstarts trying to capture this growing segment. Marriott has seen a 15-per-cent increase in stay length in suite-level rooms among bleisure travellers at its brands across Canada and is trialling 13 new room prototypes at its Bethesda Design Lab an experimental hotel adjacent to the company’s international headquarters. The hotel group has grown inventory for its vacation rental offering Marriott Homes and Villas from 2000 homes to more than 76000 since launching in 2019.

Don Cleary president of Marriott Hotels of Canada says its Bonvoy program one of the largest hotel loyalty programs in the world is a big differentiator for bleisure guests because it offers ways to offset the cost of an extended trip and the ability to connect with unique local experiences during off-work hours is integrated into the app and booking process. Ninety per cent of Homes and Villas bookings are from Bonvoy members outpacing member bookings at Marriott’s hotel properties Cleary says. “We’re the only one in this space where you can both earn and use Bonvoy points to book. That’s proving very popular for this mix of work and play.”

With workspaces consistency and convenience addressed the resort brand Selina is focused on improving the last missing piece: community. While cost and time zone differences were cited as key challenges associated with workcations in Passport Photo Online’s survey nearly one in five people say loneliness is a detractor from this type of travel.

At Selina’s 150 properties around the world accommodations range from dorm-style rooms to luxury suites targeted at Gen Zs and millennials who’ve outgrown the hostel scene. Selina co-founder and CEO Rafael Museri sees facilitating connections between guests as his brand’s biggest opportunity even going so far as to make guests’ new friendships a key performance indicator for the company. “Over 50 per cent of our customers say they made a friend staying with us” Museri says.

While the company has invested heavily in workspaces and WiFi delivery across its global resorts Museri believes wellness and music programming – from full moon ceremonies and surf lessons in Costa Rica to a three-day music festival in Morocco next month – are the company’s secret sauce.

The second episode of the series gives viewers a sneak peek at the key designs and construction milestones of the upcoming vacation which is set to debut next year.

“The most rewarding phase of the building of the ship is that now it’s physically growing. We have 3000 people working on the ship every day at the moment so every week the ship is progressing in a very substantial way and we can see that the dreaming the work what we have been doing for five years now is coming into a reality” said Harri Kulovaara executive vice president maritime and newbuilding Royal Caribbean Group.

Industrial and naval engineers interior designers architects and other creatives discuss what it takes to handle the challenges that come with such an ambitious construction timeline for the cruise industry according to Royal Caribbean Group.

“Icon will follow very much in the footsteps of some of the great ships that this company has built. Sovereign of the Seas Oasis of the Seas and now Icon of the Seas. It’s so innovative and special” commented Richard Fain chairman Royal Caribbean Group.

“We start with the concept design. It’s really about how is a guest going to experience and feel within the space and then from there we are working through how big the space needs to be. Those types of decisions are what lock in very early” explained Anna Drescher manager architectural design and newbuilding Royal Caribbean Group.

The cruise line industry has seen some unprecedented twists and turns over the last few years but it's started to rebound now that pandemic-related headwinds have lessened. Carnival (CCL -0.89%) and Royal Caribbean (RCL -0.49%) are two of the biggest players in the space and investors might be wondering which of these companies is the better investment now that trip demand is rebounding.

Read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors have very different takes on the question of whether Carnival or Royal Caribbean is the better buy.

Resiliency is key

George Budwell: Carnival's management painted a fairly optimistic picture about its ongoing recovery efforts from the COVID-19 pandemic when it reported 2022 second-quarter earnings back in June. During the three-month period cash from operations turned positive revenue rose by a healthy 50% from the prior quarter and booking rates on Carnival's leisure cruises were up substantially quarter over quarter.

Best of all Carnival was sailing into the busiest part of the year for the industry -- the third quarter. Even so Carnival's stock is still trading near its pandemic low. The cruise ship's equity in fact isn't far removed from its 52-week low right now.

Why are investors not buying into this turnaround story? The culprit behind Carnival's failure to launch so to speak on its overall positive Q2 report is the weakening global macroeconomic environment. Inflation is stubbornly high interest rates are on the rise and global supply chains are far from peak operating efficiency. In short Wall Street is concerned that these macroeconomic headwinds will spill over into the leisure cruising industry in the form of lower bookings and shrinking revenues in 2023. Unfortunately this key risk factor is hard to ignore given the stark warning signs that the U.S. and European economies are indeed headed for a slowdown.

Does this mean that investors ought to avoid cruise stocks altogether? Quite the contrary. The bottom line is that Carnival is the largest operator in the space and it has the liquidity necessary ($8.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at last count) to push through yet another hardship. So if you're looking for a value stock that could double or triple in value within the next two to three years Carnival should definitely be on your list. That being said investors will probably want to slowly build a position in this beaten-down cruise ship stock over the next six to 12 months as the company works through these ongoing challenges.

Royal Caribbean has been less dilutive and has less debt

Keith Noonan: While Royal Caribbean still has a major issue with debt on the heels of pandemic-related challenges it's taken a much lighter approach than Carnival to selling new shares in order to raise funds.

Both cruise stocks have seen huge sell-offs over the last year but dilution has been a contributing factor in Carnival posting the worse performance of the two and I think it remains a key risk factor for investors going forward.

On the other hand Royal Caribbean has been selling convertible notes and refinancing debt at relatively high interest rates recently and some of these notes will likely be converted into stock. With revenue for both companies still well below pre-pandemic levels I think Royal Caribbean's financial positioning and corporate governance have looked stronger than Carnival's lately. But it's clear that debt cash flows and the threat of continued dilution are risks for both cruise stocks.

Royal Caribbean has been increasing revenue per customer and recently posted its best-ever results along those lines. The company's high-end Celebrity and Silversea lines in particular look capable of driving high-margin sales as demand continues to improve. Both Royal Caribbean and Carnival saw cash from operations turn positive in the second quarter but both posted big losses due to high capital expenditures. There are signs that each business is on the path to recovery but Royal Caribbean's financial position and greater focus on the high-end market makes me think it's the better buy.

Which cruise stock should you invest in?

Both Carnival and Royal Caribbean are investment plays characterized by somewhat shaky financials rebounding sales and the potential for explosive turnarounds. These stocks seemingly trade at value-level prices but there's uncertainty about whether the underlying companies will be able to bounce back to pre-pandemic performance and pay down high levels of debt.

Carnival's business has higher levels of debt but it currently has more liquidity to navigate the turnaround and its beaten-down stock could have more upside if the company manages to improve its financial position. Royal Caribbean looks more sound in terms of fundamentals but it's also possible that this will be confounded by the company taking on more debt or pursing new share offerings to raise funds.

If you see the cruise industry making a strong recovery over the long term investing in both stocks could be the right move. Otherwise it's probably best to consider each company's financial position and business strengths to determine which has the more attractive risk-reward profile.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2Zvcm1lci1jZWxlYnJpdHktY3J1aXNlLXNoaXAtYXJyaXZlcy1mb3Itc2NyYXBwaW5nLWluLWluZGlhLzgyMzE20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Celebrity Cruise Ship Arrives for Scrapping in India,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.cruisehive.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /former-celebrity-cruise-ship-arrives-for-scrapping-in-india/82316 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002673E700790>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2Zvcm1lci1jZWxlYnJpdHktY3J1aXNlLXNoaXAtYXJyaXZlcy1mb3Itc2NyYXBwaW5nLWluLWluZGlhLzgyMzE20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9tc2MtY3J1aXNlcy1zaGlwLXdvcmxkLWV1cm9wYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSC World Europa preview: A guide to the giant new MSC Cruises ship,"Have you heard the buzz about the giant new cruise ship under construction for MSC Cruises? If not you will soon.

Scheduled to debut in December this massive new vessel named MSC World Europa is an astounding 22 decks high — four decks higher than Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas the current size leader in the cruise world.

It's also 1093 feet long which is longer than any other MSC Cruises ship ever built.

Still despite its great height and length MSC World Europa won't quite top Wonder of the Seas as the world's biggest cruise ship. Wonder of the Seas and its four sister vessels — Oasis of the Seas Allure of the Seas Harmony of the Seas and Symphony of the Seas — will remain the queens of the megaship world when measured by total interior space.

For more cruise guides news and tips sign up for TPG's cruise newsletter.

After its debut MSC World Europa will fall just behind them in the rankings of the world's largest cruise ships at No. 6.

In all MSC World Europa will measure about 205000 tons — about 10% less than the five Royal Caribbean ships known as the Oasis class. However smaller is relative. At 205000 tons MSC World Europa still will be significantly bigger than any vessel currently operated by any line other than Royal Caribbean; this includes such cruising rivals as Carnival Cruise Line Norwegian Cruise Line and Princess Cruises.

Like the Oasis-class ships MSC World Europa will be able to hold nearly 7000 passengers with all berths filled — 6762 to be exact.

In other words this is going to be one serious megaship.

Here's a preview of what to expect from MSC World Europa when it begins sailing later this year.

What's the layout of MSC World Europa?

An artist's drawing of the promenade area planned for MSC World Europa. MSC CRUISES

MSC Cruises is taking a page from Royal Caribbean's playbook by breaking down the ship's public areas into distinct districts.

MSC World Europa will have an adults-only ""Zen district"" and a separate ""family district"" that will house 10 new kids facilities. There will also be a central interior promenade called World Galleria complete with entertainment shops and bars.

The public areas of Royal Caribbean's Oasis-class ships are famously broken down into seven or eight separate districts which Royal Caribbean calls neighborhoods.

The promenade on MSC World Europa will open onto an area at the back of the ship that is home to a record-sized slide. MSC CRUISES

Notably the 341-foot promenade on MSC World Europa will be half-open to the sky and half-covered by an LED ""sky screen""; the screen will light up with different displays throughout the day.

One of the signature features of the promenade will be The Venom Drop @ The Spiral a record-breaking dry slide that plunges 11 decks and ends near the promenade area.

How many pools are there on MSC World Europa?

MSC World Europa will have six pools and 14 hot tubs making it one of the most pool-covered ships at sea.

The watery offerings will include an Aquapark with multiple waterslides that MSC Cruises says will integrate virtual reality technology. There also will be a family sun deck.

How many restaurants does MSC World Europa have?

MSC World Europa will feature a chocolate-themed cafe created by famed chocolatier Jean-Philippe Maury. MSC CRUISES

MSC World Europa will have 13 dining venues including six specialty restaurants.

Two new-for-the-line venues will be Chef's Garden Kitchen (an outlet focused on microgreens) and La Pescaderia a traditional seafood grill with alfresco seating.

Restaurants that already exist on other MSC Cruises ships will also be featured on MSC World Europa. These include the American-style steakhouse Butcher's Cut the Asian-inspired Kaito Teppanyaki and Sushi Bar and the Latin American street food-inspired Hola! Tacos and Cantina.

In a twist the ship will have three separate buffet restaurants each with its own ambiance.

MSC World Europa will also feature a craft beer bar serving brews made on board — a first for MSC Cruises. Dubbed the Masters of the Sea Pub it'll span two decks.

Other drinking venues will include a cocktail bar called Elixir – Mixology Bar and a South Asian-style tea room filled with perfumes from the East. There will also be a widely stocked Gin Bar.

What are the entertainment options?

MSC CRUISES

As one would expect from one of the world's largest ships MSC World Europa will be chock-full of entertainment venues both big and small including — get this — a venue that will host roller disco parties and serve as a bumper cars pavilion (the latter is something we've seen only on Royal Caribbean ships).

These entertainment venues will include:

A multistory venue called the Panorama Lounge at the back of the ship which will be home to ""immersive"" entertainment.

A main 1153-seat theater dubbed the World Theatre that'll be the place for big production shows.

A family-friendly multifunctional entertainment venue called Luna Park Arena which will host movies game shows kids activities and themed parties.

MSC Cruises in September announced the Luna Park Arena would host three concert-style shows — all new for the line. They'll include a ""Symphonic Ibiza"" show that combines a big-screen orchestra modern Euro dance music three specialty artists dancers a DJ two vocalists and a club-style atmosphere. Also planned is a ""K Pop party"" where partygoers will learn dance routines and sing along with K-pop hits accompanied by street dancers acrobats and vocalists.

In addition MSC Cruises announced the World Theatre would be home to five full-scale theater productions — all also new for the line. One of them to be called ""Yellow Submarine"" will feature circus elements based on Beatles songs.

The line also said the Panorama Lounge would be home to four 90-minute music experiences that offer a mix of live bands dancers singers aerialists and acrobats. The dancing on display during these performances will range from samba and tango to waltz disco and lindy hop.

Does MSC World Europa have a kids area?

Developed in collaboration with Lego and Chicco (and featuring play areas that include lots of their products) the children's area on MSC World Europa will spread over seven rooms and 8200 square feet. This is more space than the children's areas on any other MSC Cruises ship.

Each of the seven rooms will be dedicated to a distinct age group ranging from infants to 17 years old.

What kind of cabins can you book on MSC World Europa?

MSC World Europa will offer 19 different types of cabins seven of which are new for the line.

Among them: cabins and suites with balconies that overlook the ship's interior promenade and giant duplex MSC Yacht Club suites with living and dining room areas.

In addition the ship will have the line's first ""infinite ocean view"" cabins with walls of glass facing the sea that open from the top down to create a balcony-like effect. It's a concept that first debuted on an ocean ship in 2018 on Celebrity Cruises' 2908-passenger Celebrity Edge.

Where will MSC World Europa cruise?

MSC World Europa will debut in December in the Persian Gulf with sailings that include a visit to Saudi Arabia — a destination rarely visited by cruise ships.

The vessel will initially sail a four-night Persian Gulf voyage from Doha Qatar to Dubai on Dec. 20. Then it will begin a series of seven-night voyages from Dubai. The seven-night voyages will feature calls at Abu Dhabi United Arab Emirates; Dammam Saudi Arabia; Doha; and Sir Bani Yas Island. The latter is a beach and wildlife-viewing destination in the UAE that will be exclusive to MSC World Europa passengers during their visit.

In late March 2023 MSC World Europa will reposition to the Mediterranean for a series of seven-night voyages to ports in Italy France Malta and Spain.

Eventually MSC World Europa (or a yet-to-be-built sister ship) is likely to operate sailings in the Caribbean out of Florida. However such itineraries have yet to be set.

MSC World Europa will be the first of four sister ships scheduled to debut between 2022 and 2027 that will make up a new class for MSC Cruises called the World class.

New York City NY May 13 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

In a whirlwind of market movements Solana experiences a dip while Shiba Inu surges by 1% setting the stage for a captivating showdown. Amidst this backdrop Furrever Token steps into the spotlight with a bold move: a $20000 competition. As investors monitor the fluctuations of Solana and the meteoric rise of Shiba Inu the crypto community eagerly anticipates whether Furrever Token's innovative approach and lucrative incentives will propel it ahead of the competition.

Solana's Price Analysis: Potential Movement Towards $160 Level

Solana (SOL) is showing signs of preparation for a potential price movement above the $160 level. The intersection of this mentioned price level with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) appears to be a significant development for the price. Historically this EMA level has been considered a robust indicator for medium-term market movements serving as a strong resistance or support level relevant to the market direction. A breakthrough above this level could trigger a strong uptrend for Solana potentially pushing the price to higher levels.

However the market's bearish outlook and existing low trading volumes are increasingly complicating this scenario. Historical data suggests that the decrease in volume reflects a lack of optimism regarding upward market movements. Traders' cautious approach indicates a preference for encountering more concrete data before taking definitive positions. A price movement towards $160 for Solana could instill confidence among investors and contribute to trading activities. Another technical indicator to monitor is the potential ""neckline"" movement at the $160 level which if breached could signify significant price movements as observed in chart formations like head and shoulders or inverse head and shoulders.

Shiba Inu Analyst Predicts 3000% Rally: Here's Why

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has garnered attention as widely followed analyst Davie Satoshi forecasts a potential 3000% rally for the meme-based cryptocurrency in the current bull season. Davie expressed his optimism about SHIB's future in a recent X post highlighting its resilience and potential for significant returns. Historical data particularly SHIB's performance post-Bitcoin's last halving supports this bullish sentiment with gains surpassing 800000%. Despite market volatility Shiba Inu has maintained its position among the top 20 cryptocurrencies showcasing its enduring capacity. Davie's prediction suggests SHIB could surge to new highs reaching between $0.0002251 and $0.0006753 within the next year. This forecast aligns with the bullish outlook of other analysts indicating growing confidence in Shiba Inu's potential to outperform in the current market landscape.

Text description provided by the architects. This project is a weekend house in the mountains of the Sierra de Arteaga in the state of Coahuila in northern Mexico. The house is laid out on the slope of an old orchard in mountainous surroundings to have minimal impact on the site and natural vegetation. This solution also ensured the best views as the orchard vegetation is much more open and lower than the surrounding forest.

The house is divided into three parts: an elongated 40 m × 10 m rectangle defining enclosed areas of shelter the services at each end and a central social area around the fireplace. All these areas are connected by a long terrace looking directly towards the mountains through a sequence of beams and pillars forming the external structure of the house while framing the natural landscape.

The volume is perforated with courtyards that break up the program and bring natural light inside.

The largest of these contains a staircase leading up to the roof where there are 360-degree views over the valley and the mountains.

The construction comprises exposed concrete walls pillars and beams poured with horizontal formwork metalwork details and large glass panels with aluminum frames. The site also contains a viewpoint and firepit that is independent of the house and an outdoor table seating up to 20 both constructed as concrete monoliths.

The house is understood as a kind of sanctuary where its users move away from the city and meet nature. The house allows them to connect with their natural environment generating a deep awareness of the place resources and the world they inhabit safely and pleasantly.

Although the house belongs to a family the experience of going to their refuge in the mountains generates moments of reflection and self-discovery for each of its members according to their ages their roles and family responsibilities. The house is understood as a refuge and an observatory an instrument to observe the landscape the mountains and the forest and feel the time passing by."

INDIANAPOLIS — One of the largest employers in central Indiana said earlier this year it would support workers who are worried about access to abortion up to arranging for them to relocate.

In a Thursday interview with CNN anchor Poppy Harlow Salesforce Co-CEO Marc Benioff cited the company's stance opposing 2015 religious freedom legislation in Indiana when Harlow asked him about abortion restrictions and bans specifically in states like Indiana.

Benioff replied saying he supports providing additional options and resources for employees in cities and states that don't support equality and dignity.

""We have to be for equality. We have to be for dignity. We have to be for the equality and dignity of every human being. And if you're not for equality and dignity then you know this is not something that I can work with and we're going to have to exit your city or your state just as we have in many places"" he said.

Benioff's implication did not include a full pullout of Indiana staff but rather referenced relocation support of Salesforce workers who were seeking abortion care that would not be made available due to Indiana's restrictions.

So what's up first today? As per usual this morning's keynote will be led by Salesforce co-CEOs Marc Benioff and Bret Taylor. The opening Dreamforce keynote is always a sight to behold and often features celebrity cameos and music performances alongside the latest tech updates and news. If you want to tune in to watch online there's a link here.

Here we go

Salesforce co-CEOs Marc Benioff and Bret Taylor hit the stage to kick off the 20th edition of Dreamforce delivering a few awkward high-fives and fist-bumps to members of the audience on the way. The title of the keynote: The Great Reunion to mark the first in-person Dreamforce since before the pandemic.

""This is a new day for Dreamforce"" says Benioff. ""We need to approach this new day with a 'beginner's mind' asking what do we really want? What's important to us?"" The crowd looks as equally bemused as I am but I assume this is going somewhere...

Benioff goes on to talk about the kinds of values important to both Salesforce and its customers: trust customers success innovation equality and sustainability. ""We want to help you connect with your customers in a whole new way by building a whole new version of Customer 360"" he says. ""You'll see that new version today."" (Image credit: Future)

ANNOUNCEMENT: Salesforce Carbon Credit Marketplace

Salesforce has announced the launch of a carbon credits marketplace with the ambition to clear the path to net zero emissions for customers. The new Net Zero Marketplace is said to make the purchasing of carbon credits simpler and more transparent connecting buyers with pre-vetted carbon credit providers whose projects have been audited by third-party ratings agencies. The marketplace is not designed to replace organic means of cutting back emissions (like minimizing travel or localizing supply chains) but rather supplement existing projects. More on this later.

One trillion trees

Separately Benioff provides an update on the company's plan to plant one trillion trees to help offset the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere. “We now feel confident we’ll achieve this objective by 2030” he announces.

Slack time

It’s time to hear about Slack which was acquired by Salesforce last year and the new integrations between the collaboration platform and the Customer 360 portfolio. Benioff invites to the stage Tamar Yehoshua Slack’s Chief Product Officer to talk about the latest developments. (Image credit: Future)

ANNOUNCEMENT: Slack Canvas

Slack has lifted the lid on a major new addition to its platform which it says could go some way to addressing a number of common bottlenecks for customers. Slack Canvas gives collaborators a new way to collect organize and share data using persistent and highly customizable information panels. These so-called ""canvases"" are attached by default to every channel and can be created manually for one-off projects or events. Not only can users embed contextual information data and multimedia content into canvases but they can also complete everyday tasks in situ courtesy of the third-party integrations already available in Slack. ""Canvas will help people to be more productive in their digital HQ by giving them a surface that makes it easier to access the information they need to get their job done"" Yehoshua told TechRadar Pro ahead of the show. ""We hope people will be able to onboard employees more quickly to close deals faster to resolve incidents faster by having that information more readily available in a consistent location in this persistent layer."" For more info read our full write-up here . (Image credit: Slack)

ANNOUNCEMENT: Video conferencing comes to Slack Huddles

Slack has also announced it is expanding its impromptu meeting feature Huddles which will now support video conferencing. Designed to simulate informal office conversations the Huddles feature is moving away from its original audio-only format and towards something a little more complete. Not only can users now enable video but they'll also benefit from multi-person screensharing emoji reactions and more. For more details click here . (Image credit: Slack)

There are also 15 new Salesforce integrations for Slack specific to various products housed within Customer 360 (e.g. Sales Cloud for Slack Flow in Slack etc.).

Customer 360

Bret Taylor returns to the stage to talk through the new developments across the Customer 360 portfolio. ""I've never been more excited about the strength of our core platform"" he says. ""The pace of innovation has never been faster.""

ANNOUNCEMENT: Salesforce Genie

Salesforce has detailed what it describes as the ""biggest innovation"" to come to its CRM and sales enablement platform in the last two decades. The new addition Salesforce Genie is a service designed to unify customer data typically siloed across different channels and applications into a single multi-use profile. The objective is to help its users enable a personalized experience for each of their customers informed by the most complete and up-to-date set of information on previous interactions with that individual. We’ll have more on this later. (Image credit: Salesforce)

Real-time real-time real-time

“We’ve completely reimagined our CRM from the ground up to enable applications that simply weren’t possible before” says Taylor. “With Genie we’ve added a foundational new feature: a real-time hyperscale data platform. It’s all about the data; you can inject real-time and historical data to create a single source of truth.” “This changes the game for CRM. Salesforce Customer 360 is the world's first real-time CRM.""

Salesforce Genie is available as of today Taylor confirms.

The keynote is pretty much wrapping up here. We're hearing a little about how customers like Ford and L'Oreal are using Salesforce Genie to optimize their operations but it doesn't feel like any further feature announcements are on the way. Next we'll be heading to the press conference where Benioff and Taylor will answer questions on the updates to the Salesforce platform.

I assume they'll remove the bunny ears (a nod to the new Salesforce Genie mascot) before facing the press.... (Image credit: Future)

Press conference

We're here waiting for Benioff and Taylor to appear for the post-keynote press conference. Salesforce has kindly felled a few Christmas trees a couple of months early to give us something to look at in the meantime. (Image credit: Future)

Q&A

After recapping the announcements made during the keynote Taylor and Benioff will now field a few questions.

Question: Will the new products help Salesforce accelerate growth in EMEA? Taylor: ""We have a huge presence in Europe and it's been a huge pillar for growth much of which has been around vertical-specific solutions. This will continue going forward."" ""We're really trying to make sure that not only do we grow but we're also really inspired by where Europe is going in terms of the environment and data privacy which is reflected in our product roadmap.""

Question: How do we move past the hesitancy still hanging over businesses as a result of the pandemic? Benioff: ""In the last two years there was a buying fever but when I model data I always throw away the bottom and top number."" ""What we went through in the last few years was different to everything we've been through. Now we need to pick up the trajectory we left off."" ""The fundamental core markets are obviously still real. There's a lot of activity irrespective of macro factors.""

Question: How have you both found the transition to a co-CEO model? Taylor: ""Marc is my mentor and friend. And we were also friends before colleagues which is part of why our partnership works."" ""In the face of all the complexity I'm very grateful to have a partner. For CEOs it can feel very lonely at the top."" The happy couple on-stage. (Image credit: Future)

Question: Tell us about Salesforce's thinking when it comes to addressing climate change Benioff: ""Climate change is probably the biggest challenge humanity has gone through. When we started Salesforce sustainability wasn't a core value but it is today. We want to be an example to others."" ""Our goals are for everybody to go net zero (this is extremely important) to sequester two gigatons of carbon [via reforestation] and to set the stage for the 'ecopreneur' revolution.""

Salesforce Genie

Our full write-up of the Salesforce Genie launch is live here. Historically businesses have struggled to harness the full potential of their customer data as a consequence of their complex and disorganized IT estates which leave data stranded in isolated pockets. Salesforce Genie works to resolve this problem by ingesting and ""harmonizing"" the various disparate sources of data creating a comprehensive customer graph that can be used to inform sales efforts and personalize the customer experience.

Taking the complexity out of the push for net zero

To round out the first day of Dreamforce TechRadar Pro sat down with Ari Alexander head of Salesforce Net Zero Cloud to talk through the company's new carbon credit marketplace. Built atop Salesforce Commerce Cloud the marketplace connects buyers with a selection of pre-vetted carbon credit providers whose projects have been audited by third-party ratings agencies. The providers are involved in projects ranging from forest conservation to tree planting wind farms and more. ""We feel strongly that companies need to deeply decarbonize and set out aggressive plans to do so. But we also recognize we can't afford to wait for certain actions that are outside their control. The hard truth is that today no company can decarbonize exclusively through its own decision making - it's a very complex value chain"" said Alexander. ""We think carbon credits play an important role in taking climate action now as part of the short- medium- and long-term planning that goes along with deeply decarbonizing in the places you control."" For more read our full write-up here. (Image credit: Future)

Good morning

Welcome to another day of CRM-related goodness at Dreamforce 2022. It'll likely be a quieter day for news but there are still a number of sessions and keynotes and TechRadar Pro will also be speaking to a few Salesforce execs. First up a keynote on the latest updates to Salesforce Commerce Cloud.

ANNOUNCEMENT: Salesforce partners with WhatsApp to build business messaging into Customer 360

We'll have more on this later but Salesforce has announced that customers will soon benefit from a new integration with WhatsApp. The partnership will give users a way to communicate directly with their customers with WhatsApp-first business messaging built directly into the Salesforce platform. “Our customers are engaging audiences in the US and globally which requires them to constantly find ways to improve the customer experience by connecting every customer touchpoint into a source of truth to create truly personalized experiences at scale” said Michael Affronti General Manager of Messaging at Salesforce. “WhatsApp-first business messaging enables every Salesforce customer to provide personal and conversational experiences that increase sales improve customer service and engage customers wherever they are.”

Commerce keynote

Taking to the stage is Kelly Thacker CMO of Retail and Consumer Goods to talk about the ways in which Salesforce Commerce Cloud can help customers maximize revenue streams. ""The pandemic has ushered in a whole new generation of digital buyers"" she says. ""To win in this market it's important to bring together digital and physical interactions to create hyper-personalized and hyper-compelling interactions."" (Image credit: Future)

Thacker introduces Scott Gillespie head of Commerce Cloud to talk through what's new with the platform. The headline announcement is Commerce Genie the integration of Salesforce's new data unification service into Commerce Cloud. The goal is to give customer the ability to utilize real-time data to inform commerce strategy. I'm guessing we'll be diving into the nitty-gritty later in the session.

ANNOUNCEMENTS: Commerce Marketplace Digital Subscription App Direct to Consumer App

Salesforce announces the general availability of its Digital Subscription App designed to help businesses create recurring revenue streams and its Direct to Consumer App. Separately the company teased its upcoming marketplace service which will take the complexity out of launching new marketplace offerings for both b2c and b2b companies. Available some time next year the new service should help customers to diversify their revenue streams. Those were three quick-fire announcements with scant detail but the marketplace offering in particular sounds like it could be a blessing for businesses investigating the opportunities associated with bringing third-party products into their online stores.

Salesforce Payments

New payment methods are also coming to Commerce Cloud stores including Afterpay and Venmo. Deploying these new methods will be as simple as toggling the options in the back end Salesforce says. We're not totally clear on this but it sounds like (with the help of Salesforce Genie) different payment methods will be surfaced to different people depending on previous interactions with that individual.

The keynote is coming to a close but first a little on automation. Salesforce says it's making it easier to ""pick and pack"" from online stores. With a new store fulfilment app associates can quickly identify orders that need to be actioned helping to reduce the time it takes for buyers to receive their products.

A little break in proceedings now before the Net Zero keynote in roughly an hour's time. To recap Salesforce yesterday announced its very own carbon credits marketplace the goal of which is to make the purchasing of offsets easier and more transparent. Built atop Salesforce Commerce Cloud the new marketplace connects buyers with a selection of pre-vetted carbon credit providers whose projects have been audited by third-party ratings agencies.

Net Zero keynote

After a few laps of the Moscone Center hunting for the right theatre we're in place for the net zero keynote where we'll hear a little more from Salesforce about its plans to accelerate the drive towards net zero. On stage is Suzanne DiBianca EVP and Chief Impact Officer. (Image credit: Future)

""Now is the opportunity to flatten the curve and then to bring it down"" says DiBianca in reference to the growing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. She goes on to talk about the importance of both cutting emissions and creating new ways to sequester carbon like tree-planting. Salesforce itself is aiming to reduce its emissions by 50% by 2030 and is already running its real estate and data centers on renewable energy.

Ecopreneurs

Repeatedly Salesforce has made reference to the concept of ""ecopreneurs"" during the show. The idea is to give talented people the tools they need to develop products that help businesses minimize their carbon footprint without placing a tax on operations. Alongside hurrying towards net zero and pursuing sequestration projects supporting ecopreneurs will be a critical part of the Salesforce sustainability strategy. What specifically this might look like presumably time will tell.

Net Zero Marketplace

DiBianca now touches on the company's carbon credits marketplace. She nods towards common concerns with carbon offsetting around efficacy and fraud but explains the company nonetheless thinks the practice will play an important role in the years ahead.

Marc Benioff on stage

Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff takes to the stage for a ""fireside chat"" with Jane Goodall anthropologist and zoologist. Goodall is perhaps most famous for being the first scientist to observe chimpanzees crafting tools from twigs leaves and the like. (Image credit: Future)

""Our species is at the start of a very long very dark tunnel. At the other end is a bright star: hope"" says Goodall in reference to the long road towards repairing the damage to the environment. ""Every one of us has an impact on the planet every single day and we have to decide what we want that impact to be."" ""We need more collaboration more partnerships more working together. At the moment people aren't thinking holistically. For example closing one coal mine may lead to an increase in local poverty itself a driver of emissions.""

Benioff asks whether Goodall is hopeful about the campaign to curtail the warming of the planet and what avenues she suggests individuals and businesses should pursue. ""People are beginning to understand what we need to do. Unfortunately for most governments and corporations profit comes first"" she responds. ""That's why I have great hope for young people. If we can't learn to live in harmony with nature we'll never live in peace. We need to find the will to act.""

That's it for the keynotes today but we'll be back later with more on the WhatsApp partnership and comments from the heads of Salesforce Sales Cloud and Platform.

The post-Covid sales environment

A few interesting comments from Ketan Karkhanis GM of Sales Cloud on the ways in which the pandemic has changed the lives of sales professionals. ""The pandemic has has a profound impact on sales"" he told TechRadar Pro. ""Before sales was a contact sport; salespeople would walk the hallways read body language and have serendipitous interactions. But all of this was taken away."" ""Buyers are now digital-first and even-digital only. You need to be ready to meet them where they want to meet you in the digital world.""

Although building connections and sealing deals over video call has proved difficult for sales professionals there is a silver lining to the digital-only approach Karkhanis noted. ""The outcome of these changes is that buyers and sellers are leaving digital breadcrumbs everywhere. They're in your CRM yes but also in emails voice calls video calls and more."" ""Each breadcrumb is a nugget of gold. The question for businesses is how to harness this opportunity how to decipher and operationalize this data."" The integration of Salesforce Genie the company's new data unification service into Sales Cloud is intended to solve this precise problem.

Salesforce is getting into bed with WhatsApp

Salesforce and WhatsApp have entered into a new partnership that will bring instant messaging facilities to the Customer 360 platform. The partnership announced during Dreamforce 2022 will give businesses a new way to communicate with customers courtesy of WhatsApp integrations for multiple Salesforce CRM applications. The arrangement will set the stage for “convenient integrated and personalized experiences between people and businesses” says Salesforce as well as catering to the demand for greater consistency across communication channels. “WhatsApp-first business messaging enables every Salesforce customer to provide personal and conversational experiences that increase sales improve customer service and engage customers wherever they are"" said Michael Affronti GM of Messaging at Salesforce. For more check out the full story. (Image credit: Salesforce)

Low-code revolution

In conversation with TechRadar Pro Patrick Stokes GM of Salesforce Platform spoke about the momentum behind the low-code movement and the kinds of door it will open for businesses. ""Customers are excited [about low-code] largely become it democratizes who can build"" he said. ""Developers are expensive and there are only so many of them in the world and businesses need to move fast."" ""But more importantly when you democratize application development you're bringing people in who are closer to the process you're trying to automate or the app you're trying to build."" ""If they can be involved you're going to get a better product than if you were to ship a set of requirements to a developer who might be four steps removed from the business problem you're trying to resolve.""

That's your lot for day two of Dreamforce 2022. Join us again tomorrow for a final morning of keynotes and sessions.

The final day

Welcome to the final day of Dreamforce 2022. As before we'll be bringing you all the new product announcements as well as coverage of the keynote sessions. There's less going on today at the show but hopefully there will still be a few bits and bobs worth sharing.

First up TechRadar Pro will be speaking to Scott Gillespie GM Commerce Cloud to hear more about how the product updates unveiled by Salesforce will impact his platform.

Scratch that Gillespie has had to pull out of the interview. We'll be heading over to the main keynote of the day instead which will offer a deep dive into the new use cases for Salesforce Genie. To recap Genie is the company's new data unification service designed to make possible a new level of personalization by creating a comprehensive picture of previous customer interactions updated in real-time.

SSOP 2022 featured a session outlining the activities being undertaken by the operating partners and explorers in South Sudan's energy sector

JUBA South Sudan: The first day of the Fifth Edition of the South Sudan Oil & Power Conference ( featured a session of keynotes and presentations that offered an overview of the activities undertaken by operating partners service companies and explorers in South Sudan's energy sector. Following keynote presentations by Dr. Chol Deng Thon Abel Managing Director of Nilepet and Godfrey Moagi CEO of the Strategic Fuel Fund the session featured presentations by Joseph Gama Projects and Facilities Manager for Dar Petroleum Operating Company; Gieth Abraham Dauson Section Head of Planning for the Greater Pioneer Operating Company; and Eng. Ochan Stephen Lochi Petroleum and Well Integrity Engineer at the Sudd Petroleum Operating Company. The session featured an additional speech by Miguel Baptista Managing Director for Central East and Southern Africa Schlumberger.

The discussion which focused on strategies to uplift South Sudan's Energy Sector in 2022 was opened by Dr. Abel who highlighted that South Sudan's vibrant upstream sector is ripe with business opportunities and is ready to welcome international partners.

“Nilepet's mission is to enhance the sustainability and growth of the oil and gas industry in South Sudan through effective and efficient exploration development production and marketing of the petroleum products while safeguarding the national interest and guaranteeing higher returns for the nation through social responsibility and an environmentally friendly manner” stated Dr. Abel.

Speaking under the theme: Gateway to East African Energy Moagi expressed his optimism for the future of South Sudan in the presence of Ministers technicians engineers and experts who participated in the conference for the purpose of unlocking the country's exploration frontiers.

“Today we are talking as if renewable energy can carry the baseload. We are going to have to run parallel systems to make sure we transition effectively” stated Moagi adding that“We need to be mindful of how we move forward how we transition and we need to make sure it is at the scale we expect to carry the demand. However we need to carry on and keep moving.”

A presentation by Dar Petroleum Operating Company which was headed by Gama highlighted the company's vision as the country's premier operating company within the country committed to executing all its activities within full compliance to industrially accepted health and safety executive standards.

Additionally Dauson underlined South Sudan's Greater Pioneer Operating Company's commitment to local content within the energy sector emphasizing its commitment to addressing challenges sustainable development and growth opportunities within the country's petroleum sector.

Ushering in a new era of energy growth and economic revitalization the Sudd Petroleum Operating Company held a presentation led by Eng. Lochi outlining its intention to increase production at its Thar Jath field and restart production at the Mala field by 2023 emphasizing its intention to partner with private sector companies to meet production targets.

Miguel Baptista Managing Director for Central East and Southern Africa at Schlumberger held a speech during which he discussed the potential opportunities within South Sudan's oil field service operations space making fundamental insights on the importance of accelerating East African energy developments.

“The best way for us to gauge the level of development of a country is by looking at the energy consumption per capita of the country. That is the best proxy we have today to see if a country is developed or developing” Baptista stated concluding that“Going forward Schlumberger is focusing on our core business which basically challenges ourselves to keep developing technologies and pioneer within the core oil and gas industries so we can continue to maintain fossil fuels that are sustainable.”",,,,,,,,,

Ultimately any digitisation effort has to benefit its customers and agents – the two main stakeholders of its transformation strategy.

“If our internal teams come to us and show us 60 forms that they want to put online we’ll ask them not to as that’s not digitisation and won’t benefit customers” said Gary Teh managing director of group IT at Great Eastern.

That focus has guided the insurer’s digital transformation journey which began in 2018 when it started empowering its agents with digital tools to facilitate remote sign-ups of policies. The initiative paid off during the pandemic as it has enabled agents to continue transacting with customers during lockdowns.

On the customer front Great Eastern has also built an app for customers to manage their policies and premium payments among other capabilities. Teh said a lot of effort has been put into the app to ensure it delivers a good user experience.

That includes making sure the company’s back-end infrastructure can support the front-end capabilities of its digital tools starting with “painstaking” efforts to get rid of its legacy systems including a general insurance core system that ran on an IBM AS/400 said Teh.

“We went through a complete core system replacement and put in a modern architecture that’s cloud-native and API [application programming interface]-enabled to support interactions with our front-end tools” he said.

At the same time it also modernised its ageing life insurance system by “hollowing out the core” and rewriting key processes into microservices. Teh said the move has made it easier for the life insurance system to connect with front-end applications – and most notably enable actuaries to model new products.

He said: “We are probably one of the few insurers where our product development teams can use a product engine to model a new product and commit their models automatically to the back end with the click of a button.”

Like many financial services organisations Great Eastern has been investing in cloud-based infrastructure and container platforms. It has built its own private cloud because of regulatory uncertainty around public cloud usage at the time when it embarked on its cloud programme.

“Everything that we have in our private cloud today can be switched over to public cloud whenever we are ready” said Teh noting that the company expects to operate a hybrid cloud environment in time to come.

Meanwhile the private cloud investments have paid off enabling the insurer to not only launch new products quickly but also scale up its infrastructure to meet peak demand especially for popular savings plans that could generate a multifold spike in sales volume. “With cloud we can easily spin off more containers to capture the volume” said Teh.

Also Teh said the move to cloud has reduced hardware investments by 33% accelerated software development and enabled actuarial teams to launch simple products as soon as within a week.

Indonesian e-commerce unicorn Bukalapak’s multicloud strategy underpinned by the use of microservices and DevOps has enabled it to meet the diverse needs of its users while addressing business requirements.

Property tech firm PropertyGuru has invested in capabilities such as DevOps and authentication that can be applied across different platforms it has acquired over time.

The Australian Red Cross adopted a new integration platform to manage the surge in donations in response to the floods in New South Wales and Queensland earlier this year.

Great Eastern’s move to the cloud is not yet complete however. The company is still in the process of re-platforming more than 100 applications rather than take a lift-and-shift approach said Teh.

“The cloud programme is touching everyone in my team and everyone is encouraged to at least bring their applications to the PaaS [platform-as-a-service] or container level” he said. “We are taking a lot of time to do code refactoring so this part of the journey is going to be longer.”

Amid the faster pace of digitisation security has remained top of mind for Teh – a seasoned IT executive who is passionate about cyber security.

“As early in 2018 we knew we had to do something about cyber security when we launched all these digital tools so we invested in things like multifactor authentication and secure VPN [virtual private network]” he said adding that the foresight had enabled the company to support a remote workforce at the onset of the pandemic.

Secure development is also on the agenda with security being embedded into Great Eastern’s DevOps processes. Besides deploying container security controls the company has also implemented a cloud access security broker as well as processes such as software composition analysis and static application security testing. Teh expects his team to be set up for DevSecOps before the end of the year.

A key part of Teh’s change management strategy is the well-known concept of two-speed IT in which one team works on a fast track that allows agile and innovative projects to be implemented quickly while another continues to keep existing systems stable without disruption to the business.

But over time most organisations will see the need to evolve to a common IT operating model particularly with the shift to cloud. That includes not only IT but also other business functions such as finance which would want to know how spending on cloud infrastructure for example could be tracked and accounted for.

To address cloud cost governance Great Eastern has put in place a cloud management platform that enables users to pick the cloud resources they need for their projects and the cost of the resources is charged back to each project. “With the transparency finance was very comfortable as they would know exactly how much we are spending on each project” said Teh.

Moving forward the insurer will explore the use of public cloud services particularly virtual private cloud (VPC) services offered by major hyperscalers. “We’re doing a pilot on a VPC to test the concept of cloud bursting for data modelling which requires more compute” said Teh.",,,,,,,,,,,,

SHW,Sherwin-Williams,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc3VyYW5jZWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvMjAyMi8wOS8yMy82MTA1NTcuaHRt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Federal Appeals Court Upends $6M Lead Paint Verdict From 2019,"A federal appeals court has cleared one paint manufacturer and ordered a retrial for two others in a case in which a jury in 2019 awarded $6 million to three men whose brain damage was blamed on their years of exposure to lead paint.

The U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals cleared paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams while ordering a new trial for two others Armstrong and DuPont.

The federal court found that the district court judge in the 2019 jury trial improperly expanded the scope of the state’s risk contribution theory of liability with regard to lead paint to let the jury find liability where it should not have.

Under the risk contribution theory a plaintiff does not have to prove that a specific defendant’s conduct caused his injury. Instead liability can be apportioned among the “pool of defendants” that could have caused the injury.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court in a decision in 2005 (Thomas ex rel. Gramling v. Mallett) applied the risk contribution theory of liability only to makers of a paint ingredient known as white lead carbonate; it did not extend it to paint makers that did not themselves manufacture that ingredient but used another company’s carbonate in their products.

The three manufacturing defendants argued that the risk-contribution theory applies to them only if they manufactured white lead carbonate which they did not. The court agreed:

“[T]he Wisconsin Supreme Court has made clear that such companies are liable under the risk contribution theory only in their capacity as manufacturers of white lead carbonate pigment. As a practical matter this means that a paint manufacturer cannot be liable under the risk contribution theory for selling a finished product that contains another company’s white lead carbonate. Only the manufacturer of the white lead carbonate can be liable.”

The lower court’s error requires a new trial because it “significantly expanded the scope of the defendants’ potential liability and the evidence at trial. It also deprived the defendants of the opportunity to build an appropriate defense” the 7th circuit opinion (Glenn Burton Jr. v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours) states.

Judge Amy St. Eve in the 62-page opinion for the court noted that for years the defendant paint manufacturers had litigated under the assumption that they were liable only in their capacity as pigment manufacturers. Less than six weeks before trial however the defendants learned for the first time that they were also subject to liability as manufacturers of paint products containing white lead carbonate.

“The court’s last-minute legally incorrect ruling left them scrambling to adapt their defenses to the plaintiffs’ newly enlarged theory of liability” St. Eve wrote.

The lower district trial court based its more expansive reading of Thomas on the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s use of the word “marketed.” The district court maintained that a company that sells lead-based paint is “marketing” lead pigment even if it is not “producing” it. Thus the court reasoned a paint manufacturer could be liable for selling paint containing another company’s white lead carbonate. In disagreeing with this approach the federal court called it a “strained interpretation of marketing.”

The appeals court also found that the lower court erred in allowing testimony on lead paint’s effect on IQ from a witness without questioning the reliability of the unprecedented methodology set forth by the witness.

The federal government banned lead-based paint for residential use in 1978 and Wisconsin followed suit in 1980. Even after these bans however lead-based paint remained on the walls of many homes throughout the country.

The plaintiffs in these consolidated Wisconsin cases are three young men who grew up in Milwaukee homes that had lead-based paint on the walls. They were diagnosed with lead poisoning as young children in the 1990s or early 2000s. Years later they sued several manufacturers of white lead carbonate seeking compensation for brain damage and other injuries resulting from their ingestion of lead paint particles.

After years of pretrial litigation the plaintiffs went to trial against five manufacturers of white lead carbonate. The jury found three of the manufacturers liable and awarded the plaintiffs $2 million each. The three defendants found liable were E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. SherwinWilliams Co. and Armstrong Containers. The three appealed challenging a long list of the district court’s rulings.

The appeals court concluded that Sherwin-Williams is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; Armstrong is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the strict liability claims and a new trial on the negligence claims and DuPont is entitled to a new trial on both claims.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tLzIwMjQtY29sb3Itb2YtdGhlLXllYXItMzcxMzc5MzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Warm Sunny Hue Will Be Big in 2024 According to Trend Forecasters,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tLzIwMjQtY29sb3Itb2YtdGhlLXllYXItMzcxMzc5MzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674004EE00>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

As the heart of the home we tend to spend a lot of time in this functional space (including those groggy early morning starts) and so you want to choose a color that will always be happy to greet you.

Whichever color you choose is also likely to be part of your home for several years. As such you want a shade that's on-trend enough for a modern kitchen while also having a timeless quality that will endure the years to come.

Anyone who's kept an eye on the latest color trends will know that this year has been all about embracing colorful hues and the vast options out there make it easier than ever to build a home that reflects your unique personality and style. And yet there are still some colors that just don't gel well with the atmosphere of a kitchen.

Color is subjective and realistically no color is out of the question - it's just a case of finding the right shade to compliment your space. With that in mind we've asked a few of our favorite designers and color experts for their advice on which colors it might be safest to avoid when designing your perfect kitchen.

Lilith Hudson Social Links Navigation Junior Writer Lilith is an expert at following news and trends across the world of interior design. She regularly shares color stories with readers to help them keep up-to-date with ever-changing trends that promise to add personality into the home as well as those you ought to avoid. For this piece she spoke with designers and color experts to learn which colors you shouldn't use in your kitchen and why.

1. Bright red

We all know color has the power to completely transform a space. While bright bold colors can be fabulous it takes a certain degree of bravery to use them in design as they come with greater risks.

'When choosing a color to paint your kitchen it is the intensity and shade of any given color that is really going to determine how the space feels along with how much of the color you use' explains Chloé Batteson interior designer at Batteson Studio .

As Chloé points out this is particularly the case with bright reds. Despite being a popular choice for colorful kitchen ideas scarlet and ruby hues can feel overwhelming especially under the brighter lights typically used in this room.

'These shades create drama and can make a kitchen feel overheated and tiring so they're best avoided unless you are aiming for a kitchen to be in and out of very quickly' says Chloé. 'Try more muted earthy tones instead for a calmer atmosphere.'

Tobie Lewis of Valspar paints is in agreement. 'The kitchen is a space where you should unwind and relax while cooking eating or hosting your friends' he says. 'For many the color red is a bit too powerful and quite distracting for this specific space.'

If you're still keen on adding brighter reds to your kitchen's color palette consider using it on smaller areas like your cabinets or cupboards as seen in this kitchen from Blakes London. 'This transforms the space by adding a pop of color into the room without being too dominant' Tobie adds.

2. Brilliant white

White kitchen ideas are the traditional choice for this room (and the walls of the home more generally). For most bright whites are the default option as they make the space look clean and fresh. However brilliant whites can make your space feel too clinical as well as being impractical we all recognize those stubborn tomato sauce stains on the wall after all.

'I wouldn’t recommend brilliant white as it creates a cold and clinical environment and is not conducive to a homely feel' Chloé says. 'As a manmade color it is the only one that does not appear in the natural world making it feel particularly jarring.'

When it comes to how to make a white kitchen look warm Chloé has some advice. She recommends looking at shades with warmer undertones like a soft pink or cream. A brilliant white can also work well with a gloss finish on your cabinets especially when contrasted with darker colors elsewhere. Try using a dark marble or granite countertop or backsplash for a timeless yet modern look.

3. Dark brown

Brown might not seem like a controversial color for the kitchen especially in light of the recent move towards more organic materials such as wooden kitchen cabinets. However as the saying goes you can have too much of a good thing.

The brown color trend certainly guarantees a modern look but it isn't always executed well in the kitchen. 'If you want to keep your kitchen color scheme neutral choosing shades of dark brown can leave the space feeling unwelcoming and uninviting the last thing you want for a room that should be the soul of the home' says Tobie.

In the case of browns the key to success is tonal layering. Avoid color drenching and sticking to one hue. For example you should avoid using dark walnut cabinetry alongside a dark brown wall. 'However pairing neutral tones together by using one or two darker tones for cabinets can keep things interesting' Tobie notes.

Try combining dark cabinets with a dark beige on the walls with splashes of cream thrown into the mix. This can create a more comforting homely feel instead of being oppressive.

4. Warm yellows

As an uplifting and cheery color yellow might seem ideal for the kitchen - after all drenching a room in this color is said to improve wellbeing. You might be tempted to add a warm glow with this shade so you're met by a sunny space when you wake up for your morning coffee even in the depths of winter. However it's a tone that experts encourage you to use wisely if at all.

'We advise people to stay away from warmer colors like yellow and orange' says designer Amy Youngblood owner of Amy Youngblood interiors. 'These colors can easily make a kitchen look outdated and feel closed in and stressful.'

To embrace sunny shades for a yellow kitchen idea she recommends using them on the cabinets instead of the walls for a bold statement that doesn't feel too overwhelming. You should also take into account the natural light in your room. West or south facing kitchens especially those with conservatories or skylights can be overbearing if painted yellow.

Instead try a cooler yellow with greenish undertones for a more relaxing space. 'This is because cooler colors create a sense of calmness and creams and white will actually make the space feel brighter' says Amy.",,,

While any dog can nip these breeds are known for their particularly sweet-tempered spirit as long as they are treated right. According to The Scotsman French Bulldogs are unlikely to snap at humans due to their calming nature meanwhile the Labrador Retriever is renowned for its friendly and loving personality.

""The Labrador certainly seems to be man's best friend in this country and has reigned for decades as 'top dog' for good reason"" Bill Lambert Senior Health and Welfare Manager at The Kennel Club previously told Country Living. ""As a firm family favourite they generally have a fantastic and steady temperament – they are loving and full of personality great with kids intelligent and eager to please making them easy to train.""

Other pups that are unlikely to bite include Cavalier King Charles Spaniels Bernese Mountain Dogs and Beagles — an affectionate breed that makes them suitable for various owners.

It's important to remember that even some of the most well-behaved dogs can occasionally bite people. According to the Dogs Trust some of the most common reasons a dog may exhibit aggression towards someone include feeling fearful or frustrated being defensive guarding others or intimidation. Paying close attention to your dog's behaviour will help you spot when things are leading to aggression.

Professional fighter Bridges has amassed quite the following on Instagram with her current follower tally standing at 525000.

The Australian has become a star in the boxing world and is known as the 'Blonde Bomber' thanks to her notorious long blonde hair and impressive boxing skills. Prior to her iconic long blonde look though the boxer looked a totally person when aged 18.

Amongst her thousands of Instagram posts towards the bottom Bridges has a snap of her celebrating her 18th birthday where she looks almost unrecognisable with curly hair.

The photo was uploaded before Bridges rose to fame back in 2014 and shows her pictured as an 18-year-old in front of a birthday cake next to her twin brother Aaron. Along with the throwback snap the fighter wrote: ""Before it all started.""

18 years on from the photo the Australian was celebrating her 36th birthday this week. She once again took to Instagram to commemorate the event wishing her brother a happy birthday whilst adding she was 'proud of the woman she has become'.

In an emotional message Bridges wrote to her 525000 followers: ""Happy birthday to me and my Twin Aaron. I woke up today a little sad cos it’s the first time in 36 years I have not spent my birthday with my Twin Brother or my family.

""And I’m pretty tough and not very emotional I just get on with things and actually if you know me I kinda hate birthdays but today hit a little different and made me realise how important family is and if I could have one present today it would be to see them.

Taking to her Instagram stories Georgia shared an adorable snap of her sister Eleanor with her baby Hugh.

The caption read: ""When your sister is the PROUDEST aunty you ever did see. Hugh is so lucky to have you.""

In the photo Eleanor is seen holding the bundle of joy tightly as he sleeps peacefully in her arms.

Later on that day Georgia posted another photo of her in the hospital bed after giving birth to Hugh.

The hairdresser from Durham first revealed news of her baby on New Year's Eve on her Instagram.

The Channel 4 star revealed she had welcomed a baby boy with her boyfriend Josh Newby.

The couple have named their newborn son Hugh James Newby.

Taking to social media the 21-year-old TV star shared an adorable picture of their new arrival with her 59k followers saying he was ""perfect in every way"".

The four great tennis rivals are pictured on a boat on the Thames wearing dinner jackets and bow ties with Tower Bridge illuminated in the background.

It was posted on Twitter by Federer with the caption: ""heading to dinner with some friends @RafaelNadal @andy_murray @DjokerNole"" At the time of writing the post had clocked up more than half a million 'likes' in just over 12 hours.

The snap has also had more than 8000 comments including one fan who simply said: ""Wow the coolest photo ever.""

Another gushed: ""There'll never be a more entertaining period of professional tennis than when the core four were all at the top of their game praise to all these legends!""

Another user organised a poll asking 'who is the best dressed?' with Federer winning so far with 53 per cent of almost 50000 votes. Scots ace Murray is in last place with 9.7 per cent.

The photo also added fire to the debate about who is the greatest tennis player ever. Swiss legend Federer 41 recently announced his retirement after winning 20 grand slams.

However Djokovic already has 21 and Spanish idol Nadal has 22 with both retaining a realistic chance of adding to their tallies at the ages of 35 and 36 respectively.

Murray 35 has only three grand slams including his two Wimbledon titles and is unlikely to win another due to his injury problems. However most fans believe that he would have won more if he weren't competing alongside arguably the top three players in tennis history.

In response to the post one Twitter user said: ""Murray would have won 20 Slams if these 3 didn’t exist. He was that good but the other 3 are the 3 greatest to have ever played the game.""

The foursome are in London for the Laver Cup event with Europe taking on a world team which will be Federer's last tournament before he retires. His final match will see him play doubles with Nadal on Friday night.

""I'm not sure if I can handle it all but I'll try"" he said. ""I have had some tougher moments as well in the past being horribly nervous all these years sometimes before matches. This one definitely feels a whole lot different.

""Of course it's super special playing with Rafa. I'm happy to have him on my team and not playing against him.""

Utilities stall and limit climate action by establishing controlling and funding front groups to spread climate misinformation through advertising on social media.

Utility front groups have spent thousands of dollars on disinformation advertising that target people of color and historically marginalized groups mislead the public on the impacts of gas bans highlight false concerns regarding the reliability of renewable energy and promote “renewable natural gas” and hydrogen despite multiple studies showing these fuels are not viable substitutes for building electrification.

Utility front groups advertise for preferred candidates in elections including Seniors Across America promoting Governor Ron DeSantis followed by a slew of anti-solar advertisements costing up to $60000.

Federal commissions legislators and utility regulators can take action to improve the transparency of utility advertising and limit the spread of disinformation.

Gas and electric utility front groups have spent over $2.4 million over the past 4 years on social media advertisements many of which include targeted messaging to mislead customers on critical climate and energy concerns including the impact of power plant retirements the reasons behind high utility bills and the viability of “renewable natural gas” and hydrogen.

Using data from the Meta Ad Library and existing code developed by Brown University the Energy and Policy Institute launched a new tracking tool that exposes up to $2.4 million in spending by 14 utility front groups in the last year and shows the specific regions that the groups are targeting with the advertisements. The tracker does not show advertising spending by the groups on other social media platforms such as TikTok Twitter or YouTube.

Utility front groups are organizations that appear independent but are established controlled or funded by a gas or electric utility or trade association. These front groups advocate on behalf of utility interests often by amplifying misinformation about distributed renewable energy or electrification while masking or obscuring the utility’s involvement. Just over the last year gas and electric utility front groups spent tens of thousands of dollars spreading misinformation through targeted advertising on the platforms of the social media giant Meta such as Facebook and Instagram. In some cases the front groups have promoted specific candidates over others to influence voters in the weeks before primary elections.

Social media networks expedite the spread of misinformation through algorithms that recommend new connections to people with similar views and then promote content within the network based on engagement with previously viewed material. Additionally research shows people are more likely to trust information from others in their social network propagating “echo chambers” and severe polarization of people uniting around disparate positions.

Social media companies are under scrutiny for promoting misinformation as are the companies using the platforms to spread falsehoods furthering their interests and influence.

In September 2022 the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee Subcommittee Oversight & Investigations led by Rep. Katie Porter examined the role of public relations firms in preventing climate action for their fossil fuel clients.

Other members of Congress are also investigating the firms and fossil fuel companies for their role in the decades-long campaign to mislead the American people about the industry’s role in climate change. Rep. Carolyn Maloney the Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform and Rep. Ro Khanna the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment recently released a report of initial findings that show how oil companies “focus on unproven technologies the companies admit are decades away from implementation” and “[rely] on accounting gimmicks tricky language and delay tactics to claim the mantle of climate leadership while continuing to be a primary cause of an ongoing climate catastrophe.” The report comes nearly a year after the Committee on Oversight and Reform held a hearing to examine the fossil fuel industry’s disinformation campaigns.

Like the oil industry the utility industry knew about the risks that burning fossil fuels posed to the climate for decades before the general public was broadly exposed to the same science. . In the late 1950s the oil industry was studying carbon dioxide in the atmosphere through their trade association the American Petroleum Institute. Several years later a science advisor to President Lyndon B. Johnson warned the utility’s trade association the Edison Electric Institute about the threat that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels could one day pose to the climate. Together the utility and oil industries were told of the climate risks of their products and actions but used doubt and denial in various ways including advertisements to erode public understanding of the science and quell government action. The industry then transitioned to deflecting focus onto the emissions of other countries and sectors and in recent years have “uplifted approaches such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) that have proven unviable to date in the power sector distracting attention from the energy transition” according to a recent study.

Left: A print advertisement from the Information Council on the Environment (also known as Informed Citizens for the Environment) which was formed in 1991 to “reposition global warming as theory (not fact).” Right: A Facebook advertisement from Natural Allies for Clean Energy Future which has a media campaign plan to “redefine the role of natural gas in fighting climate change and protect the social license to operate.”

Today most utility companies have publicly committed to some type of “net-zero” climate goals but they continue to block meaningful climate reform and invest in fossil fuel infrastructure. EPI’s new tool shows that utilities continue to stall and limit climate action by funding front groups to spread climate and energy misinformation through advertising on social media networks. Below are a few examples of recent utility front group advertisements.

Front groups targeting people of color and historically marginalized groups

Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future is a 501(c)(4) front group with ties to some of the largest utilities in the country including DTE Energy Duke Energy and Southern Company. The front group has spent more than half a million dollars on Facebook and Instagram advertising since 2018 and is among the highest spenders of any utility front groups tracked by EPI.

The non-profit investigative news outlet Floodlight first reported on Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future’s advertisement campaign targeting young liberal and Black and Latino voters to convince them of the benefits of fossil gas in addressing climate change. Internal documents revealed that the campaign had a plan to “redefine the role of natural gas in fighting climate change and protect the social license to operate” and “success for the natural gas industry will be rooted in whether we can message to the left and the Democratic base of Black and Latino and age 18-34 voters as effectively as we have messaged to the right.”

More details from the documents detailed how the front group has a specific focus on Black voters: “Black voters- the core of President Biden’s Democratic coalition – are more likely to support affordability over disruptive changes in energy and climate policy. Black voters also register lower support for the Green New Deal when informed of the practical effects of such policies on energy affordability and reliability.”

The ads for the campaign included the same video with the message that fossil gas is “accelerating the world’s clean energy future” despite the fact that methane is accelerating the climate’s warming with a heat-trapping potency 84 to 87 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. The recent UN IPCC report clearly states that cutting methane emissions is critical to having a chance to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Yet methane emissions are on the rise and U.S. oil and gas drilling is a major contributor to the increase. Rob Jackson a Stanford University scientist who leads the Global Carbon Project which published two studies in July 2020 on this topic said “Natural gas use is rising quickly here in the U.S. and globally. It is offsetting coal in the electricity sector and reducing carbon dioxide emissions but increasing methane emissions in that sector. As a result we’re emitting more methane from oil and gas wells and leaky pipelines.”

Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future’s video for a $10000 campaign to target Black and Latino voters to convince them on the benefits of fossil gas.

Between February and May of this year Natural Allies spent up to $10000 on ads featuring the video created for its advertising campaign.

The Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA) which calls itself “the voice of the energy consumer” but in reality is an advocacy front group for some of the country’s largest utilities fossil fuel corporations and trade associations has spent even more than Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future on Facebook and Instagram advertising. Since May 2018 CEA has spent nearly $700000. It has also deployed similar tactics as Natural Allies dropping up to $8000 on an ad touting two women “running a business in a male-dominated field” and struggling in the face of rising fuel prices.

Seniors Across America is a front group that spent thousands of dollars on Facebook advertisements that urged Floridians to support an anti-rooftop solar bill. Text of the legislation HB 741 was sent to state senator Jennifer Bradley’s staff from a Florida Power & Light (FPL) lobbyist. FPL’s parent company NextEra Energy contributed $10000 to Bradely’s political committee just days after the legislator received the legislation and an additional $10000 weeks later. As the bill moved through the legislature Seniors Across America ran advertisements promoting it targeting those aged 55 and over and claiming that the “stealth solar tax” disproportionately hurt senior ratepayers by forcing them to subsidize customers who could afford to purchase solar for their homes. In fact the bill would have authorized utilities to charge all customers for the recovery of its lost revenue creating the very subsidy Senior Across America claimed solar was causing. Solar allies opposing the bill presented thousands of comments establishing the fact that no solar “cost shift” currently exists in Florida;Governor Ron DeSantis vetoed the bill saying that it would have forced rate increases among FPL’s captive customers. Seniors Across America continues to advertise warnings against “shady solar salespeople.”

Seniors Across America advertised warnings against the “stealth solar tax” to promote FPL’s anti-rooftop solar legislation.

Utility front groups spending thousands fighting against bans on fossil gas

Gas utilities and associated front groups are targeting regions where policies to electrify and prohibit fossil gas in buildings are advancing.

The Affordable Energy Coalition a front group created in March 2021 to attack building electrification policy in the Seattle region spent up to $2500 on an advertisement that ran through May 2022 focused on the Seattle City Council decision to ban fossil gas in new buildings. The front group used another advertisement to suggest vague and dangerous repercussions with no corroboration had the gas ban been in effect during Seattle’s record cold temperatures this past February.

Affordable Energy Coalition’s advertisement stokes unfounded fears on the impacts of building electrification.

Affordable Energy Coalition’s advertising stokes fears that electric heat pumps cannot perform in cold weather. However technological advances to new models of electric heat pumps disprove this concern. For instance a recent study in Maine found that heat pumps perform well in below-freezing weather without fossil-fueled backup. An analysis of the technology’s performance in Minnesota came to the same conclusion.

New Yorkers for Affordable Energy used similar tactics in response to a failed attempt to ban fossil fuels from newly constructed buildings in the near future. The front group is supported by the utilities Dominion National Grid and National Fuel Gas according to LittleSis. The front group focused on a campaign with the false narrative that banning gas appliances would require New Yorkers to spend thousands on retrofitting spending up to $8000 on ads falsely claiming that a gas appliance ban would cost homeowners $30000. However the ban was only for newly constructed buildings and an analysis from the Rocky Mountain Institute found that all-electric homes have lower costs than new mixed-fuel homes with savings on upfront costs and utility bills.

A study published by Stanford University researchers found that even when not running gas appliances release an annual amount of methane equivalent to 500000 cars. Further the nitrogen dioxide emitted from gas stoves inside homes far exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency’s outdoor air quality standards significantly increasing the risk of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease especially in children.

New Yorkers for Affordable Energy makes false claims about the financial impacts of building electrification.

Consumer Energy Alliance made a similar claim concerning costs in support of a bill that almost passed in Virginia that would have prevented municipalities and counties from banning new gas infrastructure and hookups. According to a Rocky Mountain Institute study many residential electrification scenarios for new buildings would reduce the cost for homeowners over the lifetime of the appliances as compared to fossil fuel-burning appliances and cost savings are also possible in retrofitting scenarios. Further with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act the federal government is lowering the energy costs of energy efficient appliances by providing $14000 in direct customer rebates.

Consumer Energy Alliance makes false claims about the financial impact of a gas ban in Virginia.

Advertisements from front groups make false claims concerning the reliability of renewable energy and energy security

Citizens for Energizing Michigan’s Economy (CEME) a 501(c)(4) organization that has received more than $43.5 million from Consumers Energy has spent on advertisements including misinformation about renewable energy and the electric grid. When Michigan legislators introduced a bill in 2021 to lift a cap on utility distributed generation programs CEME ran a misleading ad that falsely claimed “out-of-state special interests” – implying solar companies – caused widespread blackouts on the Texas grid earlier that year. Versions of the advertisement appeared on Facebook feeds in the districts of members of the Michigan House Energy Committee which held hearings on the legislation. Utility companies in Texas – specifically Calpine Vistra and NRG Energy – all have said natural gas shortages affected their ability to operate their power plants. Additionally the Texas Railroad Commission didn’t mandate winterization to prevent oil and gas wells from freezing and failed to ensure that gas producers and pipeline operators sought priority status for power during emergency outages which occurred when the grid operator ordered utilities to perform rotating outages. Coal-fired power plants also failed to operate during the extreme weather event.

Voices for Cooperative Power a front group funded by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association the trade association for electric cooperatives used Facebook ads in an attempt to urge people to call on the Michigan Public Service Commission to “not to allow the premature retirement of power plants unless the utilities demonstrate new operational alternative power plants first.” The ads are likely referring to the J.H. Campbell power plant owned by Consumers Energy. The ads claimed Michigan “can’t afford to go dark” suggesting renewable alternatives could not maintain reliable power or would be too costly. But expert analysis shows that switching to renewables would be the safest and most cost-effective option and modeling by Consumers Energy and environmental groups demonstrated Campbell’s retirement and the plan to purchase the Covert Generating Station accelerating the addition of 8000 megawatts of solar power and 550 MW of battery storage by 2040 with interim targets through this decade improve reliability in the service territory. Testimony filed by Consumers Energy also revealed that electric cooperative Wolverine Power Supply’s competitive business stood to benefit financially if Campbell remained open.

Affordable Energy for New Jersey spent its largest sums on attacks against Governor Phil Murphy’s Energy Master Plan. The 2019 plan outlines a statewide strategy to reach 100 percent clean energy by 2050 which prioritizes the rapid electrification of buildings. In response the front group has deployed a steady onslaught of low-cost frequent advertisements since the beginning of 2022.

The group’s ad topics range from attacks on the viability of electric vehicle batteries to blaming “radical environmentalists shouting down US LNG exports” for Germany’s reliance on coal in the midst of Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The front group also focused on blackouts in June 2022 advertisements in attempts to convey the message that only “base load” can prevent the blackouts. Utilities and groups typically reference coal gas and nuclear as baseload plants. Yet these fuels have no magical reliability properties and are responsible for their own outages. In Colorado during a summer heat wave Xcel Energy averted a crisis by taking control of customer thermostats to relieve demand after the coal plant Comanche 3 “went down quickly.” A year earlier a different Colorado utility Mountain Parks Electric warned customers to conserve energy because wind turbines “iced up” when in fact the causes of the supply crunch were complex and included how the winter conditions also impacted the supply of gas and Wyoming coal plants.

Affordable Energy for New Jersey’s ad touts baseload plants like coal gas and nuclear despite the reliability issues of these plants.

Gas utility front groups promoting RNG hydrogen and “clean” “natural” gas

Partnership for Energy Progress is a 501(c)(4) front group with ties to multiple utilities including Avista Cascade Natural Gas NW Natural and Puget Sound Energy all in the Pacific Northwest. The Guardian reported that the utilities created the group to convince consumers that “natural gas is part of a clean energy future.” The Seattle Times also reported that the group had prepared a $1 million media strategy campaign that would feature paid advertisements focused on “key audiences in Washington and Oregon” mobilize allies in policy debates and create a “positive” message about gas.

The front group has spent over $60000 in 2022 on Facebook and Instagram advertising. Part of the advertisement campaign focused on promoting technologies that gas utilities are bolstering but are false solutions for the purposes of building decarbonization. One of the messages promoted “renewable natural gas” as clean reliable and affordable and capable of being delivered in the existing gas infrastructure and reducing emissions. “Renewable natural gas” or biomethane is non-fossil methane generally captured from agricultural sources or landfills. The other message promoted hydrogen in the same light as renewable natural gas – as a practical solution for gas utilities to reduce emissions. Similar to utilities that have promoted carbon capture and storage even though it remains unworkable to date in the power sector Partnership for Energy Progress advertisements ignore the facts that biomethane and hydrogen while plausibly playing a role in decarbonizing other sectors are not viable alternatives to building electrification. Ample evidence shows both fuel types would lead to higher costs for customers are not available at the necessary scale could be climate intensive due to methane leakage exacerbate air pollution and cause safety risks.

Front groups frequently deployed ads that refer to fossil gas as a “clean” fuel source implying that it is critical to achieving emission reduction targets. The Alliance for Michigan Power used Facebook and Instagram advertisements to encourage that misleading message. The Alliance for Michigan Power is a front group with connections to monopoly utility company DTE Energy which provides both electric and gas service to customers in Michigan.

Alliance for Michigan Power calls on lawmakers to support a mix of power sources to meet net zero carbon emissions – including fossil gas.

Utility front groups involved in advertising for elections

Citizen’s Energizing Michigan’s Economy the front group funded by Consumers Energy ran Facebook ads for eight candidates – seven Republicans and one Democrat – ahead of their August 2022 primary elections. The ads for the Republicans focused heavily on advancing a right-wing agenda promoting “election integrity” gun ownership police “Christian values” and “fight[ing] China.”

In the weeks leading up to Florida’s August 2022 primary elections Seniors Across America spent hundreds of dollars supporting Governor Ron DeSantis who had no Republican primary challenger. DeSantis appointed the Florida Public Service Commissioners who approved Florida Power & Light’s rate hike earlier this year and has passed a host of legislation friendly to FPL and its parent company NextEra. In 2018 DeSantis received $25000 from a dark money non-profit funded by FPL. Despite his veto of the anti-rooftop solar bill written by FPL and supported by Seniors Across America DeSantis has remained silent about FPL’s connection to election scandals criminal trials and ongoing investigations. The ads from Seniors Across America praising DeSantis were followed by a slew of messaging campaigns one warning against “greedy solar companies and their door-to-door salesmen” on which the front group spent up to $30000 and another suggesting the “Top Five Scams” of rooftop solar salespeople which cost up to an additional $30000. These ads ran simultaneously with several ads encouraging primary voting.

Utility front groups also deploy tactics outside of Meta platforms to influence elections. Leading up to Nevada’s 2022 primary election Southwest Gas Corporation – one of the largest gas utilities in the country – gave $10000 its largest contribution at the time to Assemblywoman Lesley Cohen’s Democratic primary opponent Joe Dalia. Residents in Cohen’s district in Clark County also began receiving political mailers smearing Cohen and demanding she return “dirty money” from fossil fuel and energy companies ahead of the primary. The mailers were paid for by the front group Nevadans for Economic Opportunity (NEO) a 501(c)(4) “pro-growth public policy” coalition financially backed by the Retail Association of Nevada (RAN) and the Associated Builders and Contractors of Nevada among others. The address of RAN is also the same one for NEO in the state’s campaign finance disclosure database.

In 2021 Cohen introduced AB380 legislation that would require gas utilities to employ a more rigorous planning process before expanding infrastructure. To combat the legislation Southwest Gas built a coalition of affiliated interest groups. This included the creation of a now-disbanded front group Coalition for Cleaner Affordable Energy. The group sponsored Facebook content to “Stop AB380” and featured RAN’s Senior Vice President Bryan Wachter falsely framing the climate bill as a fossil gas appliance ban.

Appeals to state and federal regulators for greater transparency

Utilities form front groups to intentionally deceive customers and advance their own interests. By utilizing social media for advertising utility front groups rapidly disseminate disinformation without disclosure to viewers about the utilities’ involvement. Meanwhile even if utility involvement is revealed to customers through news sources or watchdog organizations customers are unable to opt out of paying their bills for electricity or gas both necessities of modern life.

The Federal Trade Commission exists to protect consumers from these kinds of deceptive and unfair business practices. Earlier this year 230 groups including the Energy and Policy Institute requested the FTC investigate the utility industry for widespread abuses including political corruption dark-money campaigns and unfair anti-competitive practices including denying customers access to renewable energy.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) could amend the accounting system that all utilities use in rate cases the Uniform System of Accounts to require that utilities record the millions paid in industry association dues as presumptively non-recoverable for rate recovery purposes. This action would at the very least force utilities to justify efforts to recover payments to trade associations engaged in political activities and would reduce costs for wholesale transmission customers who would no longer be required to pay those expenses. FERC can also require more granular disclosure of expenses made by utilities through their annual filings specifically in the accounts where utilities routinely place political expenses. This additional reporting requirement would help discourage utilities from booking the consulting costs of creating a front group and charging it to customers as Southern California Gas Company did several years ago when it formed the front group Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions to advance the utility’s pro-gas position in a California Public Utilities Commission proceeding.

Members of Congress can also include the utility industry in their investigations of the fossil fuel industry. The same questions and requests for documents sent to oil companies from the House Committee on Oversight and Reform could be sent to many in the utility industry as part of an ongoing investigation on climate disinformation. The House investigation included a request for companies to provide documents and communications related to involvement in supporting disinformation and misleading the public to prevent climate action.

State regulators are also capable of intervening on behalf of utility customers. Commissioner Sandra D. Kennedy of the Arizona Corporation Commission demanded that Arizona’s utilities provide comprehensive lists of political contributions lobbying expenses advertising and marketing expenses “Corporate Giving” and a list of compensations for employees and consultants engaged in those activities. In the filing Kennedy indicated that some utilities have “veered off the path of their core mission and instead have focused on solidifying their positions of power” and said that “the level of transparency called for in this letter is essential to maintaining the public’s trust.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzcHJlc3Nub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWxfbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9jaXRpemVucy1iYW5rLW1lcmdpbmctd2l0aC1zb3V0aGVybi1iYW5rL2FydGljbGVfOGM0N2FlZmMtM2I1Ni0xMWVkLTk3MTUtYmJjMjZhODQ3MzI2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citizens Bank merging with Southern Bank | Business | newspressnow.com,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

If approved down the road it could eliminate the Aliso Canyon SoCalGas facility which in October 2015 caused a massive gas leak that forced thousands of people from their homes and spurred a torrent of lawsuits.

The disaster at Aliso Canyon spewed more than 100000 metric tons of climate-altering methane into the atmosphere over the San Fernando Valley Simi Valley and Los Angeles making it the largest atmospheric release in U.S. history and led to a $1.8 billion settlement with 35000 victims.

This year in June six months after introducing a law to shut the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage field state Sen. Henry Stern who represents part of the San Fernando Valley took an unusual step — he urged his colleagues in Sacramento to vote “no” on his own bill Senate Bill 1486.

His colleagues did as Stern requested and killed Stern’s SB 1486. In a newsletter Stern sent on June 7 to his constituents in the San Fernando Valley Stern released a terse video titled “Aliso Canyon bill hijacked by the gas company.”

The rancor surrounding the huge storage facility has never gone away. The gas leak which was detected in October 2015 and lasted four months exposed residents to a host of chemicals including benzene which can cause cancer and harm to the reproductive system.

SoCalGas maintains that closing the facility isn’t feasible because it could result in a natural gas shortage which in turn would cause prices for the fossil fuel to skyrocket. Representatives for the company also insist the site has never been safer noting that enhanced safety measures have been implemented to reduce the risk of another disaster.

Residents in Porter Ranch and other nearby communities say they’ve continued to experience periodic nosebleeds headaches dizziness and other physical ailments. But SoCalGas representatives have said the amount of benzene present during the leak was within normal range.

Last November 4 the CPUC Commission that oversees operations of the Aliso Canyon underground natural gas-storage field voted unanimously to increase the capacity of the controversial field to 41 billion cubic feet. At the time CPUC Commissioner Martha Guzman Aceves said she felt “compelled to propose the increase” of the storage capacity of the field from 34 billion cubic feet to 41 billion cubic feet ahead of the arrival of winter.

But she added that the action the CPUC board was taking didn’t mean “to diminish our ability to take steps and all of the steps that we need to take to decommission” the Aliso Canyon field.

The CPUC staff proposal this week was issued along with a ruling that “details the findings of the CPUC’s review of the reliability and economic modeling from Phase 2 of the Aliso Canyon investigation” according to a press release provided to media on Friday night.

The new ruling finds that based on the analysis “Aliso Canyon is currently needed for SoCalGas to reliably meet energy demand in the Los Angeles basin and therefore sufficient replacement resources must be available for the eventual elimination of Aliso Canyon’s use.”

According to the press statement the new ruling requires utilities — and invites other parties — to provide proposals in response to the staff proposal including commenting on the portfolio of non-gas-fired electric generation and storage building electrification and energy efficiency needed to replace Aliso Canyon.

The CPUC staff estimates that an annual reduction of 214 million metric cubic feet per day in forecast peak gas demand or an annual increase of 1084 megawatts of non-gas-fired electric generation capacity or some combination of both “will be necessary to reliably serve all energy demand in 2027 without the use of Aliso Canyon.”

The statement on Friday noted that Senate Bill 380 (Pavley) tasked the CPUC with determining “the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility located in the County of Los Angeles while still maintaining energy and reliability for the region.”

According to the CPUC “since 2017 extensive monitoring and testing at Aliso Canyon has improved safety. In 2018 stringent new regulations went into effect for natural gas storage fields to further protect public health.”

The ruling and staff proposal is available at docs.cpuc.ca.gov/SearchRes.aspx?docformat=ALL&docid=497170260. The public can comment on the ruling and access documents related to the proceeding at apps.cpuc.ca.gov/p/I1702002.

The airline teamed up with Guitar Center for the promotion which also included a private lesson where passengers learned how to play the song ""Hello Aloha. How are you?"" during the trip — according to a press release from the instrument maker.

Along with a photo of passengers posing with their brand new instruments the airline tweeted ""We teamed up with @guitarcenter to surprise a flight full of customers flying out of Long Beach with a ukulele and a lesson. By the time they arrived in Honolulu they were pros.""

They posted another shot of the ukuleles resting on each passenger's seat. ""Guitar Center: You can learn how to play the ukulele in 20 minutes. Us: Prove it"" they captioned the tweet.

Twitter users were quick to poke fun at Southwest and turn the gifts into a meme. Author Ted Gioia retweeted one of Southwest's posts along with the caption ""First they take away your leg room and now this.""

Another user joked that even the worst person they know would never deserve such a ""cruel"" and ""inhumane punishment"" alongside Southwest's tweet.

Tom Nichols a journalist at The Atlantic added ""I am a big fan of Southwest but this might have made me homicidal.""

Meanwhile Very British Problems a tv show that investigates England's peculiarities weighed in writing ""Siri show me a British person's worst nightmare.""

Guitar Center said they sent their best instructors aboard the flight to teach passengers how to play the ""easy"" instrument.

""Above the clouds passengers onboard the Boeing 737-800 aircraft all received a Mitchell MU40 Soprano ukulele a Road Runner carrying case and a unique lesson in the sky"" they wrote in the release. ""Best-in-class Guitar Center Lessons instructors taught passengers how easy it is to learn to play the ukulele one of Hawaii's happiest and most familiar instruments.""

Brandy King Senior Director of Public Relations at Southwest Airlines added ""Our Customers anticipate warm Southwest Hospitality throughout their journeys with us. Today's celebration of Hawaiian culture and Southwest Hospitality underscore our everyday commitment to serve and celebrate the spirit of Aloha.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zd2FwYS1pbmZvcm1hdGlvbmFsLXBpY2tldC1zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtY3VsdHVyZS1sb3NzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SWAPA Holds Informational Picket Concerning A Loss Of Culture At Southwest Airlines,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zd2FwYS1pbmZvcm1hdGlvbmFsLXBpY2tldC1zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtY3VsdHVyZS1sb3NzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000267421981F0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

But that’s exactly what happened to those on-board Southwest Airlines with the bizarre surprise going viral after it was shared by the airline in a tweet on Wednesday.

The airline uploaded a photo of a plane full of grinning passengers who were heading from Long Beach California to Hawaii holding up the free ukulele that they found resting on their seat along with a floral case.

The airline claimed it was possible to learn how to play in just 20 minutes adding: “We teamed up with @guitarcenter to surprise a flight full of customers flying out of Long Beach with a ukulele and a lesson. By the time they arrived in Honolulu they were pros.”

The post has been ‘liked’ more than 9800 times and has attracted hundreds of comments from people who had very mixed reactions about the gesture.

Some commended the airline for the act while others described it as a “nightmare”.

“Oh my I KNEW there was a reason I fly Southwest when I can. I’ve become a devoted fan of y’all over all the other airlines” a devoted passenger wrote.

“No fair. I’ve been on this same LGB to HNL flight half a dozen times and all I ever got was forced to sit separately from my wife and baby” another passenger added.

However while comments applauding the airline continued they were intercepted with negative reactions.

“That sounds like a really really horrible surprise. I’m autistic and sensitive to sound. Being trapped on a plane full of people trying to play the ukulele for the first time would be an absolute nightmare for me” one person responded.

Another annoyed user wrote: “What if you didn’t want to hear a cacophony of ukuleles? What if you just wanted to sit in silence for the entire flight and watch TV or read like a regular flight?”

“Literally cannot think of anything worse my God” a third person added.

However many defended the airline advising those who would have had an issue to wear noise-cancelling headphones.

“You know about headphones right?” one person wrote in a sarcastic tone.

“Please ensure that all the whiners here are never on a plane with me” another woman added. “I miss the old comedy flights you used to have. Live music has suffered a lot since the pandemic. Maybe it was a lesson in what it takes to be a professional musician. We used to play on Seaflight. Good times.”

But there were many who still weren’t having it with one person writing: “No I think just most people don’t want to be in a f—king plane with 200 people struggling to play a ukelele.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvaGF3YWlpLWJvdW5kLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtZ290LWZyZWUtdWt1bGVsZXMtYW5kLWxlc3NvbnMtY291cnRlc3ktc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLTMzNzM2MDnSAX9odHRwczovL3d3dy5uZHR2LmNvbS93b3JsZC1uZXdzL2hhd2FpaS1ib3VuZC1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLWdvdC1mcmVlLXVrdWxlbGVzLWFuZC1sZXNzb25zLWNvdXJ0ZXN5LXNvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy0zMzczNjA5L2FtcC8x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hawaii-Bound Passengers Got Free Ukuleles And Lessons Courtesy Southwest Airlines,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ndtv.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /world-news/hawaii-bound-passengers-got-free-ukuleles-and-lessons-courtesy-southwest-airlines-3373609 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026742198790>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvaGF3YWlpLWJvdW5kLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtZ290LWZyZWUtdWt1bGVsZXMtYW5kLWxlc3NvbnMtY291cnRlc3ktc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLTMzNzM2MDnSAX9odHRwczovL3d3dy5uZHR2LmNvbS93b3JsZC1uZXdzL2hhd2FpaS1ib3VuZC1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLWdvdC1mcmVlLXVrdWxlbGVzLWFuZC1sZXNzb25zLWNvdXJ0ZXN5LXNvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy0zMzczNjA5L2FtcC8x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdXByb3h4LmNvbS9saWZlL2V2ZXJ5LWFpcmxpbmUtY3VzdG9tZXItb2Ytc2l6ZS1wb2xpY3ktZXhwbGFpbmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Every Major Airline's 'Customer of Size Policy' Broken Down In Detail,"Traveling on a plane when you’re physically larger than the seat itself can be a downright stressful experience. Questions like “Will I fit in my seat?” “Will my neighbor be annoyed?” “Do I really need to purchase an extra seat?” and “How long are the seatbelts?” can turn someone off from taking a trip altogether. Plus it’s confusing — as just about every major airline has a totally different set of policies for dealing with what the airline industry calls “customers of size.” We don’t want concerns about your body (and how that body fits in an airplane seat) to dissuade you from seeing the world so we’ve looked up all the major airlines’ policies and broken them down. Before we get into that shout to Twitter user Shea Wesley Martin whose tweet about his experience went viral last weekend. https://twitter.com/sheathescholar/status/1571518443869929472 We never thought we’d see anyone celebrate Southwest Airlines for anything (shots fired!) but we applaud the airline for looking out for the larger folks. Here are the major airline policies including armrest width seatbelt length and seat pitch (the distance from the back of your chair to the chair in front of you). Let’s dive in!

Alaska Airlines View this post on Instagram A post shared by David Kamada (@69_airways) Armrest Width: 17 inches for Coach 21 inches for First Class. Seatbelt Length: 46 inches + 25 inches with seatbelt extender. Seat Pitch: Main Cabin seats feature 31-32 inches of leg room Premium Class seats feature 35 inches of leg room. The Policy: As far as policies go Alaska Airlines is one of the more understanding. The airline requires the purchase of an additional seat for any customer who cannot comfortably fit between the armrests. However if the flight departs with an open seat available customers of size will be eligible for a refund for the second seat — note: refunds must be requested within 90 days of travel. If a second seat isn’t purchased in advance you may be asked to purchase an additional seat before boarding the aircraft. In the event you need to change your reservation you’ll only be charged one change fee. Read the full policy here. American Airlines View this post on Instagram A post shared by American Airlines (@americanair) Armrest Width: American Airlines has different air crafts with small variations in seat width but for the most part Main Cabin seats measure between 17.3-18 inches and First Class seats are approximately 21 inches. Seatbelt Length: Information not available. Seat Pitch: On the A319 Airbus Main Cabin seats get 30 inches of leg room 34 inches for Main Cabin Extra and 38 inches for First Class. The Boeing 737-800 and 737 Max feature 30 inches in the Main Cabin 33 inches for Main Cabin Extra and 37 inches in First Class. The Policy: For customers who need extra space American Airlines requires an extra seat to be purchased. AA strongly suggests you plan for this when booking. If you forget to book an extra seat in advance an airport agent will try to find out if they can find you two adjacent seats available on your flight in the event that that means you’ll have to sit in a higher class you’ll be responsible for the fare difference. In the event that AA can’t find seats to accommodate you you can purchase seats on a different flight at the same price as your original seats. It’s not great but far from the worst. Read the full policy here.

Delta Airlines View this post on Instagram A post shared by Delta Air Lines (@delta) Armrest Width: 17.3 inches for Main Cabin and Delta Comfort + seats 20.9 inches for First Class on Boeing 737 planes. 17.4 inches for Main Cabin and Delta Comfort + 18.5 inches for Delta Premium Select 20.46 inches for Delta One Suites Seatbelt Length: 40 to 45 inches + 25 inches with seat belt extender. Seat Pitch: The Main Cabin features 31-32 inches of leg room Delta Comfort + gets you 34 inches and First Class has 38-39 inches of leg room. The Policy: Delta Airlines’ Customer of Size Policy is a bit confusing because… well the airline doesn’t really have one. Delta does not require passengers to purchase an extra seat if they need seatbelt extenders or are unable to lower the armrest. However if a passenger “impedes” on another passenger they may be asked to move to another location that provides additional space or in some cases will be asked to take a later flight with more available seating. That’s pretty embarrassing so Delta recommends passengers purchase an additional seat if they feel they might need one. To make a reservation for an extra seat Delta suggests you create a New Passenger Name Record using your last name and “EXST” as the first name. Itinerary change charges will only apply to the passenger’s ticket not the extra seat. Read the full policy here. Frontier Airlines View this post on Instagram A post shared by Frontier Airlines (@flyfrontier) Armrest Width: For all 319 aircrafts you’ll get 17.4-18 in aisle seats 17.8-19.1 inches for middle seats and 17.1-18 inches for window seats. For 320 aircrafts you’re looking at 17.4-19 inches on the aisle 17.8-19.1 inches for middle seats and 17.1-18 inches on window seats. For the 321 aircraft you ave 16.7-18 inches on the aisle 16.5-19.1 inches on the middle seat and 16.5-18 inches at the window.

Seatbelt Length: Frontier is for whatever reason one of the few airlines that doesn’t list seatbelt lengths or extension lengths on their website. Extenders are available on all seats aside from seats located in Row 1. Seat Pitch: Most seats on Frontier aircrafts feature 28-31 inches of leg room with limited Stretch Seating options offering 33-35 inches. The Policy: The more budget-friendly airlines generally have the weakest policies. Customers who cannot lower both armrests or who compromise a portion of an adjacent seat are advised to book two seats. Frontier won’t charge you for change fees 60+ days before your departure but will charge you $49 for all seats purchased 59-7 days before departure and $99 6 days or less.

Hawaiian Airlines View this post on Instagram A post shared by Hawaiian Airlines (@hawaiianairlines) Armrest Width: 18 inches for Boeing 717 19 inches for First Class and 17.5 inches for Exit Row seats. 18 inches for Airbus A321neo 21 inches for First Class 16.8 inches at the rear of the plane. 18 inches for Airbus A330 20 inches for First Class 16.5 inches for rear seats. Seatbelt Length: 51 inches no specified length for the seatbelt extension. Seat Pitch: Boeing 717 has 30-31 inches of leg room in Economy Class and 37 inches in Business Class. The A321neo features 30-35 inches of legroom in Economy Class and 39 inches in First Class. The Airbus A330 has 31-36 inches in Economy Class and a whopping 76 inches in First Class. The Policy: In addition to having the widest seats of any airline Hawaiian is pretty understanding and accommodating to fliers who need a bit more room. If you’re unable to sit comfortably with the armrests lowered Hawaiian airlines will try its best to find a suitable alternative to help ensure your comfort though if no alternative is available you’ll have to book another flight. If you know you’re going to need extra room Hawaiian suggests you call their web support center so they can help you book two adjacent seats and they’ll even charge you the lowest available fare for the two seats which is pretty helpful. To uses this feature you’ll need to call 1-866-586-9419. Read Hawaiian Airlines’ full customer of size policy here. JetBlue Airways View this post on Instagram A post shared by JetBlue (@jetblue) Armrest Width: 18.4 inches Seatbelt Length: 45 inches + 25 inches with seat belt extender. Seat Pitch: JetBlue has nine aircraft in its fleet all of which have different specs but generally you’re looking at a generous 32-34 inches of legroom in Economy Class with lie-flat options and 45 inches of space for Mint Studio Suites on the A321neo. Check out JetBlue’s full fleet specs here. The Policy: Like Delta JetBlue doesn’t have an official customer of size policy but the seats are about an inch and a half wider than typical airline seats. JetBlue does not require customers of size to purchase an additional seat but encourages the act if it results in a more comfortable flight for you. JetBlue requires you to book extra seats at the time you purchase your initial seat. JetBlue’s website unfortunately does not list any details on whether you have to pay for change fees for your extra seat if you make an itinerary change so if you’re making travel plans that might change it’s probably best to hit up JetBlue’s customer service chat.

Southwest Airlines View this post on Instagram A post shared by Southwest Airlines (@southwestair) Armrest Width: Southwest’s narrowest seat width is 15.5 inches on the B737-700 B737-800 and B737-Max 8 aircraft. The Maximum seat width is 17 inches on the B737-700 and 17.8 inches on the B737-800 and B737-Max 8. Seatbelt Length: 39 inches + 24 inches with seat belt extender. Seat Pitch:737-700 features 31 inches of legroom. B737-800 and B737-Max 8 feature 32 inches of legroom. The Policy: Ah the very airline that inspired this article. If you’ve ever flown on Southwest you’re probably aware that it’s a tight squeeze and the airline’s customer of size policy states that any passenger encroaching on an adjacent seat will be required to purchase an additional seat. Luckily Southwest allows you to request a refund for the cost of the additional seat after travel. In the event you haven’t purchased an additional seat in advance you can speak to a Customer Service Agent at the departure gate and be accommodated with a complimentary additional seat if you need one assuming the seat is available.

Southwest has come a long way since making headlines 12 years ago when they famously ejected director Kevin Smith from a flight from Oakland to Burbank. Ready Southwest Airlines full customer of size policy here. Spirit Airlines View this post on Instagram A post shared by Spirit Airlines (@spiritairlines) Armrest Width: 17 inches (window and aisle seat) 17.8 inches (middle seat) Big Front Seat 18.5 inches Seatbelt Length: Information Not Available though Spirit does contain seat belt extenders. Guests who need an extender may not sit in any seat equipped with an inflatable seat belt. Seat Pitch: Standard Deluxe (an oxymoron if we’ve ever seen one) Leather Seats feature 30 inches of leg room with the Big Front Seats getting 36 inches. The Policy: Spirit’s policy states that any guest who encroaches on an adjacent seat or is unable to sit with the armrests lowered must purchase an additional seat at full cost. Luckily for just $25 extra you can purchase a Big Front Seat which should give you the sort of room you’d expect in a typical first-class flight. Read Spirit’s Big Front Seat policy here.

United Airlines View this post on Instagram A post shared by United Airlines (@united) Armrest Width: 16-17 inches on United Economy 17 inches on United Economy Plus 20 inches on First Class Seatbelt Length: 39 inches + 25 inches with seat belt extender Seat Pitch: United Economy features 30-31 inches of legroom while United First enjoys 37 inches. The Policy: United Airlines has pretty much the worst policy for customers of size. If you’re unable to sit ‘safely and comfortably’ (meaning you’re able to sit with the seatbelt an extension and with your armrests down) in a single United Economy seat you’ll have to purchase an additional seat. The additional seat will be the same price as your initial seat so long as you purchase it on the same day. If you don’t and United decides you need more space you’ll be charged whatever the fare level is on the day of departure. United absolutely will not budge on being able to put those armrests down even if you’re sitting with a family member or friend who doesn’t mind you encroaching on your seat."

UN INT Intro Text w/ Responsive Image - *Important Note* You must UNLINK this shared library component before making page-specific customizations.

Starbucks should be encouraging customers to choose animal- and climate-friendly vegan milk rather than cow’s milk. Starbucks baristas we need your help to end the chain’s unethical upcharge on vegan milk.

Starbucks claims to care about the environment—and the company’s former CEO Kevin Johnson has acknowledged that cow’s milk accounts for the largest part of its carbon footprint—yet as you know the chain charges upward of 90 cents extra for plant-based milks.

And Starbucks’ upcharge perpetuates dietary racism. Millions of Americans are lactose intolerant and many are people of color including 75% of African Americans and American Indians and 90% of Asian Americans.

Cows suffer so that humans can drink their milk. In the dairy industry they’re restrained and artificially inseminated. Their beloved babies are snatched away within a day of birth so that the milk meant for them can be sold for human consumption.

Many chains—including Panera Bread Pret A Manger and Philz Coffee—now offer dairy-free milk at no extra charge and all Starbucks stores in the U.K. as well as most in France have dropped the surcharge.

Starbucks baristas your customers need your help getting the vegan milk surcharge dropped and we ask that you use the form below to bring this matter up with Starbucks’ corporate leaders. You deserve to have a say in what you believe will make Starbucks a better place for you and make your customers happy.

Please urge Starbucks to stop charging extra for vegan milk."

He was a ball player.

But in another sense he was absolutely a head of state. It’s just not the kind of state that you can find on a map. His state was baseball and he ruled it like no other. And that mattered to a lot of people especially in the middle parts of the last century when baseball was the undisputed national pastime. “It wasn’t that he hit more home runs than anybody else” said legendary sportswriter Red Smith. “he hit them higher better farther with more theatrical timing and a more flamboyant flourish.”

And so when when the Yankee slugger died from cancer at the age of 53 he received the kind of tribute normally reserved for kings and presidents. His funeral was a multi-day multi-site affair with the locations including St. Patricks Cathedral in midtown Manhattan Westchester County’s Gate of Heaven Cemetery (whose other internees include James Cagney Sal Mineo and Ralph Branca) and Yankee Stadium.

In the report on his funeral in the Aug. 20 1948 issue LIFE expounded on the unique place of the Babe in American culture. “In his 53-year lifetime he won a unique hold on U.S. affections” LIFE wrote of the man who told sick kids he would hit home runs for them and came through. “…”The Babe loved applause as much as he did hot dogs and he personified that spectacular age of U.S. sports the 1920s” And as LIFE pointed out the other big sports stars of the 20s—Bill Tilden Bobby Jones Jack Dempsey—didn’t linger in the American imagination anywhere close to the way Ruth did.

And that is why the crowds assembled and that is why LIFE assigned two staff photographers to the event Cornell Capa and Martha Holmes. Some of the pictures capture the pomp of the moment. Some capture deeper emotion. What ff happening behind the eyes of Joe DiMaggio the Yankee legend who was at St. Patrick’s Cathedral and was the rare person who could see Ruth as a peer?

But the most poignant pictures are the ones that were taken at Yankee Stadium where Ruth lay in state for two days in an open casket. The mourners are young and old male and female some dressed formally but most in their everyday clothes. An estimated 100000 fans came by to see the Babe one last time in the House That Ruth Built.

A new Netflix miniseries has put Dahmer back in the public consciousness for better or worse.

Few remnants of Dahmer's gruesome history are still around. The 49-unit building was razed in 1992 15 months after human remains were found in apartment 213.

The Oxford Apartments were purchased for $325000 by the Campus Circle Project a public/private organization affiliated with Marquette University and quickly razed. Since then any efforts to put something in the space have floundered and it remains a vacant lot surrounded by a fence today.

For years there was talk of turning the site into a play area a storyline alluded to in the Netflix show where the dramatized version of Glenda Cleveland pushes for a memorial to Dahmer's victims.

More:Here is why a memorial for Jeffrey Dahmer's victims is unlikely to happen in Milwaukee

In 1998 the city of Milwaukee bought a number of vacant lots in Marquette's possession — but not that one.""We'd be happy to entertain an offer for it"" said John Hopkins then vice president for communication at Marquette. ""There has not been any interest in taking this parcel. Given its history you can understand people's reluctance to become the new owner of it.""

Plans by Campus Circle to initially turn the space into a ""tot lot"" didn't materialize.

""It was back-burnered and the flame has been extinguished at this point"" said Sally Maddick director of the West End Community Association in 1998. Her organization worked to improve the area. ""I think that would be a terrific site for a tot lot development but who will step up to the plate for that?""""My sense is that the city is not in the parks business and the county parks people are somewhat reluctant to operate a site that small"" Hopkins said.For a while talk circulated of using the lot as an environmental study space for students at nearby Grand Avenue Middle School but again nothing materialized. Before the building was torn down a Hartford couple pitched a plan to convert it to a museum of criminal artifacts.

Many shared the opinion that a memorial wasn't appropriate including June Moberly executive director of the Avenues West Association in 1998.""It was a horrendous horrendous thing but keeping a reminder there is not going to help this particular geographical neighborhood to heal either"" she said.

The land today is privately owned by Ogden Homes. The owners are prohibited from developing the land as part of its agreement to purchase it for $500 according to the Milwaukee Assessor's Office and a 2012 story in the Marquette Wire.

It wasn't just the apartment that went away.

In 1996 real estate magnate Joseph Zilber and his Milwaukee Civic Pride Fund successfully won the right to many of Dahmer's personal belongings including items that were in the apartment.

What happens during the fast temperature changes?

Researchers began exploring what they could do to understand what happens during rapid temperature change and orient the interior structure towards the martensite.

To examine rapid structural changes that take place in milliseconds the researchers needed specialized tools. They discovered synchrotron X-ray diffraction or XRD to be the ideal technique for it.

“In XRD X-rays interact with a material and will form a signal that is like a fingerprint corresponding to the material’s specific crystal structure” said Lianyi Chen a professor of mechanical engineering at UW-Madison and study co-author.

Needham analysts said they expect attorneys to target communities near EtO facilities with ads to find people willing to file more lawsuits against sterilization plant operators past and present.

RELATED: EPA flags high-cancer-risk EtO sterilization facilities across the country

The analysts believe Steris can manage any EtO legal liabilities due to the company’s size diversification and balance sheet but said investors are looking forward to Steris estimating and reserving cash for potential liabilities.

“Since breast and blood cancers are relatively common we worry that attorneys could have success in finding additional people willing to file more lawsuits” the analysts wrote. “We expect the risk of lawsuits and any news or company disclosures of additional lawsuits to weigh on STE shares given uncertainty around its potential legal liabilities.”

Medical Design & Outsourcing has reached out to Steris for comment and will update this story when more information is available.

How many EtO lawsuits does Steris face?

While Sterigenics and parent company Sotera Health (Nasdaq: SHC) face hundreds of lawsuits only a few have been filed against Steris the analysts said.

“There have been some lawsuits filed against an STE affiliate regarding a sterilization facility in Waukegan Illinois [but] STE has not owned or operated that facility for years” the analysts said citing Steris filings. “STE’s affiliate acquired the facility from Cosmed in 2005 and then subsequently sold it to Medline in 2008. Many of the plaintiffs are claiming that their exposure occurred outside the three years that STE’s affiliate operated the facility and as a result STE has filed motions to dismiss these complaints.”

EtO gas is the most common sterilization method for medical devices for to its ability to permeate packaging at relatively low temperatures and kill bacteria and viruses that could cause life-threatening infections. But the FDA is working with the industry on safer ways to use EtO and alternative means of sterilization due to the toxic chemical’s cancer risk particularly blood cancers and breast cancer.

Steris leaders have said their Applied Sterilization Technologies (AST) unit has been cautious on EtO emissions an assertion the analyst said was supported by the EPA’s data. But they worry that the EPA’s current data does not reflect past practices and there’s a risk that Steris could be found liable for EtO exposure in past decades.

The analysts also said that Sterigenics’ EtO troubles are unlikely to benefit Steris in the short term.

“First we think it’s difficult for medical device companies to quickly switch sterilization facilities due to regulatory requirements” they wrote. “And second we think that STE is unlikely to have significant capacity to take on business from SHC unless it were to build additional sterilization facilities which would take considerable time.”

Concerns about capital equipment sales at Steris

Separately from the EtO liability the Needham analysts said they have concerns about Steris and potential weakness in capital equipment revenue which is about 21% of total revenue at Steris.

“We are concerned that deteriorating financial performance at hospitals due to higher interest rates rising supply costs and the staffing shortage could weigh on STE’s Healthcare capital business while higher interest rates and an economic slowdown could weigh on STE’s Life Sciences capital business” the analysts wrote. “Despite our concerns we note that STE has a very strong order backlog which has continued to rise. … Given the strong backlog we believe that STE would need to see orders start to be canceled before it would cause its growth to slow.”

Nearly 200 packed into the museum auditorium for Lonny Cain's presentation examining where the newspaper editor's body may remain.

JOLIET IL — On Saturday morning retired Joliet area newspaper editor Lonny Cain gave a riveting presentation in the Joliet Area Historical Museum about the Molly Zelko mystery. Cain revealed the crusading newspaper editor from the 1950s may be buried in a sanitary sewer across from the Stevenson Gardens high rise on Stryker Avenue.

By early afternoon Joliet Patch went to the property to take photographs and examine the street; during that time at least a dozen or more motorists who attended Cain's talk drove to the 100 block of Stryker Avenue to check out the property for themselves. Cain's presentation coincided with this weekend's 65th anniversary of the 47-year-old Joliet newspaper editor's disappearance and presumed murder by Joliet's mob.

A full house of 200 people attended the two-hour talk. About 200 people attended Lonny Cain's Molly Zelko 65th anniversary presentation at Joliet's historical museum. John Ferak/Patch The crowd was captivated as Cain revealed new details about the Molly murder investigation that were never made public until Saturday's talk.

Cain named the two eyewitnesses who saw a large black car with four men park in front of their house at 103 Stryker Ave. and open the trunk. They saw a woman's body wrapped in something resembling a rug or a tarp. ""She made a point to say that the woman did not have shoes on"" Cain said of Pace.

After the body was dropped face-first into the ditch the men threw some dirt over the hole to cover the body so it wasn't visible. Then the black car drove off. The time of the incident was between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.

""In 1957 Stryker Avenue was a cow path"" Cain said. ""It was a small road on the edge of town not many houses there."" Molly Zelko's body may be buried within a few feet of this area near 101 and 103 Stryker Ave. John Ferak/Joliet Patch For the first time Cain revealed the identity of the woman he and late Joliet Herald News columnist John Whiteside made a focal point of their reporting efforts to solve the Molly mystery starting in the late 1970s after the 20-year anniversary. The woman's name was Jeannine (Lake) Pace. She was also a well-known area psychic who had helped law enforcement from time to time on various investigations. She died on Oct. 21 2003 at the age of 73. Back in 1957 Pace was in a turbulent marriage and raising three young children at the time two girls and a boy. Her husband often did not come at night. In fact he was away on the night she peered out her bedroom window and saw the large black car park along Stryker Avenue near the front of her family's house.

This happened between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. on Sept. 26 1957 which was a Thursday. Pace was so terrified at what she saw that urinated on herself that night Cain revealed Saturday. ""She lived with what she saw and hid that night"" Cain told his audience. Lonny Cain was City Hall reporter for The Herald-News in 1978. He teamed with John Whiteside to investigate Molly Zelko's disappearance. John Ferak/Patch In the late 1970s Dr. George Honiotes of Joliet put Jeannine Pace under hypnosis as part of Cain and Whiteside's newspaper investigation into Molly's mystery and a portion of her tape-recorded hypnotic sessions were played for Saturday's audience. ""This woman was terrified all over again"" Cain told everyone.

During a portion of the audio tapes played Saturday Pace became hysterical under hypnosis screaming ""it's a body!"" ""She didn't say it calmly"" Cain explained. ""She was reliving it."" Molly Zelko's body may be buried about 7 to 8 feet deep across from the Stevenson Gardens on Stryker Avenue. John Ferak/Patch Then the next day came on the knock on her door. It was a man from the Stryker Avenue construction crew installing the sanitary sewer lines. ""How'd ya sleep?"" the construction worker asked her.

""Fine"" she replied. According to Cain ""They knew that she saw what happened. That's how she felt."" Based on Cain's interviews with Pace Molly's body was dumped into an open ditch about 7 to 8 feet below the ground on the west side of Stryker ""right at the edge of the side area of her house."" Pace and her children lived at 103 Stryker Ave. At the time of Molly's disappearance Pace had an unpaid bill from a Joliet supermarket. Then one day out of nowhere she learned her bill got paid off according to Cain.

Then came a ""$500 donation"" given to her ""for being a needy family"" Cain said. As for Dec. 25 1957 ""that Christmas was the best Christmas the kids ever had"" Cain explained. Cain said Pace's entire living room was filled with toys and gifts for her and her three small children. Even the tree Pace had used was replaced with a different Christmas tree that December Cain explained. Molly Zelko's body may be buried under the sanitary sewers between these two houses at 101 and 103 Stryker Ave. John Ferak/Patch In November 2018 15 years after Jeannine Pace's death Cain traveled to Tennessee to interview her daughter Bonnie who was 7 years old when Molly vanished in 1957. Bonnie remembered that her family moved away from Stryker Avenue roughly within a year.

And there were a couple of things her mother shared with her over the years and that stuck with her: ""Never ever ever tell anyone that you lived on Stryker Avenue and avoid telling them your last name"" Bonnie told Cain during his 2018 interview in Tennessee. When Cain and Whiteside interviewed Pace extensively in 1978 she claimed she was peering out her bedroom window with her anxious dog Queenie whimpering nearby. She claimed to be telling the dog to stay quiet. Cain now believes that Pace's 7-year-old daughter Bonnie was also in the presence of her mother as the body disposal took place outside. ""I believe that because that's what she said"" Cain said. ""She said 'I was in the room with Mom.'""

Tragically Bonnie died about a year after Cain's interview in Tennessee. ""She fell in the shower it was a freak accident"" Cain told everyone. During that 2018 interview Cain asked the Tennessee woman if she remembered anything about her 1957 Christmas on Stryker Avenue. Bonnie remembered the whole living room covered with presents but never knew where all the gifts actually came from. Her mom told her that someone must have given the family's name to a Joliet church according to Cain. Molly Zelko is one of only three known Illinois journalists believed to be murdered in connection with their line of work. John Ferak/.Patch In addition to revealing the names of the mother and daughter who insisted they saw a body put into Stryker Avenue's sanitary sewer project Cain revealed a third name who had an enormous connection to corroborating their story — construction worker Gino Ullian.

Ullian mailed John Whiteside a letter in September 1986 — some 29 years after Molly's disappearance and presumed murder. Ullian then mailed Whiteside a second letter in 2002 after Whiteside produced another in-depth series on Molly's disappearance. Ullian revealed in his letters how he had been working on Stryker Avenue's sanitary sewer project in 1957 and was told to leave the ditch open at the end of his work day which was unusual. When he got to work the next morning he was startled to find the ditch was backfilled. Newspaper editor Molly Zelko was considered a bulldog as she investigated the mob's influence on Joliet in the 1950s. John Ferak/Patch He also revealed to Cain and Whiteside that he spoke with Pace at her house the very next day. ""I told her that something strange happened last night and in our short conversation she said she seen some men throw something in the ditch but did not say anything else"" Ullian wrote in his 2002 letter to Whiteside.

Cain said he and Whiteside never revealed the name of the construction contractor handling Joliet's Stryker Avenue project during any of their investigative stories. Then on Saturday Cain told the audience that Armand D'Andrea Construction was responsible for the sanitary sewer project. Ullian informed Whiteside in one of his letters that he recalled asking a foreman ""who backfilled it?"" because that could negatively impact his own pay. ""We were told to forget it and everything was OK"" Ullian told Whiteside. Ullian's letter went on to state ""Being a family man and needing the work I shut up.""

Ullian's letters to Whiteside notified the famed Joliet newspaper columnist that Ullian was not looking for a story or any glory. ""I want this off my chest"" he wrote Whiteside adding how he greatly admired Molly Zelko and The Spectator and ""she told it like it was no matter what the big shots said"" Cain told Saturday's audience. Molly Zelko's high-heeled shoes were on full display for everyone. John Ferak/Patch Joliet Patch asked Greg Peerbolte Joliet Area Historical Museum director for his reaction to Saturday's presentation and tremendous turnout. ""Journalism is a hallmark of our democratic republic"" Peerbolte said. ""As Molly was only one of three Illinois reporters in the state's history to presumably have been killed in the line of duty and the only woman her story takes on continued importance. ""Today's enthusiastic crowd of nearly 200 tell us that Molly's story still matters to Joliet and we as a community should continue to search for answers.""

Cain told everyone he had meetings with Will County State's Attorney Jim Glasgow and some of his top criminal investigators at the end of last year. Cain wants to determine once and for all whether Molly's body remains buried on Stryker Avenue 65 years after her middle of the night disappearance from her apartment 413 Buell Ave. Last Dec. 14 Glasgow showed up along with fellow members of his office in the 100 block of Stryker Avenue where a ground radar scan was conducted on a small section of the street. The man performing the ground radar scan Shaun Ashley Midwest area manager for GPRS Inc. told Cain this was a ""shot in the dark"" because of soil conditions and the limitations of what his company's equipment could show Cain explained. ""The one thing he did say is that his equipment could not go more than 3 or 4 feet"" Cain said. ""That was the maximum. And the sanitary sewer line is 7 to 8 feet down.""

According to GPRS's analysis across the street from the high-rise apartments ""the equipment and methods used did not detect reactions from potential burials."" Cain told Joliet Patch he asked whether the scan would detect a skeleton and Ashley told him the answer was no. After the scan Cain said he was told the Will County State's Attorney's Office could not do anything further and he should consider talking to city of Joliet officials about digging up Stryker Avenue. Is Molly Zelko buried here? A ground radar scan was conducted on a small section of Stryker Avenue last December.

We showed the topology in our previous review of the motherboard. Here is that view of each node:

This is a per-node view. Both of the nodes are independent and only share power the chassis and perhaps cooling. The other difference is really which Slimline connectors are being used between the two nodes.

Functionally that should have little difference but it does mean that each node uses different PCIe controllers on the CPU by default in our system. Of course if the cables were set to the same ports then this difference would not exist. Still for the vast majority of users these differences will not be noticed.

Next let us discuss management.

ASRock Rack 1U2N2G-ROME/2T Management

In terms of management we get the standard ASRock Rack IPMI management interface via the ASPEED AST2500 controller. Will went over the management of the motherboard in his review.

As he noted we have gone over the exact feature set of the ASRock Rack AST2500 BMC implementation in previous reviews like the X570D4U-2L2T and ROMED6U-2L2T. Everything written in those reviews applies here; we get full HTML5 iKVM including remote media along with BIOS and BMC firmware updates.

Will noted that one challenge with this platform is the slow remote media and we saw that again with the motherboards built into this server.

Overall the management works as we would expect except that remote media can load slowly via the HTML5 iKVM viewer.

Next let us get to performance.

ASRock Rack 1U2N2G-ROME/2T Performance

In terms of the performance we saw we got the same results we saw when testing this motherboard in a desktop configuration in 2021. That is an accomplishment since cooling in 1U servers can be challenging. We again ran an AMD EPYC 7262 and an AMD EPYC 7443 in the ASRock Rack platform and compared our results to the 8-channel data we had for both CPUs.

One can clearly see the impact of having four-channel memory. We will again note that at the lower-end AMD has EPYC “Rome” generation CPUs (also for use in Milan platforms) designed specifically for this market. Typically these are lower-core count (8-16 cores) parts. The cost of memory alongside those lower core count CPUs can be a lot so AMD has optimized parts for that deployment type.

Overall performance is what we would expect.

Next let us get to the power consumption.",,,,,,,,,

T-Mobile has long pushed access on planes -- starting with unlimited text messages back in 2014 -- as a feature that helped it stand apart from the pack.

There are some caveats. Only certain planes in United's fleet will support free Wi-Fi for T-Mobile customers: some Boeing 737 757 and Airbus A319 aircraft that have Viasat and Thales online internet.

Many T-Mobile customers can soon get inflight Wi-Fi on four major U.S. airlines.

This week T-Mobile and United Airlines announced a deal allowing travelers with Magenta or Magenta Max phone plans access to free inflight Wi-Fi on select domestic and short international flights. United joins Alaska American and Delta – all of which already had deals for free Wi-Fi with T-Mobile customers in place.

United says T-Mobile free Wi-Fi will be available on customers' mobile devices when flying United 737s select 757-300s and select A319s. The free Wi-Fi option is expected to take flight starting Oct. 15.



T-Mobile customers with Magenta plans will get access to four free Wi-Fi flights a year including streaming-level speeds T-Mobile said. Plus they get an hour of Wi-Fi and streaming on all additional flights along with unlimited messaging which has become the norm on mainline U.S. carriers.

Those with Magenta MAX plans will get unlimited streaming-level inflight Wi-Fi and texting. As is the case with all other carriers this free Wi-Fi option via T-Mobile is only available on mobile devices – not laptops.



The United agreement will begin this fall on all United domestic and international flights. United Express-operated flights will be a little bit slower to adopt the T-Mobile free Wi-Fi but the airline said it's coming soon.

Even with free Wi-Fi only available on select flights – and only on mobile devices – the savings can be substantial. On United flights Wi-Fi starts typically at $8 for MileagePlus members and $10 for non-members on all flights.

T-Mobile has built out an impressive list of airline partners to offer free inflight Wi-Fi but that has taken a hit recently. In its quest to provide free inflight Wi-Fi to all Delta has pivoted to using a different connectivity operator – one that doesn't partner with T-Mobile. Getting free Wi-Fi on American Airlines flights via T-Mobile is hit or miss too.

JetBlue remains the only carrier that offers free inflight Wi-Fi today. It's been a pillar of their service since the airline's launch.

Bottom Line

With the addition of United Airlines to its free Wi-Fi offerings on select plans T-Mobile could become the frequent flyer's wireless carrier.

Now T-Mobile Magenta plan customers have access to free inflight Wi-Fi on some (but not all) Alaska American Delta and United Airlines flights.

Your iPhone is on and seemingly connected for example but you can't get data in any apps and you see an error message in Safari that your phone isn't connected to the internet. If you're not connected to a Wi-Fi network then clearly your cellular data isn't working — so what do you do? Here are the top seven ways to troubleshoot and solve your problem when cellular data isn't working on your iPhone.

Turn off your Wi-Fi

Sometimes your iPhone can get caught between a Wi-Fi network and cellular and stick with Wi-Fi even when that's the wrong choice. If you are outside your home for example you might be just outside the practical range of your Wi-Fi network and your iPhone should switch over to cellular data. But because the phone can still connect to your Wi-Fi network — barely — it stays connected even though it can't exchange any data. The remedy? Swipe down from the top right of the screen to see the Control Center and tap the Wi-Fi icon to temporarily disable it. Now your iPhone will be forced to switch over to cellular data and use that instead.

Toggle Airplane mode

While there are a lot of reasons your cellular data may not be working one quick and easy trick that often gets it working again is to simply toggle your wireless connection off and back on again. Swipe down from the top right of the screen to see the Control Center and look for the Airplane mode icon. If it's already on that is probably your problem right there — Airplane mode disables cellular data so it might have been disabled by accident. But if it's off tap the icon and wait a moment then tap it again to turn your wireless back on.

Toggle your Mobile Data setting

Similarly you can control your iPhone's mobile data from the Control Center and it's possible that it was accidentally toggled off even if Airplane mode is not enabled. Swipe down from the top right of the screen to see the Control Center and look for the Mobile Data icon which is an antenna to the right of Airplane mode. If it's off tap it to turn it on. Otherwise tap it to disable wait a moment and tap it again to turn it back on. Now test your internet connection and see if that solved your problem.

You may be used to using Airplane mode but there are times you may need to toggle the nearby but lesser-known Mobile Data button. Dave Johnson/Insider

Check for a carrier setting update

While rare it's sometimes possible that your phone's carrier settings might be to blame for your lack of data connectivity. That's especially true if your cellular provider has recently updated its configuration and the changes failed to update automatically on your phone for some reason. To check for a carrier setting update start the Settings app and then tap General followed by About. If there's a carrier update available you'll be prompted to install it now.

Reseat your SIM card

You might need to reseat your SIM card especially if it's a new phone or you recently changed SIM cards. It's not hard to do this but you will need to find the SIM card removal tool that came with your phone. If that's no longer around you can also use a thin paper clip. Insert the tool into the hole near the SIM card tray and push gently but firmly until the tray pops out. Make sure the SIM card is seated properly in its tray and then carefully reinsert it. For more detailed instructions here is how to remove a SIM card from an iPhone.

Restart your iPhone

Try to restart your iPhone. This can resolve a lot of network and connection-related problems and only takes a few minutes to shut it off and then turn it back on again.

Reset your network settings

If nothing else has worked so far it could be a result of corruption in your iPhone's network settings which might be cleared up by resetting your network settings. Save this troubleshooting step for last because when you reset your network settings all saved networks paired Bluetooth devices and Wi-Fi passwords will be erased so you'll need to manually reconnect to all your favorite networks.

1. Start the Settings app.

2. Tap General.

3. Tap Transfer or Reset Phone.

4. Tap Reset.

5. In the pop-up menu tap Reset Network Settings.

As a last resort you can reset your network settings to resolve a possibly corrupted network configuration. Steven John/Insider"

TTWO,Take-Two Interactive,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL3Rha2UtdHdvLWludGVyYWN0aXZlLXBhdGVudC1jb3VsZC1wb2ludC10by1hLWJpZ2dlci1iZXR0ZXItd29ybGQtZm9yLXRoZS1uZXh0LWdyYW5kLXRoZWZ0LWF1dG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Take-Two Interactive patent could point to a bigger better world for the next Grand Theft Auto,"Large-scale outdoor urban environments crowded with people and vehicles are difficult to simulate accurately in videogames—just ask CD Projekt. A huge number of moving parts is required to make the scenes believable but the more that number goes up the more likely it is that something somewhere is going to go spectacularly haywire.

A new patent filing from Take-Two Interactive prosaically entitled ""System And Method For Virtual Navigation In A Gaming Environment"" offers a glimpse at what may be the first big steps toward changing all that.

It begins with a breakdown of how navigation in gaming environments currently works through pathfinding along linked nodes based on pre-programmed instructions and then gets into the limitations of these systems and the many ways that they can go wrong: Cars programmed with ""wandering behavior"" for instance may not take into account external factors like traffic weather or the need to actually find a spot to pull into rather than just yoinking it into ""park"" in the middle of the street.

""In view of the foregoing a need exists for an improved system for virtual navigation in an effort to overcome the aforementioned obstacles and deficiencies of conventional video game systems"" the filing says. Fair enough.

The new process described in the patent filing is long and dull and festooned with snooze-inducing flowcharts but the central gist of it is that the big life simulations can be drastically improved by offloading the bulk of the work of virtual navigation to the cloud—or as the patent filing puts it:

""the system comprising a server for managing the virtual navigation of the one or more non-player characters; and one or more player consoles in operable communication with the server over a network each player console comprising a gaming platform for executing the gaming environment wherein said server generates a coarse graph of the low-level nodes and associated links and pathfinds on at least one of the low-level nodes and the coarse graph from a start node to a target node wherein pathfinding on the coarse graph reduces the number of loads of low-level nodes needed by the one or more player consoles to generate a path from the start node to the target node.""

It's dry stuff as I said but assuming it works as intended the technical specifics are less important than the practical applications. Some games do a better job than others of simulating large outdoor environments but even the best of them stumble visibly at times—maybe not as catastrophically as the streets of Night City but enough to remind the player that they are indeed inside a videogame. If Take-Two has indeed come up with a better way to manage those systems it could have a huge impact on the biggest urban simulator of them all: Grand Theft Auto.

The patent filing makes no specific mention of GTA (or any other game) and in fact Grand Theft Auto 6 hasn't even been officially announced yet. But Grand Theft Auto 5 is now seven years old (although just five on PC) and despite Rockstar's commitment to bringing it to the latest generation of consoles there's no way that a new one isn't coming. It might be a stretch but this patent filing could be taken as a sign that it's still many years off but whenever it arrives it could bring about a sea change in what we can expect from large outdoor environments.

Around 90 development clips were reportedly leaked alongside screenshots and source code. Rockstar have since confirmed the validity of the leaks announcing that it has not affected any of their projects despite the huge disappointment it’s caused.

In terms of who was behind the attack rumours pointed towards it being a UK based teenager who appeared in a GTA forum offering to negotiate with Rockstar. That rumour now seems very likely to be true as police have made an arrest.

Taking to Twitter the City of London Police announced that they’d arrested a 17-year-old on suspicion of hacking. It wrote “On the evening of Thursday 22 September 2022 the City of London Police arrested a 17-year-old in Oxfordshire on suspicion of hacking as part of an investigation supported by the National Crime Agency’s National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU). He remains in police custody.”

Formally the arrest has not yet been linked to the cyber attack on Rockstar Games but sources say that this is the case. Journalist Matthew Keys tweeted saying that a “source says it's connected to the hack on Rockstar Games and possibly Uber Technologies.” Keys also went on to note “The 17-year-old hacking suspect was arrested in Oxfordshire and is believed to be connected to a group identifying itself as ""Lapsus$"" a group that organises primarily via Telegram channels.”

It’s believed that the investigation was completed in partnership with the FBI the latter of whom may make a statement later today. We’ll be keeping an eye on further details.

Now it appears said response has begun. In a statement Rockstar Games has confirmed the company ""suffered a network intrusion"" where an ""unauthorized third party illegally accessed and downloaded confidential information from our systems including early development footage for the next Grand Theft Auto.""

The statement further expresses how Rockstar is ""extremely disappointed"" that details of the next GTA were ""shared in this way"" and says that the studio will ""properly introduce you to this next game when it is ready."" It adds that work on the game will continue ""as planned"" suggesting that the leak won't affect the projected development of the game as was the case with Half-Life 2. You can read the full statement below:

A Message from Rockstar Games pic.twitter.com/T4Wztu8RW8September 19 2022

Meanwhile Take-Two Interactive has begun issuing takedown notices on footage (and links to footage) to multiple websites. Take-Two's response started late yesterday evening with several videos on YouTube showing the leaked footage being removed at the request of the company. Take-Two has also issued takedown notices to two major GTA communities namely the Grand Theft Auto 6 subreddit page and GTAForums the initial source for the leak.

As reported by VGC the GTA6 subreddit was temporarily taken down as moderators cleared it of any imagery of the leaked material. It has since been reopened with a warning stating ""no one can post links photos and videos of the recent leaks"" in order to protect the subreddit from being ""obliterated by Rockstar Games.""

Moreover the GTAForums thread that kicked off this whole affair was also taken down while links to the leaked material were either removed or otherwise concealed. The thread is now back online but is locked with a message that states ""All sensitive media in this thread has been hidden and the thread has been made public again for archival reasons.""

Take-Two also addressed the leak in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in which it reaffirmed that ongoing projects and online services will not be impacted and that it has ""already taken steps to isolate and contain this incident.""

The leak originally appeared on GTAForums early on Sunday morning and appears to be the result of a social engineering hack. The leaker who variously goes by the moniker 'Tea Pot' also claimed responsibility for a recent hack on Uber. Following deliberations regarding the validity of the footage the leak was confirmed as legitimate by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier. After the leak went viral Tea Pot updated their original post with a message to Rockstar and Take-Two claiming they were ""looking to negotiate a deal"" although they didn't specify the nature of the deal they were proposing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV3cmVzdGxpbmduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2p1ZGdlLXJlbW92ZXMtcG90ZW50aWFsLWRlZmVuc2UtZnJvbS13d2UtMmstbGF3c3VpdNIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV3cmVzdGxpbmduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2p1ZGdlLXJlbW92ZXMtcG90ZW50aWFsLWRlZmVuc2UtZnJvbS13d2UtMmstbGF3c3VpdC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge Removes Potential Defense From WWE 2K Lawsuit,"Pwinsider has a new report on the lawsuit between Randy Orton’s tattoo artist and the WWE 2K gaming franchise.

According to the report the judge in the case has eliminated a possible defense in the ongoing lawsuit over The Apex Predator’s tattoos. Orton’s artist Catherine Alexander has levied a lawsuit against WWE Take Two Interactive Software 2K Games Inc. Visual Concepts Entertainment Yukes Co. Ltd and Yuke’s LA Inc. The trial begins next week and Randy Orton has been called as a witness.

Judge Staci M. Yandle is overseeing the trial and issued a memorandum and order yesterday. The defendants (which are the associated legal teams of the companies listed above) are attempting to argue that the use of Orton’s tattoos in the game were ‘de minimis’ (Latin for “too minor”) to be considered a matter of law. Judge Yandle ruled otherwise.

You can read a copy of the memorandum and order below:

“Plaintiff Catherine Alexander filed the instant lawsuit against Defendants Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. 2K Games Inc. 2K Sports Inc. Visual Concepts Entertainment (the “Take-Two Defendants”) and World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. (“WWE”) asserting copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C. § 501. On September 26 2020 this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment and denied Defendants’ motion for summary judgment (Doc. 228).

This matter is now before the Court sua sponte to clarify the Court’s Summary Judgment Order(“Order”).

Alexander moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of copying. In granting Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment the Court found that it was undisputed that Alexander holds valid copyrights for the five tattoos at issue and that Defendants copied her copyrighted works. Therefore the Order is amended to clarify this Court’s finding that as a matter of law Alexander owns a valid copyright to the five tattoos at issue in this lawsuit. Given that Defendants copied Alexander’s copyrighted tattoos they are liable for copyright infringement unless they can establish an affirmative defense to their usage. Defendants asserted three affirmative defenses to their utilization of the tattoos in their motion for summary judgment: the existence of an implied license the fair use doctrine and use of the tattoos was de minimis.

In denying Defendants’ motion regarding the de minimis defense the Court noted its doubt that the defense was viable under Seventh Circuit precedent and that the defense had been successfully invoked in other circuits to allow copying of a small and usually insignificant portion of the copyrighted works not the wholesale copying of works in their entirety as occurred here. Therefore the Court amends and clarifies its Order to reflect that as a matter of law the de minimis defense is not viable in this case and Defendants cannot assert the defense at trial.”

The mods either inserted content from older Rockstar games into newer ones or combined content from similar Rockstar games into one larger game. The mods included material from Grand Theft Auto 3 San Andreas Vice City Mahunt and Bully.

This has been a legally active year for Take-Two starting with takedown notices for reverse-engineered versions of GTA3 and Vice City. Those projects were later restored. Since then Take-Two has issued takedowns for mods that move content from older Grand Theft Auto games into GTA5 as well as mods that combine older games from the GTA3 generation into one. That lead to a group of modders preemptively taking down their 14-year-old mod for San Andreas in case they were next on Take-Two's list.

One reason a company might become more concerned with this kind of copyright infringement is that it's planning to release a similar product and wants to be sure that its claim to the material can't be challenged. It's speculative at this point but that tracks with the rumors we heard earlier this year that Take-Two is working on remakes of the PS2 Grand Theft Auto games. Those rumors were also fanned this past weekend by confirmation that Take-Two has three unannounced ""iterations of previously released titles"" in the works.

PC Gamer has contacted both Take-Two interactive and libertycity.net for more information and will update this story if we hear back.

This information also could help institutional investors mitigate portfolio exposure to carbon risks. The SBTi standard offers guidance to companies on setting their targets in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. In this report we assessed the challenges that companies may face in setting science-based net-zero targets under the SBTI standard.

Three key challenges in the science-based net-zero target-setting process

Industry analysts in aggregate predict the S&P 500 will see a price increase of 25.7% over the next twelve months. This percentage is based on the difference between the bottom-up target price and the closing price for the index as of yesterday (September 22). The bottom-up target price is calculated by aggregating the median target price estimates (based on company-level estimates submitted by industry analysts) for all the companies in the index. On September 22 the bottom-up target price for the S&P 500 was 4724.28 which was 25.7% above the closing price of 3757.99.

After falling for six straight months the bottom-up target price has stabilized over the past two months. From January 31 through July 29 the bottom-up target price decreased by 11.1% (to 4727.51 from 5319.28). From July 29 through September 22 the bottom-up target price has stayed within a range of 4720 to 4750.

At the sector level the Communication Services (+37.6%) Information Technology (+31.3%) and Real Estate (+30.8%) sectors are expected to see the largest price increases as these three sectors had the largest upside differences between the bottom-up target price and the closing price on September 22. On the other hand the Utilities (+10.3%) and Consumer Staples (+14.2%) sectors are expected to see the smallest price increases as these two sectors had the smallest upside differences between the bottom-up target price and the closing price on September 22.

At the company level the ten stocks in the S&P 500 with the largest upside and downside differences between their median target price and closing price (on September 22) can be found below. It is interesting to note that only 12 stocks in the S&P 500 had a median target price that was lower than their closing price on September 22. Five of these twelve stocks are in the Consumer Staples sector.

How accurate have the industry analysts been in predicting the future value of the S&P 500?

In recent months industry analysts have overestimated the closing price by large margins. On September 30 2021 the bottom-up target price was 5049.43. Nearly one year later (on September 22 2022) the S&P 500 closing price was 3757.99. Based on yesterday’s closing price industry analysts overestimated the closing price at the end of September 2022 by about 34% nearly one-year ago.

Over the past five to ten years industry analysts on average have been within 1% the closing price of the index 12 months later. Over the past five years Industry analysts have underestimated the price of the index by 0.7% on average (using month-end values). Over the past ten years industry analysts have overestimated the price of the index by 0.1% on average (using month-end values).

Over longer time periods analysts have typically overestimated the closing price 12 months later. Over the past fifteen years industry analysts have overestimated the price of the index by 8.2% on average (using month-end values). Over the past twenty years industry analysts have overestimated the price of the index by 9.7% on average (using month-end values).

This article lists the top computer vision companies in the US and globally. Machine vision (also known as computer vision) is the field of artificial intelligence that deals with the intelligent processing of visual information. The human eye takes in light which is received by photoreceptors known as cones and rods that sends signals to neurons that lead up to the brain. The brain then processes these signals to interpret what is being seen.

A computer acts very similarly. Electronic photoreceptors within a camera known as pixels take in light and send electrical signals to a microprocessor. Software then interprets what is seen.

Types of Computer Vision Companies and Software Suppliers

While machine vision has plenty of applications when building robots and other intelligent machines it also plays a significant part in automation. Within factories machine vision is used for automating various processes previously left to humans. For example cameras are used to locate track and count widgets on the factory floor. Cameras can also detect various anomalies such as missing widgets broken widgets fires machinery failures etc.

In the security field cameras can detect unauthorized entry or even use facial recognition to detect unauthorized personnel. On the highways machine vision is used for self-driving cars license plate readers and automated traffic detectors. Facebook uses machine vision to tag images of people while Google uses it for augmented reality applications.

In the scientific military and mapping fields machine vision can automate the processing of satellite imagery. Machine vision can also be used for improved weapon targeting the piloting of drones and automated passport checking at airports.

The email messages may contain no signatures or logos with typos and other errors being fairly common. These mailings may target individual users or large corporations with no significant differences in message content.

Example of a mass malicious mailing message

Things have started to change recently though as spammers began employing techniques that are typical of targeted attacks. In particular they have been sending emails in the name of real companies copying the senders’ writing style and signatures.

Customer email with an Easter egg inside

We discovered a noteworthy email message recently. In it someone posing as a Malaysian prospect and using a fairly odd variety of English asks the recipient to review some customer requirements and get back with the requested documents. The general format complies with the corporate correspondence standards: there is a logo that belongs to a real company and a signature that features sender details. Overall the request looks legit while the linguistic errors easily can be attributed to the sender being a non-native speaker.

The email from the “Malaysian prospect” with a malicious attachment

The only thing about the email that smells fishy is the sender’s address (newsletter@trade***.com) as “newsletter” is typically used for news not procurement. Besides the sender’s domain name is different from the company name in the logo.

In another email a purported Bulgarian customer inquires about the availability of some products and offers to discuss the details of a deal. The requested products list is said to be in the attachment as in the previous specimen. The sender’s address similarly suspicious belongs to a Greek not Bulgarian domain which apparently has no relation to the company whose name is used by the spammers.

The email from the “Bulgarian customer” with a malicious attachment

What these two messages have in common is both the mailing scenario and the fact that neither looks generated by a machine. Looking closely at the message headers we noticed that they shared a structure: a sequence of headers MSGID format and email client were the same. Besides the messages originated within a limited range of IP addresses. This suggested that they were part of one massive email campaign.

Comparing the message headers of two malicious emails

Unlike the IP addresses and headers the content varies. The spammers have been sending malicious archives addressed from a large number of companies with the “request” text changing as well. This suggests that the operators invested quite some effort into preparations which is uncharacteristic of this kind of campaigns.

Statistics

From April till August our systems detected 739749 messages attributed to the campaign. The email activity peaked in June with 194100 detected messages dropping to 178510 in July and to 104991 in August.

Payload: Agent Tesla malware

We studied the contents of the archives attached to the emails finding it to contain one of two unique files that belong to the same family. It is the widespread Agent Tesla malware written in .NET and known since 2014. Its main objective is to fetch passwords stored in browsers and other applications and forward these to the operator. While Agent Tesla most frequently forwards data via email there are versions that drop the stolen data into a Telegram secret chat on a website operated by the attackers or on an FTP server. The Agent Tesla version being spread by the campaign at hand is one the latest capable of ripping password from the following applications.

Agenta Tesla is also capable of making screenshots intercepting clipboard contents and logging keystrokes.

Agent Tesla attack geography

Agent Tesla targets users around the world. According to our observations the malware’s activity from May till August 2022 was the highest in Europe Asia and Latin America. The largest number of victims (20941) was recorded in Mexico. It was followed by Spain with 18090 users’ devices registering infection attempts and Germany where 14880 users were affected.

Ten most-attacked counties by number of affected users:

Countries/territory Users affected Mexico 20941 Spain 18090 Germany 14880 Turkey 13326 Russian Federation 12739 Italy 12480 Malaysia 10092 Vietnam 9760 Brazil 8851 Portugal 8739

Conclusion

The spam campaign we discovered is clear proof that cybercriminals can invest significant effort even in mass attacks. The email messages we studied appear to be high-quality imitations of business inquiries by real companies only given away by the inappropriate sender addresses. In all likelihood these emails were composed and sent out manually. That said our systems were detecting more than a hundred thousand of these emails each month which targeted organizations all around the world.

The payload spread by the attackers is capable of stealing login data from an imposing number of applications. The data may be offered for sale on darkweb forums or used in targeted attacks against organizations. Agent Tesla is notably a long-known stealer detected by most cybersecurity products. It is assigned the verdict Trojan-PSW.MSIL.Agensla by Kaspersky products.

But the TI TMX 1795 was an 8008 chip produced months before the 8008. It was never available commercially though so it has been largely forgotten by most people. But not [Ken Shirriff]. You can see a demo from 2015 of the device in the video below too.

The reason the chips have the same architecture is they were built to replace the same large circuit board inside a Datapoint 2200 programmable terminal. These were big beasts that could be programmed in BASIC or PL/B.

Datapoint asked Intel to shrink the board to a chip due to heating problems — but after delays they instead replaced the power supply and lost interest in the device. TI heard about the affair and wanted in on the deal. However Datapoint was unimpressed. The chip didn’t tolerate voltage fluctuations very well since they had replaced the power supply and had a new CPU design that was faster than the chip would be. They were also unimpressed with how much stuff you had to add to get a complete system.

So why did the Intel 8008 work out in the marketplace but the TI chip didn’t? After all Datapoint decided not to use the 8008 also. But as [Ken] points out the 8008 was much smaller than the TI chip and thus was more cost-effective to produce.

As usual [Ken]’s posts are always interesting and enlightening. He’s looked at a lot of old computers. He’s even dug into old space hardware. Great stuff!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVldGltZXMuZXUvcG93ZXItbWFuYWdlbWVudC1mYWNpbGl0YXRpbmctdGhlLWVuZXJneS1qb3VybmV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Power Management: Facilitating the Energy Journey,"The EE Times Green Engineering Summit held Sept. 13–15 housed a discussion of ideas and approaches for achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. The Summit included a variety of topics including sustainable electronics efficient power generation and distribution energy storage the digitization of agriculture to make it more efficient alternative renewable energy sources and environmental monitoring and modeling.

In this article we will cover Texas Instruments’ (TI’s) talk on energy requirements and efforts to meet them in a more efficient and reliable way. The talk titled “Power Management: Advancing the Journey of Energy” was presented by Kannan Soundarapandian vice president and general manager of the High Voltage Power Products Business Unit at TI. Maurizio Di Paolo Emilio editor-in-chief of Power Electronics News and EEWeb moderated the session.

The talk started with identifying the energy problem that needs to be solved; namely that the world is consuming more energy and predictions are that this will continue to grow rapidly in the coming decades. Power generation will always lag behind the demand for it. Soundarapandian specifically talked about data center power supply units (PSUs). Figure 1 shows the energy consumption forecast through this decade for networks production of information and communication technology consumer devices and data centers.

The forecast shows an acceleration in the energy demand for data centers and networks. As the world moves to a more digital globally connected economy data centers play a crucial rule in maintaining this flow of increased data. Hence PSUs play a big part in overall energy consumption.

Some of the key trends and opportunities in server and data center PSUs are:

Higher power density : Typical PSU power ratings are increasing from 500 W to the 3- to 6-kW range. In effect this means a density change from about 40 W/ in. 3 to 90 W/in. 3 .

: Typical PSU power ratings are increasing from 500 W to the 3- to 6-kW range. In effect this means a density change from about 40 W/ in. to 90 W/in. . Efficiency improvements : PSU efficiencies have been improving from the range of 91% to 93% to 96% to 97.5%. 80 Plus Titanium efficiency guidelines requiring >90% efficiency across all load conditions is the goal.

: PSU efficiencies have been improving from the range of 91% to 93% to 96% to 97.5%. 80 Plus Titanium efficiency guidelines requiring >90% efficiency across all load conditions is the goal. Cost reductions : Greater affordability of more efficient PSUs is key to its widespread usage.

: Greater affordability of more efficient PSUs is key to its widespread usage. Sophisticated interface protocols: This is essential for greater speed and security. CAN Bus interfaces are an example of this.

Soundarapandian also listed the various approaches taken by TI to make PSUs more efficient and sustainable to meet the growing energy demand:

1) Topology improvements: More efficient architectures enable higher efficiency and power density. An example is shown in Figure 2 where a 1% improvement in efficiency can be achieved by moving from the standard bridge-boost PFC rectifier to a bridgeless totem-pole PFC rectifier reducing the number of diodes and with the more efficient switch. Additionally totem-pole PFCs are capable of soft switching at higher frequencies which can give power-density improvements by reducing magnetic component sizes.

Figure 2: An example of topology changes for improved efficiency in PSUs

2) Improved hardware: Gallium nitride (GaN) devices such as high-electron–mobility transistors (HEMTs) provide a number of advantages over legacy silicon solutions. The wider bandgap higher electron mobility and lower parasitics allow for much faster switching slew rates. TI’s GaN HEMTs with integrated drivers can reach switching speeds of 150 V/ns with minimal ringing in a low-inductance package. This leads to lower switching loss. The HEMTs can also switch at frequencies over 500 kHz which allows designers to use up to 60% smaller magnetics and hence lower system cost. A smaller footprint on these components can allow for more room to cool the devices. The reliability of these integrated GaN HEMTs is an area of focus at TI. Over 40 million hours of reliability data has been recorded to date and parts have been subjected to tests beyond the standard JEDEC specifications used on silicon devices. This includes the analysis and understanding of the various failure mechanisms so that PSUs can continue to operate efficiently for a long time which provides additional lifetime cost savings and reduces electronic waste. Cost advantages of the GaN-on-silicon die manufacturing adopted by TI are an important part of its overall benefit. This is one example where GaN has advantages over the higher cost of silicon carbide (SiC) in the PSU application space.

3) Enhanced firmware: With the faster switching frequencies that GaN offers it is important for the control circuitry to respond fast with time-critical real-time sensing and control for faster control-loop execution. TI’s C2000 real-time–control MCUs offer this precision control with software and peripheral scalability; for example when moving from a 500-W to a 3-kW PSU.

During the Q&A Di Paolo Emilio asked Soundarapandian about the macro power generation/distribution environment around the PSUs and what needs to be done to improve efficiency. Soundarapandian replied that this needs to be a multi-dimensional solution.

On energy generation the world is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels and as the world switches to renewable forms of energy production such as solar wind and geothermal infrastructure improvements need to take place. This includes energy storage systems micro-grid systems for generation/distribution at a localized level and an emphasis on loss reduction at all stages.

Loss reductions are a key enabler for cost reductions. An example of this is that as PSUs move toward higher and higher power levels beyond 1 kW the system bus voltage would probably need to increase from the prevalent 12 V to higher voltages such as 48 V. This would be essential in reducing IR losses in the copper wiring. Thermal management is also essential and the improved figure of merit that GaN offers versus silicon allows for greater cooling options from the size savings in magnetics.

While more than a billion people on the planet don’t have access to a power grid we are witnessing a growing pervasiveness of small solar systems in which a solar panel and a battery are connected to constitute a system along with an electrical outlet either a USB port or an AC adapter. These pay-as-you-go solar systems are growing in popularity in Africa and some parts of Asia where people can access electricity for about $6 to $8 a month.

This allows fishermen to freeze what they catch and get it to the market safely. People are also able to have light bulbs TVs and mobile phone chargers in their homes. Alex Lidow power semiconductors industry veteran and CEO and co-founder of Efficient Power Conversion (EPC) called this a quiet trend when he spoke on a panel during the Green Engineering Summit held virtually last week. He said that many startups as well as large companies are now operating in this field.

The panel discussion “Alternative energy sources and related energy storage technologies” aimed to determine the megatrends in renewable industries. Maurizio Di Paolo Emilio editor-in-chief of Power Electronics News and EEWeb moderated this panel joined by leading experts in the power design industry.

Another panelist Shri Joshi head of the Industrial Power Control (IPC) division for the Americas at Infineon Technologies presented an interesting statistic. Of all the cumulative capacity on the solar grid in the United States only 6% have the battery or storage attached. “It shows an immense potential for storage to grow” he said. “It also shows that storage will come in various forms not just stationary batteries.”

Joshi added that the overall picture is quite diversified at the macro level. “In the United States we have a lot of emphasis on grid-scale storage before-the-meter” he said. “In Germany there is a lot of emphasis on behind-the-meter and that drives different topologies and component requirements.”

With the advent of wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors Joshi said there is a shift toward high-frequency conversion. That will greatly impact the passives and will also mandate new requirements for thermal management. “Components with better thermal conductivity can squeeze higher power from a given circuit size” he said.

Like Lidow Joshi sees that solar and storage are getting combined which means battery voltages will go as high as 1500 V. That in turn calls for WBG technologies like silicon carbide. Here as Joshi noticed there is a propensity for going toward high-frequency switching. “There is a need for creatively integrated modules with low self-inductance because that matters for surge voltages” he said. “It was unheard of five to 10 years ago.”

Three megatrends in ESS

When asked about megatrends in energy storage system (ESS) technologies Henrik Mannesson general manager for grid infrastructure at Texas Instruments identified three areas.

First while there is a need to generate more energy the majority of which is now produced by solar and wind power conversion has become an important consideration in ESS solutions.

Second for energy storage solutions in households increasing round-trip efficiencies heat management higher power density and the overall size of energy storage systems have become major design considerations.

Third on the battery side of things Mannesson like Infineon’s Joshi sees a clear transition toward higher voltages. “While portable ESS solutions have been operating at 48-V systems on solar power many ESS solutions now connected to the grid are moving to 400-V battery technologies” Mannesson said.

Patrick Le Fèvre chief marketing and communications officer at Powerbox presented the European viewpoint about ESS technologies. He told the panel that wind turbines were shut down in some European countries because power could not be distributed to the network due to energy access. Additionally he said that due to the lack of wind in countries like Germany and the U.K. how we can optimally store energy is still an open question.

Le Fèvre noted that ESS technology is still a big question mark. “We are currently at the development phase so more research is required for mass energy storage.”

The panel agreed on the need to intensify the research on ESS technologies. However EPC’s Lidow concluded the discussion on the future of ESS solutions with a more provocative note.

He raised this question: While electric vehicles are taking off what will we do with all those batteries? First how do we build them? Do they outlast the mechanical shell around them? Or does a car require a replacement before the battery wears out? “The recycling of batteries may be an important element in the storage of electricity from renewables” Lidow said.

Think of all those batteries piled up and hooked to the grid — that would be a good thing for energy storage systems.

The case — Travelers Property Casualty Company of America v. International Control Services Inc. (ICS) — hinged on ICS claiming it had multifactor authentication (MFA) in place when the electronics manufacturer applied for a policy. In May the company experienced a ransomware attack. Forensics investigators determined there was no MFA in place so Travelers asserted it should not be liable for the claim.

The case (No. 22-cv-2145) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois on July 6. At the end of August the litigants agreed to void the contract ending ICS's efforts to have its insurer cover its losses.

This case was unusual in that Travelers maintained the misrepresentation ""materially affected the acceptance of the risk and/or the hazard assumed by Travelers"" in the court filing.

Taking a client to court is a departure from other similar cases where an insurance company simply denied the claim but it is hardly unique said Scott Godes a partner at Barnes & Thornburg LLP a Washington D.C.-based law firm.

""I have seen this issue bubbling up over the last few years. From my perspective insurance carriers have made this a hard market — raising premiums and lowering limits — and that has emboldened them to choose the nuclear option by rescinding coverage"" Godes says.

Security should be proactive stopping possible breaches before they occur rather than simply responding to each successful attack notes Sean O'Brien visiting fellow at the Information Society Project at Yale Law School and the founder of Privacy Lab at Yale Law School.

Solo travel can be restorative allow (or force!) you to enjoy your own company face your fears and connect with new places in an entirely different way. But the best part? Solo travel means you don’t have to negotiate a single thing. Go to bed when you want. Wake up when you want. Sleep on whatever side of the bed you want. Listen to all of the terrible music you want. Eat what you want. Do what you want when you want how you want and for whatever reason you want!

Now thanks to a new Solo Traveler feature on the Airbnb app you can do all of that while feeling safe and secure—a huge priority for any solo traveler. The app now lets single travelers share their itinerary read safety tips and get a list of suggested questions to ask their host for extra peace of mind. All users can also use Airbnb’s Local Emergency Services feature (available 24/7) and add an emergency contact to their profile.

Having said that there are still specific listing features solo travelers should look for—after all you probably don’t want to stay alone in (or foot the bill for) a six-bedroom villa or sprawling countryside manor. Whether you want to escape from it all discover new places or find solitude for reflecting hammock-swinging and cocktail-making—or if you just don’t want to put off an adventure for one more day—here are 15 Airbnbs that will make you happy you chose the best traveling partner in the entire world: you."

“We were tasked to provide precise bathymetric and sediment surveys of 342 miles of the Colorado River system between Hoover Dam and Mexico” says Jason Carey principal river engineer at RiverRestoration a river engineering company based in Carbondale Colo. “To perform these precise surveying processes we’d need high-precision survey measurements which would be extremely challenging as most of the project corridor was in a super remote area with no existing survey networks communications support or Internet access. In response to those challenges we chose to deploy positioning technology we had not used before for a significant portion of this massive undertaking. That was a huge risk for our small company. However we knew if it worked the gamble would not only be worth it for this endeavor it would establish a new workflow for the future.”

Fortunately for Carey and his project team the uncertainty has proved a successful gamble.

With a combination of meticulous pre-planning and advanced real-time precise point positioning (PPP) technology the RiverRestoration team is not only proving its multi-layered data-fusion approach was a solid bet it’s proving that PPP technology answers uncertainty with certainty whether it’s across remote lands open skies or vast rivers.

Troubled waters

One would be hard pressed to find a river more important to a region than the Lower Colorado.

It supplies drinking water for 40 million people and is vital to the United States’ food supply irrigating millions of acres of farms and ranch lands. It’s reported that the Colorado River irrigates almost 90 percent of the nation’s winter vegetable crops. It supports a $1.4 trillion USD economy and hundreds of thousands of jobs.

And yet in April 2022 the Colorado River was designated the most endangered river in the US—it had been on the endangered list since 2017.

Recognizing the waterway’s unique significance and impact the US Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) the federal agency that oversees water resource management has been implementing with increasing urgency mitigation and management strategies to sustain the river’s health. As part of that effort in early 2021 the BOR Lower Colorado Region issued a request for solicitation to survey and collect bathymetric and sediment data on 342 miles of the river channel including its reservoirs—data detail that would help them better understand erosion dynamics and their impact on the water capacity in the system.

RiverRestoration was awarded the contract and in June 2021 they launched the Lower Colorado River Assessment Project a complex undertaking that would require diverse expertise in land surveying aerial topo-bathymetric lidar bathymetry riverbed data collection and Trimble® CenterPoint® RTX PPP technology. Of critical importance to the measurable success of the project was the ability to establish a ground control network accurate to 2 cm (0.06 feet) horizontally and 3 cm (0.1 ft) vertically to tie the whole 342 miles of distance together.

That arduous task went to Precision Surveys based in Albuquerque New Mexico.

“Because the whole project team was going to rely on our control we had to make darn sure that what we set was accurate” says Larry Medrano Precision Survey’s president. “The accuracy requirement was rigorous in itself but it was particularly challenging for a project that long. In addition to choosing trusted Trimble technology for geodetic control we wanted to test Trimble’s CenterPoint RTX PPP technology. Having used Trimble RTX before we were confident it would be good but we didn’t know it was going to be that good.”

The proof is in the numbers

In October 2021 the Precision Survey team headed to Yuma Ariz. to create the project control.

To achieve consistently high accuracy over such a long distance six surveyors established the precise control network through primary static GNSS observations stored for post-processing and secondary differential base-rover RTK measurements while static data was recorded. Setting up on predetermined locations 10 miles apart the crews installed #5 rebar with aluminum cap marks in the ground and set either a Trimble R10 or Trimble R12 GNSS receiver on the mark and acquired static observations for 1.5 hours. For redundancy they raised their 2-m rod to 2.5 m and ran a second static session. Simultaneous to the static observations they set up an R10 or R12 unit and established a secondary control point using their rover receiver a few hundred feet away collecting RTK data for 3 minutes and then repeating the process at the elevated 2.5-m height for another 3 minutes. After acquiring both primary and secondary measurements they took 30-second shots of each of the two control points with the Trimble RTX-compatible R10 and R12 receivers to have a quality control check for later comparison. Through this process they gained confidence there was high fidelity between the static data RTK data and Trimble’s CenterPoint RTX observations.

Once the morning control points were established they moved north to their next locations and set two more control point pairs. To ensure they could tie the morning work to the afternoon work one surveyor occupied a primary control point for the entire day. Covering about seven sites a day the Precision Survey team established 62 control points across 30 sites along the river corridor—some of which they had to access by pontoon boat—in 4.5 days.

Every night the GNSS data was post-processed with Trimble Business Center (TBC) by Bob Green the project’s survey coordinator and professional land surveyor with Bismarck ND-based Frontier Precision. Once all the data was processed using the precise ephemeris Green integrated available CORS data from the National Geodetic Survey and then used TBC’s network adjustment tools to perform a final processing of the static and RTK measurements. This created a geodetic control network precise to 2 cm horizontally and 3 cm vertically both at a 95 percent confidence level. As a final step he compared the real-time Trimble RTX correction data with his results which he says “amazed” him.

“The CenterPoint RTX data was within a 1/2 inch horizontally and 3/4 inch vertically” says Green. “I was a bit surprised by how accurate it was particularly when you consider it took me over 24 hours to calculate the final control network and Trimble RTX’s real-time accuracy matched if not bested our results. It not only proved to us that Trimble RTX technology is a game changer in accuracy and efficiency it gave the whole project team the confidence it needed to trust the real-time corrections going forward.”

Indeed for the next two data collection phases CenterPoint RTX played a far more central role.

Aerial Support

In November 2021 Precision Surveys returned to the field to support the aerial lidar topo-bathymetric survey which included a Trimble AP60 GNSS-inertial system and a “green” lidar sensor with water depth penetrations of up to 30 ft. Originally the plan was to acquire differential base-rover RTK measurements for ground control calibration however because crews were able to use their Trimble R12 receiver and CenterPoint RTX corrections to check in to the pre-established control monuments they didn’t need to set up an RTK base station on control monuments.

Prior to each of the 30 flights ground crews first used their R12 to check into a ground control monument. They then either stood on docks or waded into the shallow water and collected a cluster of 10 submerged hard surfaces like boat ramp corners or the tops of boulders for bathymetric ground control shots; each of the shots were spaced at least 1 m apart and at varying depths while being careful not to stir up sediment that increases turbidity. They also documented riverbed attributes such as gravel sand or bedrock and photographed each point location.

While the aerial crew from NV5 Geospatial were in flight ground teams again used the R12 to acquire a minimum of five precise water’s edge shots at 1-m spacings as well as attribute data and photos. The CenterPoint RTX-based water elevation detail coupled with the underwater depth measurements provided the data needed to calibrate the above-water and below-water lidar sensors.

“The positioning certainty of the real-time RTX greatly reduced our need to post-process the data saving us substantial time back in the office” says Carey.

Although the lidar acquisition did not include real-time GNSS corrections the team used Trimble Applanix’s POSPac post-processed CenterPoint RTX internet-based service to post-process the GNSS-inertial trajectory. This service uses the same corrections as real-time Trimble RTX but it’s integrated with inertial technology and optimized for mobile mapping and survey applications.

With the corrected lidar data an aerial “voids” map was developed for areas where the river was more than 30 ft deep and lidar returns were not accurate. Based on that map the RiverRestoration group defined and planned a vessel-based bathymetric survey to fill in the aerial survey voids.

Floating new technology

Between mid-February and early April 2022 vessel crews criss-crossed 60 square miles of the Colorado River—roughly two-thirds of the project area—to acquire bathymetric data and sediment samples.

Traditionally boat surveys have required differential base-rover RTK surveying for real-time corrections but given the environment and survey area setting up base stations would have been extremely difficult and time consuming. So they opted to float the risky proposition of using the beta version of Applanix’s POS MV WaveMaster II marine positioning solution with CenterPoint RTX real-time corrections.

“With RTK we probably would have had to make a game day decision to rely on post processing positions and we wouldn’t have had reliable in field positioning to find the lidar voids” says Carey. “That not only would have resulted in surveying about a 25 percent greater overlapping area at slower speeds it would’ve also posed more risk to the crew’s and equipment’s safety.”

RiverRestoration equipped three boats with Multi-Beam Echo Sounder instruments that incorporate dual GNSS receivers for position and headings and the POS MV WaveMaster II. For redundancy and for control checks each of the three boats carried a Trimble R10 with real-time CenterPoint RTX. A fourth boat had a single beam solution with a Trimble R12i GNSS receiver which has both Trimble RTX and an integrated inertial measurement unit. With all of the vessels capable of obtaining reliable real-time GNSS corrections the survey areas could be efficiently located divided and merged.

Each morning they initialized the CenterPoint RTX corrections and checked into the pre-established control network to confirm the real-time data was accurate and functioning properly. Guided by the void maps installed on Trimble TSC7 data controllers they navigated to each of the void areas checking into control every 10 miles while maintaining speeds of about six miles per hour.

“At that speed you can come up on a shoal really quickly and potentially damage the boat or equipment” says Carey. “The ability to immediately know where we are with consistent positioning better than 0.1 feet even in deep canyon areas gave us the confidence to travel as fast as we could. The real-time corrections also enabled a crew from Survey Systems to conduct night surveying which greatly increased our productivity.”

In total the vessel survey campaign took about five months to complete. But Carey says that time commitment would’ve been significantly longer with RTK because they would’ve needed to repeatedly set up RTK base stations and potentially lose their radio signal about every half mile.

“With RTX once it converged to an accurate position we maintained accuracy throughout the entire day” he says. “Not having to move a base station every few miles saved us countless hours in the field.”

Since finishing the boat survey the project team has been processing the remote sensing lidar and echosounder data and stitching both datasets together to create a seamless 3D map of the bathymetry of the Colorado River system from Hoover Dam to Mexico. Although BOR’s accuracy requirements for the bathymetric mapping is 10 cm RMS and 19.6 cm 2 sigma Carey says preliminary results indicate their final data when delivered in October 2022 will be more precise than requested.

“This was a massive complex project and one that I don’t think has ever been undertaken to this level of accuracy before” concludes Carey. “CenterPoint RTX quickly proved to be the right solution for it. The accurate real-time GNSS corrections reliably improved the safety the production and the coverage of this survey while reducing the effort that was anticipated with the more labor and equipment intensive radio link differential RTK base station method. The risk of deploying RTX corrections on this project proved to be a rewarding solution that we will implement in all future projects.”

Medrano also agrees that Trimble’s CenterPoint RTX technology will anchor their survey work going forward.

“We proved the validity of a real-time GNSS correction service to everyone and delivered measurement data at a 95 percent confidence level as specified” says Medrano. “For any contracts that I bid going forward I’ll no longer need to consider static surveys. I’m going to pull out our CenterPoint RTX receivers and we’ll be good to go. It’s a fantastic tool.”

Given the resounding success of this project it’s a safe bet that for the next high-precision mapping project RiverRestoration’s field crews won’t be carrying the same amount of uncertainty or risk.

Shares of Carnival  Norwegian and Royal Caribbean fell this week after the Federal Reserve again hiked rates raising worries about cruise companies' huge debt loads and their ability to recover in a broader economic downturn.

The declines in cruise stocks come as the industry is working to recover from the pandemic with bookings ticking up after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lifted Covid-19 guidelines from ships.

""There's a lot of one step forward one step back going on"" Truist analyst Patrick Scholes said. He also noted the debt cruise companies racked up while their ships were anchored during the pandemic.

As of Sept. 1 Truist estimates that Carnival holds $35 billion in debt Royal Caribbean has $25 billion and Norwegian owes $14 billion. Respectively the companies' values in the stock market are about $11.01 billion $11.18 billion and $5.61 billion.

The declines came during a selloff in the broader market as the three major indices have taken a beating since the Fed's decision Wednesday.

Norwegian Carnival and Royal Caribbean did not respond to request for comment."

And that’s the goal of Jamestown Community College’s Manufacturing Technology Institute. MTI 512 Falconer St. held a manufacturing and technology expo Thursday where Dunkirk and Springville P-Tech students had a chance to network and learn about a variety of technology products such as CAD/CAM software 3-D scanning robotics automation and machining and tooling.

“This is a great event. We are really excited to be part of it” said Todd Tranum executive director of Manufacturers Association of the Southern Tier and president of Dream It Do It of Western New York.

JCC Workforce Development Director Grant Umberger agreed.

“We are the training arm of the college and we provide training solutions that have individuals go directly into employment” Umberger said.

Students also learned about technology through live demostartaions interactive breakout sessions and meeting with a variety of vendors.

Liam Rivera a senior at P-Tech in Dunkirk is very familiar with the JCC-MTI facility and is looking to develop skills in mechanical technology.

“I took a mechanical technology course in my junior year” Rivera said. “I spend my Fridays here because I take half-days at P-tech and half-days at JCC. My dream job would probably be to become an architect. I love hands-on building. I love building and P-Tech has really helped me out with that.”

Rivera added not only does P-Tech show him hands-on work P-Tech also gives access to him about machine work and digital technologies.

“They (P-Tech) have been an incredible help” Rivera noted.

Steve Myers of Applied Industrial Technologies located in Erie Pa. said he was attending to lend support for industrial distribution.

“We work with local manufacturers. We are bringing products and services that we help local manufacturer with and we are sharing the information today with everybody” Myers said.

Jeffrey Teluk director of engineering science and mechanical technology said area businesses got a chance to network and showing students a classroom setting versus a job setting.

“We also invited students to get a better idea of what (jobs) are out there as far capabilities. The students also get a contextual information as to what we show in a classroom versus what’s out there in the real world” Teluk said.

Teluk said another similar networking event is held in the spring where students have to have situational attire for a chance to maybe interview with prospective employers looking to hire workers.

“They (the students) actually get a chance to get hired” Teluk noted.

Randy Biebel of FARO Technologies Inc. located in Exton Pa. showed students what 3-D scanning involved.

Biebel said he takes an object and scans it in several different orientations to create one STL (stereolithography) model. STL is the type of file needed to print a 3-D copy of the object.

“It only took a few moments and we scanned by laser” Biebel said.

Tranum said that more young talent is needed in the manufacturing workforce.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Minnesota Vikings have a 32-17 regular season record in the building that is shaped like a Vikings ship.

The stadium is one of the most revered places in the city of Minneapolis. It even lights up purple at night.

On Thursday the governing body of the stadium the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority approved moving forward with plans to put a fence around the stadium.

According to an article from local NBC affiliate KARE-11 it is an investment for both fan safety and the safety of the stadium.

“By entering into an agreement for these professional services the MSFA intends to further explore specific concepts and estimated costs of a permanent secured perimeter” the MFSA said in a statement. “Goals for the potential perimeter project include enhanced public safety preservation of public access and inclusion of public art.”

Lester Bagley who is the Vikings VP of public affairs says that the fence is an investment in public safety.

“It focuses on the security issue while not losing the great iconic design and beauty of U.S. Bank Stadium” Bagley said.

The installation of a fence was first recommended by homeland security in 2016 and Vikings have supported that idea since then. Finding the plan for the fence will take approximately a year according to Bagely

As far as who is going to pay for the fence? That hasn’t been decided as of yet. Taxpayers paid for $500 million of the project and sticking them with the bill wouldn’t be a great look.

Needless to say the gameday experience will be forever changed once the fence goes up.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2U1OTQwODdlLTEyNmItNDM3Ni05MGFkLTJhMjQ1YzgzMTNmM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citi to slash lending to buyout funds as new capital rules bite,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

UBER,Uber,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9xLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvVWJlci1icmVhY2gtbWZhLWZhdGlndWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Multi-Factor Authentication Fatigue Key Factor in Uber Breach,"Earlier this week Uber disclosed that the recent breach it suffered was made possible through a multi-factor authentication (MFA) fatigue attack where the attacker disguised themselves as Uber IT.

MFA attacks are a form of social engineering consisting in spamming a target with repeated MFA requests until they eventually authorize access. This kind of attacks is possible when the threat actor has gained access to corporate login credentials but cannot access the account due to multi-factor authentication.

According to Uber

It is likely that the attacker purchased the contractor’s Uber corporate password on the dark web after the contractor’s personal device had been infected with malware.

To make sense of the likeliness of an MFA fatigue attack to succeed security researcher Kevin Beaumont recalled on Twitter this is the same technique used in the recent LAPSUS$ attacks about which the attacker allegedly explained: ""call the employee 100 times at 1AM while he is trying to sleep and he will more than likely accept it"".

In Uber's case the approach was different though. As reported by Lawrence Abrams for Bleeping Computer security researcher Corben Leo got in touch with the hacker behind the breach and learned they contacted the targeted contractor on WhatsApp claiming they were from Uber IT and that the only way to get rid of the unstopping notifications was to accept one.

Once the attacker got their device authorized for access to Uber intranet they began scanning the corporate network until they found a PowerShell script with admin credentials for the platform Uber uses to manage its login secrets including DA DUO Onelogin AWS and Gsuite. This allowed them to grab source code and more worryingly to get access to Uber's HackerOne bug bounty program. This in turn gave the attacker information about vulnerability reports that have not been fixed yet.

In conversation with InfoQ Cerby's chief trust officer Matt Chiodi stated that ""if what’s being reported is true this would be an unprecedented level of access even when compared to SolarWinds"". One way to mitigate the impact of such incidents according to Chiodi is applying a Zero Trust strategy consisting in trusting no device even within corporate network boundaries.

Zero Trust principles can greatly contain the blast radius. For example IBM found in its research that when Zero Trust principles are implemented by a company the cost of a breach is reduced by 42%.”

Varun Badhwar founder and CEO of stealth-mode startup Endor Labs released a statement for InfoQ hinting at the resurgence in social engineering and phishing attacks of late.

According to the 2022 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 82% of breaches last year involved the human element. That’s astronomical number and it demonstrates humans are still the weakest link in cybersecurity.

In Badhwar's view this further reinforces the idea of applying zero trust and least privilege principles for securing employee access to sensitive data and code.

Uber's investigation into this recent breach is not complete yet and it will likely bring more light into it. InfoQ will continue informing as new detail emerge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL2xvZ2luLWNvZGUtbXVsdGlmYWN0b3ItYXV0aGVudGljYXRpb24tbWZh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber hack challenges popular MFA login security practices,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2022/09/23/login-code-multifactor-authentication-mfa on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL2xvZ2luLWNvZGUtbXVsdGlmYWN0b3ItYXV0aGVudGljYXRpb24tbWZh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZWVodWdnZXIuY29tL3ViZXItdG8tZ28tYWxsLWVsZWN0cmljLWJ5LTIwMzAtNjc0MzE2NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber to Exclusively Offer Electric Vehicles by 2030,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.treehugger.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /uber-to-go-all-electric-by-2030-6743165 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002674107ED70>, 'Connection to www.treehugger.com timed out.

The airline which flies for United Airlines Holdings Inc. American Airlines Group Inc. and cargo carrier DHL Express said Thursday that it acquired 29 small two-seat planes with options to buy as many as 75 more over the next year. It plans to extend pilots interest-free loans to fly those planes around until they have accumulated the hours they need to work at Mesa.

“I really believe this will crack open the nut in terms of all these pilots out there trying to build time"" Jonathan Ornstein Mesa’s chief executive said in an interview.

Competition for pilots has been fierce in recent months and regional carriers like Mesa have said they have struggled to keep up. That is partly because bigger airlines have raided smaller operators hiring more quickly than ever to replenish their ranks as they recover from the pandemic. As a result airlines say many regional planes have been grounded without enough pilots to fly them and dozens of small cities around the country have seen reductions in flights.

Regional airlines have been boosting pay to lure more recruits. For instance Mesa recently said it would nearly triple newly hired first officers’ pay to $100 an hour. Horizon Air part of Alaska Air Group Inc. this month agreed to hike pay by 74% for captains and 85% for first officers. Pilots at regional airlines owned by American Airlines are also getting sizable raises though a portion is temporary.

Some airlines’ efforts to mitigate what they describe as burdensome experience requirements have run up against resistance. The Air Line Pilots Association a major pilot union disputes that there is a shortage and has said carriers are looking to cut corners and weaken rules the union says are critical for safety.

This week the Federal Aviation Administration rejected a request by Republic Airways Inc. another regional airline to halve the required hours for pilots who go through a special program at the airline’s training academy finding that Republic’s proposal wouldn’t provide an “equivalent level of safety.""

Pilots coming out of flight school with commercial licenses generally have about 250 hours of flying time under their belts. But in the U.S. pilots must have at least 1500 hours of flying experience to qualify for a job at an airline unless they are former military pilots or graduates of colleges and universities with professional aviation programs.

To bridge that gap many aspiring pilots work as flight instructors. Some fly charter flights or find odd jobs towing banners or dusting crops. If they have the funds pilots can rent time in small aircraft. It can take over a year sometimes a few years to build up the hours.

Mesa’s plan likely won’t quash debate about the 1500-hour rule which was implemented in 2013 in the wake of a fatal plane crash in 2009 near Buffalo N.Y. Investigators blamed that crash on a tired crew who didn’t properly react to stall warnings.

Advocates including family members of those who perished in the 2009 crash unions and some safety officials say the rule ensures that pilots have sufficient experience. But some executives and other safety experts believe that the additional time is a prohibitive barrier for many would-be pilots that adds little benefit. And since the hours are unstructured some executives say they can result in ingrained bad habits that then need to be unlearned.

Mesa will offer its light-sport planes to pilots for $25 an hour—significantly below the cost of renting a plane at most local airports—and will cover the costs with interest-free loans. Mesa said that pilots in the program will be able to fly up to 40 hours a week which it said will allow them to build their time more quickly than they could otherwise. Mesa hopes its initiative will eventually accommodate over 1000 pilots a year.

The new training program will operate in Florida starting in October and Mesa expects to expand to Arizona. Pilots in the program will get flight benefits and begin building seniority at Mesa and will have “priority status"" for employment there once they are qualified. Pilots will have three years to repay the costs.

Kaplan Safe Driver of the Year Awards.

Professional drivers across the U.S. and Canada are nominated for the award every year – and the recognition doesn’t come easy. Drivers must have at least 15 consecutive years or 250000 consecutive miles driven without a preventable accident.

Why it matters: UPSers are serious about safe driving. Nearly 10600 Circle of Honor drivers earned the distinction by driving more than 25 years without an accident – that’s about 15 billion miles without so much as a fender-bender. The top seven of this elite group were awarded Safe Driver of the Year.

The secret to their success is a commitment to world-class training. In the U.S. alone we invest more than $260 million a year on safety training at UPS. Our operations employees participate in five million hours of safety training per year.

Give them a shout out: Show appreciation for your safe UPS drivers here or use #ThankAUPSer.

Did you know: UPS is now hiring more than 100000 seasonal workers for the holidays. Following last year’s holiday season nearly 35000 seasonal employees – more than a third – earned permanent positions with UPS.

That can be life-changing: The average pay for a UPS delivery driver is $95000 or $112000 for tractor-trailer drivers. Add in another $50000 in health welfare and pension contributions. After four years drivers make an average of $42 per hour.

(Reuters) -FedEx Corp's new chief executive must show he can play catch up on costs without further eroding service Wall Street analysts said on Friday after the global delivery company laid out plans to slash up to $2.7 billion in expenses for fiscal 2023.

FedEx's plan announced on Thursday escalates pressure on CEO Raj Subramaniam to address internal missteps and adjust to a darkening global economy that hammered the company's fiscal first-quarter profits.

Some analysts said they are no longer giving the CEO - who succeeded FedEx founder Fred Smith in June - the benefit of the doubt.

""This is 1) now a ""show me"" story and 2) management must be careful not to cut so deep as to affect already sub-optimal post-pandemic service levels"" Stifel analysts wrote in a client note.

The delivery industry is grappling with the prospect of profit-sapping excess capacity as the pandemic shipping bubble deflates.

But FedEx has its own woes. Its structure with separately operated Express Ground and Freight units creates cost redundancies that are difficult to wring out.

FedEx is also more exposed than competitors like United Parcel Service and Deutsche Post DHL Group to softening demand for air shipments out of Asia.

The integration of its multi-billion dollar TNT Express acquisition in Europe has been so troubled that one analyst dubbed it an ""unmitigated disaster"". And Subramaniam raised the temperature on simmering unrest in FedEx's U.S. Ground delivery contractor network by dubbing it ""much more of a perception issue than reality.""

Last week FedEx withdrew the financial forecast it issued just three months earlier - sparking frustration among investors who bet on a turnaround.

Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski bluntly summarized the investor and analyst exasperation during Thursday's call with management.

""Your asset efficiency is literally half that of your nearest competitor which is unionized if I might add"" he said referring to UPS.

FedEx's action plan and comments did little to quell the discontent. The company's shares dropped as much as 3.9% to a more than two-year low of $148.50 in early Friday trade. They had shed 40% year to date as of Thursday's close compared with a 22% drop in shares of UPS.

""We remain skeptical on (FedEx's) scale and pace of cuts into a softening demand backdrop coupled with its European Express service issues ... as well as ongoing FedEx Ground contractor disputes"" BofA Global Research analyst Ken Hoexter said in a note.

Following a Sept. 13 hearing Judge Evelio Grillo ruled that the Bay Area Air Quality Management District’s July abatement order against the cannabis company Green Sage is “immediately enforceable” and invited the district to apply for a temporary restraining order in case the generators pop up again.

Since October 2020 Green Sage had been using unpermitted diesel generators on its property so its cannabis tenants could cultivate pot. At its peak the property was using a dozen generators and racking up enough electricity to power 9000 homes according to the air district.



Through the end of August Green Sage kept using five diesel generators in defiance of the order even as the company also faced a series of building and fire code violation citations threats of city fines and criminal charges and pending legal action from activists and residents.



The company argued in a court filing that it needed more power than PG&E could provide in order to meet the needs of cannabis cultivation citing millions of dollars of crop lost if there was a sudden change in energy supply.



The air district said it’s working with the city of Oakland and Alameda County to enforce the order and ensure more generators don’t arrive on the property. If Green Sage does not comply they could face multiple penalties in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.



“We’re watching it very closely” said Kristine Roselius an air district spokesperson.



The company did not respond to a request for comment on the order.

The district initially prompted the property owners of 5601 and 5733 San Leandro St. to curtail their unpermitted power source because of the “adverse air quality impacts” it was posing onto the community. East Oakland residents already face disproportionate levels of pollution due to their proximity to industrial sites and busy highways making the carcinogenic fumes that much more potent according to the district.



“The Air District City of Oakland and Alameda County will continue to work together to protect the residents of East Oakland who are already disproportionately impacted by air pollution. We will not let up until these air quality violations have ceased permanently” Veronica Eady senior deputy executive officer of policy and equity at the air district said in a statement.



Also on the property are artists living in The Cannery a historical live-work space that’s been permitted for decades before Green Sage acquired the building in 2016.



Residents there and throughout the 25 other live-work spaces in Oakland’s 10-mile “Green Zone” are protected from evictions. But tenants slowly began to move out as tensions rose between them and their landlord — only a handful of the 20 available artists lofts are currently in use.

Residents continuously voiced their concerns to various local agencies as the diesel generators continued to run 24/7 with their first complaint to the air district last September.



Alistair Monroe who has been a key opponent to Green Sage’s practices said something changed when they looped in the California Department of Cannabis Control which did a “total sting operation” in late August. Monroe said they visited the property numerous times to take photographs and film the violations in action.

A spokesperson for the department confirmed that it conducted an operation but cannot share details as the investigation is ongoing.



“That was like the icing on the cake of what we needed” Monroe said.



Shortly after the air district’s attorney worked with the Oakland City Attorney’s Office to contact the generator rental company United Rentals to take a back-end approach to removing the power source off the property. Monroe said the rental company would be included in fines if they knowingly defied an abatement order.



“And then next thing you know after two hours all of the generators disappeared” Monroe said. “The city agencies all started communicating and working together in alignment.”



It’s not necessarily a happy ending however. Monroe said a neighbor of his died from respiratory failure shortly after the generators were shut down and the effects of heavy pollution like this will long outweigh the time the generators were in place.



“Truly sad and I would hate to think that’s the cause … but after two years you’re going to see some damage” Monroe said.



Residents have described the process as being “incredibly slow and completely ineffective” saying they were “literally being poisoned” as Green Sage continued to operate despite a finalized abatement order.



“The District’s handling of this case sets a horrible precedent for how others in this industry can skirt the law without consequence” reads a letter from residents in July. “We understand there are procedures that must be followed. We have followed the District’s procedures exactly as instructed. Green Sage has not.”



Cannery residents paired with environmental advocacy groups Center for Environmental Health and the Environmental Democracy Project to initiate a lawsuit under the federal Clean Air Act and California’s Proposition 65 — the requirement for businesses to inform residents about exposure to harmful chemicals. The legal team won the injunction which was used to prompt the city’s negotiation with United Rentals.



“Stopping the exposure to the toxic diesel exhaust from this one facility will be a critical first step to advance environmental justice for the residents of East Oakland but work will remain to create systemic changes that prevent this from happening again” said Karina Gomez community engagement manager at CEH.



But Tanya Boyce executive director of EDP said government regulators failed to adequately respond to this violation leaving her and other advocates to take legal matters in their own hands. There’s victory here but Boyce said the government’s slow reaction to environmental violations is not sustainable.



“Ultimately we’re hoping that this site can stand as a symbol of a need for a holistic re-organization of how the cannabis industry grows” Boyce said.



She’s calling on the city of Oakland to set a limit on the amount of square footage an indoor cultivation site can be based on how much power is available in the electrical grid. It’s not about putting a hamper on the cannabis industry but making sure pot is growing appropriately she said.



“Clearly they’re not law-abiding people and a notice is not going to be enough. You’re going to need to take a step to stop them” Boyce said.



She’s also calling on the city attorney’s office for more transparency and communication because on the ground she assumed that they weren’t listening. It’s cases like this that give the city the chance to show their allegiance to environmental and racial justice and inaction speaks volumes Boyce said.



“It’s very hard for anybody to believe in government to believe in law to believe in the civil contract that we’re all supposed to sign when everybody’s always lying and cheating and doing only what serves them” Boyce said.



Chaney Turner chair of Oakland’s Cannabis Regulatory Commission thanked residents and advocates for their continuous work and said they were disappointed in how the city handled the case. The commission prompted a motion to refer this issue to the state Department of Cannabis Control in August.



“There wasn’t much support from the city and that’s when [the California Department of Cannabis Control] stepped in and they don’t really take environmental pollution lightly” Turner said. “I’m glad that they were able to do in 30 days what the city of Oakland for some reason couldn’t do in two years.”



Turner believes that in order to get better solutions and better action Oakland needs better people in office mentioning the importance of residents showing up to local elections and voting for candidates who come from areas that have been impacted by pollution.



“We have to make sure that we have people who are representing us that will listen to our concerns and that are going to take action” Turner said.



Moving forward Turner wants to see the cannabis industry being treated like any other business bringing in revenue for the city with neither special treatment nor additional tax penalties. Turner said it’s about balancing between preserving Oakland as a hub for cannabis production while ensuring these companies are being good neighbors.



“I’m not really concerned about big businesses coming here I understand that they’re bringing in more tax revenue and other things” Turner said. “But if you’re coming in from Colorado into an area where you’ve been a bad neighbor and the people living in the area are impacted by your bad decisions then you don’t need to be here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3Jjb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb25wcm9zLmNvbS9jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24tdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hcHBzL3Byb2R1Y3QvMjI0NDUzNDYvdG9tdG9tLXRvbXRvbS1vZmZlcnMtdHJ1Y2stcm91dGluZy1pbi1nby1uYXZpZ2F0aW9uLWFwcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TomTom Offers Truck Routing in GO Navigation App From: TomTom,"The subscription service enables drivers to plan routes that account for their vehicle’s dimensions fuel requirements desired maximum speeds and cargo (such as dangerous goods).

TomTom a mapmaker and geolocation specialist has introduced GO Navigation’s Truck Plan designed to meet the needs of professional truck drivers. This subscription service enables drivers to plan routes that account for their vehicle’s dimensions fuel requirements desired maximum speeds and cargo (such as dangerous goods).

Drivers will also be able to plan multiple drop-offs and gain access to an overview of upcoming points of interest (POIs) such as fuel stations for their vehicle and truck stops. These truck-specific additions work in conjunction with the app’s existing navigation features including intuitive lane guidance live traffic and the Route Bar a snapshot of the route stops relevant alerts and restrictions ahead.

“Truck navigation on mobile is a game changer. The new plan is a result of TomTom’s long-standing relationship with professional drivers. After years of experience with truck-specific sat navs we understand this industry’s biggest pain-points so we were able to develop a solution that fills the gap left by the generic navigation offerings found in other apps” said Pim Spaanderman managing director TomTom Consumer.

TomTom’s ETAs are capable of making adjustments based on real-time traffic data which gives drivers a snapshot of their schedule. The TomTom GO Navigation’s Truck Plan user interface (UI) is designed to minimize distractions and keep attention on the road. With Android Auto compatibility drivers also have the option to sync their route with their in-dash screen.

By accounting for factors like vehicle size and cargo type this plan helps professional drivers stay aware of road regulations such as avoiding prohibited routes and complying with UN Class restrictions. And with further updates in the pipeline it will soon account for other measures like low emission zones.

“As a third-generation truck driver I can say with some confidence that this addition couldn’t come sooner. Having TomTom’s large-vehicle navigation features right there on an app is a big win for the trucking community” said Luke Cuss one of TomTom’s trucking ambassadors. “The job gets challenging at times sure and changing traffic conditions and regulations can be hard to keep up with – but this plan will help us stay on top of all that meaning we can focus on the road ahead enjoy the ride and stay on schedule.”

To even be considered for a property many feel pressured to provide personal information and don’t feel they can assert their rights to privacy because agents and landlords hold so much power over where they can or cannot live. This is still happening despite the laws that are in place to prevent it.

We thought our application was thorough and we both had great references. We included a nice photo of ourselves and filled the cover letter with detailed information about who we are how we met what we studied at university and why we think we are great tenants. We even shared the story of how we got engaged because it just so happened to take place a couple hundred metres up the road from the house we were applying for. We shared all this extra information about ourselves to ‘sell’ our application to the agent. But it didn’t make a difference – we never even got a reply.

Once we viewed the house we liked it and put in an early application. The agent encouraged us to include a cover letter as it would help the owner of the property to get to know us better so we did.

In October 2021 we turned up early to a house viewing in central Wellington. A large crowd gathered as we waited for the agent to show up. I could feel the collective desperate urgency in the air as everyone wanted to get in and inspect the house but also make a good first impression on the agent.

My fiancé and I live in Wellington city. We’ve been renting a nice apartment for more than two-and-a-half years but it is small relatively expensive and has no outdoor space. The mounting pressure of rising living costs is also taking its toll and we’re ready to find a new more affordable home to rent. We have been looking for that new home for over a year.

During these conversations the property managers and rental agents were asked questions about what sort of information is collected from renters how long it is stored and whether it is shared with any third parties.

We conducted a nationwide mystery shop of property managers in May 2022. We wanted to see whether they were adhering to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner’s (OPC) “Privacy Act guidance for landlords and property managers” (OPC’s landlord’s guidance).

How much information should a landlord or property manager ask for? In the latest episode of Consume This podcast we delve into the thorny issue of power imbalance in the New Zealand residential rental market. Plus what can go wrong when your sensitive information isn't protected.

When applying for a property a person should never be asked by an agent/landlord about:

As one shopper explained: “In the beginning of our conversation I felt as though he was very clear with his answers. However the question about storing my information really did seem to trip him up and [he] sounded almost accusing as to why I cared about where my personal information was stored … The more questions I asked the less interested he seemed and [he] also almost got annoyed about them.”

What really stood out was that some agents became noticeably less interested in the mystery shopper as soon as they started asking questions about the privacy and security of their information. This occurred for example when the shoppers asked about where and for how long their data would be stored. After they asked these questions 14% of property managers showed a noticeable lack of interest.

A further 6% of agents asked the mystery shoppers to include bank statements in their application even though this is in breach of OPC’s landlord’s guidance and likely to be a breach of the Privacy Act (2020).

Another agent said “the more information you provide [about yourself] the smoother the process”. Another confirmed that extra information would “make your application stand out from the others”.

However 10% of agents encouraged the mystery shopper to voluntarily provide extra information by way of a cover letter and a ‘rental CV’ which might include “information such as age bracket gender relationship status etcetera”. This is because as one property manager put it “the more information you give the better your chances [of securing a rental property]”.

Our investigation into property managers and privacy regulations found that the agents showed a good knowledge of the revised Privacy Act (2020) and OPC’s guidance documents with 18% explicitly referring to the new rules.

Dodgy tactics and strange questions

We’ve also spoken with several prospective tenants who have shared their stories of intrusive questions from property managers or landlords.

Lucy (pseudonym) is a 22-year-old student living in Wellington city. She “was under time pressure to find somewhere to live” so agreed to an interview with the landlord of a property. During the interview the landlord asked questions about her cleanliness religious beliefs and whether she drank alcohol.

Her desperation to find a home “blinded” her to how inappropriate these questions really were at the time but she did think that “the request to interview was strange”. This interview ended up being only “the first sign of [the landlord’s] intrusive and creepy behaviours exhibited during [her] tenancy” which she left early “due to the awful experience”.

Gray a 25-year-old who studied law in Christchurch also found it difficult when searching for a rental. When she and her flatmates were filling out an application she noticed that the landlord was “asking some really weird questions”. For example after requesting her phone number they proceeded to ask “how long I've had that phone number – yeah I don't know what that had to do with anything”.

The landlord also asked her for her boss’ phone number “specifically because they wanted to prove that I actually worked where I worked” despite already giving them references. They also asked her to provide bank statements details about her salary and in another instance she was asked for a CV. For Gray it felt like she was “giving a job reference for a place to live” which seemed totally unnecessary. She found the whole process “quite invasive”.

As stated in OPC's Privacy Act guidance for tenants (OPC’s tenant’s guidance): “When you apply to rent a property the landlord shouldn’t ask you to provide bank statements so they can assess your spending habits. Asking about how tenants spend their money is unfair and unreasonably intrusive except in exceptional circumstances.”

Gray did not trust anything about the process.

“I was absolutely not having this. I did not want to end up in the [Tenancy] Tribunal. We bailed on a couple [of properties] because I was just not about to have that.”

The OPC has raised serious concerns about the privacy breaches. In its 2022 Insights Report it wrote: “In early 2021 we saw that some property management agencies were asking for very detailed information from prospective tenants as part of their selection process while others were using public forums to compile lists of so-called ‘bad tenants’.”

The OPC also noted: “The power imbalance between people and agencies is such that even if people are not comfortable with the way that their personal information is being collected and used they are not in a position to do anything about it.”

Ashok Jacob is a representative for Renters United the national advocacy group for tenants. He told Consumer about a survey it conducted among members in 2021 which found “that property management companies and landlords had been blatantly and consistently violating privacy laws in tenancy applications. In many cases they were explicitly discriminating against people based on race gender and family status – obviously contrary to the Human Rights Act 1993.”

“The supply of rental properties is so tight in so many areas that people are incentivised to give over more and more information in tenancy applications regardless of whether or not the landlord specifically requires it” he said.

Our mystery shop showed that renters who do try to assert their rights under the Privacy Act (2020) are more likely to be labelled ‘troublesome’ or ‘problematic’ and less likely to be offered a place to live.

Renters United blames the tenancy laws which it says gives landlords “disproportionate power over their tenants’ lives in so many ways that people are pressured into providing personal information – whether or not it’s legal for the landlord to ask for it”.

We approached Quinovic one of the largest property management companies in the country to ask for its stance on this issue. We also asked how it is actively preventing the Privacy Act (2020) from being breached within its own business practices.

Grant Sheridan the Chief Executive of Quinovic Property Group said he is “acutely aware of the regulatory complexities facing our industry as a result of the new OPC regulations [and OPC’s guidance]”.

He told us that Quinovic is “committed to adhering diligently to all regulations but there are certainly some challenges in terms of inconsistencies within the guidelines.” The company would “welcome a tightening up of the OPC regulations”.

Sheridan said the industry faces difficulties in regard to collecting and retaining information such as collecting proof of identification for a credit check. He claimed that if a scan of a prospective tenant’s identification document is made “the new OPC regulations require that the scan or photocopy must be immediately destroyed once the credit check has been completed.”

Yet in practice these documents don’t need to be deleted immediately. The OPC’s landlord guidance says landlords and property managers should delete identification documents once the verification process has been completed and they no longer need that information.

Sheridan also said that if a credit check is challenged the company providing the credit check needs evidence the landlord or property manager had the authority to request it.

“The credit check company also has a requirement to retain such proof for five years after the request. If the tenant is approved then they may make a claim against the landlord up to six years after the end of the tenancy and as such the landlord or property manager is duty-bound to retain the proof that they were authorised to do the initial credit check” Sheridan said.

However the landlord or property manager is not required to retain this information as they are not subject to the Credit Reporting Privacy Code.

Changes to the Privacy Act and its related guidance for landlords and rental agencies hasn’t changed the rules about keeping information such as credit check information. Under the Tenancy Act a landlord or property agency can keep the information of their preferred candidates for 12 months. And under IRD legislation they must keep approved tenants’ information for seven years.

Sheridan said that prior to the Privacy Act 2020 coming into effect a property manager or landlord could meet and approve a tenant for a property within 24 hours or even less but now the process can take longer.

“We know this is not an ideal situation for tenants who understandably want a speedy answer when they have applied for a new home.”

He argued that the current laws are disrupting tenants landlords and property agents alike in the application process. However in highlighting this issue to us he did not respond to our direct question regarding how much information agents and landlords are still asking tenants to provide but said that “Quinovic property managers make a judgement call for each individual application regarding how much information is required from tenants” meaning this can differ between tenancies.

“Property managers need to weigh up their regulatory obligations against the privacy rights of each tenant and that is not always clear cut because of the inconsistencies in the current guidelines” he said.

Lastly Sheridan said that Quinovic is reviewing all “internal processes with a view to streamlining them nationwide”.

Jackie Adams the compliance manager at OPC has seen substantial improvements in how private information is handled by most rental agencies.

The rental agencies are “reporting that the guidance is not impacting on their ability to evaluate and approve rental applicants and is providing them with more clarity about what they can do with peoples’ personal information” she said.

The grey area

OPC’s tenant’s guidance states: “Landlords can only collect personal information in ways that are lawful fair and not unreasonably intrusive. Landlords shouldn’t collect unnecessary and privacy-intrusive information from you.”

However the guidance also states the amount of “information you give to a landlord when you apply for a property is your choice but the amount you provide may affect a landlord’s decision to offer you a property”.

Here lies the murky grey area.

When my fiancé and I applied for that house we did not need to tell the agent or anyone else all those details about ourselves and especially our engagement story. The agent did not request that information either. That was a private moment that should only ever have been shared with our friends and family. We felt compelled to share it though just in case it would be the story that differentiated us enough from the others and won us the house.

It is this very notion that is the problem. In a market that is overwhelmingly skewed toward landlords and property managers renters are feeling compelled or pressured to ‘sell themselves’ to landlords and agents by sharing private stories and information just to secure a place to live.

What can you do about it?

It’s clear from our mystery shop and research that landlords and property managers are not always complying with their obligations under OPC’s landlord’s guidance.

If you are a renter and have experienced a situation where a landlord or agent has breached your rights under the Privacy Act or the OPC guidance documents you can lodge a complaint with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. It may investigate and take your issue further.

You could also share your story anonymously with Renters United.

Earlier this week it was revealed that District of Columbia Judge Carl Nichols would allow the merger to move forward. But that sealed opinion has now been released in full. In it Nichols writes that the feds failed to prove that UnitedHealth would misuse data gained as part of the deal and that its competitors would be less innovative as a result.

The crux of the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) challenge to the merger is that it would make Optum privy to data on UnitedHealthcare's competitors in the insurance market which it could use to gain an advantage. UnitedHealth Group executives countered that Optum already has access to data on competitors and misusing it would deal a major financial blow to the company's multiplayer strategy.

Nichols weighed the government's case across both horizontal and vertical consolidation concerns. For one he said that while Optum's services and Change Healthcare both include claims editing the latter has agreed to divest its claims editing business called ClaimsXten to close the deal. Nichols ordered that the divestiture be made in his opinion.

""The evidence demonstrates that the divestiture will restore the competitive intensity lost because of the acquisition"" he wrote.

Change Healthcare has already found a buyer for its ClaimsXten business: TPG Capital. Nichols notes in the opinion that TPG has significant experience in the healthcare market and has indicated that it plans to invest in expanding ClaimsXten once that acquisition closes which would preserve that competition in the market.

Nichols wrote that the feds also failed to prove the deal would be anti-competitive from a vertical consolidation perspective. He noted that no payer industry witnesses including executives at major competitors Cigna Aetna and Anthem argued that they would be less innovative out of fear that UnitedHealth would access their data and the government put forth no evidence to prove that UnitedHealth Group would misuse those data.

""The evidence adduced at trial established that for it to be likely that the proposed acquisition would substantially lessen competition United would have to uproot its entire business strategy and corporate culture intentionally violate or repeal longstanding firewall policies flout existing contractual commitments and sacrifice significant financial and reputational interests"" Nichols wrote.

For example UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty testified that it would be ""nonsensical"" for Optum to develop tools that are only of use to UnitedHealthcare and spurn other potential payer partners. Optum does pilot some of its programs with UnitedHealthcare members with the goal of building scale down the line Nichols said.

Witty added that using Optum as a tool to make UnitedHealthcare more profitable ""would be a destruction of my whole fiduciary responsibility"" at the helm of UnitedHealth Group.

While Nichols' ruling puts the case to bed for now the DOJ hinted in a statement that it may consider an appeal of the case. Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter said in a statement that the agency was ""reviewing the opinion closely to evaluate next steps"" as officials at the DOJ ""respectfully disagree"" with Nichols' ruling.

UnitedHealth Group said in a statement that it plans to begin combining with Change ""as soon as possible.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYXcuY29tL2xpdGlnYXRpb25kYWlseS8yMDIyLzA5LzIzL2xpdGlnYXRvcnMtb2YtdGhlLXdlZWstdGhlLWtpcmtsYW5kLXRlYW0td2hvLWhlbHBlZC11bml0ZWRoZWFsdGgtYmVhdC1iYWNrLWRvanMtYW50aXRydXN0LWNoYWxsZW5nZS10by1hLWhlYWx0aC10ZWNoLWRlYWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Expert Perspectives on Biggest Court Cases,"Jonathan Kanter the head of DOJ’s Antitrust Division told a Senate committee this week that the department “will litigate more merger trials this year than in any fiscal year on record.”

Zelle has been in the hot seat over authorized push payment fraud and is owned by Early Warning Services LLC a FinTech company owned by all but one bank in attendance — Bank of America Corp. Truist Financial Corp. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. PNC Financial Services Group Inc. U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo & Co. plus Capital One Financial Corp.

Complaints are on the rise from banking customers unknowingly authorizing payments to scammers using Zelle and not being able to get their money refunded.

“Zelle is not safe. You built the system you profit from every transaction on the system and you tell people that it is safe. But when someone is defrauded you claim that’s the customer’s problem” said Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) during the Senate Banking Committee hearing on Thursday (Sept. 23). The CEOs met with the House Banking Committee on Wednesday (Sept. 22).

Lawmakers grilled the CEOs about the many reports of fraud and scams on Zelle which has processed more than 5 billion transactions and handled nearly $1.5 trillion in payments since its inception in 2017. The bankers indicated that they are working together to implement new policies to protect consumers using the network.

The owners of Zelle are collaborating to provide better guardrails on the network by closing accounts of customers who receive the fraudulent funds Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan said during the testimony. The network also removed lenders who didn’t police clients accused of defrauding customers at other banks he said.

Regulation E governs how banks handle electronic fund transfers. If a fraudster gets into a customer’s account and sends money banks must provide a refund. But if a customer sends the money which is what happens in a fraudulent Zelle transaction Regulation E doesn’t apply.

“Anything that’s unauthorized we do cover” J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon told senators. “So you’re really talking about authorized transactions that we have an enormous amount of systems to stop. And the amount of fraud relatively is very small for this free-of-charge service.”"

DHAKA – Just a glimpse at the budget allocation for healthcare every year is enough to understand how terrible our indifference towards our health sector is. It has been seeing a decline in the budget allocation as a proportion of GDP dropping to 0.83 percent in the current fiscal year. But according to the World Health Organization (WHO) it should be at least five percent. Bangladesh ranks lowest in South Asia in terms of health allocation as a proportion of GDP. Currently we have to pay 72 percent of our medical expenses out of our own pockets.

WHO has committed all member states to ensure universal health coverage (UHC) which means everyone will have access to quality healthcare as needed regardless of financial constraints. Global health insurance is an important regulator in achieving UHC. Many countries in the world are or have been moving towards achieving UHC through private optional health insurance community-based health insurance compulsory payroll-tax-based social health insurance etc. Germany and France took more than 100 years to cover 100 percent of their populations via social insurance. Many low- and middle-income countries in Asia Africa and Latin America have continued efforts to implement labour-tax-based mandatory social health insurance for decades.

But the idea of ​​achieving universal health coverage or its implementation is completely absent in Bangladesh. The ruling government did make a pledge to formulate and implement UHC in the country but there has been little progress to this end. Despite Covid-19 and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war our economy has not been severely affected. In terms of macroeconomic indicators Bangladesh should be able to increase the budget for the health sector without disrupting the dynamics of the economy.

Are our policymakers aware that sustainable development is not possible without investment in the health sector? Investing in healthcare is not just about spending; it strengthens the economy in many ways and contributes to alleviation of poverty and inequality. Investment in the health sector will lead to improved labour force availability better contribution to school education employment opportunities for women and higher productivity in the economy.

Healthcare financing in Bangladesh comes entirely from the government’s general taxation system. There is an opportunity to greatly increase the finance by expanding the scope for the tax base by consolidating and redistributing the fragmented financing system and by redistributing priorities. Tax evasion corruption and harassment should be prevented. Financing the health sector can be done more easily by expanding the narrow tax system than by trying to collect health insurance premiums from poor and informal sector populations.

The need to increase the government budget for our health sector is now beyond debate. In the next national budget therefore the health allocation should be increased to two percent of GDP. The finance minister should think about how he will allocate this money. The WHO recommends allocating at least five percent of GDP or 15 percent of the budget to the health sector. An increase in health spending per one percent of GDP would protect 0.13 percent of the population from falling into financial disaster.

The challenges of healthcare delivery are mainly twofold: financing and service delivery. Corruption in the health sector doctors’ misconduct and the lack of capacity to implement the budget are the highlights among the issues. Prioritisation of cost management should be done by accepting the reality of the financial crisis in healthcare. Priority should be given to the inclusion of the poor and vulnerable groups to the maximum extent and which services are possible to deliver should be taken into consideration. A strong stance should be taken against corruption. Expenditure and results in the health sector should be presented transparently in front of the people. A government survey found that 63 percent of the individual’s out-of-pocket expenses were on medicines. A strong primary healthcare system plays the most cost-effective role in achieving universal health coverage.

Public healthcare programmes should be implemented through all-out initiatives to prevent diseases. The government should develop a flawless structure capable of fair understanding with drug and medical device manufacturers to procure and supply medicines medical supplies and new technologies. Help should be provided to build non-profit private healthcare. Differences in service quality and cost between public and private healthcare systems should be reduced if not eliminated. In addition to public and private healthcare there should be an opportunity for NGOs to work as a complementary body with the self-sacrificing attitude and capacity to engage in healthcare. The government also must invest in the improvement of the quality of life of healthcare workers.

Universal health coverage will not be achieved overnight by some miracle. Learning from the experience of low and low-middle income countries from the last 50 years Bangladesh should develop a healthcare system keeping in mind the historical evolution of those healthcare systems cultural acceptance and political-economic reality. Measuring progress in achieving the UHC requires an integrated national health database. The UHC structure should be constructed by analysing the information obtained from there making plans and implementing new decisions from the lessons of success and failure. The countries that have achieved UHC have consistently had high budget allocations for healthcare at the top of their political agendas. Strong political commitment is needed to expand healthcare coverage to the poor and vulnerable and to prioritise the voice of marginalised people over that of opportunistic groups.

Our constitution mentions the pledge to establish a state based on equality. A fundamental human aspiration is that the individual or family will not be destitute or be driven into further poverty while seeking medical treatment. Otherwise our constitution will not be able to play any regulatory role to protect the health and lives of the people of this country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lcmR3YWxsZXQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdXJhbmNlL21lZGljYXJlL3doYXQtbWVkaWNhcmUtZm9yLWFsbC1jb3VsZC1tZWFuLWZvci15b3VyLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What ‘Medicare for All’ Could Mean for Your Health Care,"Medicare is government-funded health insurance for older adults and people with certain disabilities. Proposals for “Medicare for All” would expand Medicare in two ways: It would insure every American and legal U.S. resident and it would cover a more comprehensive set of health care services.

Various single-payer health care plans under the Medicare for All banner have been introduced in Congress since 2003 and the concept was championed by candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren during the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign.

Here are answers to some common questions about Medicare for All as defined by the most recent congressional proposal: Sen. Sanders’ Medicare for All Act of 2022 [0] View all sources 117th Congress . Senate Bill 4204 . Accessed Sep 13 2022.

Who would Medicare for All cover?

Medicare for All would cover every American citizen and legal resident of the United States. That’s a dramatic expansion compared with the current set of government health insurance programs for civilians [0] View all sources Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services . Access to Health Coverage . Accessed Sep 13 2022.

Medicare covers nearly 65 million beneficiaries.

Medicaid covers nearly 82 million beneficiaries (12 million of whom are also eligible for Medicare).

The Children’s Health Insurance Program or CHIP covers just over 7 million beneficiaries.

All together the three programs cover more than 141 million people. The U.S. population is about 333 million people as of September 2022 so by covering the full population Medicare for All would more than double that total [0] View all sources U.S. Census Bureau . U.S. and World Population Clock . Accessed Sep 13 2022.

What services would Medicare for All cover?

Medicare for All would cover a wide range of health care services including some not currently covered by Medicare.

The current Medicare system separates coverage into parts [0] View all sources Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services . Parts of Medicare . Accessed Sep 13 2022.

Medicare for All would cover “comprehensive benefits” which would encompass everything the current Medicare system covers under a single system. It would also include coverage for services not covered by Medicare such as dental hearing and vision care.

Would Medicare for All eliminate private insurance?

After a transition period private insurance companies and employers wouldn’t be allowed to offer insurance policies that cover any of the same benefits covered by Medicare for All.

Private companies would still be allowed to sell or give their employees coverage for benefits that Medicare for All wouldn’t cover. Those benefits could include for example concierge care arrangements or services that aren’t medically necessary such as certain cosmetic surgeries.

Would Medicare for All let me keep my doctor?

If your doctor already accepts Medicare — and 98% of health care providers do — they probably already meet the requirements of Medicare for All [0] View all sources Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services . Announcement About Medicare Participation for Calendar Year 2022 . Accessed Sep 13 2022.

Medicare for All would require providers hospitals and clinics to meet certain “national minimum standards” in areas such as quality of facilities staffing ratios personnel training and outcomes. Those standards aren’t new. They were first established as part of the original Medicare program so most health care providers already meet them.

You would also be able to switch health care providers if you choose because Medicare for All wouldn’t have in-network and out-of-network providers. You could receive services from any qualified provider.

Would Medicare for All have out-of-pocket costs?

Medicare for All would eliminate out-of-pocket costs like copays coinsurance and deductibles for almost all services. There could be one exception: prescription drugs.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services would have the option to establish limited out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. The maximum annual out-of-pocket amount would be $200 and there would be no out-of-pocket costs for preventive drugs or for people with income below a certain level.

Pros and cons of Medicare for All

Here are some advantages and disadvantages of Medicare for All proposals:

Medicare for All pros:

Universal coverage: Every American and legal U.S. resident would have health coverage.

Lower out-of-pocket costs: Most covered services would have no copays coinsurance or deductibles. Prescription drugs could have limited cost-sharing requirements.

No provider networks: Services would be available from any participating health care provider.

The benefits of treating conditions affecting women such as depression can filter down to households and improve children’s educational outcomes.

StrongMinds has successfully adapted the Group Interpersonal Therapy model to provide community-based depression treatment to low-income women and adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa.

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. As many as 300 million experience depression globally with the World Bank considering it “the greatest thief of productive economic life.” Nowhere is this issue more under-prioritized than in Africa which accounts for the lowest mental health expenditure globally and up to 85% of individuals have no access to effective treatment.

If left untreated the results of depression can be devastating. Depression can recur over a lifetime with long-term implications for the individual’s quality of life economic productivity physical health and ability to participate in community life. In Africa women are affected at 1.5 times the rate of men. Women with depression work less experience more physical illness and experience social exclusion.

Mental health conditions are projected to cost the global economy $6 trillion by 2030. At the business level individuals with depression are more likely to experience absenteeism and poor job performance which leads to reduced productivity and higher turnover worldwide.

Individuals with depression can also face stigmatization victimization and discrimination. They are particularly vulnerable to human rights violations such as abuse neglect and denial of access to education and work opportunities. Investments in evidence-based mental healthcare can help ensure the necessary safeguards are in place for those in need of care and help normalize seeking treatment.

Without addressing these concerns the current global burden of disease associated with mental health disorders puts economic growth and social welfare at high risk.

“ StrongMinds estimates that for every woman treated for depression through our IPT-G model up to four members of her household are positively impacted. ” — Sean Mayberry CEO StrongMinds

Mental health in Africa compounds harms

Research shows that mental health has a bi-directional relationship with many of the African continent’s most significant challenges. For example mental health disorders such as depression can put people – particularly adolescent girls – at greater risk of HIV infection while inhibiting the ability of those living with HIV to adhere to treatment. In addition poverty poor nutrition and lack of education can exacerbate depression while interfering with an individual’s ability to earn an income achieve food security or finish school.

Innovative and affordable treatment options are in high demand to meet the growing need for mental health services particularly in low-resource communities. By training lay community health workers to deliver group interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-G) StrongMinds successfully brings high-quality low-cost depression treatment to tens of thousands of individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. It currently costs us roughly $105 to treat one woman with depression and we continue to work toward reducing this cost each year.

IPT-G is well-studied in low- and middle-income countries and is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a first-line depression intervention in resource-poor settings. The approach is simple yet efficient with high rates of success. Here’s how it works:

Clients are screened before during and after therapy using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to continually measure the presence and severity of depression.

Over eight group sessions counsellors guide structured discussions to help participants identify the underlying triggers of depression and examine how their current relationships may be linked.

From there group members discuss solutions to their problems learn coping mechanisms and identify support systems they can lean on after therapy.

Participants feel understood empowered and less alone as a result.

Trickle-down effect

When a woman is no longer depressed she and her family benefit. StrongMinds estimates that for every woman treated for depression through our IPT-G model up to four members of her household are positively impacted. Our data also shows that 16% of women treated report an increase in work attendance 13% report an increase in family food security and 30% say their children attend more school.

The recent “Transforming Mental Health For All” report cited the StrongMinds’ depression treatment model as an example of the integrated community-based mental healthcare needed to meet the core objectives of the WHO’s 2013 to 2030 Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan. The plan aims to achieve equity through universal health coverage and recognizes the essential role of mental health in achieving health for all people.

Findings from a recent Happier Lives Institute (HLI) study also suggest that investing in mental healthcare can increase the impact of philanthropic giving. The study concluded that for people in low-income countries treating depression in one individual is nine times more cost-effective than direct cash transfers in terms of improving a person’s subjective well-being (how the person rates the quality of their life).

Therapy doesn’t just address acute depressive episodes. Through our IPT-G model women learn how to identify the symptoms and triggers of depression and deploy self-help skills to mitigate and prevent future depressive episodes. They also share their knowledge with their family and community spreading the benefits of good mental health to others.

This challenges existing thinking in philanthropy about how donors can maximize the impact of their giving. The reality is we can only continue to scale and deliver these services if we have the funding available to reach every woman in need of mental health resources across Africa.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5c3Rhci5uZXQvb3Bpbmlvbi92aWV3cy9uZXdzL2hvdy1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLWNhbi1hY2hpZXZlLXVuaXZlcnNhbC1oZWFsdGgtY292ZXJhZ2UtMzEyNjE2MdIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5c3Rhci5uZXQvb3Bpbmlvbi92aWV3cy9uZXdzL2hvdy1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLWNhbi1hY2hpZXZlLXVuaXZlcnNhbC1oZWFsdGgtY292ZXJhZ2UtMzEyNjE2MT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Bangladesh can achieve universal health coverage,"Just a glimpse at the budget allocation for healthcare every year is enough to understand how terrible our indifference towards our health sector is. It has been seeing a decline in the budget allocation as a proportion of GDP dropping to 0.83 percent in the current fiscal year. But according to the World Health Organization (WHO) it should be at least five percent. Bangladesh ranks lowest in South Asia in terms of health allocation as a proportion of GDP. Currently we have to pay 72 percent of our medical expenses out of our own pockets.

WHO has committed all member states to ensure universal health coverage (UHC) which means everyone will have access to quality healthcare as needed regardless of financial constraints. Global health insurance is an important regulator in achieving UHC. Many countries in the world are or have been moving towards achieving UHC through private optional health insurance community-based health insurance compulsory payroll-tax-based social health insurance etc. Germany and France took more than 100 years to cover 100 percent of their populations via social insurance. Many low- and middle-income countries in Asia Africa and Latin America have continued efforts to implement labour-tax-based mandatory social health insurance for decades.

But the idea of ​​achieving universal health coverage or its implementation is completely absent in Bangladesh. The ruling government did make a pledge to formulate and implement UHC in the country but there has been little progress to this end. Despite Covid-19 and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war our economy has not been severely affected. In terms of macroeconomic indicators Bangladesh should be able to increase the budget for the health sector without disrupting the dynamics of the economy.

Are our policymakers aware that sustainable development is not possible without investment in the health sector? Investing in healthcare is not just about spending; it strengthens the economy in many ways and contributes to alleviation of poverty and inequality. Investment in the health sector will lead to improved labour force availability better contribution to school education employment opportunities for women and higher productivity in the economy.

Healthcare financing in Bangladesh comes entirely from the government's general taxation system. There is an opportunity to greatly increase the finance by expanding the scope for the tax base by consolidating and redistributing the fragmented financing system and by redistributing priorities. Tax evasion corruption and harassment should be prevented. Financing the health sector can be done more easily by expanding the narrow tax system than by trying to collect health insurance premiums from poor and informal sector populations.

The need to increase the government budget for our health sector is now beyond debate. In the next national budget therefore the health allocation should be increased to two percent of GDP. The finance minister should think about how he will allocate this money. The WHO recommends allocating at least five percent of GDP or 15 percent of the budget to the health sector. An increase in health spending per one percent of GDP would protect 0.13 percent of the population from falling into financial disaster.

The challenges of healthcare delivery are mainly twofold: financing and service delivery. Corruption in the health sector doctors' misconduct and the lack of capacity to implement the budget are the highlights among the issues. Prioritisation of cost management should be done by accepting the reality of the financial crisis in healthcare. Priority should be given to the inclusion of the poor and vulnerable groups to the maximum extent and which services are possible to deliver should be taken into consideration. A strong stance should be taken against corruption. Expenditure and results in the health sector should be presented transparently in front of the people. A government survey found that 63 percent of the individual's out-of-pocket expenses were on medicines. A strong primary healthcare system plays the most cost-effective role in achieving universal health coverage.

Public healthcare programmes should be implemented through all-out initiatives to prevent diseases. The government should develop a flawless structure capable of fair understanding with drug and medical device manufacturers to procure and supply medicines medical supplies and new technologies. Help should be provided to build non-profit private healthcare. Differences in service quality and cost between public and private healthcare systems should be reduced if not eliminated. In addition to public and private healthcare there should be an opportunity for NGOs to work as a complementary body with the self-sacrificing attitude and capacity to engage in healthcare. The government also must invest in the improvement of the quality of life of healthcare workers.

Universal health coverage will not be achieved overnight by some miracle. Learning from the experience of low and low-middle income countries from the last 50 years Bangladesh should develop a healthcare system keeping in mind the historical evolution of those healthcare systems cultural acceptance and political-economic reality. Measuring progress in achieving the UHC requires an integrated national health database. The UHC structure should be constructed by analysing the information obtained from there making plans and implementing new decisions from the lessons of success and failure. The countries that have achieved UHC have consistently had high budget allocations for healthcare at the top of their political agendas. Strong political commitment is needed to expand healthcare coverage to the poor and vulnerable and to prioritise the voice of marginalised people over that of opportunistic groups.

Our constitution mentions the pledge to establish a state based on equality. A fundamental human aspiration is that the individual or family will not be destitute or be driven into further poverty while seeking medical treatment. Otherwise our constitution will not be able to play any regulatory role to protect the health and lives of the people of this country.

The US Supreme Court’s recent decision overturning Roe v. Wade has sparked debate in the United States about how to protect reproductive freedom. President Biden proposed ending the Senate filibuster rule in order for Congress to pass legislation legalizing abortion rights and he signed an executive order to “protect access to reproductive healthcare services.” In some states legislators have enacted new laws that expanded abortion rights. However what is missing in this debate is similar discourse and concrete actions by Democrats to protect reproductive rights not only in the United States but also in less-developed countries which are directly affected by Republican attacks on US funding for reproductive health around the world.

Developing countries are struggling to improve reproductive health services even where abortion is legal. For instance safe abortion services have been legal in Nepal since 2004. Nepal’s Constitution enshrined “safe motherhood and reproductive health” as fundamental rights of people. Despite these constitutional and legal protections Nepal witnesses at least three maternal deaths every day due to its limited capacity for providing health care particularly in remote areas and lack of easy access to safe abortion if childbirth poses risks to maternal health.

This is a problem for many developing countries victimized by US policies on abortion overseas including the 1973 Helms Amendment which prohibits US taxpayer money from being used for abortions even if the abortion is legal in that jurisdiction. Although the Helms Amendment includes exemptions for cases of rape incest or risk to maternal health many recipients do not provide any abortion-related services for fear of losing US funds.

The United States’ funding restrictions on reproductive health care services don’t end at the Helms Amendment. In 1984 Republican President Ronald Reagan announced that overseas health care providers could not receive US funding if they provided abortion services even with non-US funds. This policy known as the “Mexico City policy” or the “global gag rule” also bans NGOs receiving US aid from even referring to abortion when counseling pregnant people or engaging in abortion rights advocacy anywhere. Rooted in US abortion politics this policy is rescinded every time a Democrat is president and reinstated every time Republicans regain control.

The global gag rule disproportionately targets poor marginalized and often indigenous women living in low-income countries who do not have access to private health care. Studies show that the global gag rule does not reduce abortion but instead causes abortion rates to go up. When the United States the world’s largest global health donor withdraws funding from health clinics that provide refer to or advocate for abortion services those clinics often cease to operate making contraceptives unavailable thereby leading to more unplanned pregnancies and thus more abortions—often unsafe procedures.

Health care workers in poor countries like Nepal have witnessed firsthand the vicious means of unsafe abortions—from cow dung to glass to thorns. Such practices may degrade women’s long-term sexual and reproductive health and can lead to permanent injury or maternal deaths which in turn increases child mortality and malnutrition rates.

Proponents believe they are defending the life of the unborn. Yet a recent study by the Guttmacher Institute calculated that rescinding the Helms Amendment alone can prevent 19 million unsafe abortions and 17000 maternal deaths annually and reduce abortion-related maternal deaths by 98 percent. The global gag rule censors what health practitioners can say to patients in private conversations about their health and imposes the US culture war on women in low-income countries. How is it moral for a country that aspires to be a model for freedom of speech to censor those private conversations and impose a non-universal way of thinking in an imperialist way? Current Issue View our current issue

When Biden was inaugurated health practitioners and policy-makers in Nepal and other developing countries hoped that his administration would address the lack of access to reproductive health care among less-privileged people around the world. Biden has in fact repealed the global gag rule and signed the Memorandum on Protecting Women’s Health at Home and Abroad which revoked the previous administration’s expanded version of the Mexico City policy. However since Biden’s campaign championed reproductive rights many hoped Biden would lead the passage of the Global Health Empowerment and Rights (HER) Act which allows foreign NGOs to use non-US funds to provide abortion or post-abortion care and permanently voids the global gag rule closing the path for future US presidents to impose a gag rule again solely with executive power.

Two months before the midterm elections that hope is faltering.

While Democrats control Congress they should act immediately to pass legislation such as the Abortion Is Health Care Everywhere Act which revokes the Helms Amendment permanently. Biden should also lead in passing the Global HER Act which Vice President Kamala Harris cosponsored as a senator. While fighting at home for reproductive rights President Biden must do everything in his power to ensure those same rights for pregnant people in less-developed countries all around the world.

As President Barack Obama once said “In the eyes of God a child on the other side of the border is no less worthy of love and compassion than my own child.” In that spirit US advocates for reproductive rights should not limit their advocacy to the United States because a pregnant person on the other side of the border might need an abortion as much as an American woman."

El mundo del fútbol vivió en 2021 un bombazo: el 8 de agosto de ese año Leo Messi dejó atrás su etapa en Barcelona y firmó contrato con PSG hasta el 30 de junio de 2023.

Y esa transferencia causó una revolución positiva en el club parisino en materia económica por el impacto que el rosarino genera en el público y en las empresas interesadas en contar con su imagen.

Según reveló ‘El Economista’ los ingresos de París Saint Germain aumentaron en torno a los 700 millones de euros en el año de Messi en la Ciudad de la Luz. Este balance positivo tiene que ver con la llegada de diez nuevos patrocinadores el aumento de contratos que ya estaban vigentes y la venta de camisetas.

Credit: Becky Adams-Selin Verisk Atmospheric and Environmental Research

Scientists are making substantial progress in better understanding hailstorms a key step toward improving forecasts of the multibillion-dollar hazard leading hail experts said at a briefing Thursday.

The briefing took place at the Second North American Workshop on Hail & Hailstorms an event hosted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) for U.S. and international hail scientists to share updates on important advances in hail research. Hailstorms are one of the costliest types of weather disasters causing $16 billion in damages across North America last year alone.

NCAR senior scientist Andrew Heymsfield speaking at the briefing emphasized the importance of using radars to better detect hail and thereby help mitigate storm-related damage. He highlighted key questions that scientists are seeking to answer including the influence of a changing climate on hailstorms and the processes within a storm that affect the intensity and size of hail—especially why some storms will generate especially large and destructive hailstones.

""In a hailstorm only a very few select hailstones become the largest"" he said. ""What are the underlying physical processes that select these 'favored' hailstones?""

Becky Adams-Selin senior scientist at Verisk Atmospheric and Environmental Research discussed the use of machine learning techniques and advanced computer modeling to determine why it's so difficult to forecast which storms will produce large hailstones. Her research indicates that the processes that lead to large hail may have more to do with the structure of the storm than with atmospheric conditions such as wind or temperature.

""Predicting large hailstones is difficult from a forecasting perspective because every storm is really different and the same atmospheric environment can produce several types of storms"" she said. ""We're using machine learning to identify patterns in the tens of thousands of different hail trajectories in a storm with the goal of identifying the conditions that generate the most damaging hailstones.""

Ian Giammanco senior director for standards and data analytics and lead research meteorologist at the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety noted that hail accounts for about 70% of the damage from severe thunderstorms which is far more than the monetary losses caused by tornadoes or lightning. He stressed that society needs to focus on greater resilience to hailstorms especially as more development occurs in hail prone regions.

""Our homes are getting bigger they're being built closer together and our communities are more spread out so that's a lot of material that gets hit by hail and needs to be replaced"" he said. ""We have a huge challenge ahead of us because a lot of things we have—our homes our businesses our cars etc.—are not well-suited to deal with hailstorms.""

The panelists emphasized the importance of gathering more data about hailstorms. They noted that there hasn't been a major U.S. field project to study hail in more than 40 years. Instead scientists have to rely on scattered reports on hail that fell to the ground and try to infer general characteristics of the storm that produced them. Adams-Selin Heymsfield and their colleagues have proposed a new field project ICECHIP (In-situ Collaborative Experiment for Collection of Hail in the Plains) that would use aircraft radars and other instruments to make detailed observations of hailstorms over the Great Plains and Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.

""We need better observations so we can understand the complex processes taking place in a hailstorm which will lead to better forecasts"" Heymsfield said.

Nancy Wesley (Patrika Darbo) is ready to shed her ex-husband’s last name and trade it in for a new one. Nancy Weston does have a nice ring to it don’t ya think? She may think so but Chloe Lane (Nadia Bjorlin) does not. While Nancy and Clyde Weston (James Read) prepare for their wedding she plots to save her mother from it.

Chloe calls upon Craig Wesley (Kevin Spartas) to stop Nancy from making what Chloe calls ‘the biggest mistake of her life.’ While she can understand her mother’s loneliness and desire for love she is filling that void with the wrong man.

Here's what you should know.

Credit card companies have come under increasing scrutiny from the federal government and Congress recently proposed a bill to increase competition in credit card processing networks. The goal is to lower transaction fees saving merchants and consumers money.

The move would be particularly meaningful for Visa (V 0.79%) and Mastercard (MA 0.33%) the world's two largest credit card processors. Here's what's in the bill and what it might mean for their bottom lines.

The Credit Card Competition Act

According to research from Ascent credit card processing fees for merchants range from 1.15% plus $0.05 to 3.15% plus $0.10 in interchange fees plus another 0.14% to 0.17% in assessment fees. These are fees paid to the card's issuing bank the card's payment network and the payment processor.

To reduce these fees Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Roger Marshall (R-KS) introduced a bill that looks to open up the payment processing market and increase competition. The bill is called the ""Credit Card Competition Act of 2022."" The bill would require banks with more than $100 billion in assets to process electronic credit transactions on no fewer than two affiliated networks one of which must be outside of Visa's or Mastercard's network. Supporters say the bill would save consumers money while increasing competition breaking up the dominance that Visa and Mastercard enjoy. Several organizations have come out in support of the bill.

""Processing credit card transactions should not be limited to two companies when there are a dozen that can do the job just as well"" said Leon Buck vice president for government relations banking and financial services at the National Retail Federation. ""Routing choice has saved retailers and their customers billions in the debit card market and can do even more in the much-larger credit card market.""

The National Association of Convenience Stores has also come out in favor of the bill saying that the average ""swipe fee"" of 2.25% is seven times the amount retailers in Europe pay and five times more than those in China. According to Christine Pollack vice president government relations at The Food Industry Association the hidden processing fees cost the average U.S. family $900 per year.

Here's what Visa and Mastercard have to say about the proposed bill

Visa and Mastercard account for 83% of the general-purpose cards and charged $77 billion in merchant fees last year alone. These fees include interchange or swipe fees which partner banks earn and network fees that credit card companies make.

The companies have pushed back on the legislation. According to Vasant Prabhu chief financial officer at Visa there is already a lot of competition in the market. He says that most Americans carry multiple credit cards like American Express Mastercard and other types of co-branded cards.

One of Prabhu's concerns is that the payment infrastructure for credit cards isn't ready for multiple networks and there would be a cost of reissuing cards and upgrading technology to accomplish this. He said the bill would also hurt consumers because it could lead to the demise of customer loyalty programs. This would ultimately hurt co-branded credit cards issued by airlines or retailers that may have to scale back their rewards to customers for using their credit cards.

Craig Vosburg chief product officer for Mastercard also voiced concerns about the safety and security of routing transactions through different networks. Vosburg said merchants could choose the cheapest networks that may not have the best security measures to protect consumers. Mastercard Chief Executive Officer Michael Miebach said that other payment processors hadn't made the same investments as Visa and Mastercard in the safety and security of their networks.

The bottom line

According to Doug Kantor chief counsel at the National Association of Convenience Stores the move could reduce swipe fees by $11 billion or more annually.

With competition heating up in the payments industry additional regulation would make it difficult for Visa and Mastercard to replicate the success they've had during the past decade. The credit card giants have enjoyed healthy profit margins over the years. If more payments get processed through alternative networks Visa and Mastercard could see their margins come under pressure. The bill would also impact banks and credit unions that rely on interchange fees for their co-branded payment products.

Where the proposed bill goes from here

With credit cards growing in popularity it's not surprising to see lawmakers putting the industry under the microscope. The Credit Card Competition Act has been referred to the Senate Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs but has not yet been placed on the committee's calendar.

Most legislative analysts don't see the bill becoming law during this congressional session which ends Jan. 3. However Visa and Mastercard investors will want to keep tabs on the proposed bill which could ultimately put a dent in their earnings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZ29wLWF0dG9ybmV5cy1nZW5lcmFsLXZpc2EtYW1leC1tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLWlkZW50aWZ5LWd1bi1zdG9yZS1wdXJjaGFzZXMtMjAyMi050gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9nb3AtYXR0b3JuZXlzLWdlbmVyYWwtdmlzYS1hbWV4LW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtaWRlbnRpZnktZ3VuLXN0b3JlLXB1cmNoYXNlcy0yMDIyLTk_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GOP state officials warn Visa AmEx Mastercard on code for gun stores,"Guns for sale at a store in Houston Texas. Brandon Bell/Getty Images

AGs from 24 states sent a letter threatening to take action over a new merchant code for gun stores.

The move follows the International Organization for Standardization's recent vote to create the code.

All three credit-card companies recently said they have adopted the standard.

The Republican attorneys general of 24 states are threatening to ""marshal the full scope of our lawful authority"" as Visa American Express and Mastercard adopt a new merchant category code recently created for gun and ammunition stores.

The AGs sent a letter Tuesday to the CEOs of American Express Mastercard and Visa. The letter was led by the attorneys general of Tennessee and Montana. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the story.

All three payment processors have adopted the code NPR reported.

The attorneys general warned that tracking the data could lead to misuse whether intentional or unintentional. ""Creating and tracking this data only matters if your institutions are considering using that information to take further harmful action—like infringing upon consumer privacy inhibiting constitutionally protected purchases by selectively restricting the use of your payment systems or otherwise withholding your financial services from targeted ""disfavored"" merchants.""

They said using a merchant code for gun stores would be an inaccurate method for keeping track of firearms purchases. ""This categorization would not recognize the difference for example between the purchase of a gun safe and a firearm. Nor would it capture firearm purchases made at department stores resulting in arbitrarily disparate treatment of ""gun store"" merchants and consumers.""

The coordinated move came after the Geneva-based nonprofit International Organization for Standardization (ISO) approved the creation of the merchant code earlier this month. A spokesperson for the National Rifle Association told Insider the vote was ""nothing more than a capitulation to anti-gun politicians and activists bent on eroding the rights of law-abiding Americans one transaction at a time.""

Gun rights advocates including the NRA have expressed concerns that the new merchant category code would effectively create a gun registry and put gun owners at risk.

This would ""create the obvious risk that law-abiding consumers' information will be leaked discovered hacked or otherwise obtained and misused by those who oppose Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights"" per the letter.

Visa referred Insider to a statement it issued on Sept. 13 a few days after the ISO decision: ""Many misunderstand what that means and are in turn advocating the use of MCCs to ""track"" gun sales as a potential tool in combatting gun violence"" Visa wrote. ""That's not what merchant codes are designed for nor should they be. MCCs already exist for hundreds of different businesses including beauty salons bookstores newsstands bowling alleys and bakeries among many others.""

The company said that when Visa and other payment networks process a transaction they don't have visibility over the items consumers buy.

In a separate statement to Insider Mastercard said it ""respects individuals' right to transact privately with others"" and that the creation of the merchant code would not cause the company to deviate from its principles ""Quite simply we allow lawful purchases on the network. This ensures the application of a clear consistent and reliable standard upon which consumers businesses and governments across the world can understand and rely.""

American Express did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Researchers have uncovered a widespread credit card scheme that has gone undetected since 2019.

Amazon Web Services Mastercard and Visa could potentially be unknowingly participating in the scheme the firm says.

The company's cofounder says people should be proactive in checking their credit cards for unfamiliar charges.

Cybersecurity researchers say they have uncovered a massive multi-million dollar credit card scheme and major companies like Amazon Web Services Mastercard and Visa are all potentially unwitting participants.

Consumer-facing cybersecurity firm ReasonLabs exposed the scheme which they said has flown under the radar for years by charging small enough monthly subscription fees for generic-sounding services to go undetected by scores of victims in the US.

ReasonLabs says the scam has been operating without notice since 2019 and has reaped fraudsters between $10 million to $50 million per year.

How the scheme works

The operation appears to have gone undiscovered largely due to its complexity. Scammers allegedly created a network of more than 200 fake dating and adult websites that are functional but have no real users or website traffic ReasonLabs said.

The firm says these cybercriminals used hundreds of stolen credit card numbers likely purchased from the dark web and charged the cards monthly. Typical of many sites in the adult dating industry the charges showed up on credit card bills with generic or official-sounding names obscuring their origin.

The charges usually range from $29.95 to $49.95 ReasonLabs cofounder and chief technology officer Andrew Newman told Insider.

In addition to the adult dating sites the fraudsters allegedly set up a network of functional customer support sites to service complaints and issue legitimate refunds. Newman said the scammers processed refunds in order to avoid raising alarm bells with legitimate credit card companies.

He says he believes the scheme is operated from the middle of Europe or Russia but the firm hasn't been able to fully verify the scammers' location.

Big companies' involvement

ReasonLabs says a number of major companies are unwittingly implicated in the ongoing scheme including Amazon Web Services Visa Mastercard and GoDaddy.

""We reached out to all the companies involved so we were able to understand who was doing the hosting who is doing all the domain registration. To date not a single company returned or responded"" Newman said.

He said ReasonLabs' next step would be to contact authorities via Fraud.org a nonprofit that shares consumer complaints with law enforcement partners.

AWS told Insider it received the email from ReasonLabs but it did not provide sufficient details about the alleged misuse of AWS services to investigate the matter. AWS says it has requested additional information from ReasonLabs but has yet to receive a response.







GoDaddy told Insider it is looking into the issue and MasterCard said it doesn't have a record of being contacted regarding the scheme.

Visa did not immediately respond to comment.

How to protect yourself

""For this particular scam what's crazy about it is there's really very little protection in the way of technology"" said Newman.

""Something we preach all the time is really just education. If you see something odd make sure you do something about it because it's not going to go away on its own"" he added.

He advised people to be proactive about analyzing their credit card statements for unfamiliar charges. If people suspect a charge is fraudulent they should contact their credit card companies directly because the companies can open internal investigations Newman said.

""If you see something odd make sure you do something about it because it's not going to go away on its own"" he warned."

Random House Celadon Unveil Editions of the January 6 Report Random House will publish The January 6th Report in fall 2022 featuring a foreword by California congressman Adam Schiff. The work subtitled The Findings of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol will Random House said be “the official report of the investigation into the attack—perhaps the most vital congressional investigation in American history—with exhibits and witness testimony.” The foreword by Schiff who is chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence “offers critical insights into this harrowing chapter in American history.” Mark Warren will edit the book. Macmillan’s Celadon Books imprint will also publish an edition of the report on the events of January 6 in conjunction with the New Yorker and with an epilogue by Maryland congressman Jamie Raskin. Set to be released simultaneously in print and digital formats the edition will feature an introduction by New Yorker editor David Remnick. Deb Futter acquired world rights from William Morris Endeavor’s Eric Simonoff and Celadon’s Bill Hamilton will edit the book. Celadon is calling its edition the “first comprehensive portrait of the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol.” Futter added that it will “provide the American people with a full picture of the tragic events of that day.”

Hazelwood Re-ups at Berkley

Ali Hazelwood inked a five-book agreement with Berkley her current publisher. Sarah Blumenstock acquired the titles from Thao Le at Sandra Dijkstra Literary Agency following the success of the author’s 2021 debut novel The Love Hypothesis which Berkley said has become a global bestseller. The deal includes

three adult novels which Berkley purchased in a world rights agreement and two YA titles to be released by Penguin Young Readers which it bought in a U.S. and Canadian rights agreement. The first YA title contracted Check & Mate is a rom-com in which the publisher said “a young woman’s life is jump-started when she accidentally defeats the reigning bad boy of chess inadvertently kicking off a public rivalry—and a match for the heart.” Berkley published Hazelwood’s sophomore novel Love on the Brain last month and will be releasing her third novel Love Theoretically in August 2023.

Stevenson Trades at Currency

Gary Stevenson sold The Trading Game at auction to Currency’s Paul Whitlach in a North American rights agreement. Chris Wellbelove at Aitken Alexander in the U.K. represented Stevenson a YouTuber and former banker who walked away from the industry to rail against the 1%. The memoir Currency said charts the author’s “unlikely journey from the working-class outskirts of East London to the London School of Economics” after which he became one of Citibank’s most successful traders. It also details why Stevenson opted to quit and “campaign against the perils of growing global wealth inequality.” The publisher said the book was pitched as “Anthony Bourdain meets Liar’s Poker.”

Berkley Gets ‘Christmas’-y with Winfrey

Berkley’s Cindy Hwang and Angela Kim took world English rights to Kerry Winfrey’s Faking Christmas. The holiday novel set for fall 2023 was sold by Stephen Barbara at InkWell Management. Barbara said it was inspired by the 1945 film Christmas in Connecticut and follows a woman named Laurel who’s allowed her boss Gilbert to believe she owns her sister’s local farm—when in reality she just manages its Instagram account. When Gilbert invites himself to the farm on Christmas Eve “Laurel must figure out how she can trick him into thinking she’s basically the Martha Stewart of rural Ohio and keep her job in the process.”

But James Grunke CEO of the Erie Regional Chamber and Growth Partnership said that number could be a lot higher.

The challenge is that many of Erie County's 300 or so manufacturers need to hire people but can't find them.

And the problem is widespread said Jake Rouch vice president of economic development for the chamber who explains even Erie County's largest industrial employer Wabtec Corp. has more than 100 manufacturing jobs to fill.

Other companies with dozens of job openings include JTM Foods LLC the nation's largest producer of snack pies.

This job fair is kind of different from others

Hosting job fairs isn't usually part of the chamber's playbook but its leaders are making an exception.

On Thursday the chamber and the Erie Regional Manufacturing Partnership will host the 2022 Manufacturing Career and Job Fair from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the Zem Zem Shrine Club at 2525 West 38th St.

Local companies including Wabtec Plastek Group Industrial Sales and Manufacturing and Eriez Manufacturing will be on hand with the hopes of finding new employees.

Grunke is optimistic about the potential for successful career matchmaking.

""If you want a job in manufacturing if you can show up on the 29th you are either going to get connected or get connected into a training program. We need people to come who are looking for work"" he said.

Rouch said it's difficult to say for certain the number of open jobs in Erie County's manufacturing sector. He estimates though that county's 300 or so manufacturers average at least three openings apiece. That math suggests that in the neighborhood of 1000 jobs in manufacturing await the right applicant.

""It's not like we are down 2000 jobs and there are no job openings"" Rouch said. ""It's the opposite.""

Grunke explains it this way: ""There are (still) 22000 jobs in manufacturing but there are only 19000 people filling them.""

Jim Rutkowski Jr. general manager of Industrial Sales and Manufacturing in Millcreek Township a contract manufacturer that does work for a large number of companies said he is optimistic about the chamber-led effort.

According to the chamber ISM has about a dozen jobs to fill and could potentially add another shift if it found enough people.

The hiring process has changed for Erie companies

""We are extremely hopeful that it will help"" Rutkowski said. ""In our case it is getting a little better but we are trying so many avenues to find people. It's not like the old days where you put an ad in the paper or a sign out front and people showed up at your door.""

Rouch and Grunke see the career fair as only a first step at what needs to be a sustained effort.

The chamber is also working to tackle a larger problem of providing both training and the money to help train applicants who have an interest in manufacturing employment but not all the right skills.

""You have to have the employers you have to have the training providers you have to have the talent pools then you have the funding resources"" Rouch said.

People representing each of those things ""have to get into an ongoing dynamic dance"" he said.

In some cases Rouch said the high-demand environment could make it easier for applicants to find training.

""Most of our employers if someone is ready to go to work and they are committed they will figure out how to pay for the training or they will start some in-house training"" Rouch said.

President John Standley announced his departure from the U.S. business segment of Walgreens Boots Alliance this Tuesday. His responsibilities will be divided between pharmacy led by Lee Cooper and retail led by Tracey Brown. Both will report to WBA CEO Roz Brewer and will serve on the executive leadership team.

Cooper will be joining the company as senior vice president beginning Oct. 1. Cooper previously held the role of CEO at Shields Health Solutions which is to be acquired by WBA for $1.37 billion.

MetroHealth System

Airica Steed was named the next president and CEO of MetroHealth System effective Jan. 1. Steed will succeed Akram Boutros M.D. who has worked with the health system since 2013 and announced plans to retire at the end of this year.

During Boutros’ tenure he opened two hospitals three emergency departments and 10 community health centers and grew the system’s revenue from $785 million to more than $1.5 billion annually.

Steed currently holds the position of executive vice president and system chief operating officer at Sinai Chicago Health System and president of the system's flagship Mount Sinai and Sinai Children's Hospital.

Steed was chosen to lead the system serving 1.5 million patients throughout Chicago after a nationwide search ending in a unanimous vote. She will be responsible for overseeing the opening of the system’s new hospital the Glick Center.

Amwell

Amwell has announced that it will expand its technology leadership team with Vaughn Paunovich as executive vice president of enterprise platform and Matthew McAllister as chief product officer at the digital care company.

Paunovich will manage technological delivery and innovation including Amwell’s enterprise grade digital care delivery platform Converge. His most recent experience was at UnitedHealth Group where he held myriad positions including senior vice president of OptumLabs and chief information officer for both OptumHealth and OptumCare.

McAllister will be responsible for product management and design. His most recent position was at Amazon where he worked for 12 years leading product and UX design engineering marketing and analytics teams.

“We are experiencing a time of great transformation for Amwell and for our industry” said Roy Schoenberg CEO of Amwell. “Customers today no longer want to buy features. They want a partner who can assimilate deep knowledge experience and interoperable technology to solve for their current and future digital aspirations. As we complete some of the most strategic aspects of the build-out of Converge our digital care delivery platform we are excited to have Paunovich and McAllister join our executive team.”

The tort claim notices claim that the response to the fire itself worsened the damage to the facility. Specifically it says that at one point a responding agency requested that the sprinkler system be shut off.

""The sprinkler system pump(s) and/or riser(s) and/or the sprinkler system itself were consequently shut off and at or about the same time certain doors at the Premises were opened by a responding agency. The fire thereafter grew and worsened"" the notices state.

The insurance companies representing Walmart claim that the total damages exceeded $150000000.

In the Indiana Tort Claims Act there is a $5000000 damages limit. The claim acknowledges this.

The notices name Plainfield Fire Territory Chief Brent Anderson Assistant Fire Chief Gregory Williams and Deputy of Operations Jeffry Dixon among the involved parties as well as several other fire officials.

Randy Hargrove a Walmart spokesperson told WRTV that the company is ""taking steps as required under Indiana law to preserve our rights during this ongoing investigation.""

Stephanie Singh the director of communications and marketing for the town issued the following statement but declined to comment further because the litigation is still pending.

""The Town of Plainfield is proud of the heroic response by the Plainfield Fire Territory and the supporting services from all over central Indiana who risked their personal safety to protect lives. The safety and security of life is always the Plainfield Fire Territory’s highest priority. The Town of Plainfield and the Plainfield Fire Territory remains committed to providing fire and emergency medical services to the residents and visitors of Plainfield.""

Certified fire investigator and prosecutor Peter Beering tells WRTV the decisions firefighters made on the day of the fire will more than likely be protected by precedent.

""[I'm] not hugely surprised with a loss this big that the insurance companies would seek to mitigate their loss"" Beering said. ""We want the fire department to respond. We want the fire department to not worry about liability questions and so as a general proposition the tendency is to not hold fire departments responsible for bad outcomes.""

With similar warehouse structures being built across Central Indiana Beering thinks this could be a lesson other fire departments could learn.

""If you are in charge of a fire department you have to be concerned about what that means if God forbid there's some sort of incident in one of these"" Beering said.

In April the distribution center was officially closed due to damages caused by the fire. Walmart said that as many as 1132 associates who hadn't accepted alternative positions may be separated from the company by July 15.

The fire itself lasted more than three days. It started March 16 and prompted a response from at least 24 fire departments.

In a notice sent to Plainfield Fire Territory attorneys claim the department's orders to shut down the sprinkler system during the mammoth blaze made the fire worse. The attorneys further said the facility’s doors were opened before the fire was extinguished ushering in oxygen that fed the flames.

""We are taking steps as required under Indiana law to preserve our rights during the ongoing investigation"" said Randy Hargrove a Walmart spokesman.

Damage from the fire on March 16 forced the 1.2-million square foot facility to permanently shut down. The blaze from the warehouse at 9590 Allpoints Parkway sent plumes of smoke so high satellite imagery detected it. One firefighter who suffered minor injuries while assisting in the response was treated and released at the scene. No other injuries were reported.

The Plainfield warehouse permanently closed after the fire.

In a sweeping set of announcements this week and earlier this month Walmart hit the accelerator on a technology juggernaut that is helping the company deliver powerful performance while navigating one of the most challenging retail environments in history:

Advertising and commerce partnerships with TikTok Snap and Roku to name just three titans

Personalization omnichannel integration and more features on the Walmart website and app for better customer experiences

Virtual try-on technology designed to make consumers more comfortable with clothing purchases

Simple holiday charitable giving options for customers through Walmart.com

Milestones in its GoLocal delivery service

Walmart regularly taps both third-party and acquired technology to deliver new functionality. The company is no stranger to technology investment and pursuit including building its own retail industry cloud applications.

If all those factors don’t make Walmart (revenue for the 12 months ended July 31: $588 billion) sound like a digital-native company then pay closer attention to this week’s announcement which highlights a “multilateral culture of experimentation” and its work with “Innovation Partners.” Announcements are delivered in blogs written by senior corporate executives at least one of whom invites readers to connect with him on LinkedIn.

Advertising Commerce Partnerships

Walmart recognizes the importance of social connection — social feeds live streaming and mobile — when it comes to purchase decisions especially among Gen Z and millennial customers. New partnerships are intended to give advertisers access to buyers — through Walmart Connect — anywhere advertisers need to have it in new ad formats that span the shoppers’ journey. Its Innovation Partners include:

TikTok — the two companies are working together so advertisers can serve in-feed ads on TikTok which will be augmented by Walmart Connect targeting and measurement functionality. It’s noteworthy that more than 50% of TikTok users say they watch in-feed ads and don’t scroll past them — a level of engagement that vastly exceeds web advertising

The customer experience is built for easy product discovery and a real-time checkout experience.

TalkShopLive — This partnership enables supplier-funded shoppable live streams on Walmart.com/live TalkShopLive’s platform as well as brand and publisher sites across the web via TalkShopLive’s embeddable video player.

For the latter two partnerships Walmart has partnered with Johnson & Johnson as well as Procter & Gamble thus far on ad creation.

The scope of these partnerships and the breadth of options Walmart is offering to advertisers gives the company and its advertisers incredible reach and penetration across some of the most influential consumer platforms.

“Together we will work with each partner to more deeply connect advertisers with customers throughout key moments in the shopper journey in order to provide the best solutions for advertisers” Seth Dallaire Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer of Walmart U.S. said in announcing the relationships.

Personalization and More Web App Features

Walmart detailed a number of website enhancements to make the shopper experience more personal — and to fuel maximum holiday sales.

New features include Scan to Add allowing customers to scan items in-store using the Walmart app and add them directly to a gift registry for simple integration of online/offline experiences. As one example kids can make their own gift lists on Walmart.com by simply “hearting” items and sharing them. Adults may not love that concept but it will ensure they don’t buy gifts that kids don’t want.

A Choose Your Own Model feature lets a clothing shopper choose a model whose proportions resemble them and get a personalized view of how the clothing will look on them.

Another enhancement benefits Spanish-speaking customers: The search experience at Walmart.com lets customers opt into or out of translated queries and search in Spanish for more than 600000 of the most commonly ordered items.

Collectively these improvements check a couple of important boxes: removing guesswork and making the omnichannel experience as easy as possible for customers.

“When customs are ready to shift into holiday mode we will be ready with their ideal digital experience no finger crossing required” Tom Ward Executive Vice President and Chief eCommerce Officer of Walmart U.S. said in describing the enhancements.

Virtual Try-Ons

The company is extending its virtual try-on technology with Be Your Own Model which officials say will bring an in-store fitting room-quality experience to the web. Customers can use their own photos to visualize clothing on them.

A customer will see an “ultra-realistic” simulation with shadows fabric draping and other details in seconds delivered by leveraging algorithms and machine learning models originally developed for topographic maps. The technology will show how a garment appears uniquely on an individual.

Choose Your Own Model and Be Your Own Model result from the acquisition and implementation of the Zeekit virtual try-on platform.

“Walmart is the first to offer a virtual try-on experience for apparel brands at scale and it’s the most realistic application I have seen” says Denise Incandela Executive Vice President Apparel and Private Brands Walmart U.S.

Promoting Holiday Season Charitability

The company launched Spark Good a set of resources on Walmart.com providing easy access to programs and tools for nonprofits while making charitable contributions simple for customers.

Spark Good Round Up allows customers to round up their purchase total at checkout on the website and in the app to a public charity of their choice. While many such programs exist in retail they typically donate to a single organization of the retailer’s choice. Walmart is allowing customers to customize and choose their own charity.

Spark Good Registry is a resource whereby public charities can create and manage registries for products their clientele needs — using wedding and baby registries as a model — to ensure the highest impact. Charities can send charitable receipts and thank their donors.

Going Local

The company provided a one-year update on Go Local its local delivery platform and service that businesses of all sizes can tap for their customer delivery requirements. Walmart is on track to reach 5000 pickup locations by the end of this year and offers delivery in as fast as 30 minutes.

“For our local and small business clients we work closely with them to build out their delivery value proposition and scale their business to reach more customers” said Harsit Patel Vice President and General Manager Walmart GoLocal.

Walmart is approaching GoLocal with a co-creation mindset: “It’s energizing to collaborate with our clients — regardless of where they are in their delivery journey — and find new ways to support them and their business” Patel says.

Closing Thoughts

Walmart is not only the world’s largest company and retailer but also one of the most innovative and aggressive users of digital technology. As such its moves — and the growth mindset behind them — are instructive for companies of all sizes across industries. Its digital focus and raft of digital engagement measures to drive revenue directly and through partners ensures a massive impact across retail ecommerce logistics and a wide range of other industries.

That’s why all businesses competing in the acceleration economy need to keep close tabs on Walmart’s digital initiatives.

A brief ceremony honoring associates and recognizing local fire and police departments with a $2000 donation to each organization was held in the morning to commemorate the now-completed and much-anticipated project.

The remodel includes several department transformations that Turnersville store executives said will help customers save time.

“The Turnersville Walmart has a long history of serving customers and the community” Candice Bailey store manager stated. “We still have seven associates who helped open the store back in 1991. And since Day One we’ve been focused on our associates innovation community service and helping customers save time and money.”

Customers will enjoy the following store improvements:

New pharmacy location: From its former location in the middle of the grocery department the pharmacy has moved to the front of the store so customers can get their prescriptions vaccinations and other supplies in a more convenient fashion;

Improvements at checkout: To streamline checkout for customers the store added a new associate-operated register lane;

Refreshed interior and exterior including paint and signage for easier navigation through the store.

Walmart said it will continue to innovate to help customers save time and money by giving them the option to shop when where and how they want including through pickup pharmacy curbside pickup delivery and Walmart Pay a touch-free way to pay."

BAY LAKE Fla. – While there is little doubt frustrations with what sprung up around Disneyland in Anaheim sparked the idea of a do-over somewhere east of the Mississippi the Magic Kingdom itself is only 107 acres. So something much larger was top of mind by the time Walt Disney spotted Bay Lake and snapped up 27400 acres in the middle of nowhere Florida.

A year before his untimely death with a twinkle in his eye and Florida Gov. Hayden Burns seated by his side Walt Disney hinted something grand was indeed in the works. On November 15 1965 as he announced his dream he promised he’d just be getting warmed up with a new park to at least equal -- but more likely to top -- Disneyland plus surrounding resort hotels saying “It’s going to be well over a $100 million $100 million-plus.”

November 15 1965 announcement confirming Walt Disney is behind ""Project Florida."" (Left to right: Walt Disney Florida Gov. Hayden Burns Roy O. Disney (Disney)

With inflation $100 million today works out to roughly $867 million and phase one ultimately cost $400 million in 1971 dollars. No wonder Burns was wowed enough to tout this as “the greatest attraction yet known in the history of Florida.” But Walt was vague enough to prompt Mayor Russell Thacker of Kissimmee to say that day “It’s going to be something big but I don’t think they’ve told us anything.”

Florida legislators learned everything less than 15 months later on February 2 1967 as Roy Disney pressed for the company’s own private government with the screening of a truly extraordinary short film touting “A whole new Disney World.”

The Movie touting EPCOT the city officially named Walt's Florida Project a ""Disney World"" (Disney)

After a prelude Walt himself appears in what’s meant to be an Imagineering conference room explaining: “We have a perfect location in Florida almost in the very center of the state. In fact we selected this site because it’s so easy for tourists and Florida residents to get here by automobile.... Our Florida land is located partly in Orange County and Osceola County between the cities of Orlando and Kissimmee...” Take a look at the scale of the Disney property (below in green) compared to either Orlando or Kissimmee (both outlined below in red).

Walt Disney Explains his vision for ""The Florida Project in 1966. (Disney)

Walt continued: “The important thing is that the Disney World is located just a few miles from the crossing point of Interstate 4 at the Sunshine State Parkway. Florida’s major highways carrying motorists east and west and north and south through the center of the state.”

Keep in mind I-4 had just opened months before Walt’s secret was revealed in 1965. Sunshine State Parkway (now Florida’s Turnpike) opened its Orlando-area segment in 1964. The crucial intersection with I-4 that Walt talks about was completed two months after lawmakers saw this film not to mention four months after Walt passed away.

After the geography lesson Walt promised “The most exciting and challenging assignment we’ve ever tackled at Walt Disney Productions... There’s enough land here to hold all the ideas and plans we could possibly imagine. Right now our plans include an airport of the future down here in Osceola County.”

Walt Disney envisioned his land in Osceola County would be an ""airport of the future"" (Disney)

“An entrance complex where all visitors will enter Disney World” including day parking for the tens of thousands of theme park guests.

Vision for a centralized guest parking area for theme park guests miles from The Magic Kingdom connected by monorails (Disney)

“An industrial park area covering about 1000 acres...”

“And of course the theme park area way up here. All these various activities around the Disney World will be tied together by a high-speed rapid transit system running almost the full length of the property.”

A diagram showing an early placement for ""The Magic Kingdom"" -- envisioning an expanded Bay Lake (Disney)

“The most exciting by far the most important part of our Florida Project in fact the heart of everything we’ll be doing in Disney World will be our Experimental Prototype City of Tomorrow. We call it EPCOT spelled E-P-C-O-T: Experimental.... Prototype.... Community of Tomorrow.”

“EPCOT will be a community of tomorrow that will never be completed but will always be introducing and testing and demonstrating new materials and new systems.... It will never cease to be a living blueprint of the future where people actually live a life they can’t find anywhere else in the world” Walt Disney added.

EPCOT the city would have been the very heart of ""The Florida Project."" (Disney)

Similar to Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom the primary sections of EPCOT would have radiated out from a circular 50-acre hub. Atop that hub would sit an enormous 30-story hotel the film’s off-screen narrator calls ”the shining jewel at the center of the city. It will offer tourists and vacationers not only the most modern guest rooms and convention facilities but also a 7-acre recreation deck.”

Below the hotel and its pools volleyball and racquetball courts would be a transportation lobby linking the vast parking area for theme park guests to the south and the theme park itself to the north via a monorail. Also on that level “international shopping areas where stores and whole streets recreate the character and adventure of places around the world plus theatres with dramatic and musical productions restaurants and a variety of nightlife attractions and a wide range of office buildings....”

This section of the film likely sparked a major misunderstanding that persists to this day. The narration says “most important this entire 50 acres of city streets and buildings will be completely enclosed. In this climate-controlled environment shoppers and theatergoers and people just out for a stroll will enjoy ideal weather conditions protected day and life from rain heat and cold and humidity.” About this time a visual shows a skylight looking down into the international shopping streets below.

Note: No one says anything here about a domed city. The heart of EPCOT below the hotel was meant to be climate controlled -- like a vast shopping mall but with more skylights and windows for natural lighting.

Underneath the shopping and transportation hub the next level down would cater to cars moving through the heart of EPCOT and parking for those shops offices and mid-rise high-density apartment buildings that would wrap around the outskirts of the City Central.

An underground level would be exclusively for trucks and other industrial traffic to keep traffic jams to a minimum.

The transportation hub as planned for the heart of EPCOT the city (Disney)

To reach the neighborhoods guests and residents would hop aboard larger enclosed versions of the electric-powered WEDWay Peoplemover found in Tomorrowland. These transit lines would ferry guests outward past a large greenbelt of parks nature and recreation space that separates the urban from the suburban and also would have included schools and churches -- connected by footpaths to the homes.

Schools churches and recreational activities were planned for a massive greenspace between the urban core of EPCOT the City and neighborhoods. (Disney)

The film does not even hint at the design of those homes themselves - just that they “will be built in ways that permit ease of change so new products may continuously be demonstrated.” Who wouldn’t look forward to their kitchen being torn up once or twice a year right? Every front lawn is a short walk from the nearest Peoplemover station with smaller communal play areas out front and driveways out back for those times you need that pesky 20th century relic the automobile. “But most EPCOT residents will drive their automobiles only on weekend pleasure trips” the narrator continues.

Getting to work is as simple as hopping a WEDWay to the hub -- then taking a monorail north to the theme park or south to a 100-acre industrial complex that uses more WEDWays to reach each office complex.

There the film’s narrator promises “Individual companies will create a showcase of industry at work. In attractive park-like settings 6 million people who visit Disney World each year will look behind the scenes at experimental prototype plants research and development laboratories and computer centers for major corporations.” I can just imagine the excitement in the face of teenagers clamoring to see metal car parts being stamped. “Dad! Look! Real flame retardant was just sprayed on that door gasket.”

An industrial complex intended as a showplace was planned south of EPCOT - the City (Disney)

The narrator promises “EPCOT will be a working community with employment for all. And everyone who lives here will have a responsibility to help keep this community and exciting living blueprint of the future.” So no pressure guys.

Walt wraps up the film saying “I’m sure this experimental prototype community of tomorrow can influence the future of city living for generations to come. It’s an exciting challenge a once in a lifetime opportunity for everyone who participates speaking for myself and the entire Disney organization. We’re ready to go right now.”

Walt Disney Explains his vision for ""The Florida Project in 1966. (Disney)

Unfortunately they weren’t. Walt passed away from lung cancer just 49 days after filming his vision of EPCOT. Without him Imagineers eventually admitted they couldn’t crack the code to make it work. Instead they took ideas from Walt -- making all of The Florida Project forward-thinking in terms of the environment power garbage and transportation. They managed growth and construction with a blueprint called “The EPCOT Building Code” which was far more strict than Florida’s. Eventually EPCOT Center was built in the heart of Project Florida right where the city was meant to be. When they broke ground on October 1 1979 the international shopping street had morphed into World Showcase. The industrial plant with its state-of-the-art displays from corporations morphed into Future World. It did become “The most exciting and challenging assignment ever tackled at Walt Disney Productions” -- costing close to $1 billion in 1982 dollars but even many Imagineers wonder what would have happened had Walt lived just a few more years.

Here’s to dreaming and here’s to another half-century of The Most Magical Place on Earth!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vZXcuY29tL21vdmllcy9kaXNuZXktcHJpbmNlc3Nlcy1ldm9sdXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Snow White to Encanto: The evolution of Disney princesses,"1937: Snow White Everett Collection Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs came out in 1937 debuting the very first Disney princess with Snow White herself. Voiced by Adriana Caselotti she's incredibly of her time (i.e. dated af). Her whole deal is she's like really pretty. Plus she cooks and cleans a house for seven dudes who can't seem to pick up after themselves. Thankfully we've come a long way with our Disney princesses since Snow White.

1950: Cinderella Disney Another Disney princess who is extremely outdated when looking at her through a modern lens is Cinderella's titular damsel (voiced by Ilene Woods). Forced to cook and clean for her ugly—which back then meant evil—stepsisters and stepmother all she needs to achieve happiness is a pretty dress and a handsome rich husband to fall in love with her and pull her out of her dreary life? That's not a great message to send young kids watching today.

1959: Aurora Everett Collection Keeping the problematic train rolling is Sleeping Beauty's Aurora (voiced by Mary Costa). It doesn't get more yikes than yet another woman who is awoken from a cursed sleep by a nonconsensual kiss (see also: Snow White). Aurora caps off the trifecta of the ""Golden Era"" of Disney princesses i.e. the damsels in distress who wait around for their princes to save them. But the trend of passive female main characters ends here thankfully. Original Sleeping Beauty shares note to fans

1989: Ariel Everett Collection After a 30-year hiatus The Little Mermaid splashed onto the scene with an extremely different kind of Disney princess. Unlike the gentle delicate women that came before Ariel (voiced by Jodi Benson) is rebellious curious and confident and goes after what she wants in life. She breaks the rules and seeks adventure. She doesn't wait around for a man to save her—she saves her prince. Twice! And don't try to argue that Ariel gives up her voice to get the guy. She actually chooses to give up her voice to become a human fulfilling a lifelong dream of living up above the confines of the sea. A romance with a hot dog-loving prince was just a fun bonus. She's the first Disney princess to own her agency signaling an important shift in the company's values. All the women who have played Ariel

1991: Belle Disney Just two years later Beauty and the Beast introduced Belle (voiced by Paige O'Hara). This Disney princess like Ariel wants more out of life. She's smart choosing to read as many books as possible instead of swooning over the hunky (but horrible) town eye candy. She also falls in love with a man for his personality over his (beastly) looks. Talk about a modern woman! How well do you know Beauty and the Beast?

1992: Jasmine Everett Collection Up until now all the Disney princesses were white. It wasn't until Aladdin's Jasmine (voiced by Linda Larkin) that fans saw their first Disney princess of color. Problematically Larkin is a white person voicing a character who is not but still...baby steps. (It should be noted that Filipina actor-singer Lea Salonga did the singing voice for Jasmine.) 25 interesting facts about Disney's animated hit Aladdin

1995: Pocahontas Disney Pocahontas continued the much-needed push for non-white Disney princesses with the titular Native American heroine voiced by Irene Bedard. But unlike Aladdin Pocahontas' speaking voice behind the princess actually is a woman of color—Bedard is one of the most well-known Native American actors. This was definitely a step in the right direction for Disney. (Though Pocahontas' singing voice is provided by a white actor known for her extensive work in musical theater Judy Kuhn.) Plus Pocahontas is literally out here ending wars and pushing for acceptance no matter what your skin color is. Irene Bedard is not a Native American Barbie

1998: Mulan Everett Collection And the war-ending princesses don't stop there as Mulan came out a few years later. Voiced by Ming-Na Wen (with Lea Salonga providing the singing voice for a second princess) Mulan battled and defeated the Huns...and more importantly sexism as she proved that a woman warrior is just as good—if not better—than men. Mulan: The story behind 'I'll Make a Man Out of You' and its other hit songs

2007: Giselle Amy Adams in 'Enchanted'. Everett Collection Enchanted marks the first live-action Disney princess and while Amy Adams' naive optimistic Giselle's way of thinking is more in line with the earlier Disney princesses this rom-com subverts all those dated stereotypes and ideas brilliantly as Giselle gets a harsh but authentic dose of reality when she's exiled from her animated fairy-tale world into live-action NYC. Disney reinvents the princess in Enchanted

2009: Tiana Disney The Princess and the Frog's Tiana (voiced and sung by Anika Noni Rose) introduces Disney fans to a woman who would rather work hard (sometimes to the point of exhaustion!) to achieve her dream than take any shortcuts—or rely on a man to help her get there. But she also does the right thing even when it's the hardest choice to make. There aren't many role models better than Tiana. Disney reveals name and opening for Splash Mountain's Princess and the Frog revamp

2010: Rapunzel Disney Disney took a classic fairy-tale character like Rapunzel and modernized her for Tangled. Voiced by Mandy Moore she's another Disney princess who bursts out of her comfort zone to seek a better life for herself. Plus she outsmarts a con artist to get what she wants. Not bad for someone who had never been outside of her tower prison her entire young adult life. Why Tangled is better than Frozen — and deserves more love

2012: Merida Disney If you want to see just how far Disney princesses have come since Snow White just look at Brave. The young and headstrong Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) refuses to marry a prince and competes for her own hand in marriage instead. Her growth during the movie has nothing to do with finding love but rather mending her broken relationship with her mother. Brave: Merida remains the girl you know and love — EXCLUSIVE

2012: Vanellope von Schweetz Disney Sarah Silverman's plucky young character is Disney's first Jewish princess since it was revealed at the very end of Wreck-It Ralph that she was an actual princess instead of just a racer. She strives to race with all the other players despite her glitching putting her at a disadvantage. In the end she embraces her glitching and turns her weakness into a strength. See the Disney princesses' new outfits in Ralph Breaks the Internet

2013: Anna and Elsa Disney Both of the princesses in the first Frozen movie represent strong positive and modern traits. The real love story is between sisters Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) rather than with a guy. Plus Elsa learns to embrace her power rather than suppressing or fearing what makes her special giving us the power ballad that defined a decade. And with Frozen 2 these princesses continue to push Disney's values forward. Frozen: The reviews are in...

2016: Moana Moana in 'Moana'. Disney Along with introducing acting/singing phenom Auli'i Cravalho to the world Moana also debuted a young princess who puts her own life on the line to save her people. She doesn't let fear or doubt stop her from doing the right thing. And she also doesn't let anyone get in her way—even if it's a legit demigod. 10 fun facts about Moana

2019: Princess Leia Lucasfilm Ltd. While Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope actually came out in 1977 introducing fierce princess (now General) Leia to the world the Disney–Fox merger that made her a Disney princess didn't happen until March 2019. And she's the perfect Disney princess—rebellious strong and a true leader fighting the war against evil no matter how impossible the odds may be. And late star Carrie Fisher was a true national treasure using her platform to elevate important conversations about addiction and mental illness and becoming a true advocate who spoke up even when it was tough. It feels right that Fisher's Leia is an addition to the Disney princess club (even if it's by a technicality!). 10 characters who are now technically Disney princesses thanks to the Disney–Fox merger",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjIvMDkvd2FsdGVyLWVsaWFzLWRpc25leS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWFpcnBvcnQtYmIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney Has Roughly 9 Months to Complete Construction on the Walter Elias Disney International Airport at Disney ...,"The Walt Disney Company made some big announcements at the 2022 D23 Expo in early September but company executives made no mention of a Walter Elias Disney International Airport to be built on Disney World property and time is running out for Disney to seal the deal.

RELATED: Disney’s Plans for a Massive Magic Kingdom Expansion are More About a Strike Against Universal than a Stride Toward a Better Guest Experience

Construction of the Walter Elias Disney Airport at Disney World which would serve Guests flying to the Resort area to visit the parks must be completed by June 30 2023 as new legislation takes effect on July 1 2023–legislation that will take away Disney’s autonomy in building its very own airport forever. But the project would be a huge undertaking. They’re going to need dump trucks full of pixie dust for this one.

Disney World is ever-changing and ever-growing just like Walt Disney “prophesied” it would do when he first bought thousands of acres of swampland in a desolate humid area of Central Florida in the early 1960s.

“Here in Florida we have something special we never enjoyed at Disneyland: the blessing of size” Walt said. “There’s enough land here to hold all the ideas and plans we can possibly imagine.”

Walt’s first purchase of land in Central Florida was transacted in October 1964. And by the time he was finished purchasing swampland he had amassed almost 30000 acres within Orange County and Osceola County. And it only cost him about $5 million.

Reedy Creek Improvement District

In 1966 Walt Disney and his team began their lobbying efforts in the Sunshine State with the goal of establishing the Reedy Creek Improvement District. Reedy Creek would serve as a special tax district that ultimately gave Disney World the blessing of full autonomy over the land on which the new theme park resort would be built. In essence Disney could do (almost) whatever it wanted.

The Reedy Creek independent special district was created to function as its own authority from a government standpoint allowing it to have the same authority and responsibilities as any county government. Reedy Creek could levy taxes create its own building codes maintain itself independently from the surrounding counties and it could even build its own nuclear plant–or an airport that would serve visitors who vacationed at Disney World.

The Florida legislature passed the Reedy Creek Improvement Act in 1967.

Lake Buena Vista STOLport – What’s that?

When Walt Disney bought up swampland in Florida he had already been dreaming of his airport of the future. It would serve many purposes not the least of which was offering transportation for Guests to and from Walt Disney World.

See the location of the airport at the southern tip of the Disney World development area on this map.

Walt envisioned an airport that a central monorail line would connect to an entrance plaza and a hub and to the theme park resort area which would become Disney World. The airport would be situated around and near Bay Lake.

During the time that Walt Disney World was being built that part of Central Florida wasn’t quite the size it is now but it was still in need of a new airport as the closest one to the Walt Disney World area had only one commercial airstrip and it operated out of part of McCoy Air Force Base (hence the call letters “MCO”) according to a site that features posts about the history of Walt’s “Florida Project” and E.P.C.O.T. City:

“The desire for Walt Disney World to have its own airport wasn’t as arbitrary as it might seem today. In 1971 what has now become the bustling Orlando International Airport was known as the Orlando Jetport at McCoy. The Jetport inherited an old missile hangar from the Air Force. Even after the government decommissioned the base in 1975 and transferred the entire site to the city of Orlando air travelers arriving at the newly-named Orlando International Airport were greeted by the same primitive Quonset hut terminal until more modern facilities opened in 1981.

“For a brief time in the early 1970s though it was possible for the jet-set to wing their way to the Vacation Kingdom of the World courtesy of Disney’s very own landing strip the Lake Buena Vista STOLport. This facility a private-use airport designated “DWS” by the IATA was essentially a featureless 2000-foot landing strip and taxiway.”

The Lake Buena Vista STOLport was situated to the east of the now-removed Walt Disney World Speedway and only offered services to Guests coming to vacation at Disney World. According to Disney Fandom Shawnee Airlines serviced passengers headed to Orlando International and to Tampa International. It was a tiny place but there were plans to build a full-service airport located at the Walt Disney World Resort. Those plans fell by the wayside in the 1980s however as Disney expanded its Monorail system.

Disney’s Magical Express is No More and Guests Need Better Options

Currently millions of Guests arrive at Orlando International Airport en route to Disney World but the Resort is located 20 to 25 miles from MCO meaning Guests either have had to arrange for transportation from Orlando to Disney World since the STOLport died. Because of this Disney implemented a service known as the Magical Express.

It was free to Guests staying on property at Disney World and offered transportation to and from MCO via brightly colored Mickey-inspired buses. But lots of good things have to come to an end and Disney’s Magical Express met its demise in January 2022 (probably because it was free). The end of the Magical Express left Guests to arrange other means by which to get to the parks from MCO: Mears Connect the Sunshine Flyer car rentals and rideshares like Uber and Lyft are now among Guests’ choices for getting to the parks from Orlando.

Disney World Guests Need the Convenience of an Airport on property

It’s time to develop and build an airport on Disney World property as it would serve the millions of Guests who visit the Resort every year. It would also serve as the realization of the dream of a full-service airport that once danced in the creative minds of Walt and those working closely with him–and not anywhere near the old airstrip which can still be seen from World Drive.

The “Buena Vista” name was one from Walt’s era but in light of the upcoming 100th anniversary of Disney’s inception it seems far more fitting to honor the man behind it all and formally register the airport as the Walter Elias Disney International Airport (and hopeful “WED” isn’t already in use by another airport).

No plans for the airport were discussed at the 2022 D23 Expo held in Anaheim in early September and Disney’s running out of time to make the decision to build an airport–and finish its construction. For the first time since 1967 the sands of time are running out and Disney no longer has the open-ended freedom to build the airport like it once did. There’s still a window but it’s actively closing as these words are being read.

Since the passing of the Reedy Creek Improvement Act in the late 1960s which gave Disney its own special district at Disney World the company has had the legal right to build anything from an airport to a nuclear plant within the area. (Yes we’re serious.) But when Florida lawmakers voted to repeal the Reedy Creek Improvement District during a special session in April of this year the clock began winding down on that right and on that window of opportunity. As it currently stands Reedy Creek will be dissolved effective July 1 2023 and all the special privileges that the Improvement Act afforded Disney will also be dissolved.

But perhaps all they need is a little faith trust and pixie dust to complete the project in time–and a different contractor than the one overseeing the construction of TRON Lightcycle Run at Magic Kingdom. (Who knows how long it would take that contractor to construct an airport and render it operational?) That just might be the perfect recipe for an attraction of a completely new kind at Disney World–the Walter Elias Disney International Airport–and the most impressive thing about it? The fact that Disney had it constructed and operational in only a few months!

Disney has always been in the business of making the impossible possible so the new airport wouldn’t be completely uncharted territory for the entertainment giant. And just think if Disney can pull that off Walt’s memory will be honored in a monumental way and Universal will never be able to throw shade against Disney on social media again!

Discovery said in a statement.

Last June international media companies AT&T Inc. and Discovery Inc. had announced a definitive agreement to combine WarnerMedia’s entertainment sports and news assets with Discovery’s non-fiction and international entertainment and sports businesses to create a standalone global entertainment company. Media experts said the combined entity could be a powerful competitor in the Indian web streaming segment challenging the might of incumbents like Netflix Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar if it invests enough in local content. While Warner’s streaming service HBO Max is currently unavailable in India discovery+ launched here only in 2020 and is yet to fully find its feet.

The Discovery network has said it is expanding its play beyond infotainment to genres like kids sports and entertainment programming. Starting June 2020 over 100 new shows including kids and library content from American broadcast network A+E Networks were added to the discovery+ slate. The service now covers genres like reality sports kids learning food travel and history across seven languages--English Hindi Tamil Telugu Kannada Malayalam and Bengali.

Newly minted CEO David Zaslav and his team have spared no feelings in the reckoning pulling feature films like Batgirl from release despite it already being deep into post-production. Another one of those casualties was Final Space an animated series that ran for three seasons on Adult Swim.

While the series was canceled prior to the merger it has now been taken off any streaming services. In fact once Netflix's license to stream the show in international market expires the series won't be available to be seen anywhere. Those revelations were made Saturday morning by Final Space creator Olan Rogers who released a new merchandise design poking fun at the company's decision to label the series as nothing more than a tax write-off.

It's a banner that you all have been waving and it's a rallying cry I can stand behind while I continue into this long dark night chasing an ending for this story. ARMOR UP: https://t.co/aq5Q0w5ddu pic.twitter.com/d4gH2n4itW — Olan Rogers (@OlanRogers) September 24 2022

""Five years of myy life. Three seasons of TV. Blood sweat and tears...became a tax write-off for the network who owns Final Space"" Rogers said in an impassioned tweet Saturday. ""Yup. That's it. That's why it's disappeared everywhere in the USA. Five years of work vanished. When the license is up internationally Netflix will take it down and then it will be gone forever.

Rogers' note continues by throwing his full support behind the #RenewFinalSpace fandom saying he's going to us the ""rallying cry"" to do whatever it takes to finish the story he and so many others set out to tell.

Optimizing resources in our operations and supply chain

To achieve a circular economy in fashion the challenges related to waste must be addressed at significant scale and in collaboration across the industry. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that a garbage truck of textiles is landfilled or incinerated every second somewhere in the world. It is estimated that aggregate textile waste will increase by about 57 million additional tons of waste annually by 2030. At LS&Co. we are committed to doing our part to address these challenges by reducing waste in our supply chain and our own operations; making it more convenient for consumers to change their own consumption and recycling patterns; working with the industry to solve the challenges that currently limit the scale of collection sorting and recycling technologies; and minimizing the use of plastics. This also includes our focus on developing more circular product designs that use recycled inputs and are recyclable while using recycled and recyclable packaging for our e-commerce shipments and product packaging. These and other strategies will move us closer to our vision of zero waste. In 2021 we continued this journey by developing detailed roadmaps to achieve two new zero-waste goals.

Zero Waste Goals Goal: Zero-waste-to-landfill from company-operated facilities and 50% waste diversion across strategic suppliers* Target Year: 2030 Goal: Zero-waste-to-landfill from company-operated facilities and 50% waste diversion across strategic suppliers* Target Year: 2030 Goal: Eliminate single-use plastics in consumer-facing packaging by shifting to 100% reusable recyclable or home compostable plastics Target Year: 2030 Goal: Eliminate single-use plastics in consumer-facing packaging by shifting to 100% reusable recyclable or home compostable plastics Target Year: 2030

Our Products We are working to make even more products with safe recycled and renewable inputs that contribute to circularity. This includes making sure suppliers adhere to Screened Chemistry protocols an important step in ensuring safely compostable materials at the end of our products’ useful lives. We use responsibly sourced fibers like organic cotton and responsible manmade cellulosic fibers as recognized by Canopy. We have incorporated state-of-the-art fibers made from post-consumer recycled jeans and other responsible components and we have extended some of our WellThread® design innovations to our mainline collections such as with the circular Levi’s® 501® jeans. For more about our use of recycled and renewable raw materials read Sustainable Fibers. For more about the ways we are becoming circular ready read Circular Economy.

Shrinking Care Labels and Hangtags In 2021 we reduced the width of our care labels by 25%. For care labels on our tops we switched to using recycled raw materials. Our primary supplier estimates that the smaller labels reduce related fabric waste by about 30% for bottoms and by about 70% for tops. We also reduced the size of a number of the paper hangtags on Levi’s® bottoms. As just one example moving away from our large matchbook-style tag to a much smaller tag on Levi’s® 541 jeans reduced the overall size by 62%.

Predictive Forecasting Smart Buying Most apparel companies — and we are no exception — carry more units of apparel than they end up selling to be prepared to satisfy consumer demand across a variety of styles colors and sizes. With this practice comes waste in the form of excess and obsolete inventory. Optimizing this inventory could reduce environmental impacts from production to shipping to energy use in distribution. Driving higher accuracy in our demand forecasting process by digitizing and infusing artificial intelligence predictions is a priority in addressing this opportunity. We have opportunities to use digitization for product prototyping eliminating the need to manufacture physical prototypes and samples. We will continue working toward a digitally powered organization to increase efficiency and eliminate waste wherever possible. E-Commerce and Third-Party Retail Shipping packages to our customers and receiving returned packages generates a lot of waste. From paper to polybags we are working to reduce the amount of packaging our online customers receive. Over the last two years we have collaborated with a variety of third-party retailers to reduce or eliminate the polybags used to protect our garments during transport to their distribution centers and stores. Read about how our Henderson Nevada distribution center is optimizing efficiency and reducing waste by going omnichannel. Retail Stores The LS&Co. Retail Sustainability Playbook includes operational guidelines for reducing waste generated in our retail stores. It provides guidance for reducing our environmental footprint by minimizing store waste and increasing recycling and reuse rates at all LS&Co. store locations. Among other guidance the playbook advises retail store managers to: Partner with waste haulers to ensure all waste is sent to the proper location such as a recycling center.

Ensure all waste is separated at the store level for proper recycling including cardboard boxes and polybags from shipments.

Implement a recycle or reuse program for common store items including clothes hangers display features and other recyclable materials.

Establish in-store recycling programs for customer clothing along with a local partner for proper donation or recycling of all used clothing. Pre-fabricated fitting room walls allow us to take the walls with us should we move to a new location eliminating the waste associated with disposing of the old ones and using resources to build new ones. In 2021 we began implementing this approach at our stores in India and we aim to expand use of pre-fabricated fitting room walls to other regions in 2022. All company-operated U.S. and Canadian Levi’s® retail locations and all U.S. wholesale locations use 100% post-consumer waste stock for their print materials. What’s more the newest mannequins we use are made from 100% recycled base stock that blends both post-industrial and post-consumer materials. The material has an unlimited shelf life and the mannequins themselves use a universal base which means stores will not have to discard a base because it doesn’t fit. Printed imagery is made from upcycled plastics that can be recycled again into more graphics. Other features include wallpaper made of plant-based reed fiber and cotton paper pulp applied to the walls with glue that has a potato or rice starch base. Wool rugs have been made from sustainably and humanely raised sheep the wool has been colored with natural dyes and rug backings are made of sisal a plant material. In 2021 we applied these and other innovative features to Levi’s® store upgrades including stores designed to our “indigo concept” which reflects a unique brand experience through ambient lighting an open and airy feel and sustainability attributes throughout the store and its fixtures.

Reducing Waste in Construction To improve efficiency and reduce waste in building out our retail stores we have begun using a master set of plans and specifications for construction that incorporates sustainability features from our Retail Sustainability Playbook. The set includes metadata and dashboards to make it as easy as possible for construction teams to use with the aim of minimizing change orders that are inherently inefficient and potentially wasteful. We anticipate the new plans and specs as well as a new digital collaboration platform will cut construction waste once fully implemented.

Company-Operated Factories Our manufacturing facility in Plock Poland is working toward zero waste to landfill through a waste segregation and recycling program — including a waste management and recycling campaign for employees — and collection of denim material scraps for reuse in the household industry. During 2021 an estimated 400 metric tons of fabric scraps were collected and sent for recycling or recovery. The facility has also provided employees with reusable water bottles eliminating the use of plastic cups. Our plant in Epping South Africa aims to achieve zero waste to landfill through a robust waste segregation and recycling program for paper and plastic along with denim material waste collection for reuse in the automotive industry. In 2021 the facility began repurposing some fabric waste into products for use by charitable organizations.

Eliminating Pumice Stone Waste in the Apparel Supply Chain Pumice has been used for many years in processes commonly referred to as stone washing to give denim garments a worn-in authentic look. And while pumice is natural it also creates a lot of waste both from upstream mining and from its use in factories which then ultimately ends up in landfills. In fact each pumice stone can be used just two or three times before it degrades into sand. We’ve been encouraging some of our suppliers to switch to enzyme-based softening powders and synthetic stones to reduce waste. Shifting away from pumice avoids the water pollution impacts from mining and the climate impacts associated with shipping pumice from Turkey and Indonesia the two countries that export it. Synthetic stones can be used about 3000 times before they are ultimately recycled and replaced and so they also offer cost savings to our suppliers. As of early 2022 more than 5400 metric tons of pumice stone waste have been avoided by LS&Co. suppliers who have switched to non-pumice fabric softening methods. This is equivalent to approximately half the weight of the Eiffel Tower.

Distribution Centers Our 12 company-operated distribution centers handle about 65% of our total volume globally and about 5% of our global e-commerce volume. We have opportunities to make efficiency changes that reduce waste in logistics and shipping at these locations. To gain even more control over efficiency and waste we have brought some e-commerce operations in-house including bringing our U.S. e-commerce logistics operations to our LEED Platinum-certified distribution center in Henderson Nevada. A new system in Henderson eliminates the addition of polybags and saves other plastic packaging while also reducing transportation needs — all of which will add up to environmental improvements. Our company-operated distribution centers have recycling programs that allow them to reduce waste.

Eliminating Poly Liners and Reusing Cartons Before being placed into a shipping container our garments are packed into boxes of various sizes. Different boxes are used across the world which reduces loading efficiency and leaves wasted space inside the containers. Our shipping experts continue working hard to optimize the size of boxes and match box size and durability to the product but we have not yet resolved the issue of multiple box sizes being used around the world. We have strengthened the boxes in which our products ship so they can remain intact when they reach distribution centers. This has included improving their moisture-resistant coatings to eliminate some of the polybags used by suppliers to protect our products during shipment and to eliminate the internal poly liners that used to be necessary to protect our products from humidity and wet weather. The stronger coated boxes also allow our distribution centers to reuse a majority of the cartons that come into the facilities from suppliers repack them and ship products out to large retail customers.

Eliminating Single-Use Plastics Soft plastic packaging bags or polybags and other plastics are ubiquitous in the apparel industry with an estimated 180 billion polybags produced for the industry every year and a small percentage collected for recycling. Polybags are the clear plastic bags commonly used to protect garments footwear and accessories during storage and shipping. Other forms of plastics used in the apparel industry include a range of items from small hooks clips and shirt collar supports to large shipping carton liners — which we have begun eliminating in concert with suppliers. Polyvinyl chloride or PVC has been banned from use with any LS&Co. products so all polybags used for our products are non-PVC industrially compostable or made with recycled content. Even so we are working to find ways to reduce their use in our supply chain distribution centers and stores. To meet our goal of eliminating single-use plastics in consumer-facing packaging by 2030 we are working to shift to 100% reusable recyclable or home compostable plastics. Reducing Polybags In the LS&Co. value chain our suppliers wrap light-colored t-shirts tops and bottoms in polybags to keep them clean and folded. Over the past few years we have carefully examined our polybag use practices to determine whether we can replace them with biodegradable options and use different folding techniques to minimize the need for a polybag. In 2021 we began collecting data to establish a polybag use baseline for our products associated with Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers representing the majority of our product volume. This cross-functional step is fundamental to tracking future polybag reduction progress. Once our North American e-commerce operations moved to the LS&Co. Henderson Nevada distribution center we began eliminating polybags from e-commerce shipments departing that facility. If a product arrives in a polybag it stays in one but we do not add polybags to products that arrive without one. We have begun discussions with third-party retailers about ways they can remove polybags from their e-commerce shipments of our products as well especially with products like dark blue or black jeans. In 2021 our company-operated distribution centers tested the use of paper bags instead of polybags with some WellThread® products and discovered that the paper’s brittleness made them unsuitable for use with conveyor belts so our search for sustainable polybag alternatives continues.

Pre-Packing Our Products to Eliminate Polybags Simply eliminating a polybag can cause a product to un-fold and the hangtag to tangle so we are exploring reduction alternatives like pre-packing. This would allow us to have suppliers pack a specific size range and quantity of garments into a box that does not get opened until it has reached its retail store destination. In 2021 we began collecting data to better understand how many of our products are already getting pre-packed and where the additional opportunities lie.

Rating: About this rating True

On Sept. 20 2022 a TikTok channel named @insideedition.official posted a video titled ""Garbage Truck Bursts into Flames."" The clip was viewed millions of times and showed a green garbage truck with a Waste Management logo catching on fire shortly after dumping a load of refuse. We soon found that this was a real and legitimate video with no signs of it being staged.

First the @insideedition.official TikTok channel was not the ""official"" account for the entertainment news TV show ""Inside Edition."" The real account for the program is @insideedition.

The original ""Garbage Truck Bursts into Flames"" video was uploaded on YouTube on March 31 2020:

Readers may be wondering why the person holding the camera was standing in such a perfect spot to record the garbage truck bursting into flames. The reason is simple:

The video was recorded by a YouTuber known as Curotto Can Man whose YouTube channel includes at least hundreds of videos of various types of garbage trucks in action.

In fact Curotto Can Man even created a video titled ""Garbage Trucks: The Movie"" and released it on Christmas Day in 2021.

The holiday gift to garbage truck enthusiasts was described like this:

aka 2021 a year in review. here is a clip of every single truck I filmed in 2021 about 175 trucks crazily enough. I believe this is the longest comp on yt now. this took about 4 hours to upload lol. Other than that not much to say and if you finish this in one sitting you're a G. Comment your favorite truck and stuff you would like to see and I will probably post it in January! Also first person to comment which truck they would like to see more of will get it featured on New Years! … thanks for watching and merry Christmas to all!

We reached out to Curotto Can Man to learn more details about the incident and will update this story if we receive a response.

In sum yes the ""Garbage Truck Bursts into Flames"" video was real and had no signs of being staged.

Besides its bankruptcy woes the two men involved in the daily operations of Arizona-based Wyotrans David Allen and Jeremy Louder have ties to at least three other trucking companies set up through various LLCs over the last five years.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Daniel P. Collins has set a hearing for Wednesday after claims from Wyotrans’ insurance company IPFS Corp. that it is owed nearly $84000 for its post-petition monthly payments for July and August.

In its motion IPFS seeks “authority to cancel certain insurance policies and to collect all unearned premiums” owed to the insurance company.

In court filings Penske states that Wyotrans leases and rents approximately 26 trucks and trailers and owes it more than $560000 in post-petition charges.

In its motion Penske claims Wyotrans stopped paying the leasing company’s charges on Aug. 1 while at the same time continuing to use and possess its equipment “in the operation of its business.”

After initially agreeing to return the short-term units by Sept. 15 Penske claims Wyotrans has failed to return them.

Allan NewDelman Wyotrans’ attorney said the company was forced to file for bankruptcy protection after one of the units it leased from Penske was involved in a single-vehicle accident. The towing company charged over $100000 to haul off the equipment which Penske paid but sought reimbursement of the towing bill from Wyotrans which the company didn’t have on hand.





Wyotrans doing business as National Freight Carriers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Arizona.

In its bare-bones petition the company listed its assets ranging from $100000 to $500000 and its liabilities as between $500000 and $1 million. At the time Wyotrans estimated that funds would be distributed to unsecured creditors.

Christopher C. Simpson is serving as a Chapter 11 Subchapter V trustee in the Wyotrans bankruptcy case.

“It’s a complicated case” Simpson said at the Chapter 11 status hearing in July. “It’s a very difficult business to run but we are optimistic today.”

However at the Wyotrans’ status hearing in early September Simpson said he was less optimistic.

“Part of my communication to the court … was going to be that we are going to be hitting some rough water here” Simpson said. “There does seem to be an uptick in unpaid administrative fees a significant potential uptick. There are some disputes among the parties regarding accounting. So I wanted to let the court know that my prior cautious optimism is now reverted to just caution.”

Who owns Wyotrans LLC? It’s complicated

Michelle Allen is listed as the managing member of BMA LLC which was incorporated on Dec. 3 2019 in Sheridan Wyoming. Allen signed Wyotrans’ bankruptcy petition.

The incorporation paperwork also lists Allen as the chief executive manager and her husband David Allen as the executive director.





Court filings in other cases allege David Allen places assets in the names of his wife and son Grayden Allen to avoid creditors.

Prior to entering the trucking industry Allen and Louder spent time in federal prison on fraud-related charges. Both still owe millions in restitution to victims in separate fraud schemes. No charges have been filed against Allen or Louder related to Wyotrans’ Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

David Allen 44 of Gilbert Arizona along with four of his family members who owned a boat dealership was convicted of defrauding banks out of $5.4 million in January 2012. He was sentenced to 37 months in prison followed by five years of supervised release. He was also ordered to pay more than $1.1 million in restitution since his release in June 2014.

Since that time David Allen has only paid around $12000 of the $1.1 million he owes according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office Financial Litigation Unit.

Allen’s business partner Louder 43 of Plano Texas was convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Lounder served 60 months in prison and was ordered to pay $17 million in restitution to his victims. Federal prosecutors claim Louder co-founder of Quadwealth conspired to devise a scheme to defraud investors by promising them high rates of return on real estate and securities investments.

Louder is listed as the president of MercTrucking and Mercury Holdings with the addresses being the same as BMA LLC’s in Sheridan Wyoming. Wyotrans listed that it previously operated its trucking business under the name MercTrucking in its bankruptcy filing.

Some of the equipment the trucking company leased through Penske was through GBA LLC which was formed on April 2 2020 in Sheridan Wyoming. David Allen’s son Grayden Allen is listed as the sole member and manager of GBA. According to court filings in another case Grayden Allen was only 19 years old at the time and was likely on or had just returned from an overseas missionary program with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Legal troubles

According to court documents in another case GBA LLC obtained a loan to purchase a house the family was renting in Gilbert Arizona in October 2020. The government placed a lien on the property in November as the only activity on the account was deposits from David Allen or BMA LLC.

Since August 2021 the government has been engaged in settlement discussions after David Allen wanted to refinance the property but continued to send incomplete financial statements to the government and title company.

Lani Carr widow of Gabriel Fuentes Jr filed a lawsuit alleging fraud claims against Louder and David Allen in Bexar County Texas in September 2020. Carr claims that shortly after the couple started a hotshot transportation business SLK G LLC with Louder and Allen in November 2019 Louder started funneling money from SLK’s business account to his entities including Mercury Holding according to the lawsuit.

Carr claims her signature was used without her permission by Louder to buy new equipment and that he wouldn’t provide her or Fuentes copies of the company’s profit and loss statements. Fuentes died unexpectedly on the road in April 2020. In May she alleges Louder modified the SLK operating agreement using an encrypted program that showed Louder owning 66% and Carr owning only 33%. The partnership agreement listed Carr and Fuentes as owning 50% of the business.

Disclosure: FreightWaves SONAR is listed as an unsecured creditor of Wyotrans.

The trophy home at 13 The Promontory Noosa Waters was designed by Paul Clout — the father of in-demand designer Chris Clout — two decades ago.

But its pristine condition and prime waterfront position saw it sell under the hammer for the strong price at a time when fewer properties are selling at auction.

Dowling Neylan Real Estate director Dan Neylan said the home attracted around 70 inquiries which was unusual for a property in that price range.

“I estimate the land value alone at $5.5m” Mr Neylan said.

“The majority of interest was from interstate. A lot of people thought it was reasonably priced when compared to sale prices on Noosa Sound.”

Mr Neylan said properties in the area were still attracting strong prices offmarket but not many at auction.

“The reality is there’s very limited supply and still strong demand particularly in the luxury home market” he said.

“This property occupies one of the prime locations in Noosa Waters. The house was designed by Paul Clout — albeit 20 years ago.

“It’s had three or four owners and some minor imrovements but it was showing signs it was ready for a new lease of life.”

The Brisbane buyer plans to use it as a second home — a trend becoming increasingly popular.

“Because work practices allow people to spend a lot more time here now” Mr Neylan said.

“The current owner owns multiple properties. He’ll keep one in Noosa and take up residence in Melbourne.

Noosa auctioneer Gordon McDonald said the majority of properties going to auction were being passed in and selling via negotiation afterwards.

Mr McDonald said bidding for 13 The Promontory Noosaville started at $5.5m.

In the larger of the moves Morgan Stanley on Tuesday gained from UBS a Lafayette Louisiana team led by brokers Matthew G. Doucet Kevin A. Cook Lacy Foreman Labbe and Jeffrey C. White according to registration records. Known at UBS as The A&L Wealth Group the team had managed north of $650 million in client assets according to a source familiar with their practice.

Spokespeople for Morgan Stanley and UBS declined to comment on the move. The brokers could not immediately be reached for comment.

Doucet an 11-year broker who spent his entire career with UBS ranked second on Forbes’ 2022 list of best-in-state next-gen wealth advisors. The publication said he managed $662 million in AUM with a $1 million account minimum.

Cook a 23-year industry veteran started in 1999 at Edward Jones in nearby Broussard Louisiana and joined UBS in 2011 according to his BrokerCheck.

Labbe and White also started at Jones in 2006 and 2008 and joined UBS in 2012 and 2014 according to their respective BrokerChecks. While at Jones Labbe had worked out of Abbeville Louisiana about 20 miles south of Lafayette and White had worked out of Broussard according to the database.

Their recruitment follows Morgan Stanley’s hire in late July of Robert R. Shelton a 35-year industry veteran who had been with Wells since 2012 and joined the same Lafayette office according to registration records and a source familiar with his practice. Shelton who manages roughly $180 million according to the source started in 1986 with ​​Lehman Brothers—a predecessor to Smith Barney and ultimately Morgan Stanley.

Wells Reels in Florida Team

Separately on Thursday Wells recruited a $210 million-asset Morgan Stanley team led by a 40-year industry veteran and his two sons primarily based in Fort Lauderdale according to a spokeswoman for the hiring firm.

Known as the Savarick Group at their former firm the team is led by Roy Savarick who had joined Morgan Stanley’s Smith Barney predecessor in 1994 and his sons Evan Savarick and Matthew Savarick who had spent their respective 8- and 12-year careers with Morgan Stanley according to registration records. They were joined in the move by another broker Molly Pacheco and client associate Jennifer Harley.

The team generates annual production of about $2 million and also has offices in New York City and Breckenridge Colorado according to the Wells spokeswoman. The brokers could not immediately be reached for comment.

The Savarick team had chosen Wells for its “comprehensive approach to serving the high-net-worth client segment with multiple types of lending capabilities the planning process and fiduciary platform” the Wells spokeswoman wrote in an emailed statement.

A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the move.

The team had managed “just north of $100 million” in client assets at the time of an August 2016 profile of Evan Savarick in Financial Planning.

Roy Savarick while registered with Morgan Stanley had worked out of a Florida office and a residence in Breckenridge west of Denver according to his BrokerCheck which as of Friday only shows a Fort Lauderdale office location for Wells. He had started his career in 1982 with Prudential Securities and has served clients’ families for four generations according to his BrokerCheck report and LinkedIn profile.

Both the younger Savaricks are registered out of the Florida office according to their BrokerCheck records.

Evan Savarick’s record shows a client dispute disclosure from October 2020 alleging that he had failed to follow instructions “with respect to managed accounts” going back to August 2019. The claim was settled by Morgan Stanley for $72500 of $140000 requested in order to “avoid the costs and uncertainties of litigation” and Evan was not asked to contribute according to his broker comment.

Pacheco who is registered in New York City began her career in 2018 with Morgan Stanley according to her BrokerCheck.

Both Morgan Stanley and Wells have offered recruiting deals over 300% of a broker’s trailing-12 production to top teams. Recruiters say the wirehouses are adding fuel to an overheated broker recruiting market and pushing offers by some competitors even higher.

Wells Fargo which also last month hired a J.P. Morgan Advisors duo producing $7 million has around 12300 brokers in its wealth division. Morgan Stanley no longer reports headcount as part of its quarterly earnings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vYmFuay1yZWd1bGF0aW9uLzIwMjIvY29uZ3Jlc3MtZHJpbGxzLWJhbmstYnJhc3Mtb24tYXV0aG9yaXplZC1wdXNoLXBheW1lbnRzLWZyYXVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Congress on Authorized Push Payments Fraud,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.pymnts.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /bank-regulation/2022/congress-drills-bank-brass-on-authorized-push-payments-fraud/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026742199DB0>, 'Connection to www.pymnts.com timed out.

And in a smaller package to boot.

That appears to be the idea behind the new WD Black P40 NVMe SSD drive which adds some bling to Western Digital’s “Black” line of gaming storage.

If the WD Black P40 looks somewhat familiar you’re not imagining things. The P40 shares a lot with another Western Digital gaming drive the WD Black P50 in its design.

WD Black P50 vs. WD Black D30:Which portable game drive SSD should you get? | Technobubble Tech

The similarities include the same USB 3.2 Gen2x2 interface and sequential read performance of up to 2000 MB/s (sequential write speeds for the P40 are rated up to 1950 MB/s). It also uses the same flat form factor and unique industrial look that the P50 has.

All that being said the P40 also sports some key differences.

The most obvious one is the addition of LED lighting which adds some colorful bling to your setup. This makes the P40 a perfect peripheral for PC gamers who employ LED lights on their mouse mousepad and computer whether it be a gaming laptop or desktop rig. For folks who use it with a Windows PC the P40’s lights also can be customized for added personalization.

If your interests lie in something more functional the P40 also boasts a smaller form factor than the P50. The P40 is pretty petite for a portable drive at a little over 4 inches tall and about a half-inch thick. As a result it’s even more easy to carry around than the already quite portable P50. This makes it a great option for folks who like to bring their gaming laptop with them while traveling or even desktop gamers who want less clutter on their desk.

In addition to PC gaming the P40 can also be used by console gamers thanks to its compatibtility with the PS4 PS5 Xbox One and the Xbox Series S and Series X. The P40 can be used with Mac systems as well.

As far as storage capacity the P40 comes in three flavors: 500GB 1TB and 2TB. Each P40 drive comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable as well as a USB-C to USB-A adapter allowing you to connect via the two most popular USB options.

The P40 held up quite well in nearly two months of testing. The WD Black P40 performed well when working with media such as images and videos although it might not always maintain its topline speed for an extended time when working with really large video file sizes. It also did well when used for game capture storage including several sessions that involved recording hours upon hours of video game footage. There were no failures or file corruptions and transfers were also pretty zippy.

The one caveat is that getting the most out of the P40 in terms of speed requires a device with USB 3.2 Gen2x2-compatible board.

At this point devices with USB 3.2 Gen2x2 — which is different from the rival Thunderbolt standard — are still not as common. This means most users will be limited to slower speeds like around 900 MB/s to 1000 MB/s or so. That’s still fast but not as fast as the P40’s advertised max read and write speeds. If your system happens to top out at those speeds it might be more cost-effective to go for something like the SanDisk Extreme Pro Portable SSD which is rated at 1.050 MB/s and can be bought on sale for as low as $95 for the 500GB version and has a regular price of $199 for the 2TB version. Anther option is the WD Black D30 which is rated up to 900 MB/s and saw a price drop to $79.99 for 500GB $124.99 for 1TB and $199.99 for 2TB.

Speaking of cost the P40 is also a bit pricey so that fast performance certainly comes at a cost. It’s not quite as expensive as the P50 which starts at $139.99 and goes up to $359.99 for the 2B version. In contrast the P40 starts at $119.99 and goes up to $329.99 although the $500 GB version is available for $20 off at some online retailers while the 2 TB version has been reduced to $279.99 at the Western Digital online store.

Using it for current-gen consoles such as the PS5 or Xbox Series X can also be a bit of overkill. Neither lets you play games of an external drive for example so it might be better to opt for a cheaper drive given that they can only be used for backing up games.

If your main priority is speed and you have the requisite USB 3.2 Gen2x2-compatible device however then the P40 is certainly one of the top portable external drives out there. This is especially true for PC gaming where the P40 especially excels in maintaining its zippy read speed.

The P40 also slots in nicely between the WD Black P50 and the WD Black D30. If you’re comparing these drives make sure to check out our WD Black P50 vs. WD Black D30 comparison article as well.

Black plastic and some black-painted metal are used for the case of the HP Omen. The Omen logo on the display lid is the only eye-catching spot of color. Otherwise the laptop's design has been kept simple. Straight lines with few decorations make up the exterior of the gaming notebook. Nothing has changed in the design since last year. Even the otherwise typical large openings for fans are inconspicuous here. HP manages to make the laptop look much less larger than it is thanks to Swiss edges and other optical tricks. In return it almost seems to hover above the surface.



When opened a decent keyboard with switchable RGB lighting is revealed. Above this is an interesting triangle pattern which seems to have no function at all. Otherwise a large O17 lettering catches our attention. The laptop stands securely on large rubber feet on the underside.



The display lid and base underside are made of plastic. The upper side of the notebook with the keyboard and touchpad is made of metal. A positive aspect here is that the palm rests remain cool even under heavy load. Despite its size the screen can be opened up to 150° with one hand. HP has done a good job with the hinges because the screen position remains stable even when the laptop is subject to shaking.

The Daedalus Prime subsidiary asserting Intel patents has filed suits against Samsung and TSMC; Volkswagen filed a number of IPRs against Fortress-backed Neo Wireless.

TikTok also filed IPRs against asserted patents owned by the funded Advanced Coding Technologies—which appears to be related to Leigh Rothschild’s Patent Asset Management per corporate records; and Raymond Anthony Joao in keeping with tradition has sued yet another oddly sympathetic plaintiff via one of his subsidiaries Alvao Digital LLC—FC Dallas Soccer LLC—on two patents and separately against local Dallas primary care physicians (Nextcare Primary Care Texas PLLC) in Greatgigz Solutions LLC.

Other Western District Waters Tested Tentatively: NPE ALD Social LLC [IPValuation Partners] one of two IPValuation Partners entities monetizing a handful of patents acquired from Comtech Telecommunications has filed six cases in the Western District (WD) skipping Waco and heading to Judge Fred Biery’s court in San Antonio for all six. Biery has had just a handful of cases in the past decade—few past five years until recently; but the San Antonio court and docket he helps oversee is massive. This now puts him in the top five for Western District judges for patent cases (with Bassfield IP and some other ancillary orders in a handful of other cases) with Judge Albright (obviously) leading the charge and Judge Yeakel of Austin a distant second; Judges Gillman and Pittman being the others. Most other WD Judges have either never or so seldom had a patent case as to render us all unable to make even educated guesses as to how they will handle them. The ALD stands for Aggregate Location Dynometer and the accused products are all various emergency notification services offered by defendants AT&T Alert Media Alphabet Apple Deutsche Telekom (T-Mobile) and Verkada.

The other subsidiary monetizing Comtech patents is Artax LLC; it’s unclear whether they’re related or have financial or managerial support in common. Artax for their part sued GPS company TomTom at the end of last month.

What is clear though from recent filings is that beyond a few outliers few are willing to experiment in the short-term with an uncertain assignment scheme. It seems abundantly clear (if it wasn’t already) that a whole class of entities effectively banked on being able to select Judge Albright over any other member of the federal judiciary.

IP Edge Entities Run into (and then from) Delaware Disclosure: Clear the country NPEs who have long preferred Delaware—I’m speaking primarily of the 500-600 cases filed annually by subsidiaries associated with IP Edge—have had to contend with Chief Judge Connolly’s new standing/finance disclosure order and they haven’t fared well to date. IP Edge’s common practice—to recruit an LLC “owner” generally a Texas individual of questionable relation to the patents or monetization effort often a paralegal or occasionally a family member of lawyers involved in enforcement—has raised questions from defendants and Judge Connolly himself.

IP Edge entities often run like clockwork through certain preferred firms and run on shoestring budgets—and historically despite filing literally thousands of complaints in its ten years of life (and representing most years upwards of 15% of all patent filings) IP Edge cases statistically never go to trial and more than 90% of them settle within six months prior to Markman with the vast majority settling even before an answer is due from the defendants.

IP Edge itself is run by three principals with ties to former Eric Spangenberg-run IPNav—the self-declared “King of the Patent Trolls”—and works according to their public profiles and website to help secure financing and representation and manage a vast array of LLC subsidiaries asserting patents. Recently whether by design or necessity the principals themselves—normally involved only in licensing discussions and not in any of the official documentation—have been appearing as counsel in IPRs and occasionally in district court. They appear to favor Delaware as having no apparent intent to go to trial a longer time-to-trial benefits their file-and-settle model by creating a longer window in which to engage in largely expense-free settlement negotiations.

In Delaware they have maintained since Chief Judge Connolly’s order that there are no third-party investors or interested parties with the disclosed owners generally being any of these unrelated individuals mentioned earlier and listed on the LLC formation documents. On September 12 Chief Judge Connolly ordered the principals to appear in person at evidentiary hearings to answer to those disclosures (a similar order issued in cases related to Dynamic IP Deals (DynaIP) cases. After that order the IP Edge entities quickly filed voluntary dismissals thus evading the hearing and any immediate reckoning with their disclosures.

Unrelatedly The Life is Good apparel company filed a declaratory judgment against Hitel another IP Edge subsidiary in Massachusetts this week (with some accompanying press) accusing the entity of “ bad-faith threats to assert frivolous patent infringement claims” against their website under Massachusetts’ local unfair and deceptive practices laws. In that complaint the company notes that “Hitel’s sole managing member is Annette Rathgeber who also works for a company called IP Edge LLC (“IP Edge”). IP Edge purports to be Hitel’s licensing advisor.” It details an assertion letter and repeated communications threatening litigation and notes that Hitel alone has brought more than 30 suits against similarly situated retail companies.

WD's latest addition to their Game range of external drives is the Black P40 Game Drive. It combines an NVMe PCIe Gen 3 SSD with a USB 3.2 Gen 2 x2 (20Gb/s) interface all housed inside a durable and shock-resistant enclosure which – of course – also has RGB lighting. We test the 500GB model hitting the market at £93.99.

Currently the WD Black P40 Game Drive line-up comprises just three capacities; the entry-level 500GB drive (the drive we are looking at here) 1TB and a flagship 2TB model.

Internally the drive uses a WD SN560 M.2 NVMe drive along with an ASMedia bridging controller. WD quote Sequential read performance across the drive range as up to 2000MB/s with the 1TB and 2TB models rated as up to 2000MB/s for Sequential writes while the 500GB model gets by with 1950MB/s.

The WD Black P40 Game Drive comes in a sturdy box with an image of the drive on the front along with the regular WD Black branding. Under the right-hand side of the image we see the drive’s capacity and read speed in both English and French.

The back of the box has a small image of one end of the drive the end that has the USB Type-C connector. To the left of this image is a box contents list and the drive compatibility options again in both English and French along with logos informing users of the 5-year warranty and that the SSD inside the unit uses 3D NAND.

One side panel of the box has a life-size side view of the drive.

The WD Black P40 Game Drive design follows the same look and feel of other recent WD Game devices as it looks like a mini modern-day weapons storage case the type you'll find scattered throughout any decent FPS game. WD claims the shock-resistant enclosure can survive a drop of up to two meters.

Using the CrystalDiskInfo utility we find that the drive inside the P40 is recognised by the CrystalDiskInfo utility as a WD SN560E drive details of which are very thin on the ground at the time of writing this review.

Along the top and bottom outer edges of the base of the drive are the two plastic strips that cover the LEDs for the RGB lighting feature. These strips run for around 80% of the length of the drive.

The drive uses a USB Gen 3.2 Gen 2 x2 (20Gb/s) interface.

Bundled in with the drive are USB Type-C to Type-C and a Type-C to Type-A adapter along with a Quick Install Guide.

WD’s SSD Dashboard (v3.7.2.5 supports the Black P40 Game) is one of the best and about as comprehensive an SSD management utility as you’ll likely to find. It displays information on drive temperature life remaining and a whole lot more including a live performance monitor. There isn’t any cloning utility incorporated into the dashboard but Acronis True Image WD Edition which can download from WD’s website.

One page of SSD Dashboard is dedicated to controlling the RGB lighting system which has 13 basic pattern effects with options to tinker about with the colours being used. It is also compatible with the most common motherboard RGB systems out there; MSI’s Mystic Light Sync Asus’ Aura Sync Razor Chroma RGB and Gigabyte’s RGB Fusion 2.0.

For a look at the RGB lighting see the below video:

Out of the box the P40 Game Drive is formatted in exFAT. We re-formatted the drive to NTFS so we could run some of our benchmarks.

CrystalDiskMark is a useful benchmark to measure the theoretical performance levels of hard drives and SSDs. We are using V8.

The ATTO Disk Benchmark performance measurement tool is compatible with Microsoft Windows. Measure your storage systems' performance with various transfer sizes and test lengths for reads and writes. Several options are available to customize your performance measurement including queue depth overlapped I/O and even a comparison mode with the option to run continuously.Use ATTO Disk Benchmark to test any manufacturer's RAID controllers storage controllers host adapters hard drives and SSD drives and notice that ATTO products will consistently provide the highest level of performance to your storage.

AS SSD is a great free tool designed just for benching Solid State Drives. It performs an array of sequential read and write tests as well as random read and write tests with sequential access times over a portion of the drive. AS SSD includes a sub suite of benchmarks with various file pattern algorithms but this is difficult in trying to judge accurate performance figures.

WD's official Sequential speed ratings for the 500GB version of the Black P40 Game Drive as up to 2000MB/s for reads and up to 1950MB/s for writes. We could confirm both official figures with the CrystalDiskMark 8 benchmark with the best test read result of 2081MB/s and a best write result of 1951MB/s.

In our throughput tests both read and write performance peak at the end of the test (16MB block mark). Reads peak at 1840.16MB/s while writes peak at 1874.15MB/s both figures are short of the official figures of 2000MB/s reads and 1950MB/s writes.

Although the peak read throughput result of 1840.16MB/s is a little way off the official maximum figure the 500GB WD Black P40 Game Drive is the second fastest drive we've seen to date when it comes to Sequential reads. Kingston's XS2000 drive sits in the top spot.

When it comes to Sequential writes the WD Black P40 Game Drive is the third fastest we've seen behind Seagate's FireCuda Gaming SSD and WD's own Black P50 Game Drive.

The PCMark 10 Data Drive Benchmark has been designed to test drives that are used for storing files rather than applications. You can also use this test with NAS drives USB sticks memory cards and other external storage devices.

The Data Drive Benchmark uses 3 traces running 3 passes with each trace.

Trace 1. Copying 339 JPEG files 2.37 GB in total in to the target drive (write test).

Trace 2. Making a copy of the JPEG files (read-write test).

Trace 3. Copying the JPEG files to another drive (read test)

Here we show the total bandwidth performance for each of the individual traces.

WD's Black P40 Game Drive handles the rigours of the PCMark 10 Data Drive Benchmark very well indeed. It's the second fastest USB 3.2 Gen 2 x 2 drive we've seen to date beaten only by Seagate's FireCuda Gaming SSD in the overall bandwidth figure and all three test traces.

To test the real-life performance of a drive we use a mix of folder/file types and by using the FastCopy utility (which gives a time as well as MB/s result) we record the performance of drive reading from & writing to a 256GB Samsung SSD850 PRO.

100GB data file.

60GB iso image.

60GB Steam folder – 29521 files.

50GB File folder – 28523 files.

12GB Movie folder – 24 files (mix of Blu-ray and 4K files).

10GB Photo folder – 621 files (mix of .png raw and .jpeg images).

10GB Audio folder – 1483 files (mix of mp3 and .flac files).

5GB (1.5bn pixel) photo.

BluRay movie.

In our real-life file transfer tests the WD Black P40 Game Drive averaged 379.61MB/s for the thirteen transfers when writing data was being written to the drive. The fastest write performance was the 543MB/s for the 5GB image. Reading the data back the drive averaged 417.69MB/s the fastest transfer being the 12GB Movie Folder.

To get a measure of how much faster PCIe NVMe drives are than standard SATA SSDs we use the same files but transferred to and from a 2TB Kioxia Exceria Plus drive:

Switching over to reading and writing the data to another NVMe drive saw as you might expect dramatic leaps in performance particularly when it came to reading the data from the drive

The latest drive to join WD's Black Game clan of external SSDs is the P40 which marries an NVMe Gen3 SSD with a USB Gen 2 x2 (20Gbps) interface oh and it has RGB lighting as well. The Black P40 Game line-up consists of the same lower capacities as the previous Black P50 Game; 500GB 1TB and 2TB but at launch it tops out at the 2TB capacity whereas the Black P50 has a 4TB flagship model.

Looking identical in appearance to the previous Black P50 Game drive the P40 is actually smaller and lighter than the P50 measuring 106.98 x 50.82 x 13mm and weighing in at 78.5g compared to the 118 x 65 x 14mm and 115g of the Black P50 Game.

Apart from being smaller and lighter than the previous drive the Black P40 Game has another trick up its sleeve – RGB lighting. The LEDs are housed under two very thin plastic strips on each side of the base of the enclosure which run for around three-quarters of the enclosure's length. The thirteen lighting effects are controlled via the WD SSD Dashboard management software.

Internally the drive uses one of WD's own Black SN560E M.2 NVMe SSDs which has an in-house controller and 3D TLC NAND and there is an ASMedia ASM2364 controller handing the USB 3.2 Gen2 x2 bridge. All three drives in the range have the same up to 2000MB/s read performance rating. The two largest drives in the range are rated up to 2000MB/s for writes while the 500GB drive has to make do with up to 1950MB/s.

When tested with the ATTO benchmark we couldn't hit either of those official maximum figures for the 500GB Black P40 Game (2000MB/s reads 1950MB/s writes) but got pretty close with a read result of 1930MB/s and writes at 1720MB/s. However using the CrystalDiskBench v8 benchmark we could confirm both official figures. The fastest test result of 2081MB/s came when we used the Peak Performance profile test (using compressible data). When it came to writes the best result 1951MB/s came from the default CrystalDiskBench test.

Overall WD's Black P40 Game Drive is fast performing external drive but as with all USB 3.2 Gen 2 x2 devices the trickier part of the equation is to find a device which supports the interface.

We found the 500GB WD Black P40 Game Drive SSD on the WD Digital store for £93.99 (inc VAT) HERE.

Pros

Sequential performance.

Design.

5-year warranty.

Cons

Needs a USB 3.2 Gen 2 x2 interface to get the best out of it.

KitGuru says: Another fast-performing external SSD from WD's Black Game Drive stable. Smaller in stature than the Black P50 Game Drive the Black P40 has an additional feature in the shape of RGB lighting. On the downside you need to find a USB 3.2 Gen 2 x2 supporting motherboard or add-in card to tap into its full potential.

WY,Weyerhaeuser,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS93ZXllcmhhZXVzZXItdW5pb24td29ya2VyLXN0cmlrZS1lbnRlcnMtMTF0aC1kYXktd2l0aC1uby1lbmQtaW4tc2lnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weyerhaeuser union worker strike enters 11th day with no end in sight,"With only weekly negotiations occurring so far some workers believe the timber company is trying to wait them out.

LONGVIEW Wash. (CN) — Timber giant Weyerhaeuser has found itself in hot water with unionized employees for the first time in 36 years as over 1100 union workers have walked off the job in 14 locations across Washington state and Oregon over low wage increases increased health premiums and cut vacation time.

Friday marked the 11th day of the strike and Weyerhaeuser — once described as a local family-focused company — may be waiting its workers out.

“We’re striking for better health care and of course better wages” said Alfred Hendricks a Weyerhaeuser electrician among hundreds of Longview Washington employees who have been striking outside the facility day and night since Sept. 13.

“The company's been reporting $1.9 billion in profit the past two years and we're looking just to get a small increase” Hendricks said citing Weyerhaeuser’s self-described “record net earnings” in 2021 which are actually larger than Hendricks reports. In a January press release Weyerhaeuser reported “record net earning of $2.6 billion or $3.47 per diluted share on net sales of $10.2 billion” — roughly a 226% increase from its “net earnings of $797 million on net sales of $7.5 billion for the full year of 2020.”

But despite a record-breaking year of profits Weyerhaeuser hasn't negotiated a contract with its unionized employees who range from sawmill workers and log yard scalers to mechanical loggers and log truck drivers — all of which have been working under expired contracts since May 31.

“Meanwhile they're distributing millions of dollars of dividends to their shareholders” said Hendricks who also noted Weyerhaeuser no longer provides its employees with shares of the company.

On Thursday the union bargaining team for the International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers of District W24 met with Weyerhaeuser to negotiate for the second time since declaring the strike. However the company has refused to change its “best and final” offer from Sept. 12 which offers a 5% wage increase at the expense of increased health care premiums.

“They want us to pay part of our medical premiums for our plans which we've never done” Hendricks said. “Last contract they got rid of our Nelson Trust our main health care system that we paid into. And now we're on one of the high-deductible ones that cost a little more out of pocket when we want to get treated for anything.”

Adding insult to injury employees say Weyerhaeuser’s offer cuts into their vacation days. The timber company refutes this claim and says the contract has been misportrayed to the public.

“The core of what we are offering includes competitive hourly wage increases over four years” Weyerhaeuser said in a statement. “No cuts to vacation schedules and in fact improved vacation schedules for employees with fewer than 12 years of service.”

Additionally Weyerhaeuser insists employee retirement benefits will remain intact including pension benefits for eligible employees. But as for health care premiums the company says they are not asking for anything outside of the norm for other Weyerhaeuser employees in the U.S.

“We have offered to pay 97% of the health care premium with employees responsible for only 3% to start” Weyerhaeuser said. “This amounts to about $17 per month for single employees and about $46 per month for employees with families. We believe this is more than fair and the breadth and quality of coverage available through our health care plan remains unchanged.”

Even so District W24 workers are prepared to continue striking until Weyerhaeuser offers a better deal.

“We strongly believe in what we're fighting for and we'll support all of our union members to the day that we actually can get a fair contract” chargehand Brad Treichel said. “Skilled labor is not cheap and cheap labor is not skilled.”

The union's presiding directing business representative Brandon Bryant said of the failed negotiations “We are incredibly disappointed that Weyerhaeuser was unwilling to provide a different offer to our members than the one our members have already overwhelmingly rejected.

“There seems to continue to be delays ineffectiveness and lack of urgency from this multibillion-dollar company. The company’s next availability is next Friday and we hope that Weyerhaeuser will do the right thing. Until then our members will continue to be on strike continue to stand up for themselves continue the fight against corporate greed and continue to not settle for less"" Bryant said.

Treichel believes Weyerhaeuser is trying to wait the strikers out.

“They're only losing money here in Washington and Oregon” Treichel said. “So I think that as long as they can make a little bit and keep their stock prices up that they're going to try to wait this out. Because we do have a young workforce. And everything the cost of living is really expensive now so it's really hard to be able to save up to keep your savings kind of where you can live for two three months without working. So if they can hold out for that long I think that they probably think that they're going to be forced to come back to work.”

If Treichel’s theory holds true a resolution may soon be around the corner. According to Oregon Business Weyerhaeuser shares declined 1.84% on Thursday underperforming compared to competitors Wester Fraser Timber Canfor and PotlatchDeltic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbWluZGFuZXdzLmNvbS9taW5kYXZpZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvYS1zb2pvdXJuZXJzLXZpZXctc2VwdGVtYmVyLTI0LTQ4LXllYXJzLWFnby1hbmQtdG9kYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A SOJOURNER'S VIEW: September 24 48 years ago and today,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbWluZGFuZXdzLmNvbS9taW5kYXZpZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvYS1zb2pvdXJuZXJzLXZpZXctc2VwdGVtYmVyLTI0LTQ4LXllYXJzLWFnby1hbmQtdG9kYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000026742258D90>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon meeting with industry employees and local elected officials in Wamsutter spoke about the creation of the four-state pact to pursue a regional hydrogen hub in connection with the federal 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This Western Interstate Hydrogen Hub effort known as WISHH is an example of interstate and bipartisan cooperation to advance innovative solutions for the country’s energy future.

“I really cannot think of a time in our history when the challenges have been as pronounced as they are the opportunity is as broad as it is and the chance for people here to make a difference has never been greater” said Gordon. “And really all we need is the will to get it done. We are at that apex that allows us to solve a number of these problems that our country and our world is facing.”

Williams an energy infrastructure company that handles 30 percent of the nation’s natural gas hosted the event to reinforce its commitment to operating in the state and to share its vision for the energy economy in Wyoming. Company leaders focused on the need for a comprehensive strategy that builds on the foundation of core energy sectors while supporting and investing in the growth of next generation energy sources.

“What we are seeing in the core natural gas business that we have today across all of our assets especially here in Wyoming is very exciting” said Williams Chief Operating Officer Micheal Dunn. “Now we start coupling that with the other opportunities we are looking at … renewable energy hydrogen carbon capture … we are going to take advantage of the infrastructure we already have here in place in Wyoming and use that for the benefit of these new and growing industries.”

Williams employs more than 190 people in Wyoming who support more than 4600 miles of gathering and transmission pipelines and three compressor facilities in the state. Nationwide the company operates more than 30000 miles of pipelines connecting clean energy to some of the country’s largest markets. In 2021 Williams consolidated three legacy upstream assets held by other companies to establish a contiguous footprint of over 1.2 million net acres operated by Williams’ joint venture partner Crowheart Energy.

Also in 2021 Williams was awarded a nearly $1 million grant from the Wyoming Energy Authority to complete a feasibility study to evaluate water access compatibility and asset integrity in support of clean hydrogen production and transport in the vicinity of Wamsutter and Opal. The study is being conducted in conjunction with the University of Wyoming’s School of Energy Resources (SER) and is expected to be complete in early 2023.

“We are excited about Williams not only acquiring the assets here around Wamsutter but also just in general about what Williams does” said Eugene Holubnyak SER’s director of the hydrogen energy research center. “I’m personally quite excited about the Williams team their capabilities and their technical expertise and the vision that Williams has for energy going into the future.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vYnVpbHRpbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvcmVhY2hkZXNrLXJlaW1hZ2luZXMtY29tcGFueS1naWZ0aW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More than Swag: Reachdesk Reimagines Company Gifting,"“On the count of three” Chelsea Williams joked. Her Reachdesk colleagues Snezh Terentieva and Andy Willetts each picked a small item off their desks.

Williams carries playing cards whenever she travels and more often than not a rich purple deck is found in her purse. The Reachdesk-branded deck was sent out to employees participating in a virtual casino night but their utility and sentiment has extended far beyond the event for Williams the company’s director of people operations.

“Every time I have them out” she said “it reminds me of Reachdesk and warms my heart.”

Andy Willetts held up a copy of Rad Women Worldwide. Each employee received the book as part of Reachdesk’s celebration of International Women’s Day last March but for Willetts the book was more than a tie-in to a virtual event.

“It speaks to the company’s values” the product marketing manager said. “We were named one of the UK’s best workplaces for women recently so this really represents what it’s like to work at our company.”

Snezh Terentieva a product manager held up a half-full box of candy hearts to the camera. Sent out to the team as part of a go-to-market strategy the hearts featured some relevant calls to action rather than “you’re sweet” or “cutie pie.”

“Know your audience” Terentieva said reading from one.

The message is at the center of Reachdesk’s corporate gifting proposition. The objects the three colleagues chose represented more than a token of appreciation or celebration in their workplace — each provided a reminder of how gifting can strengthen team culture recognize accomplishments and build an employer’s brand.

“Reachdesk is all about building connections and making it simple and easy to do” Terentieva said.

What they do The Reachdesk platform allows companies to deliver gifts to customers prospects clients and now employees — simply easily and conveniently. Their global marketplace offers myriad gifting options and rich analytics give insight into the power of gifting and ROI for companies. Their focus on relevant data-driven gifting extends into building a zero-waste future with no wasted budgets or items no wasteful packaging and conscientious decision-making regarding carbon emissions.

Reachdesk

Reachdesk’s original gifting use case was focused on building connections with clients across marketing sales and customer success but the team noticed at least 10 percent of use was coming from people teams to connect with current employees or potential hires.

“There wasn’t really a lot built into the product for HR teams” Terentieva said. “We could see that the original Reachdesk was functional for them but we wanted to know how we could make it better especially for companies like us who have shifted to having really distributed teams.”

Reachdesk for People was born.

While adapting to serve HR and people teams the product team focused on how they could best serve companies with distributed teams — a challenge Reachdesk knows well. Beyond their hubs in London Lisbon and New York team members log on daily from around the world.

“You don’t have the dogs in the office or the table football” Willetts said. “And although these things don’t make the culture they will offer tangible elements of it. So one of the questions that came up was ‘How do we continue to make our culture something that people are touching on a regular basis and having regular contact with?’”

Williams nodded. “To Andy’s point” she said “we’re shifting from the ‘Great Resignation’ to the ‘Great Recognition.’ The name of the game now is showing employees that you genuinely care about them and rewarding them for their hard work in a personalized way.”

For Williams and Reachdesk’s people team recognizing the value of their workforce begins before a hiring offer is even made. After the first interview candidates are sent a gift card to purchase a lunch or coffee to recognize the time spent engaging in the process which continues through to an offer letter and eventual sign-on.

“If at the end of the day they don’t end up accepting an offer with us we still gift at that moment in time because we want to build lasting relationships with people” Williams said. “Gifting to employees as part of the offboarding process is another great use case. We view our exiting employees as forever Friends of Reachdesk and we want to keep that warm-fuzzy association with our brand even if they don’t stay with us forever. And who knows they might become boomerang employees at some point down the road.”

Reachdesk for People does more than provide recognition for employees and candidates — it also gives time and space back to HR teams.

“It became a huge headache to get personalized gifts to employees around the globe as companies became more remote-first not to mention all the relocating that happened during the pandemic” Williams recalled. “For HR & People teams the reduced administrative burden and time savings the platform provides is game changing.”

“You made me remember!” Terentieva replied. “One client was packing all the onboarding t-shirts and gifts in her own house so her entire living room was taken up with all of her company swag. She was going into her living room packing boxes up and going to the post office to ship them.”

Reachdesk

The list of client stories kept unrolling: One person built a shed for company swag in her yard another worked from home but had to travel long distances to the office to package and send employee gifts and yet another client spent a full day at the post office during the holidays.

“Talking to anyone who works in HR it’s people who never have a spare second. They’re always very busy dealing and caring for people” Terentieva said. “We’re giving them their days back.”

“They get their home back” Willetts added. “Even if they become a bit less familiar with their postal worker we are taking things off their plates and enabling them to do important work. Beyond the creativity we offer in the marketplace this is one of the most popular benefits for both companies and individuals.”

Williams laughed. “I feel seen in this conversation” she said “because I have definitely been there. The unsexy part of this which is so critical for People and HR teams is the vendor consolidation. Normally you’d be working with several vendors throughout the year for different events or products Reachdesk consolidates all of that on one platform”

Human Resources Integrations For busy HR and people teams Reachdesk for People not only offers vendor consolidation but also integration with existing tools including HiBob Workday and BambooHR. By integrating with systems that are sources of accurate data Reachdesk minimizes the risk for error whether sending to the wrong address at the wrong time or missing celebrations or recognitions for staff members.

“We don’t want HR professionals to have to think about who needs to receive a gift or how their spreadsheet needs to be formatted or uploaded” said Terentieva. “By removing the headache we can focus on what really matters — building that connection and having moments of delight and belonging.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdWguZWR1L25ld3MtZXZlbnRzL3N0b3JpZXMvMjAyMi1uZXdzLWFydGljbGVzL3NlcHRlbWJlci0yMDIyLzA5MjMyMmNoYXplbi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UH System Mourns the Loss of Regent Stephen “Steve” Chazen,"Stephen I.

The U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals cleared paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams while ordering a new trial for two others Armstrong and DuPont.

The federal court found that the district court judge in the 2019 jury trial improperly expanded the scope of the state’s risk contribution theory of liability with regard to lead paint to let the jury find liability where it should not have.

Under the risk contribution theory a plaintiff does not have to prove that a specific defendant’s conduct caused his injury. Instead liability can be apportioned among the “pool of defendants” that could have caused the injury.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court in a decision in 2005 (Thomas ex rel. Gramling v. Mallett) applied the risk contribution theory of liability only to makers of a paint ingredient known as white lead carbonate; it did not extend it to paint makers that did not themselves manufacture that ingredient but used another company’s carbonate in their products.

The three manufacturing defendants argued that the risk-contribution theory applies to them only if they manufactured white lead carbonate which they did not. The court agreed:

“[T]he Wisconsin Supreme Court has made clear that such companies are liable under the risk contribution theory only in their capacity as manufacturers of white lead carbonate pigment. As a practical matter this means that a paint manufacturer cannot be liable under the risk contribution theory for selling a finished product that contains another company’s white lead carbonate. Only the manufacturer of the white lead carbonate can be liable.”

The lower court’s error requires a new trial because it “significantly expanded the scope of the defendants’ potential liability and the evidence at trial. It also deprived the defendants of the opportunity to build an appropriate defense” the 7th circuit opinion (Glenn Burton Jr. v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours) states.

Judge Amy St. Eve in the 62-page opinion for the court noted that for years the defendant paint manufacturers had litigated under the assumption that they were liable only in their capacity as pigment manufacturers. Less than six weeks before trial however the defendants learned for the first time that they were also subject to liability as manufacturers of paint products containing white lead carbonate.

“The court’s last-minute legally incorrect ruling left them scrambling to adapt their defenses to the plaintiffs’ newly enlarged theory of liability” St. Eve wrote.

The lower district trial court based its more expansive reading of Thomas on the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s use of the word “marketed.” The district court maintained that a company that sells lead-based paint is “marketing” lead pigment even if it is not “producing” it. Thus the court reasoned a paint manufacturer could be liable for selling paint containing another company’s white lead carbonate. In disagreeing with this approach the federal court called it a “strained interpretation of marketing.”

The appeals court also found that the lower court erred in allowing testimony on lead paint’s effect on IQ from a witness without questioning the reliability of the unprecedented methodology set forth by the witness.

The federal government banned lead-based paint for residential use in 1978 and Wisconsin followed suit in 1980. Even after these bans however lead-based paint remained on the walls of many homes throughout the country.

The plaintiffs in these consolidated Wisconsin cases are three young men who grew up in Milwaukee homes that had lead-based paint on the walls. They were diagnosed with lead poisoning as young children in the 1990s or early 2000s. Years later they sued several manufacturers of white lead carbonate seeking compensation for brain damage and other injuries resulting from their ingestion of lead paint particles.

After years of pretrial litigation the plaintiffs went to trial against five manufacturers of white lead carbonate. The jury found three of the manufacturers liable and awarded the plaintiffs $2 million each. The three defendants found liable were E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. SherwinWilliams Co. and Armstrong Containers. The three appealed challenging a long list of the district court’s rulings.

The appeals court concluded that Sherwin-Williams is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; Armstrong is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the strict liability claims and a new trial on the negligence claims and DuPont is entitled to a new trial on both claims."

Accurate pricing of climate risk is the first step to ensure an orderly transition.

Taking an asset-by-asset approach to company valuations provides a more meaningful view of what may happen to a company industry or country during this transition.

In the insurance business we are used to painful wake-up calls. I personally witnessed the devastation caused by Hurricane Ida in my home city of New York which caused more than 100 deaths across the country last year. It is estimated to join the top costliest hurricanes measured by insured losses along with Katrina in 2005 and Sandy in 2012.

When flood waters come close to Wall Street in one of the richest cities in the richest country in the world we know we have a perfect storm to demonstrate the need for action on climate change and secure a more resilient future for all. At Willis Towers Watson where I am CEO enabling our clients to manage climate risks and transition to a net zero economy is among our top priorities.

Policymakers already know what’s required to avoid catastrophic climate change. The 1.5°C target to limit global warming above pre-industrial levels was settled at Paris in 2015 and yet current commitments to cut emissions put us on track for 2.7°C warming according to a report from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

An orderly climate transition

Accurate pricing of climate risk is the first step to ensure an orderly transition. Wall Street and the global financial system that has funded a fossil-fuel economy must now be at the heart of the transition to a net zero and resilient economy. But accurate pricing requires transparent information. We are only just beginning to understand the financial impact that the huge social and economic transformation required to meet the 1.5°C Paris target and adapt to climate change will have on investors industries companies and countries.

Any investor today has to think about the financial implications of every major risk they're running in their investment portfolio. In our view climate transition risk i.e. climate-related changes to policy market and consumer behaviors is one of the largest risks for any investor.

Climate-related indices have proliferated in recent years. It’s a welcome trend but they are unlikely to tell you much about the financial impact of policy or market changes beyond a price on carbon or carbon exposure and they often rely on historical emissions data. Nor do they tell you much about structural shifts in consumer behavior.

We think that carbon exposure only accounts for a small proportion of climate-related financial risk and using carbon as a proxy for risk may in fact distort the real picture for investors. Metrics that are both financial and forward looking provide a higher resolution view of risk and opportunity in the transition. Taking a bottom-up asset-by-asset approach to company valuations provides a more meaningful view of what may happen to a company industry or country during a transition consistent with the goals of Paris.

This approach reduces the capital allocation to companies with the largest transition risk which reduces financial risk to investors. It facilitates the repricing of climate risks allowing capital markets to align with government policy. It also increases capital allocation to the companies that stand to gain from the climate transition and hence offers potential for improved returns. Finally it brings transparency at the company level which helps identify what companies can do to mitigate climate transition risk and be a part of the solution.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMjQvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWlsbGVubmlhbHMtcmV0aXJlbWVudC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millennials Want to Retire at 50.

Las Vegas Boulevard the epicenter of American gambling is dominated by New York landlords.

Now a big company from Las Vegas wants a bite of the Big Apple.

New York real estate heavyweight Related Companies announced recently that it’s partnering with Wynn Resorts to pursue a casino license with plans for a project in Related’s Hudson Yards development in Manhattan.

Their news release did not provide specifics on the project saying only it would be a “resort entertainment and gaming destination along the Hudson River” and that it would be near the sprawling Javits Center convention facility.

But Wynn’s venture marks a reversal of sorts from what Las Vegas has seen in recent years: New Yorkers snapping up property in Southern Nevada’s most lucrative stretch of real estate.

Of course Las Vegas has long been a destination for out-of-town developers house flippers and commercial-property landlords. (I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve written about Southern California firms buying apartment complexes here.)

But when it comes to the Strip one city in particular has emerged as the main source of buyers lately.

New York-based Vici Properties a Caesars Entertainment spinoff vastly expanded its holdings in Las Vegas when it acquired casino giant MGM Resorts International’s real estate spinoff in a $17 billion-plus deal.

As part of the buyout which closed this spring Vici acquired several MGM-operated properties along Las Vegas Boulevard including The Mirage Park MGM New York-New York Luxor and Excalibur.

Before that Vici also acquired casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s real estate on the Strip — The Venetian Palazzo and The Venetian Expo — for $4 billion in a deal that closed in February.

All told Vici now owns 660 acres of real estate along the Strip “the most economically productive street in the world” the company said this spring.

Another major landlord from New York is investment giant Blackstone whose portfolio includes Bellagio Aria and Vdara. It purchased those three for more than $8 billion combined and leased them back to MGM Resorts.

It also owns two other MGM-operated properties — Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand — in a joint venture with Vici.

Blackstone had kicked off a real estate buying spree in Southern Nevada after the economy crashed a decade or so ago and it owned and operated The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for years.

It bought the flashy hotel-casino in 2014 for $1.73 billion and sold it for $5.65 billion. The sale which closed in May marked the “most profitable single asset sale ever” for Blackstone’s real estate business the company previously said.

Meanwhile New York’s Dreamscape Companies acquired the off-Strip Rio for $516.3 million in 2019 and New York investment firm Gindi Capital after it teamed up to buy Showcase Mall several years ago purchased more property along Las Vegas Boulevard in 2019 for $172 million.

Last month Clark County commissioners approved Gindi’s plans for a new three-story retail complex spanning more than 300000 square feet on that roughly 9.5-acre site — which Gindi had acquired from Spectrum Group Management another New York firm.

Related Wynn’s casino partner in New York is no stranger to Las Vegas either. Among other ventures here it partnered on the development of World Market Center downtown’s massive furniture-showroom hall that was acquired in 2017 by (drum roll) Blackstone.

Time will tell whether other Las Vegas firms plant a flag in New York. But odds are a company there is bound to buy something here first.

A Louisiana woman has filed suit against MGM Resorts International claiming it shortchanges gamblers when they cash out slot machine vouchers at casino kiosks that don’t pay exact change.

Attorneys for Leane Scherer of New Orleans filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court’s Southern District of Mississippi and hope to make the complaint a class-action suit.

RELATED: Players let $22M in cashout tickets expire last year. Where did the money go?

Representatives of MGM had no comment on the lawsuit Friday.

Attorneys representing Scherer on Friday had no additional comment and did not say how many people they expect to join the lawsuit if it receives class-action status.

Slot machines that dispense vouchers instead of coins started to become popular in the late 1990s. With those machines players insert currency for credits to play. When a player ends play the machine dispenses a voucher with a bar code with the dollar amount won. Vouchers can either be redeemed at a kiosk the cash cage or can be reinserted into another slot machine for further play.

Ticket in-ticket out technology or TITO is an advantage to casino operators who don’t have to constantly refill their slot machines with coins.

In her complaint Scherer said kiosks at MGM’s Beau Rivage in Biloxi Mississippi dispense the cash amount rounded down to the nearest dollar and give another voucher for the change which can be redeemed at a casino cage. Putting the change on a separate voucher was a new phenomenon that began during the coronavirus pandemic due to a shortage of coins.

The complaint said MGM provides no signage at Beau Rivage explaining that players cannot receive the full amount of their winnings unless they go to the cage.

The lawsuit cited Wynn Las Vegas as an example of a casino that adequately informs players that it doesn’t pay change at its kiosks.

“For example the kiosk at the Wynn in Las Vegas bears a sticker that says ‘Machine only dispenses cash ticket will print for change. Please take ticket to the cashier to redeem.’ Defendant’s casinos were far less forthcoming” the suit says.

Under existing policies in several states winnings that are left behind by players can go back to the casino company or to a charitable cause it supports. In Nevada players have 180 days from a voucher’s issuance to claim the winnings. In New Jersey players have a year to redeem and in Pennsylvania three years. In Mississippi players have just 30 days to redeem their tickets before they are turned over to the casino.

“For the last few years defendants have essentially been keeping the change off of hundreds of thousands of gaming vouchers essentially robbing their customers a few cents at a time on millions of transactions” says the lawsuit which was filed Wednesday.

In 2012 Nevada lawmakers passed legislation directing unclaimed slot-machine winnings to the state and to the casinos. Under the law 75 percent of the abandoned funds is turned over to the Nevada Gaming Control Board which forwards the total to the state’s general fund. The remaining 25 percent can be kept by the company as gross gaming revenue.

The law was amended and as of 2021 all casino vouchers including those involving table-game play and sports wagers allow funds to be directed to the state and the casinos after 180 days.

In the 2021 fiscal year Nevada players left a total $22 million in unclaimed tickets.

PAUL — No one said a turnaround was going to be easy for Miami's men's hockey team for Chris Bergeron who took over as head coach before the 2019-20 season.

It has been some tough sledding for the RedHawks who have finished last in the eight-team NCHC each of the last two seasons. And Miami has been picked to finish last in a preseason poll of the media who cover the conference.

Bergeron went through a rebuild when he was the head coach at Bowling Green before he took over at Miami. Last season the RedHawks struggled despite having a returning All-NCHC First Team goalie in Ludvig Persson. So what will be the start to turning things around?

""(Persson) has brought a work ethic that I've seen very very little of in the last 20 years"" Bergeron said. ""The problem comes that he just takes on too much on himself. He doesn't need to be Superman.

""We need to help him. We need to play better in front of him. The other thing is he believes we should be winning and isn't OK with losing. Unfortunately — but the reality is — too many people have gotten used to losing at Miami. That's going to take a bunch of kids saying 'No more.'""

There are a lot of new faces on the roster with nine freshmen to try to take up that mantra.

""We got to campus a couple weeks early and did a golf outing trying to get to know everyone before we really get into it for the season"" Miami senior defenseman Jack Clement said. ""I'm really excited about the guys we've brought in. Looking forward to it.""

Head coach: Chris Bergeron (4th season at Miami 20-66-9 overall 14-52-6 NCHC; 13th overall 191-220-53 overall).

Last season’s record and finish: 7-27-2 overall 4-19-1 NCHC. Lost in opening round of NCHC playoffs at Denver.

Last season’s NCHC finish: 8th out of 8 teams.

NCHC preseason media poll: 8th.

Notable changes: The RedHawks lost captain and defenseman Derek Daschke — the team's leader in points (28) — to the transfer portal (he is with Minnesota Duluth this season). Forward Matt Barry who finished third on the team in points (23) graduated. Assistant coach Eric Rud left to become the head coach of the USHL's Sioux Falls Stampede.

Outlook: Ludvig Persson was an All-NCHC First Team selection as a freshman but saw his numbers slide last season under a heavy workload (32 games 37.6 shots against per game the most in the nation). Look for a bounce back season for a player known for his work ethic desire to win. The RedHawks need to help with more offense (2.6 goals-per-game 34th nationally) and a better penalty kill (74.5% 53rd).

YUM,Yum! Brands,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY29uc3VtZXJnb29kcy5jb20vbWFycy15dW0tYnJhbmRzLWdldC1jbG9zZXItY3VzdG9tZXJzLXNwYXRpYWwtYW5hbHl0aWNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mars & Yum! Brands Get Closer to Customers With Spatial Analytics,"Lisa Johnston: Hello everyone. Welcome to “ How Companies Like Mars & Yum! Use Spatial Analytics for POS Analysis & Customer Segmentation .” My name is Lisa Johnston editor-in-chief of CGT.

The way consumers live and move throughout the world are changing thanks to shifting behavior habits and the rise of hybrid work. Now what this has meant for both CPGs and retailers is that they need to reassess how their point-of-sale footprints are holding up for the new expectations.

Here at CGT and RIS we know that more companies are turning away from traditional market research data sets to alternative data sets in order to get a more accurate and holistic view of consumer insights. This includes brands that want to better understand how location impacts category performance. Today we are joined by Matt Forrest of CARTO to talk about why CPGs and retailers are using spatial analysis to understand target segments.

Matt is VP of solutions engineering at CARTO a company that focuses on creating tools that solve geospatial problems. Using advanced spatial data science techniques Matt works to find solutions to business questions by understanding the role that space and place have on companies across many industries.

To get started there are probably people here that are very familiar with spatial analytics but also some who have heard of it but aren't as aware of the benefits. Matt how would you best explain spatial analytics to someone who's completely new to the subject?

Matt Forrest: When you think about anything that happens in physical space that's generally how you would think about geospatial or spatial analytics. It can go by many names including GIS spatial analytics location intelligence or spatial data science. A good example is something that's pretty simple in concept but very complex to measure study and understand. It's a concept of trade areas.

If you have a retail location or a point-of-sale you want to understand where the patrons of that location are coming from. What you want to do is establish a trade error. This could be done traditionally with a few different methods such as drawing a simple radius around that and noting that everyone within a mile will likely come to this location.

There's an older model called the Gravity Model which relied on surveys and things of that sort defining different locations with weights competitors etc. More recently we've been using things called Drive-Time Rings — or Isochrones is the technical term. This identifies the area that could be reached within a 5- 10- 8- 15-minute drive of that location. Of course that doesn't capture every single person that goes to that location but fortunately we've been able to enhance that with new spatial data called human mobility data.

This is data that's collected from a mobile device or cell phone that shows a location and is then anonymized and aggregated. It allows you to find the most common areas that people who come to this location or have seen in that location come from.

It also provides good data to tie back to including things as simple as demographics age gender media and income; or more advanced consumer segments that can be created from that demographic data. There's a lot of other data that can be added into that but it's the combination of those data sets that's the first step in the analysis. That can tell you where things are happening but ultimately understand why. It's a combination of that data plus different spatial analysis techniques that you can use.

We'll talk about some of those today but the one I’d like to talk about is white space. We’ll break that one apart and why it’s important but also using more advanced techniques such as machine learning and predictions to understand where you should go next and what areas to avoid.

Johnston: Matt can we talk about why the retailers in the CPGs that you work with are using these types of analytics?

Forrest: We work with a combination of both retailers and CPG companies. I'll go between the two to speak to the complete audience and then if there's any specific questions we can dive into those.

The first is understanding point-of-sale exploration. That's that first step to understanding where locations are. In the CPG context you can start to understand a place or location where you’re selling a product by understanding who's coming to that location: Who are the likely customers? That tells you a very specific story about the store’s make up and groupings of individuals. It might be a younger population with more money to spend or it could be a more family-oriented market that's budget conscious.

We’re able to start to break these out into groupings of not just consumers but stores which can inform the route-to-market strategy of what products to place in what locations. Maybe you want to understand marketing dollar spend or budget in-store how to appropriately allocate that and where. That can inform everything from sales team strategy and roll out from that perspective so it gets very specific. It's really profiling your stores and end customers not necessarily the consumer itself. Of course where the consumer lives is important but where they buy is different based on where they might live work or the places they're going to when they come home.

Mobility data provides a great perspective into that. Of course you can also look into if someone's on the path home how you could possibly influence advertising or things like that. If there's a large group commuting between a suburb of Dallas and the downtown area you want to understand their likely paths back to that location. These highways are very important to inform advertising spend etc. If you are able to do different targeting for example a reminder about that or advertising is a good use case for this too. All that data can inform decisions not just where to place products but marketing sales and so forth.

From the retail perspective it’s incredibly important to understand who's going into which locations what competitors are nearby and how that’s influencing analysis around cannibalization. All of that is tied to location and the mobility data can be very granular. We've also worked with companies that do this in the new real retail context where they're doing a lot of shipping and online ordering. This allows them to easily see if they have someone that's shopping in the store and can connect that to online data.

That's really important. The last influential piece is whether you can tie a specific product purchase to a location at a date and time to understand where that person comes from. It will enable a rich picture of what products are being sold to who then tying that back to one skin the demographics and all these different components. That point-of-sale or store location is a fundamental part of all this. It gives a perspective of where you can easily filter and see what's going on categorize locations and make decisions from that. That's the first step in the process.

Johnston: When you talk about the different types of data that retailers and CPGs have when they come to you how do you work with companies to use the data that they have or get the data that they want?

Forrest: It's certainly in the best-case scenario for a retailer to have that data you just described. There was a purchase at this location for many dollars of this product — over time you can understand a granular picture of what customers want and figure out where those customers are. That gives an interesting data perspective to play with.

From a CPG side a lot of that comes from distributors. Unless you're self-distributing or doing some direct-to-consumer which is a major trend right now distributors will have some data at different levels — maybe at the point-of-sale level an aggregated view like zip code or county it varies. Sometimes you can tell from a metro area or territory coverage what's happening. Even at those higher levels you can break it down and understand what's going on from a product perspective.

Trying to break that down to the granular level is always going to be the best case — even at a territory or metro level we can get that data about consumers stores etc. to understand the broad demographics of these 10 metro areas why these product sales are picking up in those areas which stores those might be happening in and make more informed targeted choices from that.

Of course on the CPG side a lot of this is reliant on the sales team and discussing with the individual points of sale. That's an important part of this entire process — one I don't want to dismiss — because that's critical. Some of these assumptions can ground truth and help you see what’s happening where maybe you’re seeing something different and compare it. You never want to pull the human aspect out of this because it adds and informs.

If you're trying to break into a new market this can give you a base to start from to know which products are sold in which location. Then you can tie that to the individuals and everything from there. Regardless of what you have from a data perspective you can always start with who's coming to which locations and the supportive data around that. You can create those trade areas from human mobility data see the visits start to estimate the size of the store or those different factors and then all the consumer segmentation even social conversation data sets to road traffic all play into this as well.

Johnston: I'm glad you brought out the human aspect. Let’s dive into a couple case studies. We're going to talk about how your team worked with Yum! Brands and Mars. Starting with Yum! Brands can you set up the story: why did they approach you or what were the pain points they were experiencing?

Forrest: It was pretty unique. We've worked with them in a few different contexts one being international expansion. A lot of people know the playbook in certain countries and certain countries have better data to begin with than others but they know the playbook in the U.S. Once you start to translate that to new markets how do you do a store point-of-selection or QSR location strategy for Thailand or other markets? That's where we wanted to work from. It was a blank slate in a way. They had some assumptions had stores operating but needed more data to inform what's next. After starting with these locations we've worked with teams on the ground to figure it out.

The next layer goes deeper for rolling out a new brand. Starting from a perspective of where and what data can be brought in we can then predict revenue for new locations — which ones are going to be more profitable or better to invest in. That brings up the aspect of international data and comparable data sets (apple to apples) between markets which we've worked on quite a bit because customers that are successful in the U.S. want to move into another country.

We’ve built a data observatory that allows access and acquisition of different data sets in different countries. This provides a global demographic data set including human mobility data and different providers in different areas and regions that can be brought in for different countries.

It’s become a data marketplace as a beginning step to allow for an easier path to get a handle on geospatial data. The problem in the market now is that there's a lot of vendors to choose from which means a lot of evaluation of data a lot of paperwork and sales processes etc. We try to make that easier by saying “it's here and ready for you to use take a look and then go from there.” Once you begin to hit these different countries you can start to build that out — even if it's not data you need to buy or purchase. There are open data sets that are valuable to help paint an initial picture. There's great global point-of-interest data sets from a tool called Open Street Map.

There's very basic global demographics that we provide to offer estimates of population and age. We can interpolate that with satellite imagery to understand where pockets of development and built environment are. It gives a starting point to understand what's there even if you know nothing — an initial base to start from. That’s what YumStar needed a global data strategy where to go what data to acquire and what that looked like. Demographics were the first step within that. Next we layered human mobility so that the data engineering team could bring that data into their environment to work into existing models. From there they were able to identify if they roll out this type of store in this location based on what we know about a comparable market or similar location we would expect X-amount of revenue. They can compare that to what they already have in the nation and go from there. That international case was the first one.

The second one was with one of their brands trying to target white space. Effectively they had expanded that restaurant's footprint so much that they were trying to figure out in terms of revenue whether there's more profitable locations. They also rolled out a new store model which breaks the original assumptions of what they wanted to do. In many QSR or fast food cases it's reasonable to say that with a good commercial center enough car traffic and enough location to other locations or a strip mall etc. they would likely perform well. That's the dominating model for a long time.

Once you reach a certain inflection point more data is needed or if you're going to a new model as in this case it was more of a storefront in cities that was more accessible — you can't take the same assumptions of car traffic etc. data into that. We used a white space model to understand given the open areas they weren’t operating in can we simulate predictions of new locations across all those places to identify where the best ones are so that it doesn’t overlap with the existing footprint. You can control the range of that location and understand who might be operating in that region.

If there's franchisee rules or something of that manner those are important to understand then scope that to know what is a good location who might have the rights to it and go from there as well as understand the demographic footprint and predicted revenue. It’s a very granular view of what would happen if we go to this location. It encompasses a lot of new data. It's essentially the walkability including detail around left turns or proximity to highway interchanges that can be layered that may have not have been considered before to pull out what those factors are.

For that new footprint there were a few things that stand out including proximity to a large population that wants that food whether that's college campuses a downtown area or late night locations. That's what human mobility data offers: who's coming to locations with similar populations and expanding from that perspective. There are different cases that include different brands and locations both in the U.S. and abroad.

Johnston: It sounds like you're not only able to get much more granular but also leverage insights when there's no historical data available. Would you say that's fair?

Forrest: Absolutely. With the new store model there was limited data. They had some similar models but it was much farther away from the traditional set of locations. Basically they have assumptions about what these will look like and can test those in theory to see these are these populations and as they roll them out the data and models or machine learning will increase to actually drive this and what to look for in the future. As that hones in you'll have the same for these locations — demographics model mobility or trade areas add in car traffic then other features that spatial analysts may or may not know but the restaurant owners or other teams will know.

If there's a divided road it's a pain to make a left turn that's a problem in terms of a location selection issue. That's something that may decrease revenue accessibility — it's easier to make a right turn into a location or a corner location. Those are key things that you want to factor in even things like signage visibility and more are up for play. It’s a matter of using that data that exists out in the world already to start informing your strategy.

Johnston: It makes perfect sense from a user perspective. There's at least one quick service restaurant in my town that I won't go to because I can't make a left turn out of there. It's off limits. We can probably all relate. What can you tell us when it comes to Yum! about the integration process and how it helped them achieve their initial goals?

Forrest: It worked nicely because they had it in existing data infrastructure. Naturally we plug into a lot of different data infrastructures commonly data warehouses and databases work within CARTO's environment. We don't maintain our own database. We have one that customers can use if they don't have an existing data infrastructure but if they do it sits there and we put our platform on top of it. Similar to a Tableau where it plugs into the existing data infrastructure and the data warehouses and databases have these geospatial capabilities in them.

We use what's already there. It's not big on maintenance or the installation perspective. Once it's there we have two tools that allow us to run those models directly into those data warehouses for questions of site selection and white space cannibalization.

We use the existing data and then the spatial data from the data observatory sits alongside that to do the combinations of joining that data creating those trade areas so on and so forth. For retail customers there's a specific package that does that so you can do that on your own and use our models that we built. There's an application layer that sits on top of that that does this in a UI model. The site selection application gives you a very detailed view of pointing and clicking doing revenue models white space and you can run as many as you want to build that over time.

We try to make that easy to use and are working on a similar process for the CPG space as well. The integration that is one of the bigger headaches is where to put this data: Do I have to connect? How does that move about? How do I do the enrichment process? That's the painful part and if you can't do that you're stuck.

We integrated nicely and then a lot of it was hearing what people are doing today. Everyone knows a lot of the problems — as I mentioned the human factor — and the more you can understand what's going on listen to individual franchisees restaurant owners distributors or sales force in the field they're going to have a lot of great information that can start to queue in to identify important factors and capture that from a geospatial perspective. There's all these factors we can study analyze and bring in that lay a good foundation for that.

Johnston: Can you tell us about how Yum! was measuring success and any success metrics or goals that they hit?

Forrest: A lot of it was around new restaurants: How many are we building and is that revenue driving an increase? Ultimately a key performance indicator is whether these efforts show in terms of revenue. Effectively a lot of the process was driven around a handful of core assumptions and then a real estate process where there is open space and who can acquire that from that perspective.

It gave a very fast repeatable way to study sites rather than hear it seeing what's out there grabbing that and looking at it or targeting new areas to find specific sites. The revenue piece is helping them grow understand and roll out new locations as well as start to see more increased revenue to find the best locations. Those are the three KPIs: ease of use in terms of making that process easier for both franchisees as well as the corporate Yum! offices so they can better partner finding and speeding up the evaluation process then ultimately revenues.

Johnston: I’d like to move on to the next case study which is Mars. You had mentioned there's a lot of similarities between the CPGs and the retailers when it comes to using this type of technology but I imagine there are still some differences. Can you tell us why Mars came to you?

Forrest: Mars was a unique case because it wasn't so much about points-of-sale. Candy products can be sold at any physical location but to maximize brand awareness and capture profit they were interested in vending machines which are ultimately a site selection issue.

It's very specific and similar to maybe even an ATM — you can place them pretty much anywhere it doesn't take up much real estate and there's an incentive for whoever might be hosting it. Of course some locations are obvious such as transportation hubs busy districts and those types of areas. However Mars wanted to understand where the machines should be placed if they rolled out thousands of them.

These are incredibly smart tools. They can track granularly what's sold at what point in time. These are these newer smarter technologies that can even do counts of people tracking by. It's like having an IOT device plus a storefront. The amount of data that can be collected from this is crazy but you have to get very granular on top of that. If your catchment area is very specific you have to catch people at a specific time — even if you put it in a location. For example we discussed large stadiums a lot. How do you know what concourse next to what on what level? Those become questions that need answers. In this case Mars wanted to know how to roll these out repeatedly but have the granular data to see where they should be. That's where we started.

First we wanted to figure out where to place them and get specific data on that. We know some things work well like transportation hubs but where are the areas with a lot of bus stops large foot traffic when and what time is that foot traffic is that an area where people are out at night or working during the day? Naturally all of that changed during COVID. It’s a matter of understanding the new network where these things are happening.

Fortunately that data is updated monthly so we can get that specifically to see the change effect taking place. Some of those factors are what we were trying to look at. Of course foot traffic proximity high traffic locations or areas of lots of people are critical and then within a storefront which side of the street might make a big difference in terms of where you're locating that.

This provides a very specific view on these topics and can ground truth. You’re able to send someone out and determine that this side of the street is nicer might have more visibility or traffic or we can help them to identify a subway station or bus stop on this side of the street compared to the other so you might want to place it over here. It enables you to recognize that snap decision someone may make because they may or may not want to run across the street and come back or something along those lines.

That's where we started from. A lot of the data sets I mentioned — human mobility demographics — allow us to see who's coming through that area volume of road traffic and then the points of interest that matter such as storefronts offices transportation stations and more. There’s global data for that too.

It was easy to move from country to country and then predict performance based on what we know about the existing footprint. Can we predict revenue or see what's going on? Can we understand if this will perform in this way or in that way and do the same type of predictive process. It was a unique case because the choices about where to put these are infinite and you can test and revise quickly to find those areas.

The last step is taking that data using it and putting it to use. If we see that there's an area that's underperforming or overperforming how can we replicate what's working and change what's not? It's very fluid and responsive which is the fun nature of this work — you can test and revise very quickly.

Johnston: I'm going to use the overused term if it helps you stay “agile.” Can you share any examples of how Mars is using this information to pivot quickly or how they're putting it into action?

Forrest: One interesting example is the stadium case. We know stadiums have very high peaks of people coming or moving through — they're in a game or concert you have a window of a few hours to harness and you need to capture revenue from that. Ultimately where those people spill out to and where they are going is something we can study.

You're going to capture a wide demographic set from that area but understanding if there are surrounding parking lots where people are going out after that or where they are coming from is a huge pattern. Then we’re able to see if we can capture them at the location as well. Maybe as they spill out where does that correlate with all these other factors?

That case is interesting because of the data. While it's very good within the environment of a stadium it's hard to say that this device was at this level at this time. The data doesn't tell us that and that would be a little creepy if it did so. However we can see where these people are moving to and from after this event. It’s a brand presence perspective to know that these are areas they're going to or areas where they work so we can influence that from these mobility patterns and keep that awareness up. If consumers recognize that they saw that at the stadium or want to check that out they may or may not capture the purchase there but in another setting after that as well.

Johnston: Helping you connect the dots without being creepy — that's probably not a tagline but it’s definitely a benefit.

What are some of the challenges when it comes to integrating this type of technology? You had mentioned that with Yum! integration it sounds almost plug-and-play because you can work with the existing data sets and infrastructure. It's probably a similar story for Mars but there are always challenges when it comes to propelling forth this kind of advancement. What do you say to the doubters or what should companies be aware of?

Forrest: For Mars these machines are so advanced with the information that they see and it's so specific I would say the speed of the data moving through is probably some of the challenge. In a way it can tell you if there's a spike in a specific type of product or what that response would be. There's a lot you can do with that but how fast can we keep up? Mobility patterns generally aren't changing that rapidly which allows us long space views but why are we deducting change all of a sudden to understand something from that perspective. That's probably the biggest challenge pushing volume through. It’s one of the most advanced data cases we've had because there's so much we could potentially do with it.

Figuring out where to start what's going to give us the most insight from a phase one perspective and then how to roll that out into additional phases. There's almost too much to see. What’s the most important right now to help make the decisions that are right in front of us? There’s this prioritization of decision making. If there's a doubt that or you’re not seeing that initial value one of the most important pieces pulling a quote from geographer Waldo Tobler is “everything happens somewhere but closer things are more connected than far away things.""

Looking at a group of locations and what that could be within a metro right next to each other within a state there's commonalities you're going to see there. How do you leverage those commonalities to find the best product fits the best customer base to feed that into your marketing decisions and then inform those location strategies to bring that through together?

Location is always going to inform something but how do you find those commonalities as you move across geographies? For instance if there's a spike in the Buffalo New York market why is that happening what's the consistency there if we roll a new product out and how do we apply that to similar markets or similar demographic segments? All of these pieces are there but finding what those pieces are — location informs a lot of what we do.

Of course online there is a huge component that's booming which is direct-to-consumer and all these pieces are there as well. Even that data marketing and advertising can inform what we do in the real world. There's an interesting interplay that's a very new space about what the network of the web or internet is or the purchasing patterns. How that plays out in physical space and how those two are interconnected is really interesting. It's starting to be an area that people are looking at it's the next big iteration for our space: How do you connect the physical world with what's happening in the digital world?

Johnston: You mentioned the digital world this is a metaverse question: How do you use spatial analytics within the metaverse but I’m not sure we're quite there yet.

Forrest: It's early I don't know yet.

Johnston: I agree. I don't know if we're there because we are still defining what a space is probably not yet. There's not much of a difference or there's fewer differences between CPGs and retailers looking to leverage these types of analytics. We know there are some differences can you tell us about how you're seeing CPGs and retailers use this technology differently?

Forrest: For the retail space a lot of it is how to roll out new locations. There's an investment a physical footprint all these considerations and that site decision making is important because these are generally multimillion dollar decisions and investments that are going on. Investing in a location in a city in a specific area those are all things that are important. It’s bigger upfront in terms of what that looks like. That's probably the first piece that those are big critical decisions.

Even with the existing network there's an optimization question am I doing things? Am I putting the right product in these different places? One retailer we work with saw a spike in winter clothing sales in Hawaii it was very odd because it's Hawaii but it was a tourist flying in from Australia Asia and all these different locations that were spending time there and buying winter clothes to bring back.

You could pull that from mobility data or even point-of-sale data that you're bringing from the store. You can see some of these international sales and what's happening. That's one thing that is interesting. There's that initial optimization plus those big investments that you're making upfront from the CPG side. A lot of it's about optimizing your existing network of stores locations etc. A new product rollout is a good case for this because there's a ton of work in understanding and studying who might want to buy this product and where that target market is. Sometimes that could even go into a store and sit on a shelf next to all these other products and you're spending all this investment in advertising.

Making sure that for those stores you believe they're in can you do some marketing in-store? How do you position the product within the location? How do you partner with the points-of-sale that you're working with or customers to ultimately determine the ones we want to pick out and would be successful. You're building awareness for that new product in those right locations. It's an optimization piece but there's always an upfront investment that is going to look different because of the product development rollout and marketing that goes into that. Then making sure specifically you can get that product to the right people at the right location. They’re both massive investments upfront one is a real estate decision the other is more of a distribution network or route-to-market decisions.

There are similarities there but they're quite common. Of course consumer segmentation is a huge one and finding out who your consumer groups are. Finding good data that tells you the mean income age and all these demographic factors but also specifically the profile and what that looks like. This is one of the most interesting pieces about geospatial data.

We work with providers that do an excellent job of segmenting the populations into multiple different kinds of consumer groups. There's one in the U.S. that provides about 81 different consumer segment groups and 17 family groups. They can tell you what they do all the demographic factors that make up the population or consumer segment and where they like to shop. If you know where your target customer likes to spend their time and money or even their interests and then where they are and where they go to. That's a commonality across both but all that data rolls up into these models that you're using and going from there.

Johnston: What are some common misconceptions about using this type of data? What's the question that you always have to answer when you're talking with new customers?

Forrest: There's certainly skepticism on whether they need to get that granular especially in terms of demographic data and the data we report. Sometimes you know populations of counties and can get very specific. Everyone has a zip code but it's from a spatial analysis perspective the worst geometry you could work with because it has nothing to do with the patterns of spending our time or our lives. It's a geometry that tells the postal service where to deliver mail and that's common in every country. If you look at them they're wildly inconsistent — the U.S. Canada the U.K. anywhere you go — it's a terrible geometry to work with. Granularity helps and even within some zip codes you can see disparities of population that are from income where people settle and things like that.

Getting specific is important and that all rolls up from that trade area. For example do I want to assume that everyone within a five minute drive is going to come to my store and run with that or do I want to do something more specific to actually see all the block groups — which is a census designation about where these people come from — and tie that to a consumer segment. I can do that now for your top consumer segments from real data about real customers who put a foot in this location and that's probably more impactful.

That's usually one of the things that's worth covering to realize that this is a lot of data but the insights are going to give you very targeted information about how people are moving about and moving through. That’s important. There's data accuracy both understanding where you point from a CPG perspective and putting your points-of-sale on a map can sometimes be a big challenge.

Knowing and cleaning that data is complicated but new locations you might want to look at. As you move into new markets this is one of the most common things is data accuracy. There's a provider we work with that has built a great tool that verifies and calls individual locations to see if you're in business and ask questions to get rid those that traditionally hadn’t had good data. It's important to understand that this is specific to a side of the street or not and the case we saw with Mars that can be a big difference. One side of the street or the other could be lots of revenue that the company could be missing out on.

Johnston: We're making those left turns. If you could leave our audience with some last words on best practices what would you tell retail CPGs who are perhaps interested in or getting moving more deeply into spatial analytics? What would you leave them with?

Forrest: Start with a phased approach. You and your team know the problems or gaps that you want to solve — we can't tell you that. You're going to know where you're missing and where you want to go and start to audit your own data: What do you have? What's accessible? What's easy to use? If I could map anything do I have an address do I have a territory or a metro area I work with? Understanding what you have accessible is a good first step to understand what's there and then draw that back to your problem of whether you need to add more locations define that statement and what matters to that. Is it throughput? Do you need a lot of people? Is it a specific type of consumer that you want to have to start answering those questions?

You can start to map that to spatial data. That's going to tell you that demographics are more important than activity traffic is more important than consumer segments and then you can start to make those specific decisions. Once you start to add that you can build that roadmap of where we want to go eventually whether that's expanding into new territories or getting deeper on the data that's going to really help you build that vision for where you want to go.

That's my best advice. Start to understand what you have align that to your problems and your needs and then define what that looks like. That's where you start that discussion about what's going to be most important for our business.

Johnston: Well those are definitely great words to leave us with. Matt thank you so much for taking the time to join and give us a primer on this technology as well as provide these valuable use cases.

That's all the time we have for today. Once again I'd like to thank Matt for giving us this time and CARTO for sponsoring this webinar. Finally thank you to our attendees for giving us your time today. We hope you found it valuable. Have a great rest of your day.",,,,,,,,,,,,
