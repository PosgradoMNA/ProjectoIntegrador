The survey conducted from Dec. 12 to Dec. 16 and released Friday afternoon found 11.8 percent or some 3 million families saying they experienced involuntary hunger at least once in the three months prior to the survey period.

This was 1.8 points higher than the 10 percent or an estimated 2.5 million families recorded in September 2021.

Annual average hunger for 2021 meanwhile was 13.1 percent lower than the record-high 21.1 percent in 2020 but still above the 9.3 percent annual average in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hunger increased the most in Metro Manila from 14 percent in September to 22 percent in December. It went up from 6 percent to 9.7 percent in the Visayas and from 10.3 percent to 12.2 percent in Mindanao.

But hunger went down from 10.3 percent to 9.2 percent in Luzon outside Metro Manila.

The overall hunger rate is the sum of 9.2 percent (2.3 million families) who experienced moderate hunger and 2.6 percent (657000) who experienced severe hunger.

According to SWS moderate hunger refers to those who experienced hunger “only once” or “a few times” in the last three months while severe hunger refers to those who experienced it “often” or “always” during the same period.

The survey used in-person interviews of 1440 adults nationwide and had a margin of error of plus-or-minus 2.6 percent for national percentages and plus-or-minus 5.2 percent for Metro Manila the Visayas Mindanao and Luzon outside Metro Manila. —Inquirer Research

Text description provided by the architects. As Beck Family Estates’ first winery developed outside of South Africa Abbott Claim is a thoughtful expression in the built form of the rolling hills and beauty of the Yamhill-Carlton region. The project features custom elements such as a living roof a semi-circular barrel cellar and an underground wine library lit from an oculus above. Large canopies provide weather protection and screening for the crush pad and mobile bottling line.

Integration with Site. The design concept for Abbott Claim was driven by the owner’s desire to respect the existing character of the site. The design team subtly tucked the building into the hillside minimizing its visual impact while taking advantage of the ideal aging conditions offered by a below-grade barrel cellar. The team also incorporated materials reflective of the beauty of the landscape. Airfoil-shaped tilt-up panels were formed with Corten steel that was left in place as the exterior skin. Combined with integrally colored concrete these materials evoke the color of the native soil while the airfoil shape of the panels mimics the curvature of the surrounding hills. Care was also taken during construction to protect a large planting of native Willamette Valley Ponderosa Pines.

Design Features. Because the building is largely set into the hillside every opportunity was taken to introduce natural light into the interior. The airfoil panels are spaced apart to fit narrow vertical windows between each panel while clerestory glazing along the exterior fermentation room walls and in the interior office area brings light into all of the inner spaces. Similarly an oculus above the wine library brings sunlight into the core of the building.

Challenges. Throughout the process the owner challenged the design team to conceal as much of the utility piping as possible. This was no easy feat for a production facility with myriad mechanical systems and proved especially challenging during construction of the pre-cast elements which needed to incorporate all system components into individual concrete tilt panels and vault sections. The effort required intense coordination between all team members but paid off in the seamless and clean interiors. The fermentation room is largely uncluttered thanks to concealed mechanical chases on each flank of the room which are served by hidden below-slab piping. The semi-circular barrel cellar was formed with pre-cast vault sections. Additional pre-cast halfpipe elements were used to create a chase to conceal sprinkler piping and electrical conduits. As a result there are no visible conduits sprinkler pipes or plumbing within the barrel room vaults.

Resolution. Abbott Claim is an accomplishment in meeting seemingly opposing objectives: to be an efficient wine production and aging facility but also to have an understated serenity to the whole through its concealed systems. The facility’s form and materials blend with the surrounding hills while not sacrificing any quality of interior materials or natural light. Any one of these objectives could have overshadowed the others yet the building’s thoughtful siting and design strike a seamless balance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMjcvYWJib3R0LWVsZW1lbnRhcnktc3Rhci1xdWludGEtYnJ1bnNvbi1zaGFyZWQtaGVyLW9uLXBhdGgtZm9yLXN1Y2Nlc3MuaHRtbNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzAzLzI3L2FiYm90dC1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LXN0YXItcXVpbnRhLWJydW5zb24tc2hhcmVkLWhlci1vbi1wYXRoLWZvci1zdWNjZXNzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How a 'self-worth journey' put ‘Abbott Elementary’ creator Quinta Brunson on a path for success,"Quinta Brunson reached a new height of success when her new ABC sitcom ""Abbott Elementary"" broke records for the network. But before that she was a viral internet meme and YouTube personality.

Speaking to Essence magazine Brunson 31 shared that ever since she was a child she'd always been the performer of her family. ""They kind of looked at me for entertainment"" she told the publication. ""They peddled me around the house and around their friends and had me do little dances and little impersonations.""

""Abbott Elementary"" became ABC's first comedy debut to quadruple its ratings since its premiere in December 2021. Brunson said she couldn't have made it possible without going on a self-worth journey before entering the workforce. ""I really want that for more young Black women. It's a lot of stuff that's thrown at us. And if we kind of do the work to know the ins and outs of who we are it can provide a protective shield"" she told Essence.

Prior to mainstream stardom Brunson found herself at Temple University ""disgusted"" to be studying advertising she said in a recent interview with Mic. She took a leap of faith by quitting school and working at the Apple store to save up for her move to LA. Shortly after Brunson's friends urged her to post a funny skit on Instagram in 2014 which turned her into a viral sensation almost overnight. Her charisma and comedy allowed her to get a job at Buzzfeed as a producer and content creator before moving on to work on shows like ""A Black Lady Sketch Show"" and ""Magic Girl Friendship Squad"" NBC BLK reports.

""Abbott Elementary"" was born from her love for school as a child and her inspiration for teachers like her mother Norma Jean and the show's namesake Joyce Abbott who recalls Brunson's savvy as a student. ""The year Quinta was in my class we had news coverage three or four different times. Quinta would get up and speak and one of the newspapers even noted 'We entered into the classroom and we were met by the articulate Quinta Brunson'"" she told Essence.

Brunson says she created ""Abbott"" as a response to how brutal the world can be as each episode demonstrates the characters working through complex issues but reaching solutions that make the audience feel good.

""Life can be dark and horrible but what makes humans so resilient is their ability to find the light in dark situations"" Brunson told Essence. ""I think that's the only reason why we're still on this planet. It's certainly the only reason Black people are still here. Our ability to shine the light is really strong. That's really important and I wanted to be a part of providing that.""

During an interview on NBC's TODAY Brunson shared that her favorite reaction to the show is people wanting to share the experience with their families. ""Generations getting together to watch the show means a lot to me. That's exactly what I intended. I wanted families to watch the sitcom the way I did with my family growing up"" she said to hosts Hoda Kotb and Kelly Rowland.

Brunson added that her previous experiences being behind the scenes played a huge role in her preparedness for her own show.

""I was participating in acting and writing for other shows and I knew that eventually I wanted a sitcom of my own"" she shared. ""But all the stuff you do before that leads up to that point. Whether it be building relationships with other creators or networks I loved everything that I got to do leading up to Abbott and I'm still doing more.""

Abbott issues disaster declaration after Medina County fire burns over 1000 acres destroys 3 homes,"MEDINA COUNTY Texas – Gov. Greg Abbott has issued a disaster declaration for Medina County after a large wildfire has burned over 1000 acres and left some families displaced.

The flames are about 70% contained as of 10:30 a.m. Monday. No injuries have been reported and no lives have been lost.

But three homes were completely destroyed and others are significantly damaged Abbott said on Sunday. Thirty-seven homes have been saved so far.

There are currently 119 homes without power either due to fire damages to the homes or damage to the power lines the governor said. Crews are working to restore power as soon as possible.

The governor’s disaster declaration will allow for the county to have access to state resources to aid in the fire response. Abbott also said he will request a federal disaster declaration.

However in order for the governor to request the federal declaration damage assessments will need to be reported.

Residents who have been directly affected by the fire who have lost belongings or even their homes will need to report the damages online. To report damages you can visit MedinaCountyTexas.org or Damage.tdem.texas.gov.

Those who have been displaced can find temporarily shelter at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church located at 13715 Riggs Road in Helotes.

Nineteen agencies from multiple areas in the state have been responding to the fire over the course of the last four days. The fire initially began Friday and is believed to have stemmed from a vehicle fire.

At last check the city of Mico is to remain evacuated and Medina County residents who live on County Road 2615 between County Road 265 to just south of Paradise Canyon. This includes the High Mountain Ranch subdivision.

Fire officials are still urging residents to have a go-bag ready in their vehicle or by the exit of their home in case they have to evacuate.

The smoke from Medina County will be visible from San Antonio and could impact the air quality near Medina Lake Bandera Pipe Creek Boerne Comfort and Kerrville officials say.

Everyone is urged to avoid the area as firefighters continue their work to extinguish the flames and contain them.

We’ll bring more updates to this story as they become available.

Greg Abbott declares disaster for Medina County as blaze grows,"Yvonne Greene 62 was visiting her elderly parents in Mico northeast of the Medina Lake dam Saturday when she stepped outside to get some kale from an outdoor refrigerator and was alarmed to see smoke billowing nearby.

“I thought ‘That’s not just somebody barbecuing’” Greene told the San Antonio Report Sunday morning. Greene noted that while her parents Fred and Gladys Greene 88 and 89 didn’t seem alarmed by the smoke at first she was. She decided to call 911 and learned there was a voluntary evacuation underway in the area — one that later became mandatory.

“We started packing but they didn’t really want to go; they were very reluctant” Greene said.

Greene helped her parents evacuate their mobile home Saturday to Lakehills United Methodist Church on the opposite side of the lake where they listened to the service Sunday morning.

The Greenes were one of the many Medina County households that were ordered to evacuate over the past few days. As of Sunday 40 homes were still actively under mandatory evacuation orders due to a growing wildfire in the county west of San Antonio. The blaze which officials are calling the Das Goat Fire was started by a burning vehicle Friday and has burned more than 1000 acres Medina County Emergency Manager Keith Lutz said during a press conference Sunday.

As of Sunday evening the fire was 10% contained according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group’s InciWeb website. High winds contributed to its spread.

As of about 3 p.m. Sunday three homes had been lost to the fire but there had been no related injuries or casualties Lutz said. With dry conditions expected to continue over the next few days Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for Medina County at the press conference Sunday in Castroville.

In addition to Medina County state officials have declared disasters in Blanco Brown Brooks Coleman Comanche Eastland Grayson Hood Mason Potter Randall Reynolds Williamson and Starr counties due to a rapid spread of wildfires across the state Abbott said.

“This disaster declaration accelerates the capabilities for Medina County to be able to respond to this disaster and makes it available all the state resources that may be needed to respond to this” Abbott said. “It adds to the other counties for which I’ve already declared a disaster which altogether will go towards a potential request that we will be making to the federal government for a federal disaster declaration.”

About 200 firefighters from 19 agencies are “already involved in responding to this disaster” Abbott said.

Five aircraft provided by the Texas National Guard six bulldozers and three law enforcement agencies are assisting in the fight with approximately 30 personnel he added. Those agencies are the Medina County Sheriff’s Office the Texas Department of Public Safety and Texas Parks and Wildlife.

It was unknown when all families will be able to return to their homes although some were able to do so Saturday and Sunday Lutz said.

San Antonio Fire Department spokesman Joe Arrington said the SAFD had contributed five brush trucks as of Sunday morning to help contain the blaze. Arrington was unsure how far the fire was from the Bexar County line but he said local officials are watching the blaze closely.

Tearing up with worry as she listened to Abbott deliver the update Sunday afternoon from inside Rio Medina Fire Department Station 15 evacuee Sharon Tijerina said the hardest part of being away from her home was the waiting.

A resident of High Mountain Ranch in Rio Medina for 22 years Tijerina worried about her black outdoor cat Spooky who had run off as she was collecting her other pets Saturday. Tijerina is staying at a relative’s house with several friends until it’s safe for her to return home she told the San Antonio Report.

“I love where we live. We are all a tightknit community” Tijerina said. “The waiting is awful.”

Abbott issues disaster declaration as Das Goat Fire rages,"Firefighters continue to battle a large fire in Medina County just south of Lake Medina.

The Das Goat Fire began on Friday afternoon according to James Wettstaed a public information officer assigned to the fire.

""A vehicle driving down the road caught fire pulled off to the side of the road and the fire jumped into the brush” he said.

On Saturday afternoon residents — including the entire town of Mico — began to be evacuated as the fire began to grow due to windy conditions.

Several homes have been damaged. Many areas also suffered power outages from downed power lines due to the fire.

By Sunday afternoon the fire had grown to over 1000 acres with about 100 firefighters battling the blaze — along with several aircraft that were called in to help.

""Because of the level of damages that have already been sustained i'm going to be issuing a disaster declaration for Medina County” said Gov. Greg Abbott at a Sunday press conference.

Wettstaed said Monday morning that the Das Goat fire is one 50 percent contained. Officials are hoping to get the fire fully contained by midweek.

Das Goat is 70% contained according to the Texas Wildfire Incident Response Systemwebsite."

The Texas attorney general on Thursday ordered drugmakers Abbvie Inc and Endo International to turn over materials related to the sale of puberty blockers to children who believe they are transgender part of an investigation into their off-label use.The demand comes during a growing controversy over the use of medication given to halt the development of puberty and secondary sex characteristics in children as young as 8 who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria . Transgender issues and treatments have increasingly become part of a national debate in America.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has said he is investigating whether pharmaceutical companies are promoting hormone therapies such as Supprelin LA and Lupron to children and their parents without disclosing potential long-term effects.""I will not allow Big Pharma to misleadingly promote these drugs that may pose a high risk of serious physical and psychological damage to Texas children who cannot yet fathom or consent to the potential long-term effects of such use"" Paxton said in a statement. Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc manufactures and markets Supprelin LA for the treatment of children with central precocious puberty. The Company does not promote its medications for off-label uses. That said we intend to cooperate with this investigation"" a spokeswoman for Endo said.Representatives for Abbvie could not be reached for comment by Reuters on Thursday.Paxton said that the medications Supprelin LA which is manufactured by Endo and Lupron Depot made by Abbvie were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for other medical conditions but were being used to halt puberty in children with gender dysphoria.In a related development Arizona and Oklahoma on Thursday passed legislation that would ban transgender children born as boys from participating in girls' sports.Those bills were approved after Lia Thomas a transgender swimmer for the University of Pennsylvania who was born male won the women's Division 1 NCAA championship in the 500-yard freestyle race.",,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the newly identified behaviors will challenge businesses to rethink their approach to design innovation and growth as a result of the shifts in employee expectations and mindset scarcity caused by disrupted supply chains and new virtual environments such as the metaverse.

“Don’t underestimate the degree of relationship change we are seeing — or the role of business in responding to it” said Lansen Walraet Associate Director and Design Lead France & Benelux at Accenture Interactive. “The choices that businesses make next might affect our world and its structure in more ways than we can imagine and it all points to shifts in people’s relationships — with colleagues brands society places and with those they care about. There are challenging times ahead but also great opportunities for businesses to stitch together positive relationships to create a fabric of life that is good for people society and the planet.”

Fjord Trends 2022 dives into five human behaviors and trends bound to affect society culture and business:

1. Come as you are: People are fundamentally thinking differently about their sense of agency over their own lives supported by new opportunities like the side-hustle economy. The rise in individualism and independence has major implications for organizations relationships with employees and consumer-creators. Businesses should keep this in mind when defining their value proposition to attract and retain employees.

2. The end of abundance thinking?: Those who have been able to rely on the availability and convenience of the things they want are having to think again. Scarcity shortages distribution delays austerity laws and sustainability factors are driving forward the nature-positive movement and a more measured approach to consumption.

3. The next frontier: The metaverse is showing promise beyond its gaming roots to offer people and brands a new place to interact create consume and earn. Its true potential is yet to be seen but it has the makings of a new cultural evolution. Finding success here will rely on brands’ understanding of their customers in this new world.

4. This much is true: Asking questions and having them answered immediately has become part of everyday life but people are increasingly doubting the answers they get. Combined with the proliferation of channels and sources this is a design and business challenge. Those who meet it will earn trust and competitive edge.

5. Handle with care: The desire to care is a fundamentally human trait but it’s now more visible valued and openly discussed. Regardless of their connection with health organizations must now define how they embed care into their practices and offerings—for employees customers and wider society.

Following the uproar over Liberal’s move to bypass preselection in favour of PwC consultant Alex Dore in the NSW seat of Hughes Labor has followed suit with a consultant candidate of its own.

Evidently inspired by the ongoing schmozzle created by Federal Liberal’s attempt to parachute PwC consultant and Manly resident Alex Dore into the working class NSW electorate of Hughes Labor has now pulled the same stunt with Accenture managing director Andrew Charlton in the Western Sydney seat of Parramatta one of the nation’s most diverse – with predictably the same result; outrage among local branch members.

Amid NSW Liberal factional-infighting over pre-selections the party’s federal executive in January attempted to use its powers of intervention to place its preferred candidates or ‘captain’s picks’ in eight primary seats including forwarding Dore – a former Young Liberal president and the nephew of the Australian’s editor-in-chief – in Hughes.

The whole saga is now set to play out in NSW Supreme Court following backlash from within the local party.

Presently an associate director Dore has been with PwC’s management consulting division since 2015 crossing after a stint as a ministerial policy advisor to the NSW Department of Premier and Cabinet. According to his professional bio Dore focuses on advising the skills and health sectors with functional experience in strategy business case development public policy analysis project management and ironically process improvement.

Now the federal branch of Labor has kicked up a similar stink just days out from an election campaign by proposing to plonk Accenture managing director and former Rudd advisor Andrew Charlton into the multicultural seat of Parramatta a move potential local candidate and union lawyer Abha Devasia described as tone-deaf and wilfully disrespectful to the community on account of Charlton being a “white millionaire man from the Eastern suburbs.”

Charlton a regular columnist for the Sydney Morning Herald joined Accenture in 2020 upon its acquisition of his co-founded economic strategy consultancy AlphaBeta some of the proceeds of which he was reported to have shortly after put towards a $16 million property in the affluent harbourside suburb of Bellevue Hill. Last year he was promoted to the role of Sustainability Services Lead for Accenture’s Growth Markets division.

While denying reports she was interested in contesting the seat herself former state Labor candidate Charishma Kaliyanda told the ABC that it was important to consider whether the eventual pick was reflective of the diversity in the area with people from Chinese Indian and Lebanese making up one third of the electorate alone.

“What the boardrooms of Accenture need may be different to what the community of Parramatta needs” Kaliyanda contested.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbGFnYXRhcjI0LmNvbS9tYXJ3YXJpLWNvbGxlZ2UtbWJhLXN0dWRlbnRzLWdldC1wbGFjZW1lbnQtaW4taGRmYy1hbWMtc2JpLzg4NzAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marwari College MBA students get placement in HDFC AMC SBI,"SHUBHANGI SHIFA

I've had a lot of Macs over the years. I remember the old PowerPC Macs which performed OK against Intel-based PCs but did have some heat issues under heavy loads. I went along with the transition to Intel in the Mid 2000s and had a Mac Pro Intel-based machine which replaced my identical-looking PowerMac G5. That served me well for many years because it was so upgradeable but eventually that machine no longer supported the latest versions of macOS so reluctantly I bought an iMac in 2019 sporting a 3.6GHZ 8-CORE INTEL CORE I9 chip and 8GB of memory. Like many Apple computers of the last several years it wasn't really modular except for memory expansion. It was OK for photography work but not really zippy.

The problem was Apple had a big hole in its lineup. The next significant jump up was to the Mac Pro originally the awful (in my view) trashcan Mac Pro and when Apple thankfully ditched it they replaced it with another Intel-based Mac Pro (cheese grater) in 2019. That was too much money for me so I sat on the iMac hoping for better days.

Things got better with the release of laptops with the new Apple Silicon Mac Book pros. Last year I bought the 16"" model with the M1 Max chip and loved it. I kept wondering when a desktop M1 Mac would come along. I had expected a 27"" iMac but instead we got something much better: The Mac Studio. It came in two versions very fast and very fast x 2. I opted for very fast as reviewers seemed to be saying the M1 Max was more than enough for a landscape photographer. Another motivator was that I hated that my laptop was faster than my desktop and I really wanted to work on a bigger screen.

What I Bought

It was still expensive. My choice was the Studio with 64 gigs of ram I opted to spend the additional 200 bucks on a 10 core CPU system with a 32 core GPU and a 16 core neural engine. I upped the hard drive to 2 TB to match the iMac I was getting rid of.

It totaled $4798 plus tax but that included the Studio Display (more about that later).

Getting it Set Up

The 2 boxes from Apple arrived on the 18th the release day. The boxes were innovative. As I hovered over the new arrivals with a box cutter Apple had faked me out. there was a pull tab and each box opened easily with no tools. It was a very ""Apple"" experience.

With typical Apple whimsy the back of the boxes showed the back of the products. I didn't even notice that until I was moving the boxes to the garage.

I had already just sold my iMac but had done 2 Time Machine backups of it before it departed. When I plugged in the Mac Studio and the Studio Display the new Mac Studio did its usual routine with the machine asking me if I had a backup. (Parenthetically I should say I have never seen a Mac boot up so quickly. It was ready to go in a tad less than 5 seconds.) I wondered if the boot process would be longer when the Mac was fully loaded. It wasn't. The Studio was really fast on this important first trial. The Time Machine transfer took about 1 1/2 hours which was quicker than I thought it should be.

After the usual and multiple logins to iCloud I was ready to edit some photos. My usual workflow is DXO PureRAW to Photoshop a pass through Topaz Sharpen AI and then onto other specialty editors like Luminar AI when needed

DXO PureRAW is not M1 native but they've done a few tricks to speed things up. It seems about 25% faster on the Mac Studio. Photoshop was a disappointment until I realized my Time Machine backup dutifully moved an Intel version of PS to the new Mac. I uninstalled and re-installed it and the Apple Silicon version came to life. Was it fast? I'll say. From a just booted Mac Photoshop came up in around 2 seconds. Wow. Editing inside Photoshop was fast too. I had the impression effects were applied in almost real-time. I am used to waiting for a render. I use Lightroom mainly for assembling panoramas; that's really fast too. A 9 image panorama previewed in about 6 seconds (usually it took 20-30 seconds) and the actual assembly took around a minute.

I do use and like Adobe Bridge but it hasn't been upgraded to Apple Silicon yet. It's still running noticeably faster and it can build a visual catalog on a networked volume faster than it used to.

Luminar Neo and Luminar AI from Skylum are built for Apple Silicon and they are both faster than they were on my iMac. They are not as fast as my Adobe products but render time appears to be about 10-15% improved. That's probably a combination of their universal code more ram in this Mac versus my old one and the speed of the processor. I expect as the Luminar code gets tightened up it will be even faster.

The Topaz apps I use Topaz Sharpen AI are screaming fast. I use Sharpen AI the most. Using my last Mac getting a preview of the sharpen could take 30-45 seconds. Now it's about 5 seconds. Actually doing the rendering is only about 15 seconds. It used to take 1-2 minutes.

The Apple Studio Display

I'm glad I bought the monitor. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of newer monitors like HDR and local dimming but it looks fine. It appears to be about the same display that was in my 27"" iMac. The built-in speakers are OK but not quite as good as the pair of Audio Engine A 2+ mini-monitors I have on my desk. Still the Studio Display speakers sound good coming from such a thin display certainly the best speakers built into a monitor I've heard. If you have good speakers in your workspace don't use these built-in Apple speakers as an excuse to buy this monitor.

The webcam is dreadful as has been widely reported. Watching my FaceTime calls for some reason doesn't match the quality on my iPhone or iPad. The video looks like an old VHS tape. Poor resolution pasty faces. Apple has signaled that it will be improved in a firmware. I hope so.

Summing Up

Did the Mac Studio and Studio Display make me a better photographer? No not at all. However the increased speed of everything is inspiring and encourages me to try new things and techniques. I can get my work done faster and there are little things like the SD card slot upfront that are really appreciated along with all the increased ports.

I'm happy I bought the Mac Studio. I think it's long overdue from Apple but I welcome it just the same. The speed increases are obvious and as a busy photographer it seems the perfect hardware match for my workflow. It might be a bit of overkill and it's not noticeably faster than my M1 Max laptop but the larger monitor and the Thunderbolt USB A and USB C collection of ports on the computer and more ports on the Studio Display are really a big deal. Also nice is a front-facing SD card reader. Photographers will cheer.

If I was doing more video I'd think about the Ultra but I have no complaints at all about the Mac Studio that I've configured and I think most photographers would find it a solid upgrade and terrific speed enhancement to their workflow. After years and years some of my Windows user friends are jealous and asking questions.

Do you want to recycle more but get confused about what’s OK to throw away? Here’s what to keep in mind when sorting your scraps.

Recycling is important and it should be easy—but it’s not. How to handle cardboard boxes with plastic windows? What do those numbers on plastic containers even mean? Are all products with a “please recycle” logo actually recyclable? (Um no.)

Counties assume we are all sorting experts—but Hudson Valley residents are constantly playing a guessing game of what is and isn’t OK to toss causing chaos and delays at facilities. “If your local recycling center or transfer station can’t handle something there’s no point in giving it to them. It can slow down the process and will just go to a landfill” says Lalita Malik president of the Mid-Hudson chapter of the Sierra Club. Saving the planet shouldn’t be complicated so we’ve gathered a list of household items that are generally acceptable to recycle in our region.

PAPER & CARDBOARD

■ While some centers are beginning to accept plastic-lined paper disposable cups (like what you get at a coffee shop) both Ulster and Dutchess counties’ recycling authorities say no. Check with your provider.

■ Clean and dry cardboard is nearly always accepted but make sure to break down boxes first so they lay flat in your bin says national provider Waste Management (WM). Items like pizza boxes can only be accepted if there is no liner or food scraps and minimal grease.

■ Newspapers magazines flyers and printer paper can all be recycled—newspapers might need to be kept separate though depending on the rules in your town.

■ Per Angelina Brandt director of sustainability at the Ulster County Resource Recovery Agency (UCRRA) it’s generally not necessary to remove the plastic window from an envelope or pasta box. “When mixed paper is recycled it turns into a soupy pulp during processing. Since the plastic is a different material and density it can be easily removed from the solution.”

■ Shredded paper is commonly accepted in curbside programs. Some places like Westchester County might require you to place it in a paper bag first.

PLASTIC

■ You’ve probably noticed that on all plastic goods numbers 1 –7 are imprinted on the bottom. This is a resin identification code assigned depending on the material. In general almost all recycling centers accept numbers 1 and 2 (containers) but never recycle 7-grades—they’re made of mixed plastics that are difficult to repurpose.

■ PVC pipes and materials (number 3) are difficult to recycle because of their composition—leave them out of the bin.

■ According to Orange County’s recycling department loose plastic bags (number 4) and bagged recyclables should never be put into a pick-up bin—plastic bags can damage sorting machines. Instead drop off plastic bags at grocery stores where collection bins are common. (In truth you should go with reusable bags if you haven’t already done so).

■ Polypropylene containers (number 5) commonly found in the form of shampoo bottles or yogurt cups are often recyclable but because of their density double-check with your provider.

■ Polystyrene (number 6) is a toss-up—it’s best to check with your local center to see if they accept it but as of 2022 the material can’t be sold in stores or as take-out containers in the state.

■ Brandt suggests recycling by shape—bottles jugs jars and cans are highly recoverable but laundry baskets and toys aren’t even if they’re numbered 1 or 2.

GLASS

■ Rockland Green says that broken glass should never be put in the bin to avoid injuries.

■ Empty glass bottles and jars are usually recyclable. Rules vary depending on your center’s abilities; you may only be able to put brown clear and green glass in the bin.

METALS

■ Empty tin aluminum and steel cans are recyclable. In New York most beverage cans have a five-cent deposit that you can get back from a recycling machine or center per the state’s Returnable Container Act. This also applies to plastic and glass bottles that are under a gallon.

■ Empty aerosol cans are also OK but remove the cap (and make sure they’re empty).

■ Tin and aluminum foil can be recycled but must be free of food residue. UCRRA recommends that you crush these items into a ball before throwing in the bin.

At the ceremony being broadcast from Los Angeles’s Dolby Theatre Smith yelled at the comedian telling him to “keep my wife’s name out your f***ing mouth” after punching the comedian in the arm.

While presenting the award for Best Documentary Rock quipped: “Jada I love you. GI Jane 2 can’t wait to see you”

The comment prompted the Oscar-nominated actor to stand up and walk on stage causing Rock to joke: “Uh oh...”

After Smith hits Rock in the arm he walked off stage and proceeded to take his seat.

“Will Smith just smacked the s*** out of me” said Rock.

Smith is then heard yelling: “Keep my wife’s name out your f***ing mouth” to which Rock replied: “Wow... dude. It was a GI Jane joke.”

“Keep my wife’s name out your f***ing mouth” Smith yelled again.

“I’m going to...” replied Rock who appeared flustered at the interaction.

“That was the greatest night in the history of television...” he said before presenting the category nominees.

Absolutely I just tuned into the Oscars and saw this my husband and I are just sitting here with our mouth open. What in the world was that?



I would totally file a lawsuit against Will Smith today if I were him. He's a comedian my goodness! — Rosa K (@audionics2001) March 28 2022

The moment prompted several Twitter users to ask: “What just happened at the Oscars” after the livestream cut off for a brief period for audiences in the UK and India.

Many viewers also reported that the sound of the televised broadcast cut out during Smith’s outburst in order to cut the swearing.

When the livestream resumed P Diddy (real name Sean Combs) came on-stage at the “most exciting Oscars ever” and offered to mediate between Smith and Rock.

“Will and Chris we’re going to solve this – but right now we’re moving on with love” the rapper said.

Rock’s joke has been presumed to be about Jada-Pinkett’s shaved head. The actor has previously opened up about coping with a genetic hair loss condition called alopecia  first revealing her diagnosis in 2018.

The stock market hasn't been in the best of health so far in 2022 with the S&P 500 index down 5% but the correction has created an opportunity for investors to add some solid stocks to their portfolios at attractive valuations.

Apple (AAPL -0.91%) and Intel (INTC 0.63%) are two stocks investors can consider investing $5000 in for the next five years as they are on track to take advantage of some secular growth opportunities. Let's look at the reasons why these tech giants could make investors richer in the long run.

1. Apple

A $5000 investment in Apple at the beginning of 2017 was worth nearly $30000 at the end of 2021 thanks to the stock's terrific rise during this five-year period.

But the stock market sell-off has led to a 5% decline in shares of Apple so far this year. However Apple seems capable of delivering outstanding stock market returns over the next five years as well due to a few reasons.

First the company is leading the fast-growing 5G smartphone market. Strategy Analytics estimates that Apple accounted for 31% of global 5G smartphone shipments in 2021. It is worth noting that Apple's 5G smartphone shipments last year exceeded the combined shipments of the next two vendors.

Apple's dominant position in the 5G smartphone market could be a solid long-term catalyst for the company. That's because global 5G mobile subscriptions are expected to jump from 664 million in 2021 to nearly 4.4 billion by 2027 according to third-party estimates. Apple appears to be pulling the right strings to make the most of this lucrative opportunity by adding an entry-level 5G-enabled iPhone to its portfolio that could substantially boost the company's smartphone shipments.

Second Apple is reportedly working on new products such as self-driving cars and metaverse-related hardware such as mixed reality headsets. Bloomberg reported in November 2021 that Apple aims to launch a self-driving electric car by 2025 compared to the company's estimated internal timeline of five to seven years. As it turns out Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty estimates the automotive space could pave the way for Apple to double its revenue and market cap in the future.

Finally the company's services business is growing at a faster pace than its product business. The services business generated $19.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 up 24% from the prior-year period. This exceeded the 9% growth in Apple's revenue from product sales as well as the 11% year-over-year growth in the company's total revenue to $123.9 billion.

The addition of new hardware products to Apple's portfolio bodes well for the services business as the company will be able to bring more users into its ecosystem. Analysts expect the services business to clock 15% to 20% growth for the next few years due to stronger hardware penetration and new offerings. This potential growth of the services business points toward an improvement in Apple's earnings power. That's because the services business reported a gross margin of 72.4% last quarter as compared to the 38.4% margin of the products business.

Not surprisingly analysts expect Apple's earnings to grow at nearly 15% a year for the next five years as compared to just 8.4% annual growth over the last five. As such Apple could continue to be a top growth stock well into the future.

2. Intel

Intel may look like a surprising choice to invest $5000 in given that the stock has underperformed the broader market over the past five years.

However Intel stock could turn out to be a top performer over the next five years as the semiconductor giant now appears to be in turnaround mode. The launch of Intel's Alder Lake central processing unit (CPU) platform in late 2021 has started turning the tables in the company's favor against rival Advanced Micro Devices.

According to CPU benchmarking software provider PassMark Intel's share of the CPU market has increased to 65.8% in the first quarter of 2022. This points toward a turnaround in Intel's fortunes as the company's share dipped to 60.2% in the third quarter of 2021 from more than 82% in the fourth quarter of 2016.

It is also worth noting that Intel is witnessing a shift in the server market with a market share of 97% in the first quarter of 2022 up from 91.6% in the third quarter of 2021. This reversal in Intel's fortunes of late isn't surprising as the company has bridged the technology gap with rival AMD.

More importantly Intel is now intent on keeping up the pressure on its rivals by ramping up capital spending and consistently rolling out competitive platforms. For instance Intel has outlined $27 billion in capital expenditure this year up substantially from last year's outlay of $18.7 billion. More specifically Intel will spend 35% of its projected 2022 revenue as capital expenditure and it expects to maintain this level through 2024.

The company intends to ""regain process performance parity by 2024 and leadership by 2025"" according to CEO Pat Gelsinger by launching five processor platforms over the next four years. What's more Gelsinger says that Intel is on or ahead of schedule as far as the development of its upcoming process nodes is concerned which explains why the company is confident in its ability to return to double-digit revenue growth by 2025.

Chipzilla expects to clock 10% to 12% annual revenue growth from 2025 and maintain that momentum in 2026. It also anticipates a gross margin between 54% and 58% by then which points toward a nice bump over its projected 2022 gross margin of 52%.

Intel seems to be executing well as far as its turnaround is concerned. The company was able to reduce wafer costs by 30% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2021 and it also increased its substrate capacity by a record margin.

As such it won't be shocking to see Intel become a solid tech investment in the long run. So investors should consider buying it right away as it is trading at less than 10 times trailing earnings as compared to the Nasdaq-100's price-to-earnings ratio of 33.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9qZXNzaWNhLWNoYXN0YWluLWxvb2tzLWlybC1wcmluY2Vzcy0yMjM2MTI0NDguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jessica Chastain Looks Like An IRL Princess At The 2022 Oscars — See The Jaw-Dropping Photos!,"The time has finally come when the red carpet has rolled out and the Oscar nominees are showing the world their most outstanding lavish ensembles yet.

Now many find themselves searching every tuxedo lapel for a brooch. It’s not there? Did he forget? It seems almost unfinished.

Men and jewelry have a long history—think of all those royal portraits think of the Pope!—but after falling out of favor for almost a century jewels have once again become part of a man’s black tie wardrobe. Sometime it’s a lapel pin sometimes a necklace worn tightly against the collar of a dress shirt. There are earrings rings stacked bracelets. And yes watches too.

Tonight it was Will Smith and his Cartier brooch that caught the jewelry world’s attention. Partly because at first we couldn’t tell what it was. There was something glittering against his tie. Was it a brooch? A tie pin? It was the best kind of jewelry statement strong and subtle at the same time. Texts were sent. Images zoomed in on. Emails delivered. It was an earring.

According to Jake Weingartern of Stockrisers North Carolina is among a handful of teams that has reached out to Illinois State guard Antonio Reeves recently. The Chicago native has entered the transfer portal and is drawing some interest early on from programs.

Illinois State transfer Antonio Reeves has heard from Duke Texas Tech BYU Memphis Xavier Alabama DePaul Oklahoma Arizona State Kentucky North Carolina Ohio State and Wisconsin he told @Stockrisers. Averaged 20.1 points 3.4 boards and 1.2 steals per game. — Jake (@jakeweingarten) March 27 2022

The junior guard averaged 20.1 points 3.4 rebounds and 1.2 steals per game for the Redbirds this past season. He committed to Illinois State over programs like Chicago State Northern Illinois and Detroit among a few others.

But UNC does have some competition in the portal. Teams like Duke Memphis Wisconsin Ohio State Texas Tech Alabama and Oklahoma among others have reached out.

UNC’s season is still alive and there’s a LONG ways to go before everything is finalized with the roster. However it’s very likely Caleb Love tests the NBA Draft waters at a minimum and even with R.J. Davis likely back and Simeon Wilcher coming in UNC needs depth.

( ) – Chemotherapy radiation and anti-nausea treatments. They can be painful for cancer patients.

A woman in West Palm Beach apparently went through that but then submitted dozens of claims for payment to American Family Life Assurance Company and got paid more than $37000 but authorities say she submitted forged medical treatment and progress notes.

According to the report from the Florida Department of Financial Services Pilar Garcia was known as Marcela del Pilar Ortiz Leal and in June 2017 she took out a cancer insurance policy with Aflac.

SEE ALSO:

Then around October she was diagnosed with breast cancer and began treatments.

Between January and November 2018 she filed 13 claims for valid cancer-related treatments.

After that she went four months without filing any claims.

The report from the state says that from March 2019 through Sept. 2021 Garcia filed 63 claims with Aflac for cancer-related treatments that supposedly happened at two facilities both located at Good Samaritan Medical Center.

Garcia’s legal trouble began in Dec. 2020. That’s when an Aflac special investigator reported her name appeared on a list of policyholders who were potentially involved in an “Excessive Radiation Treatment” scheme.

That meant her account was flagged for a review of her claims and the special investigator verified those 63 claims were fraudulent.

SEE ALSO:

On Oct. 27 2021 the special investigator sent a letter of restitution asking Garcia to pay back the $37775 paid to her inappropriately.

On the same day she referred the case to the state’s Division of Investigative and Forensic Services Bureau of Insurance Fraud.

A detective from that agency got the case and Aflac’s claim documents less than three months ago in November.

In his report he wrote the first bad claim made March 5 2019

appeared to have dates that were altered by handwriting an additional ‘1’ in front of the date 1/9/2018 throughout the document to make it 11/9/2018. It should be noted that this investigation determined that Ms. Garcia did have a valid treatment on 1/9/2018 but not on 11/9/2018.

The detective wrote the next three claims were submitted the same month “and had handwritten alterations to the dates.”

He continued ""Pilar Garcia’s next several claims had typed numerals in the dates but appear to have been altered using a copy-and-paste method. One can see the misalignment of dates and times as well as different font sizes.”

Starting with a claim submitted in Aug. 2019 “Ms. Garcia appears to have altered the heading of the treatment notes entirely so that the alterations are not as apparent. However when comparing Ms. Garcia's valid records with her forged records one will notice that the header on the valid records is italicized while the header on the forged records is not. The remainder of Pilar Garcia's claims have the non-italicized typed header.”

In Dec. 2021 the detective used Aflac records to confirm Garcia's bank account number and found the dates of payment corresponded with the dates of her claims.

In January he and another detective visited one cancer facility and wrote he “was able to verify Pilar Garcia aka Marcela Ortiz Leal did not receive any chemotherapy or anti-nausea treatments” there on Nov. 9 2018 or after. She’d received treatments before then but her only office visits after “were for blood work or doctor's consultations not for chemotherapy or anti-nausea treatments as stated in Ms. Garcia's claims.”

SEE ALSO:

Then the lead detective went to the other facility and verified Garcia “did not receive any radiation treatments at any point on or after Jan. 1 2019. Ms. Garcia’s last radiation treatment was sometime in 2018. However Ms. Garcia filed three claims with Aflac for radiation treatments that she claimed happened in 2019 or later.”

Finally just over a month ago — on Feb. 17 2022 — two detectives met Garcia at a Dunkin' Donuts in West Palm Beach. According to paperwork filed Garcia told them “she could not remember the exact dates but she admitted to submitting several claims on her cancer policy. Ms. Garcia then admitted that she had stopped treatments some time ago but she could not remember the dates. Ms. Garcia began crying and insisting that she was not a bad person. She also expressed some concern about talking to us and I told her again that the decision whether or not to talk to us was ultimately hers to make. Ms. Garcia explained that she did not want to look bad by not talking to us but she also did not want to hurt herself by talking to us. After some discussion she decided to continue talking to us. At that point Ms. Garcia admitted that although she could not remember the exact dates the last several claims she submitted to Aflac were false. I then showed Ms. Garcia the altered claim documents and she admitted she altered them. ... She admitted she added the handwritten ‘1’ before the dates.... Ms. Garcia admitted to altering the header as well and agreed that the altered header format was what she used to submit the rest of her fraudulent claims.”

The detective added she said she changed her name because her ex-husband wanted her to and he said she “confirmed that the Marcela Ortiz Leal from her claims was in fact herself.”

He found Garcia “engaged in a systematic ongoing course of conduct with the intent to defraud Aflac over a period of approximately two and a half years.”

She's charged with fraud-swindle to obtain property between $20000 and $50000 and is out of jail on bond.

Fraser also thanked his wife Jodie and kids for “allowing a middle-aged man to go out and play with his friends in the sand dunes for six months.”

More from The Hollywood Reporter

Fraser was previously nominated for an Oscar in 2016 for Garth Davis’ Lion. He’s set to reteam with Villeneuve on Dune: Part Two which is in preproduction. Backstage at the Oscars Graig talked about the sequel. “I can’t give you any scoops…. .but Part Two is a bigger story. I read the script and I was more blown away than Part One.”

Earlier this month Fraser also picked up the BAFTA and American Society of Cinematographers Award for his work on Dune.

At the Oscars he topped a field that included Bruno Delbonnel for The Tragedy of Macbeth Janusz Kaminski for West Side Story Dan Laustsen for Nightmare Alley and Ari Wegner for The Power of the Dog.

Thailand has always been one of the most popular destinations for Indians and the Thai Government’s recent lifting of pre-travel testing is great news for both Indian travellers and Thai tourism.

It’s as suburban a scene as the city gets. It was a completely different scene when gunshots rang out around 3 a.m. last Saturday morning. Police say a teenager was shot while on his way to a party.



“Guns started being pulled out and 20 plus shots enough is enough” said Stephen Markowski a Bayside resident. What You Need To Know Bayside Queens residents are calling for action after an early-morning shooting outside of a troubled foreclosed home on a quiet street



Residents say once the home went into foreclosure squatters move in



The house has also been listed on Airbnb



Airbnb says the company takes this very seriously and has suspended and cancelled reservations at the property pending a thorough investigation



“We said 'watch it’s probably squatters renting it out on Airbnb.' Sure enough we go on Airbnb. There it is the house” said Markowski.



An Airbnb listing that has been taken down advertised “keep it simple at this peaceful and centrally-located place.”



“The squatters have been creative and they create new accounts and they continue to pop back up. So we've been in contact with Airbnb to take a more proactive approach to making sure that these listings don't pop up again” said Sen. Edward Braunstein who represents the area.



An Airbnb spokesperson tells NY1 the company takes this very seriously and has suspended the listing and canceled reservations at the property pending a thorough investigation. Sen. John Liu says now the city needs to step in.



“Specifically the Department of Buildings to go take a look at what’s happening at this house. And issue a vacate order get these people out” said Liu.



A Department of Buildings spokesperson tells NY1 the agency does not issue vacate orders just because something at the property is illegal or because of landlord-tenant disputes that should be adjudicated in Housing Court. He added DOB inspectors will be routed to the building in the coming days to investigate recent 311 complaints about work done without permits.



As for the home’s former owner John Carollo he says he signed all of his rights away when the home went into foreclosure in 2018.



""This is long before the squatters took possession of this home. Okay. Can't do anything about it. My hands are tied” said Carollo.



The CEO of American Mortgage IP which currently holds the title for the house says the house is set to go to auction in June. He says the situation in Bayside is an example of a large endemic problem in New York — how long it takes to foreclose on a property.

These flaws have been observed in real cyberattacks against organizations so they are published to raise awareness to system administrations and serve as official advisories for applying the corresponding security updates.

In this case CISA gives federal agencies until April 15 2022 to patch the listed vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of falling victim to cyberattacks.

A massive 66 vulnerabilities

The new set of 66 actively exploited vulnerabilities published by CISA spans disclosure dates between 2005 and 2022 covering a broad spectrum of software and hardware types and versions.

The Mitel CVE-2022-26143 and Windows CVE-2022-21999 vulnerabilities disclosed in February are two particularly interesting bugs.

Microsoft fixed the CVE-2022-21999 Windows Print Spooler bug in the February 2022 Patch Tuesday updates and threat actors had not actively exploited it at the time. The vulnerability allows attackers to achieve code execution as SYSTEM the highest Windows privileges when exploited.

The Mitel CVE-2022-26143 bug affects devices using a vulnerable driver (TP-240) including MiVoice Business Express and MiCollab.

This flaw allows a record-breaking DDoS amplification ratio of about 4.3 billion to 1 using a method of internal reflection.

Akamai the company that discovered the Mitel bug has already reported attacks in the wild beginning last February targeting governments financial institutions and internet service providers.

Additionally the set contains a 2005 RCE flaw on Hewlett Packard OpenView a 2009 buffer overflow on Adobe Reader and Acrobat a 2009 RCE on phpMyAdmin and another 23 flaws dating between 2010 and 2016.

The addition of these 66 vulnerabilities at this time doesn’t necessarily mean that CISA’s analysts just spotted their active exploitation in the wild.

Quite possibly the agency is publishing new sets with intervals between them to not overwhelm system administrators striving for a balance between practical constraints and best security practices.

Another possible explanation for the addition of such old vulnerabilities in the catalog could be that they’re leveraged in new exploit chains that are applicable today suddenly transcending from obsolescence to relevance.

However the list shows us how quickly threat actors begin targeting a vulnerability once a vendor discloses it.

For example the Windows Print Spooler CVE-2022-21999 vulnerability the Mitel DDoS CVE-2022-26143 amplification vulnerability and the CVE-2022-26318 WatchGuard vulnerabilities were disclosed in February and were quickly exploited by threat actors.

Due to this it is critical for admins to apply security updates as soon as possible to prevent their exploitation especially on internet-exposed devices.

Due to the large number of flaws comprising the latest set CISA hasn’t supplied the usual summary table so system administrators will have to review the new entries on the catalog which now counts a total of 570 vulnerabilities.

ALGN,Align Technology,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzI2L2lzLWFsaWduLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktYS1idXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Align Technology a Buy?,"It's penetrating markets efficiently while selling a powerful core product.

If orthodontics sounds like a boring field to invest in you probably haven't heard of Align Technology (ALGN -0.17%).

Far from being a dental supply company the core of Align's business is its Invisalign transparent teeth straightener which helps people improve their smiles more fashionably and more comfortably than traditional straightening solutions like braces.

And where there's disruption of an old paradigm with a new one there's money to be made for those who are willing to invest which is exciting.

There's a lot to like about this stock

The key to appreciating Align's value as a company is to understand why its Invisalign product is so much better than the traditional alternatives.

Rather than enduring difficult sessions at the orthodontist's to install adjust and eventually remove the straighteners patients get their teeth imaged by the company's 3D scanner devices. Then the clinician molds a transparent aligner body to the shape of their chompers but adjusted for the corrections that the person needs. After that the patient wears their customized aligner easily removing it when necessary to eat or drink.

Eventually they have a smile that's closer to the aesthetics they'd prefer. And the ease and appeal of the entire process is making the company rich.

Last year it sold about 55% more of its Invisaligns than it did in 2020 generating nearly 60% more net revenue in the process. For 2021 its total take was $3.9 billion with a surprisingly high sum of $705.5 million derived from sales of imaging systems and software services rather than aligners. And management is betting that net sales will rise by as much as another 30% in 2022 which it says is in keeping with the business's long-term average growth rate.

There are a few reasons to believe that the leadership team's confidence is well-placed. One especially handy capability that'll allow this company to grow more than it might otherwise is its digital experience for prospective and current patients.

If someone wants to know whether their teeth might be eligible to be straightened with Invisalign they just need to download the MyInvisalign app and upload a picture of their smile. From there they'll get guidance on whether they should seek a referral to a practitioner -- and if so the app helps them find local ones. After that everything from appointment scheduling to arranging insurance coverage and virtual follow-ups is handled by the app.

Slashing the friction of screening and onboarding new customers is a significant competitive advantage even if it's possible that others will seek to imitate it over time. The app also has a powerful tool that lets people see a computer-generated image of what their smile might look like after their treatment is complete. When it comes to advertising techniques it's hard to imagine anything much better.

Furthermore with a market share of approximately 10% Align is strongly positioned to continue its global expansion which it considers a strategic priority. Last year it sold 69.5% more cases of its straighteners to customers in Europe the Middle East and Africa and it's currently building a new global manufacturing hub in Poland to serve hot demand.

Headwinds are few and far between

There aren't any recurring bugbears or major looming threats that investors need to be aware of with Align Technology's stock at the moment but there are a few minor things.

In particular its operating margin may continue to come under some pressure -- as it did most recently in the fourth quarter when it dropped from 25.7% to reach 21.4%. Management cites foreign exchange losses and spending more on marketing and research and development (R&D). The additional spending will help to drive more growth so it isn't alarming.

Likewise investors would do well to note that the company performed exceptionally well in 2020 which makes 2021's net income growth appear to be low in comparison. As it turns out over the last five years Align's annual net income has grown by 234% and there's no indication that the favorable trend is petering out; nor is there cause to think that it will anytime soon.

In my view Align is a great stock to buy this year for investors who want growth. But be aware that it has been hit particularly hard by the ongoing drama surrounding the Federal Reserve's plans to hike interest rates as have most growth stocks. So it might not beat the market at least for the time being.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbWFudWZhY3R1cjNkbWFnLmNvbS8zZC1zeXN0ZW1zLWFjcXVpcmUtdHdvLWV4dHJ1c2lvbi0zZC1wcmludGluZy10ZWNobm9sb2d5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3D Systems to acquire Kumovis and Titan Additive Manufacturers of Extrusion 3D Printing Technology,"3D Systems one of the world’s leading 3D printing company announced that it is simultaneously acquiring two manufacturers of extrusion 3D printing technology namely Kumovis a Munich Germany-based additive manufacturing solutions provider for personalised healthcare applications and Titan Additive LLC (Titan Robotics) the Colorado-based designer and fabricator of large-format industrial 3D printers.

Earlier Stride Ventures loaned them a massive $9 million USD

According to the start-up Toothsi has puth forth a specific resolution to issue 460053 CCPS VI at an issue price of Rs 2173.66 per share at a consideration of Rs 100 crore.

According to estimates Toothsi set a post funding valuation of $252 million. Up till now the company has raised $47 million in equity 9 months ago and $20 million in a round of funding last year.

Toothsi is a dental tech company that deals with consumers directly. They don’t have any clinics; their employees come directly to the comfort of your home to consult you and provide clear aligners for your teeth. The startup was founded by four qualified and experienced dentists.

One of the founders Dr. Arpi Mehta said that children in developed countries receive their first dental consultation at the age of seven on average. However in India most people do not understand the importance of dental care by the time they are late teens or in their twenties.

The concept of using metal braces and getting them fixed is such an invasive way for most adults and they would prefer to live without going through teeth alignment. Therefore Dr. Arpi Mehta realized that clear aligners form a good solution to this issue and came up with the idea for Toothsi

They work with other orthodontists technicians planners and customer care companies to provide you with clear aligners from the comfort of your own home.

The Mumbai based start-up which was founded just in 2018 uses clear align technology to produce their aligners. So far they have they sold over a million aligners.

Aligners aren’t the only product they sell as they recently dipped into other orthodontic products such as sonic toothbrushes teeth whitening products and aligner accessories. The founders also recently launched a skincare company named Skinnsi that offers laser removal services as well as derma facials.

During the financial year that’s passing Toothsi saw their revenue multiply 2.88 times from Rs. 5.06 crore to all the way to Rs. 14.06 crore. Consequently their cost shot up 3.46 times to almost Rs. 44 crores and they ended up losing Rs. 28.94 crore in the process this year as compared to a Rs. 7.54 crore loss during the previous one.

It almost seems as if Toothsi is digging up a hole so big; one that they can’t navigate out of. Over the past two years they have received so much funding one of which is massive loan which has to eventually be paid off. Time will tell if they end up being one of the success stories of the start-up world.",,,,,,

A smartphone-protection solutions company recently conducted drop tests of the Galaxy S22 and the iPhone SE 3. And as per the results the iPhone SE 3 performed better than the highest-end Galaxy S22 Ultra. Let’s take a look at the details.

iPhone SE 3 Beats Galaxy S22 Ultra in Drop Test

Allstate Protection Plans put the Galaxy S22 models to test their physical structure and protection against accidental drops. While the Galaxy S22 Ultra survived JerryRigEverything’s torturous bend test in which the OnePlus 10 Pro succumbed Allstate’s drop tests with the Galaxy smartphones did not go well for them.

Although Samsung uses a Gorilla Glass Victus+ layer to protect the displays of its Galaxy S22 models all of them including the display of the Galaxy S22 Ultra shattered on the first impact of a 6-foot drop on a concrete sidewalk. Allstate highlighted that the Galaxy S22 Ultra’s curved screen design is more vulnerable to shatters and cracks upon drops than other smartphones without a curved display.

The firm conducted the same test on the iPhone SE 3 and it performed much better in Allstate’s drop test than Samsung’s $1199 device. The new iPhone SE comes in a compact form factor and has a much smaller footprint than the massive 6.8-inch Galaxy S22 Ultra. Plus Apple claims that it uses the “toughest glass in a smartphone” for the front and back of the device which actually proved true.

Image: Allstate Protection Plans

The iPhone SE 3 was able to survive a 6-foot face-down drop on a concrete sidewalk. Although the display suffered a few minor scuffs and scratches it did not shatter like the Galaxy S22 Ultra. However this did not go well for the phone’s glass back as it got cracks at the bottom part though the camera was alright.

Following his loss to AJ Styles via DQ on last Monday's RAW Rollins grabbed the microphone and stated ""this is bullsh-t"". He then claimed that next week's RAW won't happen unless he gets what he deserves – a WrestleMania moment.

BlackBerry (BB 2.73%) was once synonymous with smartphones. Its enterprise-oriented devices accounted for over 20% of the fragmented market's shipments in 2007 according to Gartner.

But by 2016 the year BlackBerry finally stopped manufacturing its own devices and licensed its iconic brand to third-party smartphone makers its market share had plunged to about 0%. Apple and Alphabet's Google had disrupted and split the market into a duopoly with their iPhones and Android devices respectively and BlackBerry was left out in the cold.

Between the last trading days of 2007 and 2016 share prices of BlackBerry (known as Research in Motion until 2013) plunged 94%. At that point many investors walked away and left the stock for dead. BlackBerry hasn't recouped most of those losses yet but it also hasn't faded away -- and some contrarian investors believe it could still stage a long-term comeback.

Let's review the three key facts that well-informed investors likely know about BlackBerry and how they might make its brand relevant again.

1. It's a cybersecurity company

BlackBerry's CEO John Chen who took the helm in 2013 gradually phased out its dying smartphone business and focused on expanding its enterprise software and cybersecurity services with acquisitions.

BlackBerry acquired Good Technology a mobile device management service provider for $425 million in 2015. The following year it bought the cybersecurity firm Cylance for $1.4 billion.

Between 2014 and 2016 BlackBerry also acquired the smaller cybersecurity firms Secusmart and Encription the virtual SIM solutions firm Movirtu the enterprise data management company WatchDox and the crisis management platform AtHoc.

All those building blocks enabled it to launch Spark a unified platform of security and data management software for enterprise customers in 2018. It launched an expanded version Spark Suites in 2020.

BlackBerry generated 67% of its revenue from its cybersecurity business in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 compared to 54% of its revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. That ongoing expansion might enable BlackBerry to benefit from the growth of the broader cybersecurity market which could still grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.4% between 2022 and 2027 according to Report Ocean.

2. It's an automotive software company

BlackBerry's other main growth engine is QNX an embedded operating system it acquired from Harman for about $200 million in 2010. That acquisition turned out to be a smart move since QNX is now the most widely used embedded OS for connected and driverless vehicles.

QNX faces stiff competition from Android Microsoft's Windows Embedded and Linux but its IVY partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- which was announced in late 2020 -- could make it the preferred embedded OS for automakers that want to tether their newest sensors and services to AWS. Therefore it could still remain relevant in the automotive market even though it lost the mobile market to Apple and Google.

The softness of the automotive market over the past two years -- which was initially caused by the pandemic then exacerbated by the chip shortage and supply chain crisis -- has been throttling QNX's near-term growth. However this business could still recover quickly after those headwinds pass.

3. It just sold most of its patents

As BlackBerry made the painful transition from hardware to software it repeatedly leveraged its massive portfolio of mobile and messaging patents to generate fresh cash. It collected licensing fees from Chinese smartphone makers that wanted to use its brand it sued companies for allegedly infringing on its mobile messaging features and it even went after Ryan Seacrest for selling a smartphone case with a BlackBerry-style keyboard.

However BlackBerry's licensing revenue plunged 77% year over year to just $52 million or 10% of its top line in the first nine months of fiscal 2022. It lost most of its patent infringement cases including a high-profile one against Snap and its closely watched settlement with Meta Platform's Facebook didn't bring in any significant revenue.

TCL which previously manufactured BlackBerry-branded devices also declined to renew its licensing partnership in 2020. Its new licensing partner OnwardMobility hasn't released a BlackBerry device yet.

That's why BlackBerry recently sold nearly all of its mobile messaging and wireless networking patents to Catapult IP Innovations for $600 million which includes $400 million in cash and a $150 million promissory note.

That fresh injection of cash which dwarfs its $271 million in cash and equivalents at the end of last November could enable BlackBerry to make fresh investments in its core cybersecurity and IoT businesses.

It's still a work in progress

BlackBerry still faces a lot of near-term headwinds. Its cybersecurity revenue declined year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 as it faced stiff competition from other cybersecurity companies and soft auto sales continue to throttle QNX's growth. BlackBerry isn't doomed yet but it will need to find fresh ways to grow again in this challenging market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYXBwbGVpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMi8wMy8yNi9nb29nbGUtY2hyb21lLWZvci1tYWNvcy11cGRhdGVkLXRvLWZpeC1oaWdoLXNldmVyaXR5LXplcm8tZGF5LWJ1Z9IBcWh0dHBzOi8vYXBwbGVpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMi8wMy8yNi9nb29nbGUtY2hyb21lLWZvci1tYWNvcy11cGRhdGVkLXRvLWZpeC1oaWdoLXNldmVyaXR5LXplcm8tZGF5LWJ1Zy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Chrome for macOS updated to fix high-severity zero-day bug,"If you buy through our links we may get a commission.

Google released an update to Chrome on Friday that includes a fix for a high-severity zero-day bug that made it into the browser an update that is available now for macOS.

The Chrome Team said on Friday there was a ""Stable Channel Update for Desktop"" that brings Chrome up to version 99.0.4844.84 on macOS as well as Windows and Linux. The update is important as it fixes a high-severity bug in the browser.

The issue identified as CVE-2022-1096 is a ""type confusion"" weakness for Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine reports Bleeping Computer. Identified by an anonymous security researcher details of the bug's workings are being kept restricted until ""a majority of users are updated with a fix.""

Google is being purposefully cagey about the details of the exploit since it says it detected attacks actively using it. The team also insists that restrictions on the exploit's details will stay in place if the same bug exists in third-party libraries that other projects rely on that have yet to be fixed.

Type confusion refers to a bug that can crash a browser due to the reading and writing of memory out of buffer bounds. As well as causing crashes the bug can also be used by an attacker to execute code.

Google didn't say when it would expect to reveal details of the vulnerability but that may depend on how long it takes for a sufficient number of users to update their browsers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL29waW5pb25zLWJsb2dzL3lvdXR1YmUtYmxvY2tpbmctd2lvbi1oaWdoLXRpbWUtZm9yLWluZGlhbi10ZWNoLW1pbmRzLXRvLWJlYXQtdGVjaC1naWFudHMtNDY1ODQ00gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2lvbmV3cy5jb20vb3BpbmlvbnMtYmxvZ3MveW91dHViZS1ibG9ja2luZy13aW9uLWhpZ2gtdGltZS1mb3ItaW5kaWFuLXRlY2gtbWluZHMtdG8tYmVhdC10ZWNoLWdpYW50cy00NjU4NDQvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,YouTube blocking WION: High time for Indian tech minds to beat tech giants,"WION the global news channel from India was recently blocked by YouTube in yet another example of Western tech giants' monopoly over information systems.

For several months WION has been the most popular news channel on YouTube globally. This demonstrates the channel's popularity on the platform owned by Alphabet Inc.

WION is known for delivering news that is objective unbiased and accurate.

Since the commencement of the Ukraine invasion WION has been providing objective news and analysis of the events in Russia-Ukraine conflict.

WION has criticised the Ukraine invasion while also ensuring that its reporting remains impartial and that both sides of the story are told and heard.

Yet WION was blocked by YouTube on March 22 preventing millions of users from watching its coverage.

The block was lifted after an unprecedented massive user-led campaign.

But the larger question here is: how long can news and information providers from countries like India depend on the gate-keeping by these tech monopolies who claim to be impartial platforms but are far from unbiased?

Is there a way for Indian software professionals who practically lead most of the tech world drive a revolution to end the grip of these companies on global content?

The way Indians and people all over the world consume and distribute information has evolved dramatically in the last 10 to 15 years.

People no longer read the morning paper or the nightly news.

Instead the average individual spends hours each day online looking at news or entertainment websites accessing social media and consuming a wide range of information thanks to smartphones and other digital devices.

This new digital way of information demand and supply system has made it simple for anyone to share their opinions with the rest of the globe. There has never been a better time to take on the US IT giants than now when the talent pool is abundant the government encourages entrepreneurship and India's global prominence is expanding. × Social media platforms are crucial in this regard.

Currently over 4.62 billion individuals use some type of social media around the world accounting for roughly 58.4 per cent of the worldwide population.

Despite the fact that social media has a large and diverse audience only a handful of companies control the majority of the world's most popular social media platforms.

Social media platforms Country of origin Monthly users Instagram (owned by Meta) US 1.3 billion YouTube (owned by Alphabet Inc.) US 2.3 billion Facebook (owned by Meta) US 2.9 billion Twitter US 463 million TikTok China 1 billion Pinterest US 454 million Snapchat US 538 million

(*Meta Platforms Inc. doing business as Meta and formerly known as Facebook.)

(*Alphabet Inc was created through a restructuring of Google on October 2 2015 and became the parent company of Google.)

What do they all have in common?

Although none of the companies are Indian (With the exception of Koo) most of them include multiple Indian professionals on important design teams.

Social media platforms are becoming an important tool for delivering news to individuals.

The news is linked with all kinds of activity on the social media feed which is made up of a blend of private and public postings.

What people are exposed to is partly determined by their fellow networkers' actions.

Furthermore it is dependent on the platform providers' will.

Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram or Google are all companies that have the ability to prevent anyone from sharing information at any time.

This demonstrates that these technology behemoths have complete control over the information eco system.

In India both rural and urban locations the number of internet users has risen over time.

The digital India policies along with low data pricing enabling a large number of individuals in India to actively use the internet.

Around 448 million of them were active social media users.

As of January 2021 YouTube and Facebook have the highest penetration with over 89 percent and 76 percent respectively.

Now comes the question: Shouldn't Indian companies create their own effective social media platforms given our large user base and tremendous talent and entrepreneurial spirit?

Why should we let Western IT behemoths impose their ludicrous restrictions on us?

The significance of building our own indigenous technology is what we Indians may do to prevent incidents like YouTube's shutdown of WION in future.

The United States has the power to weaponise its technologies for nefarious ends.

Because news generates information which generates opinions and opinions shape our thoughts actions and attitudes.

As a result anyone who has authority over the information in this digital realm has influence over the entire world.

The WION banning is an example of how technological self-reliance can be postponed only at great risk to us.

The key to expressing Indian viewpoints must be in the hands of Indians.

There has never been a better time to take on the US IT giants than now when the talent pool is abundant the government encourages entrepreneurship and India's global prominence is expanding."

The team also insists that restrictions on the exploit's details will stay in place if the same bug exists in third-party libraries that other projects rely on that have yet to be fixed.

Type confusion refers to a bug that can crash a browser due to the reading and writing of memory out of buffer bounds. As well as causing crashes the bug can also be used by an attacker to execute code.

Google didn't say when it would expect to reveal details of the vulnerability but that may depend on how long it takes for a sufficient number of users to update their browsers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL29waW5pb25zLWJsb2dzL3lvdXR1YmUtYmxvY2tpbmctd2lvbi1oaWdoLXRpbWUtZm9yLWluZGlhbi10ZWNoLW1pbmRzLXRvLWJlYXQtdGVjaC1naWFudHMtNDY1ODQ00gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2lvbmV3cy5jb20vb3BpbmlvbnMtYmxvZ3MveW91dHViZS1ibG9ja2luZy13aW9uLWhpZ2gtdGltZS1mb3ItaW5kaWFuLXRlY2gtbWluZHMtdG8tYmVhdC10ZWNoLWdpYW50cy00NjU4NDQvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,YouTube blocking WION: High time for Indian tech minds to beat tech giants,"WION the global news channel from India was recently blocked by YouTube in yet another example of Western tech giants' monopoly over information systems.

For several months WION has been the most popular news channel on YouTube globally. This demonstrates the channel's popularity on the platform owned by Alphabet Inc.

WION is known for delivering news that is objective unbiased and accurate.

Since the commencement of the Ukraine invasion WION has been providing objective news and analysis of the events in Russia-Ukraine conflict.

WION has criticised the Ukraine invasion while also ensuring that its reporting remains impartial and that both sides of the story are told and heard.

Yet WION was blocked by YouTube on March 22 preventing millions of users from watching its coverage.

The block was lifted after an unprecedented massive user-led campaign.

But the larger question here is: how long can news and information providers from countries like India depend on the gate-keeping by these tech monopolies who claim to be impartial platforms but are far from unbiased?

Is there a way for Indian software professionals who practically lead most of the tech world drive a revolution to end the grip of these companies on global content?

The way Indians and people all over the world consume and distribute information has evolved dramatically in the last 10 to 15 years.

People no longer read the morning paper or the nightly news.

Instead the average individual spends hours each day online looking at news or entertainment websites accessing social media and consuming a wide range of information thanks to smartphones and other digital devices.

This new digital way of information demand and supply system has made it simple for anyone to share their opinions with the rest of the globe. There has never been a better time to take on the US IT giants than now when the talent pool is abundant the government encourages entrepreneurship and India's global prominence is expanding. × Social media platforms are crucial in this regard.

Currently over 4.62 billion individuals use some type of social media around the world accounting for roughly 58.4 per cent of the worldwide population.

Despite the fact that social media has a large and diverse audience only a handful of companies control the majority of the world's most popular social media platforms.

Social media platforms Country of origin Monthly users Instagram (owned by Meta) US 1.3 billion YouTube (owned by Alphabet Inc.) US 2.3 billion Facebook (owned by Meta) US 2.9 billion Twitter US 463 million TikTok China 1 billion Pinterest US 454 million Snapchat US 538 million

(*Meta Platforms Inc. doing business as Meta and formerly known as Facebook.)

(*Alphabet Inc was created through a restructuring of Google on October 2 2015 and became the parent company of Google.)

What do they all have in common?

Although none of the companies are Indian (With the exception of Koo) most of them include multiple Indian professionals on important design teams.

Social media platforms are becoming an important tool for delivering news to individuals.

The news is linked with all kinds of activity on the social media feed which is made up of a blend of private and public postings.

What people are exposed to is partly determined by their fellow networkers' actions.

Furthermore it is dependent on the platform providers' will.

Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram or Google are all companies that have the ability to prevent anyone from sharing information at any time.

This demonstrates that these technology behemoths have complete control over the information eco system.

In India both rural and urban locations the number of internet users has risen over time.

The digital India policies along with low data pricing enabling a large number of individuals in India to actively use the internet.

Around 448 million of them were active social media users.

As of January 2021 YouTube and Facebook have the highest penetration with over 89 percent and 76 percent respectively.

Now comes the question: Shouldn't Indian companies create their own effective social media platforms given our large user base and tremendous talent and entrepreneurial spirit?

Why should we let Western IT behemoths impose their ludicrous restrictions on us?

The significance of building our own indigenous technology is what we Indians may do to prevent incidents like YouTube's shutdown of WION in future.

The United States has the power to weaponise its technologies for nefarious ends.

Because news generates information which generates opinions and opinions shape our thoughts actions and attitudes.

As a result anyone who has authority over the information in this digital realm has influence over the entire world.

The WION banning is an example of how technological self-reliance can be postponed only at great risk to us.

The key to expressing Indian viewpoints must be in the hands of Indians.

There has never been a better time to take on the US IT giants than now when the talent pool is abundant the government encourages entrepreneurship and India's global prominence is expanding."

A taxable spinoff is a divestiture of a subsidiary or division by a publicly-traded company which will be subject to capital gains taxation. To qualify as a taxable transaction the parent corporation must divest through direct sale of the division or the assets it contains. The profits made from the sale will be taxed as capital gains.

Key Takeaways A taxable spin-off is a form of corporate divestiture where the conditions of Internal Revenue Code provisions for tax-free spinoffs are not met.

In a taxable spinoff both the parent company and the shareholders incur an additional tax obligation from the transaction.

Changes to tax law under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 including lower corporate tax rates may impact firms’ decision to pursue taxable versus tax-free modes of corporate divestiture.

Most spinoffs are tax-free and a company will fulfill the IRS requirements in order to ensure this.

Spinning off a portion of a company is usually beneficial to the share price of both companies.

Understanding Taxable Spinoffs

A spinoff occurs when a parent corporation separates part of its business to create a new business subsidiary and distributes shares of the new entity to its current shareholders. The subsidiary will become completely independent from the parent corporation operating entirely on its own. If a parent corporation distributes the stock of the subsidiary to its shareholders the distribution is generally taxable to the shareholder as a dividend payout.

In this case ordinary income tax equal to the fair market value of the stock received is imposed on investors. In addition the parent corporation is taxed on the built-in gain (the amount the asset has appreciated) in the stock of the subsidiary.

The tax in this case is a capital gains tax equal to the fair market value of the distributed shares less the parent company’s inside basis in the stock. When cash is received in lieu of fractional shares in the spinoff the fractional shares are generally taxable to shareholders.

A taxable spinoff will bring in liquid assets to the company usually in the form of cash. The downside of this transaction comes from the decrease in income from the capital gains tax. If a parent company wishes to avoid taxation it may consider a tax-free spinoff. Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provides an exemption to taxing transactions from spinoffs allowing a corporation to spin off or distribute shares of a subsidiary in a transaction that is tax-free to both shareholders and the parent company.

When a Spinoff Is Taxed

A spinoff is taxed when the company outright sells the subsidiary. This can include the company being bought by another company or when the company is sold via an initial public offering (IPO).

When cash is received instead of shares in a spinoff the shares of the spinoff are generally taxable.

When such events occur there are two levels of tax that need to be paid. An ordinary tax would be applied at the shareholder level which would be equal to the fair market value (FMV) of the stock received. In many ways it is similar to a dividend payout. A capital gains tax may also be applied on the stock sale at the level of the company equal to the FMV of the stock minus the company's inside basis in the stock.

There are also cases when a spinoff may be taxed simply because it didn't adhere to the tax-free spinoff requirements listed below.



Tax-Free Spinoff

There are typically two ways that a company can undertake a tax-free spinoff of a business unit. First a company can choose to simply distribute the new shares (or at least 80%) of the division to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis.

The second way a company can avoid any capital gains from divestiture is by giving current shareholders the option to exchange shares of the parent company for an equal stock position in the spun-off company or to maintain their existing stock position in the parent company. This means the shareholders are free to choose whichever company they believe offers the best potential return on investment (ROI) going forward.

The IRS has certain requirements for companies to be able to spin off tax-free. They are control device active trade or business and distributions.

Control requirements stipulate that the corporations must own stock possessing at least 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of the stock of that corporation. There are different measures for determining voting control but are usually determined by the ability to elect directors.

Device requirements for tax-free spinoffs mean the spinoff cannot be used as a device for the sole purpose of distributions of earnings and profits. This is determined on a case-by-case basis and considers all aspects of the spinoff.

The active trade section requires both the pre-existing company and the newly spun-off company to qualify as what the IRS calls an ""active trade or business"" immediately once the deal is finalized. This also requires that both businesses are actively engaged in business.

The distribution requirements mean that the IRS requires the pre-existing company to distribute all stocks and securities held in the newly spun-off company in specific ways. Usually this is for the company to distribute at least 80% of the shares to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis. The second involves the stock options given to shareholders explained above where they can choose either the pre-existing company or the new company to invest in.



Special Considerations

Because of the availability of a tax benefit under Section 355 most spin-offs are conducted in order to take advantage. Rather than incur an additional tax burden through a taxable spin-off businesses may often find that it makes more sense to pursue some other form of divestiture if the benefits of the divestiture outweigh the additional tax incurred.

This also means that corporate income tax rates may influence firms’ decisions to divest and how. Cuts to corporate income tax rates in the U.S. under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 signed by President Trump may have changed this calculus somewhat in favor of other forms of divestitures such as subsidiary stock sales or asset sales.



Real-World Example

One of the largest corporate spinoffs of all time occurred in 2008 when Altria Group Inc. (MO) spun off Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) spinning off 100% of the shares of Philip Morris. In this case each Altria shareholder received one share of Philip Morris stock for every share of outstanding Altria common stock.

They split due to concerns over payouts to shareholders as well as the mounting pressure of smoking lawsuits. However on Altria's website they state that they spun off Philip Morris as ""management believed that the spinoff would enable each of Altria's international and domestic tobacco businesses to focus exclusively on realizing its own opportunities and addressing its own challenges thereby building long-term shareholder value.""

On Jan. 30 2008 Altria authorized the spinoff. By March of the same year Philip Morris shares were distributed to shareholders on record of Altria that held shares during the distribution date. This was a non-taxable spinoff example as most spinoffs are conducted in order to be tax-advantaged.

Is a Stock Spinoff Taxable? Stock spinoffs are usually tax-free. There are many advantages for both the parent organization and the common shareholder if the spinoff is not taxed.

Is a Spinoff Considered a Dividend? Since the spinoff is paid to the shareholder as a distribution it is very similar to a dividend. The main difference between the two is that a dividend will pay the shareholder in cash whereas a spinoff will pay the shareholder in additional stock shares.

What Is the Difference Between a Spinoff and a Split-off? The method of creating a tax-free spinoff that involves presenting shareholders the options of investing in either the spun-off company or the pre-existing company is called a ""split-off."" These terms are used to avoid confusion when discussing the spinoff and whether the company distributes the shares on a pro-rata basis or gives shareholders the option to choose.

How Many Shares Do you Get in a Spinoff? How many shares you receive in a spinoff is determined by whether the company performs a true spinoff or if there is a split-off. In a split-off you are able to choose between receiving shares in the newly spun-off company or keeping your shares in the parent organization.

The Bottom Line

Most companies who spin off portions of their companies will do so in a tax-free way. There are enormous tax benefits to not selling a company outright therefore most companies will fulfill the IRS requirements for spinning off portions of their company in a tax-free way.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I saw something so traumatizing and so familiar that it almost made me have a panic attack.

Written and directed by first-time filmmaker Mariama Diallo Master stars Regina Hall as Gail Bishop the first Black master of Ancaster an elite New England university. As we follow Gail’s story we are also introduced to Jasmine Moore played by Zoe Renee a Black student from a middle-class background who is a freshman at the Predominantly White Institution (PWI). The stories unfold in parallel fashion. On one track Gail traverses the minefield that is being a Black administrator surrounded by liberal covertly racist white colleagues. And on the other track Jasmine discovers that being Black at a PWI means putting up with so many racialized microaggressions that it can be hard to know if others are being intentionally racist or just obliviously white. All the while in the background there is creeping dread as something supernatural begins to unfold.

Now I think the supernatural element is neither well thought out nor properly executed. There is a story of a curse having to do with Margaret Millet a woman assumed to be a witch who was put to death not too far from campus grounds. Millet’s ghost haunts the university and at 3:33 on December 3rd she kills whoever is staying in the room that Jasmine is staying in. This element of the story leaves me with more questions than answers—but I don’t think the filmmakers are very interested in this part of the story. (Perhaps it was tacked on to make the movie more bankable since horror tends to do well these days?) What it seems the filmmakers are actually interested in is the experience of being Black at a university that has historically been hostile to people who look like you. This theme is explored from two perspectives.

A Black English professor is up for tenure at the university and Hall is on the committee considering her dossier. She tries to support this colleague but the white faculty who are on the committee with her constantly remind Hall of her “place” in the university and use the fact that she had to work very hard to get to her position (indeed harder than any of the white faculty members I’m sure) as a way to pit her against the promotion of another Black colleague.

Now I have never had that exact situation happened to me before but the world of Black academia is small. There are so few Black folks who have jobs in academia that most everyone either knows each other or have heard of each other. And while I have not experienced this first hand I know of many colleagues who have been in this exact position. You are put in a hard to get position and you promised yourself that you would make things easier for the person who came behind you. Instead your colleagues expect you to be as hard on others as the gatekeepers were to you. This is a frustrating place to be and the movie captures that element beautifully.

Then there is what happens to Jasmine and this brings me to the scene that hit a little too close to home.

I have attended PWIs my whole life both as an undergrad and as a grad student. I work at one now as the Associate Director of Africana Studies at Oklahoma State University. The scenes featuring Regina Hall have an element of truth because white faculty can at times be oblivious to experiences of their Black colleagues but what Jasmine experiences in the film was so painful that there were moments I had to pause the movie.

She receives a very cold welcome during freshman orientation. She is graded much harsher than her white cohorts for no other reason than because she is a Black student. She tries to go to a white frat party and is initially turned away but then let in because she knew someone inside. All these things happened to me when I was a college freshman in the early 2000s.

Then the scene happened that was so intense that I had to stop the film and come back the next day.

While Jasmine is at the aforementioned frat party a song that is seemingly beloved by white students everywhere comes on: “Mo Bamba” by Sheck Wes. I have seen white students at universities across the nation lose their mind over this song. I have no idea why it is so beloved but the reaction in the film is an authentic one. White partygoers sing loudly but then a line is crossed. Instead of editing themselves and not saying the n-word they choose to sing the song as it was written and include the word with a hard r.

I had to walk away.

I had the same experience when I was a junior in college. I went to a white frat party and Ludacris’ “Southern Hospitality” came on the speakers. I was a student in a southern university so this song was everywhere at the time. I had many white friends but when the n-word was used they would choose not to use it. That was not the case with these white frat boys I did not know.

They said the word to my face and were surprised that it angered me. When the next song came on they said the word again this time in defiance of what I had just told them and this resulted in me punching the president of that fraternity. Nothing became of this incident. My frat brothers (members of a historically Black Greek Letter organization) quickly whisked me out the party and we never stepped foot in that frat house again. But this is why that scene hit me so hard. It tapped into a painful experience that I’d experienced but I am not alone. I have talked to many other Black folks who have had similar experiences. This film is full of little moments like that. Moments that only a person who has lived through them could have written and captured so well on film.

This is an uneven film and the supernatural moments are not where the source of the horror lies. It is in the realization that the nature of racism is such that it is ubiquitous and unending. Even on a college campus populated by people who think themselves liberal but whose whiteness remains central to how they interact with the world.

What’s amazing about this film is that the literal demons depicted in the movie are less scary than the things it shows that happen in the real world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzMvMjYvMjI5OTczOTUvYW1hem9uLWdhbWVzLXN0dWRpby1ib3NzLW1pa2UtZnJhenppbmktc3RlcHBpbmctZG93btIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Games boss Mike Frazzini is stepping down,"Amazon Games studio head Mike Frazzini is stepping down from his role to focus on family according to a report from Bloomberg.

The steel industry around Birmingham shrank as manufacturing moved overseas. Bessemer’s unemployment rate reached 35% in the early 1980s. Another vestige of steelmaking disappeared from Bessemer in 2018 when US Steel sold its land to Amazon which had chosen the town as the site for its first warehouse in Alabama.

Britvic’s Aqua Libra Flavour Tap sits on a cabinet-sized unit in office kitchens and retail shops. The distinctive streamlined design includes a simple touchscreen interface that provides user with a selection of products and dispenses a finished drink in seconds.

Under the countertop a high-tech cartridge powered by Internet of Things (IoT) technology releases micro-doses of sugar- and additive-free flavoring into the water. The digital interface data analytics on flavor tap usage and IoT capabilities all use AWS.

Britvic sees this as an opportunity to eliminate single-use plastic beverage containers and provide a way for consumers to drink fewer sugary drinks thus making a positive impact on the environment and personal health. “With Aqua Libra we’re offering a new proposition for customers to reduce their carbon footprint while providing healthy hydration options for staff and shoppers” says Scott MacKenzie Beyond The Bottle proposition lead at Britvic. A few years ago though the digital flavor tap was just an idea. To prove its viability and win support for the project across the business Britvic needed a prototype.

Through collaboration with AWS and working within the AWS framework Britvic spun up a feature-rich prototype within 4 weeks that was built on AWS IoT Analytics and Amazon QuickSight. “AWS really gets what we’re trying to do. That belief and support has been important to the success of Aqua Libra” says MacKenzie. “In particular being able to build a prototype on AWS so quickly showed the rest of the business that we could bring this idea to life.”

Supporting Corporate Sustainability and Wellness Goals

Based on the prototype demo the Aqua Libra Flavour Tap team got the thumbs-up to create a production-scale product. Throughout the development process the ability to use AWS to analyze real-time data on the tap’s usage has helped Britvic generate insights that improve the product. Tracking customer behavior led Britvic to provide recyclable cups alongside the flavour tap as not all consumers carry refillable vessels and to adjust the tap’s minimum container weight so a wide range of cups can be detected. By studying usage Britvic also realized the amount of flavor added to the water varies by location so it can tailor the flavor cartridges based on whether the flavor tap is in a workplace or retail outlet.

Collecting data on flavor tap usage has also helped Britvic customers to understand the needs of their employees and shoppers and to gain insights that help them to work towards corporate sustainability and wellness goals. The Aqua Libra dashboards show its customers how many and what kinds of drinks are served so they can determine whether the flavor tap is in the right location for maximum use and can encourage healthy habits such as drinking more frequently throughout the day.

Using AWS the IoT sensors on the flavor tap’s flavor cartridges also simplify operations and maintenance as they send out automatic alerts when a cartridge needs to be changed or if it’s experiencing problems and requires attention. “We’re helping our customers fulfil their goals and help their employees or customers make better healthier choices for their bodies and for our planet” says MacKenzie.



AWS Supports a Long Future of Innovation

Britvic expects the Aqua Libra Flavour Tap will continue to evolve over the coming years as it learns more about how customers and consumers want to interact with it. Future features include auto-recognition of vessels—so the flavour tap would know a consumer’s usual order—and the ability to detect and stop spillage. Britvic also sees opportunities to move into other environments such as education and health and has plans to roll out the Aqua Libra Flavour Tap to 100 locations in the UK by next year and to be international by 2023.

Using AWS supports these goals as the on-demand serverless model makes it easy to try out new services release frequent updates and scale up to accommodate rising demand.

It also helps Britvic to keep up with consumer expectations. “Our customers are more aware than ever of consumer expectations for tasty healthy and sustainable options” says Dickson. “Our decades of experience with liquids and equipment combined with a priority to develop industry-leading experiences has led to the creation of the Aqua Libra Flavour Tap. While developing the ground-breaking product AWS has supported our ability to innovate in-house.”



About Britvic Britvic is a UK-based soft drinks company. It’s the largest supplier of branded still soft drinks and the second largest supplier of branded carbonated soft drinks in Great Britain as well as being an industry leader in Brazil Ireland and France.

The Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union which is seeking to represent workers the facility made the allegations known about the Bessemer facility in a statement issued Saturday afternoon.

Amazon on Saturday night disputed the union’s version of events.

According to the organization a compressor in the facility malfunctioned Friday afternoon spraying what workers thought at the time was smoke into an air vent on the third floor of the warehouse. It’s now thought to be vaporized oil.

The group in its statement said that around 1:30 p.m. workers on the third floor of the warehouse were told to clock out evacuate and go on unpaid Voluntary Time Off. According to the group workers on other floors were not told to stop working and evacuate or notified of the substance spreading through the air vents.

First floor workers eventually went to see what was going on around 4:30 p.m. According to the organization no alarms notifications text messages or otherwise went out to workers at any time during the day.

Around 5:45 p.m. workers began to leave the facility via word of mouth. Some fire and police service vehicles were on the scene at that time according to the release.

Overnight-shift workers began to arrive while day-shift workers were waiting for more information but at 7:00 p.m. workers were told to re-enter the building and begin their shifts. According to the release cloudiness was still in the air inside the facility.

OSHA has been notified of the incident according to the organization.

Isaiah Thomas worker at the Bessemer facility thought their glasses were smudged as the incident began but later left with their co-worker after they thought it was smoke in the building.

More on Amazon:

“Everyone was very confused and the lack of information made us feel very unsafe. We didn’t know what was happening and many of us sought safety in our cars and tried to get as far away from the building as possible” Thomas said according to the release.

Thomas added that they were shocked that workers were asked to keep working throughout the incident and shocked that no notification or alarm went out to workers.

“I don’t know what I was breathing in for that long and I don’t know if it’s still in the air at work today either. I feel very unsafe and I wish management would treat us like humans and care about our safety in a real way” Thomas said.

Stuart Appelbaum President of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union echoed Thomas’ words.

“It is unconscionable that Amazon would keep workers at their stations when there is a known health and safety issue. Workers’ lives should never be put in jeopardy for profits” Appelbaum said. “Amazon must be held accountable for this.”

Amazon released a statement Saturday night denying the group’s version of events.

“Mr. Applebaum’s claims are false. Yesterday an air compressor malfunction resulted in smoke emitting from the equipment. Out of an abundance of caution we evacuated the facility and called the local fire department who responded and quickly evaluated and cleared the site” said Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel. ”We’re thankful no one was injured and we appreciate the swift actions of the Bessemer Fire Department.”

The fire department conducted an air quality test and found zero hazardous contaminants. Employees were able to re-enter the site and completed their shifts. Employees were not to clock out and take VTO (voluntary time off) and all employees were paid for their full shifts.

This incident comes as the deadline for the return of mail-in ballots for the facility’s labor vote nears. Workers have until March 28 to fill out and return their ballots.

A similar vote last year went decidedly in Amazon’s favor against unionization. U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville questioned the decision to allow a second election on Friday the same day the alleged incident took place.

Ross was President of the union from April 2016 until March 2018.

The detail in the complaint and arbitration decision are shockingly egregious (.pdf). The allegations included that he

put $3600 of personal furniture on the union credit card and even charged “thousands” on personal items like bedding and toilet paper.

billed $6200 for a rental car to the union while living near union headquarters and not entitled to a car.

claimed mileage reimbursement even while the union was paying for his rental car.

charged “thousands of dollars of unauthorized meals to his APFA credit card” and “thousands for maintaining an office he was not entitled to.”

It appears that Ross’ defense to using the credit card for personal purchases was (1) that the expenses were approved (effectively by his subordinates in the union) and (2) that the people complaining didn’t audit the credit card charges of other past union presidents (in effect I suppose ‘everybody does it’).

Receipts were submitted for each credit card charge and reviewed per policy by the appropriate accounting and legal departments. Plaintiff admitted they did not review any other administrations union credit card charges for similar purchases or past practice or for expenses when said officers relocated to DFW.

And he says that no one can prove the mileage reimbursements he took were for the rental car he had as opposed to for driving his personal car and that the policy the union had on meal reimbursements was unclear (“APFA also had no policy in place until 2021 for a National Officer in relation to one’s union credit card practice” so more or less anything goes though it seems like this position would entail problems with the IRS).

The arbitrator’s findings are damning. For instance

It appears APFA paid for Ross’s family vacation in the Grand Canyon with Defendant Ross’ APFA credit card. The cost of this vacation to include meals and hotels should be borne by Defendant Ross. This is an abuse of Ross’s fiduciary duty to the APFA membership. This is a per se violation of the Policy Manual.

The arbitrator found that he took mileage reimbursement and gas reimbursement on the same day paid for personal meals with his union credit card on the same day he also too meal per diems and that the rental car – paid to be upgraded to the luxury category – was against union bylaws. And the arbitrator found that when Ross moved to Dallas to become union President he both took a moving allowance (to move into a new home) and had the union lease him an apartment even though he was only entitled to one or the other.

Thus it is the arbitrator’s Opinion that Defendant Ross abused his Fiduciary duty to the membership of the APFA and should be assessed the cost of leasing that apartment in the amount of $8106.13 …The arbitrator finds that throughout this proceeding Defendant Ross intentionally and willfully ignored the provisions of the APFA Policy Manual and thus has violated and abused his fiduciary duty entrusted to him by the APFA membership. Ross’s testimony was inconsistent and not forthright. Because Ross abused his position of trust as well as his fiduciary duty to the membership of the APFA he can no longer hold a position of trust with the APFA.

The union for its part promises reforms. Before the pandemic thought it was rife with infighting and then failed to speak up for flight attendants as the company furloughed them during Covid. They’ve had financial challenges and it’s easy to see why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvbWFyLzI3L2xpdHRsZS1yb2NrLWFpcnBvcnQtaG9sZGluZy1pdHMtb3duLWluLW1pZHN0LW9mL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Little Rock airport holding its own in midst of lingering pandemic disruption | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"The state's largest airport has emerged relatively unscathed from the pandemic but it will continue to face challenges in adding or keeping airline service as the nation's airlines deal with pilot and aircraft shortages the failure of business travel to return to pre-pandemic levels and rising fuel prices.

The disruption and uncertainty however create opportunities.

Those were among the key takeaways from an air development workshop held last week at Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport/Adams Field.

The pandemic turned the industry ""upside down"" said Joseph Pickering principal at Mead & Hunt a global consulting firm. The former Delta Airlines executive is the business unit leader for the consulting firm's air service consulting group.

""We experienced a shock event unlike anything else"" he told members of the Little Rock Municipal Airport Commission and airport executives. ""In the past we've had recessions other minor blips along the way. 9/11 looking in the rearview mirror looks minor compared to what we had now.""

Passenger traffic fell to levels not seen since the 1990s while airlines offered just ""minimum service"" as part of an effort to keep the economy going while much of the nation was ""locked down"" in an effort to halt the spread of the covid-19 virus.

One immediate impact of the pandemic was the loss of business travelers. They represent an outsize portion of airline passengers because they travel frequently and often pay premium prices for their tickets.

""I had one airliner planner tell me that the state of Florida early on in the pandemic single-handedly kept the industry afloat because people wanted to get out eventually"" Pickering said. ""These leisure destinations were benefiting more so than the typical business markets.""

Since demand for airline products fell so did profitability which led to cutting costs. Airlines were unable to reinvest in new aircraft and offered early retirement packages to employees including pilots their most expensive labor cost Pickering said.

Once demand began returning the airlines no longer had pilots in place to meet it. Now fuel costs are rising and business travel hasn't returned Pickering said.

""We've got this perfect storm"" he said. ""We've got lack of business travel we've got crew shortages fuel increases disruptions going on in economies around the world. And fewer airplanes as well.""

All that disruption and uncertainty has left smaller cities with reduced service. Delta Airlines for one has pulled out of Fort Smith Regional Airport. American Airlines still serves the airport.

Other destinations such as Myrtle Beach and Key West are fully recovered according to Pickering.

""Little Rock is somewhere in between"" he said.

Margaret Muir was one of two executives from American who spoke at the daylong workshop.

Little Rock has service to five of American's 10 U.S. hubs: Chicago Dallas Charlotte Miami and Washington D.C.

""You can see where we're arranged our service from Little Rock -- we connect east and west and north and south -- so lots of options for the Little Rock passenger who is trying to get just about anywhere in the country"" said Muir senior manager for network planning at American.

These days she said Clinton National is performing pretty consistently to and from the American hubs in Dallas and Charlotte.

""Because you can connect anywhere at these hubs they tend to hold up better"" Muir said.

The Chicago hub is impacted by winter weather Miami weekend service hasn't been strong ""so far"" and the D.C. hub has been slow to recover but the airline sees some ""signs of strength"" she said.

Given all the challenges American and the rest of the airline industry faces Muir said it will be difficult to expand service at Clinton National.

The airline looks at a number of metrics to weigh new service she said. They include how a new route would fit into overall strategy the demand for the new route and how valuable is that demand would it stimulate demand and last but not least the opportunity cost.

""You are going to have the take the plane from somewhere"" Muir said. ""We don't have a plane sitting waiting to be deployed to a new market. Instead it was already doing something. What are the opportunity costs of moving from an existing market to a new market?""

And keeping the service Clinton National already has she said requires the airport to keeps its costs low which it already does; keep the airline informed on changes in the market that could impact service such as company expansions or relocation to the city; and tell the airline what customers are saying about routes and schedules.

Bryan Malinowski the top executive at Clinton National expressed worry that not all travelers will return.

""Airlines are telling us that the leisure travel is back but only about 50% or less of the business travel"" he said. ""I think that's an important point to echo.""

Pickering pointed to other cities and their efforts to retain or stimulate demand including using federal pandemic relief funds which can be used to subsidize airline routes because they can qualify as economic development or tourism.

""Air service checks both of those boxes"" he said.

Last year the Tulsa County Board of Commissioners allocated up to $3 million in federal covid-19 relief funds to a local group to incentivize nonstop flights from Tulsa to major U.S. cities. The group has a goal of raising $15 million in public and private money to fund the effort.

American Airlines then announced announced that it will add year-round nonstop service from Tulsa International Airport to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington D.C. and Miami International Airport beginning in November.

Pickering warned that the incentives aren't a guarantee.

""Incentives help put you over the finish line"" he said. Airlines ""won't go into a market that they know is not going to work.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3VuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lcy1wb2xhcmlzLWxvdW5nZS1hY2Nlc3MtZnJ1c3RyYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The frustrating United policy that's much more punitive than American Airlines,"Both United and American Airlines offer two different types of airport lounges with vastly different amenities and experiences.

There are standard run-of-the-mill membership lounges — dubbed the United Club and Admirals Club respectively — and then there are exclusive spaces respectively called the Polaris Lounge and Flagship Lounge which are reserved for business-class passengers.

United Polaris Lounge Washington Dulles (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

In recent years the two carriers have invested significantly in building out their poshest lounges. American now operates five Flagship Lounges (across its biggest international gateway hubs) while United has six Polaris Lounges (one in every domestic hub except for Denver).

These business-class-only lounges offer an upgraded experience compared to the standard membership clubs. This includes more luxurious seating arrangements including nap pods and a plethora of phone booths an elevated buffet with better catering top-shelf liquor shower suites and more.

It's no surprise then that the airlines limit access to these lounges to their most lucrative flyers. This helps avoid overcrowding in the lounges while also reserving this experience to those paying the big bucks to sit in the pointy end of the plane on international flights.

While both airlines allow business-class flyers to use the lounge before long-haul flights American is more welcoming than United when it comes to a carve-out for certain domestic flights — those seated in American's Flagship business or first class on premium transcontinental routes receive access to the Flagship Lounge. (American also admits its top-tier elites before long-haul flights regardless of the cabin flown.)

Meanwhile those flying in the United Polaris lie-flat pods on the same routes are relegated to the standard United Club.

In fact I recently flew from Newark to San Francisco on one of United's premium transcontinental coast-to-coast services. I booked a business-class ticket and despite enjoying the Polaris ""hard product"" on board the plane I was locked out from using the Polaris Lounge before my flight.

Instead I spent a good chunk of a 3-hour departure delay sitting in the much less premium United Club at Newark. The airline currently operates just one ""standard"" membership club at Newark Terminal C and it's dark outdated and notoriously overcrowded.

United Club Newark (Photo taken pre-pandemic by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

(United is building an upgraded club in the C3 concourse. Until then the airline also operates a temporary pop-up club near Gate C93 but that's only used during peak departure windows.)

During the departure delay I kept thinking to myself that had I been flying American I would've had access to the Flagship Lounge where I could relax and enjoy the upgraded amenities included with my business-class ticket.

Of course I understand United's perspective for keeping the Polaris Lounge limited to its long-haul international passengers. The airline can limit overcrowding and reserve the space for travelers driving the most revenue.

United Polaris Lounge Washington Dulles (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

But premium transcontinental routes have historically been some of the most profitable in the domestic network. Business and deep-pocketed leisure travelers splurge for the lie-flat pods which can go for more than $1000 in each direction. Plus many corporations award their travel contracts to airlines based on the coast-to-coast product offering and the number of frequencies.

In United's case the airline recently restarted serving the JFK airport with flights from San Francisco and Los Angeles after a more than 5-year hiatus.

Pulling out of JFK in 2015 has since been deemed a ""strategic mistake"" by United executives who say that the airline lost corporate contracts and other big spenders due to the move.

United at JFK (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

It's apparent that these transcon routes are some of the highest-profile flights in United's domestic system yet the airline is letting its business-class flyers down by denying them entry to the Polaris Lounge before travel.

If the airline wanted to upgrade the pre-departure experience it could consider letting these passengers into the fancy lounges. And if United is worried about ""cheapening"" or overcrowding the experience it could even limit access to those paying for business fares and exclude those redeeming miles or upgrades from using the Polaris Lounge.

This is a move that's been recently popularized by United's Star Alliance partner north of the border. Air Canada's top lounge the Signature Suite is only accessible to those paying for business-class fares — others can use the standard Maple Leaf Lounge before departure.

Another alternative is to restrict transcon business-class passengers from using the Polaris Lounge bistro area. Each Polaris lounge has a restaurant-style dining room (in addition to an extensive buffet) with waiter service and cooked-to-order menu items.

United could differentiate the transcon and long-haul premium travel experience by only allowing those traveling internationally to use the dining room — which would still represent a big improvement compared to the status quo for coast-to-coast travel.

It'll ultimately be interesting to see if United ever adjusts its Polaris Lounge access policy to include premium transcontinental routes. Until then American Airlines will continue to take the cake when it comes to offering the best domestic ground experience that your money (or miles) can get you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZHJvbmVkai5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yNy9hdmlhdGlvbi12ZXRlcmFuLWJpbGx5LW5vbGFuLXRhcHBlZC1hcy1mYWEtYWN0aW5nLWFkbWluaXN0cmF0b3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aviation veteran Billy Nolan tapped as FAA acting Administrator,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has announced that air industry veteran Billy Nolan has been named to serve as acting administrator when the agency’s outgoing chief Steve Dickson steps down at the end of the month.

Nolan will be moving into the interim Administrator role from his position as the FAA’s Associate Administrator for Aviation Safety which he assumed in January. In that role Nolan has overseen a team of more than 7600 employees responsible for the complete span of aviation safety concerns. Nolan previously worked for several commercial airlines and served tours of duty in the US Army as an airplane and helicopter pilot and safety officer.

Nolan will take the reins from the outgoing Dickson a Trump appointee who in February announced he’d be stepping down halfway through his five-year mandate to spend more time with his family.

As part of its announcement the FAA said Deputy Administrator Bradley Mims will also take on an expanded role during the interim period with a particular focus on the agency’s workforce and the nation’s airports.

It is unknown whether President Joe Biden will decide to put Nolan’s name forward for the permanent FAA Administrator position whose nominees must be appointed by the US Senate. But in appointing him to the interim spot US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg praised Nolan’s qualifications.

“Billy Nolen has extensive expertise in aviation and a deep understanding of the vital role the FAA plays in ensuring the safety of the traveling public” Buttigieg said. “We are grateful to Steve for his service and to Billy and Brad for stepping up to lead the FAA during this critical time.”

A Bachelor of Science in Professional Aeronautics graduate from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Nolan has worked in air safety positions for Qantas Airways and American Airlines. He entered the industry in 1989 as a pilot for American earning type ratings on Boeing 757 767 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft. He later managed the airline’s Aviation Safety Action Program eventually rising to the post of managing director for corporate safety and regulatory affairs.



In 2015 Nolen became senior vice president for safety security and operations at the airlines’ trade organization Airlines for America. From 2018 to 2019 he served as executive manager for group safety and health at Qantas before moving to WestJet.

Mims has worked in transport roles in both the private and public sectors for four decades and has served in leadership roles in both the public and private sectors. He first served at the FAA under the Clinton administration and has played a vital role as FAA Deputy Administrator in the Biden era.

The recent compromises are found in President Joe Biden’s infrastructure law which puts $2.5 billion toward projects including dam removals as well as improvements to existing structures for hydropower and energy storage.

Ted Illston of American Rivers a group that has pushed for dam removals on environmental grounds recently told the Associated Press that the group recognizes “that (hydropower) is probably going to play some role in the transition. It’s certainly better than coal.”

Hydropower in the United States

Hydropower uses flowing water to move turbines connected to generators. It is the oldest and second-largest sort of renewable energy in the U.S. after wind power. In 2020 it accounted for roughly 7 percent of the electricity generated in the country.

The industry has not received as much federal money as wind and solar but sees room for growth. Of the 90000 dams in the country about 2500 produce power. Non-powered dams could produce enough power for 9 to 12 million homes said an estimate by the Electric Power Supply Association based on federal data from 2012.

In southwestern Pennsylvania Rye Development a Boston-based hydropower company is adding turbines to eight dams to generate electricity. The company says the improved structures will limit damage to the rivers’ water quality and fish.

Rye is among the companies that sees an opportunity to expand hydropower production at existing dams while working to minimize environmental harms.

Part of the difficulty is that most dams in the U.S. were built more than fifty years ago.

The risk of dam collapses has led to increased dam removals or demolitions in recent years with more than 40 percent of the country’s dam removals in the past century happening in the last ten years.

Last month federal officials moved a step closer to approving what would be the largest dam demolition in U.S. history. Removal of the four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River near the Oregon-California border would help save the river’s salmon and other fish species that cannot reach breeding areas because of the structures.

Ongoing debates

Despite some recent improvements in relations between the hydropower industry and environmental groups there are still disagreements. On Maine’s Kennebec River environmental groups and state environmental agencies are pushing for the removal of four hydropower dams that block endangered Atlantic salmon from reaching key areas. The dams make about 5 percent of the state’s renewable energy.

Shannon Ames of the Low Impact Hydropower Institute said

“It’s very easy for individual river systems to get lost in the message of climate change and the need for renewable energy.”

With drought affecting hydropower production in America’s West the industry has a more direct path to growth in eastern states.

In Pennsylvania Rye met with the Low Impact Hydropower Institute early in its process and is among a small number of companies seeking certification from the group.

To get certified companies must show their structures meet protections for endangered species. The group says its environmental requirements are often stricter than state or federal rules.

But both in 2020 and 2021 the tournament was played without one essential ingredient for sports events: fans.

That changes this week at the newly named Chevron Championship formerly known as the ANA Inspiration.

“Finally. We have been counting down” said Alyssa Randolph tournament manager for the Chevron Championship. “We really look forward to it. I mean fans really bring energy and excitement and the players feed off of that. What a great year to bring that back and we can’t wait to have them.”

The Chevron Championship will be the first major sporting event played in the desert with full ticket sales no vaccination mandate no requirement for proof of a negative COVID-19 test and no mask mandate since The American Express on the PGA Tour played in La Quinta in January of 2020.

Other non-sports events like the Coachella Music Festival and the Palm Springs International Film Festival also have either been canceled or held in modified fashion since the pandemic hit in the spring of 2020.

At both the 2020 tournament rescheduled to September from April and the 2021 event that was held in its traditional April dates the Chevron Championship allowed only members of Mission Hills Country Club onto the Dinah Shore Tournament Course in Rancho Mirage and then only in the backyards of their homes or in homeowners’ association common areas. Ticket sales were eliminated because of state and County of Riverside restrictions on gatherings of large crowds. But those restrictions have been eased as the COVID-19 case numbers have dramatically dropped.

“We are following closely with the state of California and we were advised that the county is following State of California guidelines on the mega events which we fall under” Randolph said. “That’s outdoor sporting events for more than 10000 people need to require (stiffer protocols). So we don’t have 10000 people per day so we are just following state guidelines on this.”

While fans won’t need to be vaccinated to buy tickets because of local regulations others at the tournament will need to be tested or vaccinated under LPGA protocols including amateurs playing in the tournament’s pro-am. That’s because pro-am players will be in relatively close contact with the LPGA pros.

A timeline of the pandemic

Here’s a recap of some of the major sporting events that have been canceled or postponed with their restrictions when they were played since the pandemic hit:

March 10 2020: The BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament is canceled one day before the event was to begin play. The tournament discussed rescheduling for later in the year but the tournament was not played in 2020.

March 12 2020: The Chevron Championship known then as the ANA Inspiration is postponed from its original dates of the first week of April. After a few weeks the LPGA announces the event will be played in September.

Sept. 10-13 2020: The Chevron Championship is played at Mission Hills Country Club under strict protocols that include no gallery at the event. Temperatures are over 100 degrees for the tournament and caddies are given an option of walking the course or riding in carts. Defending champion Jin Young Ko and other South Korean players do not play because of difficulty in traveling.

Jan. 21-25 2021: The PGA Tour’s The American Express tournament is played as scheduled at PGA West in La Quinta but the tournament does not sell tickets to fans and the event’s two nights of concerts are canceled. The event also cancels the three-day pro-am and eliminates La Quinta Country Club from the three-course rotation leaving two PGA West courses operating out of one clubhouse.

March 2021: The BNP Paribas Open is once against postponed but again tournament organizers say they hope to play the event later in the year. By May organizers announce the two-week tennis event will be played in October at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.

April 1-4 2021: The Chevron Championship is played in its traditional dates in April but despite working hard with county officials over protocols the tournament is played for the second year in a row without fans.

Oct. 4-17 2021: The BNP Paribas Open is played for the first time since 2019. Several top players do not enter the tournament and fans have to prove they have been vaccinated in order to buy tickets.

Jan. 20-23 2022: The American Express tournament is played in La Quinta and the tournament again sells tickets and schedules two nights of concerts for Friday and Saturday. Fans must show they are vaccinated or have proof of a negative COVID-19 test within the previous 48 hours. The tournament also reinstates the three-day pro-am and returns to a three-course format with La Quinta County Club again in the event.

March 7-20 2022: Just six months after the rescheduled 2021 event the BNP Paribas Open is played in its usual March dates. Fans are still required to prove their vaccination status to buy tickets but crowds are increased from the October event.

March 31-April 3 2022: The Chevron Championship is scheduled to be played with fans on the course for the first time since 2019. Fans do not have to prove they have been vaccinated or that they have had a recent COVID-19 negative test.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5lbWFibGVuZC5jb20vdGVsZXZpc2lvbi93ZW5keS13aWxsaWFtcy1hY2N1c2VzLWV4LW1hbmFnZXItb2Ytc3BlbmRpbmctZG9sbGFyMTBrLW9uLWhlci1jcmVkaXQtY2FyZC13aXRob3V0LWFza2luZy1hbWlkc3QtdHJvdWJsZXMtYW5kLWxlZ2FsLWFjdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wendy Williams Accuses Ex-Manager Of Spending $10K On Her Credit Card Without Asking Amidst Troubles And ...,"Even amid reports that Wendy Williams is returning to “her old self” health-wise the former daytime talk show host is still fighting legal battles over her finances. She recently called out a former manager and Wells Fargo financial advisor on social media saying that $10000 was charged to her credit card without her consent to purchase the services of an attorney to pursue guardianship over her.

In the weeks since The Wendy Williams Show was officially canceled and it was announced that Sherri Shepherd would take over the time slot with her own show Sherri Williams has continued to defend herself against rumors regarding her mental health and maintained that she is on the road to returning to television . Her finances continue to be a struggle since former financial advisor Lori Schiller claimed to Wells Fargo in February that Williams was “of unsound mind” causing the bank to remove Williams’ access to her accounts. The media personality went on Instagram to express her frustration regarding the situation:

When I began asking questions about my money suddenly Lori Schiller has got no response regarding my money. I want my money. This is not fair. And Wells Fargo has no questions and answers with regarding my money. This is not fair. And Lori Schiller and Wells Fargo have this guardianship petition about keeping me away from my money.

Not only did Wendy Williams say that Wells Fargo started this guardianship without her consent and amid her consistent denials regarding rumors about her mental health she also accused her former manager of using her credit card to retain the services of an attorney.

The former host accused Bernie Young of spending $10000 of her money per The Sun  to try to take over guardianship of her bank accounts. She addressed her former manager’s actions in her post:

And this guy named Bernie Young I know for a fact that Bernie Young used my American Express card to hire an attorney to file a petition against me. That was done with my American Express card. Bernie Young you’re no good and this is not fair at all.

The star fired Bernie Young as her manager earlier this year and although she reportedly wanted “nothing to do with him” Wells Fargo believed he was acting in the former host’s best interests. While The Sun verified the transaction that Williams said took place on her credit card there was no proof that the payment shown in the statement was unauthorized or improper.

The media personality did not appear on The Wendy Williams Show this season as she reportedly battled health problems including COVID and Graves disease. Her condition was reported to be deteriorating with sources claiming in January that she couldn’t dress herself get out of bed without assistance or recognize those close to her. A number of guest hosts took over for her including Leah Remini Michael Rapaport and Sherri Shepherd.

When Debmar-Mercury made the decision to cancel the show they left the door open for Wendy Williams’ possible return to television if and when she was able to. With this being an ongoing situation it's likely that more updates with arrive sooner rather than later."

Companies with high profits and revenue per employee are presumed to be the most successful. Alphabet Microsoft and Meta Platforms owner of Facebook are such companies. These tech companies are among the largest in the United States based on revenue and they are among the youngest large companies. Several were founded in the past 25 years. However a group of relatively small companies leads the list of highest profit per employee.

Data for the recent “Profit per Employee” research paper from software company Tipalti came from the Fortune 500. The paper examined 914 major companies most of which made a profit per employee in the last year. Only 238 reported a loss per employee. The company that has the most profits per employee is Air Lease. The company reported $516 million in profits or $4.3 million per employee.

Air Lease with an employee count of 120 buys passenger planes and leases them to airlines. The process allows carriers that do not have capital access to planes. Air Lease makes its profit largely off the interest it charges these carriers. The company was hurt by the trouble with the aviation industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic but its financials have started to recover.

When the company announced its 2021 results John L. Plueger chief executive officer and president commented: “We had a strong fourth quarter and second half of 2021 that benefited from continuing airline industry recovery as seen in our cash collections operating metrics fleet expansion and record lease placement.”

Air Lease owns 474 planes that it leases to 118 customers in 60 countries. The company is based in Los Angeles. (See if Air Lease is also among the 50 best companies to work for.)

To find the 50 companies with the most profits per employee 24/7 Wall St. reviewed Tipalti’s “Profit per Employee” research paper. Very few of the companies with the highest profit per employee are large tech companies. Meta is highest among these ranking 11th with a profit of nearly $500000 per employee based on over 58000 workers. Several financial firms are ahead of Meta.

Mortgage giant Fannie Mae has profit of $1.5 million per employee based on 7700 workers. This places it second on the list. The third is private equity firm KKR at $1.3 million per employee based on 1583 workers. (Find out if any of the companies on this list were also among the most innovative companies in 2021.)

A 14-year-old boy died after he fell Thursday night from a drop tower amusement ride that recently opened at the Orlando area’s ICON Park entertainment complex authorities said.

Tyre Sampson 14 of St. Louis Missouri fell from the Orlando FreeFall ride described by its operators as the world’s tallest freestanding drop tower the Orange County Sheriff’s Office said.

In video circulating on social media that purportedly shows the incident a person falls from their seat about five seconds into the ride’s drop down the tower as the vehicle decelerates before it reaches the ground.

Deputies were called to ICON Park around 11 p.m. Sampson was taken to a hospital where he died from his injuries the sheriff’s office said. Details about what led to the fall were not immediately released.

Sheriff’s investigators will determine whether the incident was an accident or intentional and from an initial investigation “it appears to be a terrible tragedy” Orange County Sheriff John Mina said.

‘I want to know what really happened’

Sampson was an honor roll student and an aspiring football player his father Yarnell Sampson told CNN. Tyre was visiting Orlando with his football team over spring break his father said.

His son “was a very good young man. He was a big teddy bear a gentle giant” the elder Sampson said adding Tyre was a “kindhearted kid” who would give the shirt off his back to anyone who needed it.

While holding back tears Sampson told CNN he viewed the video of his son’s death on Facebook.

“I saw the video of my son falling down and I couldn’t believe (it). My life stopped” Sampson said.

He added “I want to know what really happened. You know what you know why a 14-year-old young man with a bright future has been taken away from us.”

The FreeFall is a 430-foot-tall tower and ride with a vehicle encircling the tower that takes up to 30 riders to the structure’s top. When the vehicle reaches the top “it’ll tilt forward 30 degrees and face the ground before free falling nearly 400 feet at speeds reaching over 75 mph” ICON Park’s website says. The ride opened around Christmas last year the company said.

The ride passed a safety inspection in December before it was allowed to open according to a safety inspection report obtained by CNN.

The document from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services noted the drop tower passed inspection on December 20 2021. No deficiencies were listed in the report.

The ride was scheduled to be inspected again by FDACS in June midway through the permit year according to the department.

FDACS also stated the owner/operator is responsible for inspecting the amusement ride prior to opening each day of operation.

The boy was secured in the ride’s seat an official with the company that operates the ride told CNN affiliate Spectrum News 13.

“Yes (he was secured in the seat). That’s what we know at this time. So again we operate the ride with all the safety precautions in mind and everything is in place and this is why we’re doing an investigation” John Stine sales and marketing director for the Slingshot Group which operates the ride and two others at the park told Spectrum News 13.

In an interview with CNN Stine said the company is heartbroken over Sampson’s death.

“We are devastated by what happened to this young guest of ours” Stine told CNN Friday.

The ride has been closed until further notice while the incident is investigated and the company said it is working with the sheriff’s office and officials on a full investigation.

“Right now the last thing on our mind is getting the ride operational” Stine said. “We want to find out what happened to this young man and safety is paramount for us both with our guests and our employees.”

Stine said there had never been any problem with the drop tower ride. “We’ve been operational for almost three months. And it’s performed wonderfully. And this is what’s so perplexing” he said.

ICON Park released a statement saying a “tragedy occurred last night at the Orlando FreeFall and our hearts are heavy with sadness.”

“The owner of the attraction is fully cooperating with authorities and ICON Park is doing everything we can to assist” the statement reads.

State agency is investigating

FDACS will investigate issues surrounding the ride and its safety Mina said. The agency has statewide responsibility to inspect all amusement rides in Florida except for those at large parks that have more than 1000 employees and have full-time inspectors on staff.

Its inspectors will be at the site Friday “with our investigation underway” department spokesperson Caroline Stonecipher told CNN.

The sheriff’s office has not gotten previous complaints about the ride Mina said. But he stressed that FDACS would be responsible for examining any such complaints.

What the video shows

The video purporting to show the incident is recorded from the ground just outside the attraction’s gate. Before the ride begins riders sit in their seats with a harness over their shoulders and chest the video shows.

The vehicle eventually starts its ascent. About two-and-a-half minutes later the descent begins.

Roughly five seconds into the drop – perhaps two-thirds down the tower – a person falls from one of the seats as the vehicle decelerates.

People scream and the camera pans to show a body on the brick floor at the tower’s base.

“Call the ambulance! He just fell” someone yells. As the ride lowers to ground level riders plead for workers to let them off.

A worker appears and asks ride attendants whether they are sure they checked the rider. They say that they did.

Spectrum News 13 asked Stine about the harness.

“Our safety harness that goes over the chest of the rider is sufficient and obviously we’re going to look into this further. We’re going to work with all the authorities and that’s all we can share at this point” Stine said according to Spectrum News 13.

ICON Park includes a variety of offerings including rides such as a 400-foot-tall observation wheel; Madame Tussauds Orlando; and SEA LIFE Orlando Aquarium.

A 14-year-old boy from Missouri fell to his death while on a new ride at an Orlando amusement park authorities said.

The incident occurred Thursday shortly after 11 p.m. at ICON Park the Orange County Sheriff's Office said. Deputies responded to a 911 call after the boy fell off the Orlando FreeFall the world's tallest free-standing drop tower at a height of 430 feet according to the park.

The teenager was transported to a local hospital where he died from his injuries the sheriff's office said.

The boy identified by authorities as Tyre Sampson was visiting Orlando from Missouri with a friend's family Orange County Sheriff John Mina told reporters during a briefing Friday afternoon.

The death is believed to be accidental at this stage in the investigation based on videos and witness statements from ""everyone involved"" the sheriff said.

""Our role in this situation is to determine whether or not this is an accident or an intentional act and this does appear just to be a terrible tragedy"" Mina said.

There are no criminal charges filed at this time Mina said. ""We'll see moving forward what [the investigation] results in"" he said.

The sheriff said he did not have any reports of issues with the new attraction but noted that further investigation into the ride's safety will be conducted by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs.

An initial permit inspection of the ride on Dec. 20 2021 found ""no deficiencies"" the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs said. The ride's next inspection would have been after six months of operation it said.

A 4-minute video posted to social media captured the fatal fall which occurred at the end of the ride's descent. Mina said the sheriff's office has viewed the video and flagged to have it taken down.

""Something that awful shouldn't be out there in the public"" he said.

The Orlando FreeFall opened in late December one of two new rides to debut at ICON Park. Up to 30 passengers at a time ride to the top of the tower where they are tilted toward the ground before going into a nearly 400-foot free fall at over 75 mph.

The attraction will be closed until further notice amid the state's investigation.

""We are heartbroken with the incident that took the life of one of our guests"" the ride's operator SlingShot Group said in a statement. ""We extend our condolences and deepest sympathy to his family and friends. We are working with the Sheriff's Office and ride officials on a full investigation.""

ICON Park said that it is also cooperating with authorities.

""A tragedy occurred last night at the Orlando FreeFall and our hearts are heavy with sadness"" the park said in a statement.

The eighth grader was a star football player who was visiting the theme park with his team attorneys for his parents said.

""This young man was the kind of son every parent hopes for -- an honor roll student an aspiring athlete and a kind-hearted person who cared about others"" Ben Crump an attorney for Tyre's father Yarnell Sampson said in a statement. ""A fun theme park visit with his football team should not have ended in tragedy.""

""Every parent who sees this horrific video can't help but think the same thing 'That could have been my child'"" Bob Hilliard an attorney for Tyre's mother Nekia Dodd said in a statement.

The two attorneys ""intend to get answers"" for the family Crump said.

In 2020 another death occurred at ICON Park when an employee fell from the 450-foot-tall StarFlyer swing ride. A federal investigation found that 21-year-old Jacob David Kaminsky wasn't hooked up properly to the ride's safety device when he fell 225 feet while conducting a safety check according to the Orlando Sentinel.

After the United States refused to budge on technical requirements and “sovereign operational restrictions” according to one Emirati official the deal for up to fifty F-35s was canceled in December 2021.

The UAE’s position reveals the tough choices for smaller powers caught between the United States and China. As they shop for the prized jewels of the twenty-first century including top military communications and health technologies countries like the UAE will be forced to choose between state-of-the-art equipment sold by two very different countries.

As the outcome of the F-35 deal demonstrates the United States is very particular about its data. “Even if the F-35 itself is not using this 5G network if the UAE is embracing Huawei 5G technology and using it for ground stations communications towers on bases then that is an opportunity for China to draw a lot of intelligence about the way the F-35 operates” said Emily Harding a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in comments to C4ISRNET.

The risk then? “This is concerning because it is giving an adversary [China] a lot of insight into our highest-functioning airplane.” As Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters back in December “These end-user requirements and protection of US defense equipment are universal non-negotiable and nonspecific to the UAE.”

Having tossed the F-35 deal for now the UAE has set out to demonstrate that it has more partners than the United States. In February the country purchased twelve L15 stealth fighters from China. The UAE is also expecting a delivery of eighty Rafale F4 fighter jets from France later this decade. Of course neither fighter is as good as the F-35 but the point was made: the UAE has other options including China.

Cooperation between the UAE telecommunications industry and Huawei is deep. Emirati telecom company du inked a deal with Huawei to provide 5G network services back in October 2019 according to du’s chief technology officer Saleem Alblooshi. Huawei showed off its capabilities last year in cooperation with du when it broadcast the UAE’s President’s Cycling Cup using 5G. Just a few weeks ago at the Mobile World Congress in Spain Huawei signed an agreement with both du and Emirati telecom firm Etisalat to jointly provide 5G edge computing services which involves moving “traffic and services from a centralised cloud to the edge of the network and closer to the customer” Juniper networks reported. Etisalat and Huawei also successfully tested fiber-to-the-room a fiber optic-based networking solution for hotels and businesses in a multi-story building in February.

The technological partnership doesn’t end there. The two countries established joint laboratories for researching telecommunications and artificial intelligence including the 5G and Internet of Things Joint Open Lab and the China-Emirates Science and Technology Innovation Laboratory (CSET). The CSET lab recently showed off China’s Golden Eagle CR500 helicopter drones and MR40 unmanned aircraft. The UAE plans to add at least ten CR500s and twenty MR40s to its current fleet of Wing Loong I and II drones which were originally based on the American MQ-1 Predator drone.

The UAE is using Huawei to build its own high-tech indigenous telecommunications services not replace them. Referring to a test after the 5G edge computing agreement was signed Khalid Murshed chief technology and information officer at Etisalat said “The success of this testing activity will support UAE industries and the government sector in achieving their digital transformational objectives.”

Other countries have long been involved in the UAE’s communications sector. Etisalat also “is extending its partnership with Amazon Web Services to address the growing demand for digitalisation in key economic industries including oil and gas manufacturing and logistics.” France’s Thales Group which recently created “a 100% Emirati company whose objective is to support the country’s aspirations to develop national industrial autonomy” describes itself as “a long-term partner of the UAE armed forces.” Thales Group also has several educational partnerships with Emirati universities.

The UAE’s cooperation with Huawei like its relationship with other international firms is a means to an end. That doesn’t mean concerns about data security aren’t substantive: in a highly globalized world data security is never guaranteed. At some point the United States will either decide the F-35’s data is too valuable to fall into Chinese hands and decide to limit the Emiratis to lower-tier products or it will reach a compromise. Andreas Kreig a senior lecturer at King’s College London said “It is more likely that the Biden administration will come out with a meaningless concession for the Emiratis to be able to publicly say why they allow the deal to go through. This may include creating the U.S.’s own little hub of data companies in the UAE to compete with Chinese companies.”

Alternatively the alleged concern over Chinese-Emirati ties is a distraction from the real issue: the Biden administration’s disagreement with Emirati foreign and domestic policies. Under the Trump administration the United States was willing to sell F-35s to the UAE even as it waged a determined campaign across the globe to convince countries not to use Huawei. What’s changed is the party in control of the United States and if the Emiratis are unable to convince the Biden administration to sell them the F-35s they will have to wait for another chance in 2024.

Most UAE-China cooperation is economic but increased military intelligence or political ties are worth watching for. The UAE is unlikely to pursue abrupt increases in institutional and operational military ties with the Chinese because of its longstanding participation in U.S.-led exercises and shared security interests with countries such as Greece Egypt and Israel. However that history may not prevent it from cooperating with the Chinese behind the scenes. According to the Wall Street Journal sources the F-35 deal may have ended due to the Emiratis’ willingness to permit the Chinese to operate a military facility near Abu Dhabi likely for intelligence-gathering purposes or to set the foundation for military access. The UAE hosts approximately 3500 U.S. soldiers and according to a Congressional Research Service report UAE ports host more U.S. Navy ships than any other foreign port in the world.

The UAE is a good target for foreign military and intelligence services. In fact if any intelligence relationship is growing quickly it’s the relationship between the UAE and Israel. In the wake of the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords the two countries are sharing Iranian-related intelligence including information related to Hezbollah cyberattacks. It would not be surprising if Israel and the UAE were also sharing intelligence on how to win over the Americans.

Because the UAE doesn’t have the military power to significantly alter foreign policy outcomes alone it relies on its status as a high-tech international economic hub to gain diplomatic leverage. Yet while the United States provides most of the UAE’s fighter jets and air defenses the UAE also knows the United States is not the only game in town.

Earlier this month the EPA cleared the UK-based biotech company Oxitec to release a maximum of roughly 2.4bn of its genetically modified mosquitoes through 2024 expand its existing trial in Florida and start a new pilot project in California’s Central Valley where mosquito numbers are on the rise.

Oxitec’s modified mosquitoes are male and therefore don’t bite. They were developed with a special protein so that when they pair with a female mosquito the only viable offspring they produce are also non-biting males. The project specifically targets the Aedes aegypti mosquito one of more than 3500 mosquito species and a dangerous invasive insect that has spread diseases like dengue Zika Chikungunya and yellow fever in other countries.

The company hopes that releasing its engineered bugs will help control the Aedes aegypti in California where numbers have risen in recent years. The species is already on the move across the state and has been found in 21 counties according to the California department of public health. The state’s devastating drought conditions – with low water levels in pipes and ponds slowed stagnating streams and less rain to flush out water systems – have helped mosquito populations flourish and they love to lurk near houses and communities.

The dangerous diseases aren’t yet spreading in California but the invasive insect has been highlighted by officials as a growing risk.

“It does not belong here and it is environmentally disruptive” said Rajeev Vaidyanathan irector of US programs at Oxitec of the Aedes aegypti. He added that female Aedes aegypti prefer to feed and breed in and around people’s homes and are out biting during the day – making them much more difficult to eradicate with pesticides. “Butterflies and bees are out during the day” Vaidyanathan said. “That makes it very incompatible with traditional mosquito control.”

The company’s so-called “friendly” male mosquitoes are delivered as eggs ready to deploy in a “just-add-water” device which could help curb the high cost typically associated with eradicating the species.

The project which will be carried out in partnership with the Delta Mosquito and Vector Control district in Tulare county still needs to be reviewed by California’s department of pesticide regulation. But Oxitec has already introduced this particular strain of genetically modified mosquitoes in Brazil and is fresh from a first-year trial in the Florida Keys. The company claims to have encouraging results. “Every single larva that carried our gene emerged as an adult male” Vaidyanathan said. “We didn’t have any female emergence.”

Oxitec is now eager to test the technology in a new and changing climate. “There are some fundamental questions we need to answer before we can say this is a viable tool for mosquito control” Vaidyanathan said. “How is that going to affect our boys’ ability to fly? How is it going to affect our boys’ ability to mate?” he said noting that the Central Valley is a “goldilocks” test location due to its arid agricultural landscapes with temperatures that climb past 100F during the summer. “We cannot extrapolate with what we have done in Florida.”

The EPA earlier this month concluded that the test was safe to humans and the environment but stipulated that the mosquitoes cannot be released near any potential tetracycline sources an antibiotic that acts as an antidote. The regulations include within 500 meters of wastewater treatment facilities commercial citrus apple pear nectarine peach growing areas or commercial cattle poultry and pig livestock producers. All the modified insects are equipped with a marker gene that scientists can use to tell them apart from wild ones and regular monitoring will be put in place to ensure the experiment is going to plan.

Still the pilot has encountered some resistance. Citing concerns about possibly unforeseen consequences and a lack of transparency critics are calling on California regulators to pull the plug.

“The science was incomplete before the first rollout” said Dana Perls the food and technology program manager with Friends of the Earth of the trial in Florida. She said California and Florida should not be taking risks with experimental biotechnology and said a lack of publicly released data from the field trials in Florida made it hard to gauge the project’s success.

Close to 13000 comments were issued to the EPA in opposition to the project’s expansion this year the bulk of them signatures collected by the advocacy organizations Friends of the Earth the Institute for Responsible Tech and the Center for Food Safety.

“There’s no such thing as 100% effective in science” Perls said. “Yet the public is being asked to trust that Oxitec’s experiment will work and no GE female mosquitoes will survive. But how do we know that?”

Opponents have also raised questions about the modified mosquitoes’ interaction with Tetracycline an antibiotic used in agriculture which can be found in wastewater and works as an antidote enabling female mosquitoes to develop. They fear the complicated interplay could lead to hybrid mosquitoes that are even more difficult to control. “That’s why there needs to be transparency. We need unbiased independent review transparency and public participation” Perls said.

Vaidyanathan said the data has been reviewed by regulators and that company officials had presented findings at conferences across the country. There are plans to release the data to the public after the regulatory process at the federal and state level concludes. “We are following the EPA’s strict guidelines” he said. “Once we get the permits” he added “we can talk about it publicly.”",,,,,,,,,

SUBSCRIBE The Neanderthal in Us Anne-Françoise Pelé When our ancestors Homo sapiens reached Europe between 56800 and 51700 years ago the continent was populated by Neanderthals. After thriving in Eurasia for over 300000 years Neanderthals vanished from the Earth about 40000 years ago. Why did they become extinct? What did humans inherit from Neanderthals? Could archaic genes help us fight diseases? Paleogeneticists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Germany are on a mission to elucidate this prehistoric “cold case.” Image: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural HistoryJohn Gurche/Chip Clark The name Homo neanderthalensis was coined by geologist William King in 1864 after the first specimen of an early human fossil was discovered in the Feldhofer Cave of the Neander Valley in Germany (tal — a modern form of thal — means “valley” in German). Neanderthals are ancient relatives on the hominid family tree. According to Max Planck Institute geneticists modern humans and Neanderthals coexisted in western Europe for up to 5000 years and degrees of genetic traces from such encounters can still be found in the genome of people outside Africa. On average people living today carry between 1% and 2% Neanderthal DNA. Recent research led by Janet Kelso a computational biologist at the Max Planck Institute has shown that Neanderthal DNA influences variation in skin tone hair color sleep patterns (night cavers and bonfire partygoers you are covered!) and smoking behaviors (smokers blame your Ice Age ancestors!). Similarly segments of Neanderthal DNA found in modern humans would be responsible for the degradation of fats. By bringing together fossil skull data brain imaging and genomics an interdisciplinary research team led by the Max Planck Institute found that Neanderthal genes influence the brain development of modern humans. They affect the shape of the skull and the areas of the brain responsible for planning and coordinating movements. Researchers demonstrated the effects of this Neanderthal DNA on gene activity in the putamen a basal ganglion and in the cerebellum. Several genes that humans received from Neanderthals also play an important role in shaping our immune system. In 2020 researchers at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the Max Planck Institute demonstrated that a segment of DNA that causes their carriers to have an up to 3× higher risk of developing severe Covid-19 is inherited from Neanderthals. Six months later the same team showed that Neanderthals also contributed a protective variant and half of all people outside Africa carry a Neanderthal gene variant that reduces the risk of needing intensive care for Covid-19 by 20%. During their research they also found that the same gene variant that increases the risk of falling seriously ill with Covid-19 reduces a person’s risk of contracting HIV by 27%. Whether it is genesis or genetics that underlies our thinking prehistoric legacy is invoked to draw lessons about who we essentially are.

READ NOW Let the Memory Live Again Brian Santo At a point in the future that might be nearer than many expect the industry is going to need an entirely new data storage medium to store hundreds of terabytes probably petabytes and maybe even exabytes. At the moment each of the three likeliest possibilities is more exotic than the next. They’re holograms 5D quartz and DNA. The relentlessly growing surge of data that must be transmitted processed and stored is a constant challenge. The industry anticipates that moving from electronics to photonics will be the path to growth in transmission throughputs and processing speeds but storing photons is not an option. So how to move beyond semiconductor memory? Holograms have been around for decades but holographic memory still needs quite a bit more R&D work. The basic concept is to store images in crystals. To read a beam is trained on the crystal and a high-res camera captures the image; the image data gets translated back into digital data. Multiple images can be stored in the same volume; change the angle of the beam to read different images. Lithium niobate crystals are rewriteable. The fundamental concept of 5D storage harks back to compact disks and DVDs. Recording CDs requires making physical pits on a flat medium. To read illuminate the surface with a laser. Is there a pit? Yes-or-no is one-or-zero. That’s 2D. DVDs work the same way but they have multiple layers. That’s 3D. The medium for 5D is a specialty quartz. A laser reader notes not just whether or not there’s a pit but also the optical property of birefringence. As the name suggests birefringence has two states. Now we’re at 5D. Developers say it’s possible to store eight bits in a single pit. If the technology can be perfected a 12-inch crystal platter could hold hundreds of terabytes and the medium would be stable for a thousand years. DNA storage leaves traditional electromechanics behind. DNA consists of strands of the amino acids adenine guanine cytosine and thymine (AGCT) which can be combined in endlessly variable order and can be correlated to binary digits (bits). Strands of AGCT can be assembled stored in liquid and read out. While 5D quartz can be expected to last a thousand years there’s an example of DNA being sequenced from the tooth of a mammoth that died a million years ago. By one estimate 4 grams of DNA could hold all the data the entire world could generate in one year. At the moment DNA storage is a lab curiosity exorbitantly expensive slow

and subject to errors from mutation – a novel consideration in electronics. That said the promise of unlimited storage volume and astonishing longevity of DNA has all of the biggest data center operators monitoring the technology. There are at least 20 organizations who say they can perform DNA storage. DNA storage companies have attracted over $1 billion in funding since 2020. Gene Therapy Isn’t Science Fiction Barbara Jorgensen If you know nothing else about genes you know that they are microscopic and complex and differentiate humans from amoebae. In addition to determining features such as hair and eye color in humans genes can also cause disease. Gene therapy seeks to correct defective genes to manage a variety of health conditions. Science fiction has had a field day with genetic manipulation — think “Jurassic Park” — but adding inhibiting editing or replacing genes are bona-fide medical treatments. Within a gene DNA can be modified to manage blood disorders vision loss cancer heart disease diabetes and cystic fibrosis. CRISPR is perhaps the best-known technology in the field: It’s a tool for editing genomes allowing researchers to easily alter DNA sequences and modify gene function. But in laboratories electronic equipment does a lot of the heavy lifting. Centrifuges incubators and freezers are typical lab instruments. Then there’s process automation which can increase sterility levels in fluid transfer and eliminate manual handling. A sample taken from a patient for example may be returned to that patient after it’s been processed. Sensor technology and analytics increase the scalability of equipment and therapies and reduce time and headcount. The first successful nuclear gene transfer in humans (approved by the National Institutes for Health) was performed in 1980. To date more than 2600 clinical trials in gene therapy have been conducted. China has become the dominant location for gene therapy trials due to the nation’s expanding research ecosystem and significant governmental support for emerging technologies. China is the only country in the top five — U.S. China U.K. Germany France — where non-industry sponsored trials outnumber industry-sponsored trials (73% versus 27%). One therapeutic success story centers around vision loss. Researchers identified a gene — RPE65 — associated with blindness and used a harmless virus to insert a healthy gene underneath a patient’s retina. In 2017 the U.S. FDA approved voretigene neparvovecrzyl (marketed as Luxturna) for the treatment of any heritable retinal dystrophy caused by the mutated RPE65 gene. The cell and gene therapy market was valued at $4.99 billion in 2021 according to research firm Arziton; the segment is forecast to reach $36.92 billion by 2027 with a CAGR of 39.6%. Key players are Gilead Sciences Novartis Smith Nephew Amgen Organogenesis Roche (Spark Therapeutics) Dendreon Vericel and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Why So Blue? Stefani Muñoz When I first adopted my puppy back in 2021 many of those around me inquired whether she was part chow. When I asked why they thought so they would say it was because part of her tongue was blue which is characteristic of the chow chow breed. One Embark DNA test later and lo and behold — my puppy was indeed part Chow. I then began to wonder why exactly chows have blue tongues while many other canine breeds don’t. It’s said that chows originated in China about 2000 years ago first appearing in Chinese artifacts dating as far back as 206 B.C. Many historians believe that chow chows were the inspiration behind the design of the stone lion statues that commonly guarded Buddhist temples and it’s said they were considered “war dogs” often named “man kou” meaning “dog of the Barbarians.” According to Chinese legend when Earth was created and the first stars were placed into the heavens parts of the sky fell to the earth. Chows deemed ever-curious creatures licked the blue pieces of sky from the ground staining their tongues deep blue. Other sources claim the breed’s blue-tinged tongues were inherited from bears. Turns out it comes down to their genetics — more specifically their pigment cells. Similar to humans a canine’s genetic code determines both the type and amount of pigment cells present depending on the genetic makeup of their parents. There are two primary pigments found within canines that determine not only the color of a dog’s tongue but also their eyes nose and so on: eumelanin and phaeomelanin. Eumelanin produces a black color while phaeomelanin produces a red color. It’s important to note however eumelanin determines the color of a canine’s nose tongue lips and eyes whereas phaeomelanin determines the color of fur. The reason behind chow’s blue tongues is the presence of excess eumelanin within the mucous membranes of their tongues. A deeply blue tongue is an indicator that a chow is purebred while only a partially blue tongue could indicate that the chow contains some other time of canine DNA. Chows aren’t the only dog to exhibit blue tongues nor the only mammal: Blue tongues are common in the Chinese Shar Pei Eurasier and Thai Ridgeback as well as polar bears giraffes and blue-tongued lizards.

Today Denis is general manager of Innoscience Europe (a subsidiary of Innoscience) and is directly responsible for Innoscience’s GaN business and marketing in Europe and the USA. What personal projects will you be working on this weekend Denis? I am currently working on a project with my 11 year-old son that involves building up and programming a mini-robot. Sometimes I actually think I am more into it and excited to see the mini-robot moving under our instructions than my son is. How do you talk about technology with your kids? Together with them I like to disassemble electronic devices and explain to them the components inside and their high level functions (e.g. camera microprocessor power devices and so on). By means of electronic kits for kids I also show them how electronics works. It’s great fun and educational too. Who was (or is) your mentor? I had several leaders and mentors in my career. I was taught how to be an inspirational leader and I was taught the importance of building up true relationships that go beyond business. This mentor taught me not to accept any easy explanation and more importantly to always question results. Who is your favorite musician writer or artist? I like all types of music with a strong preference towards (hard) rock music and particularly [Italian rockstar] Vasco Rossi Queen Iron Maiden Metallica… you could say I like energetic music. What is the biggest threat to society posed by technology today? I think the biggest threat posed by technology today is to lose the human contact and interaction which is increasingly being substituted by virtual interactions. It is something we need to be mindful of. What advice would you give to early-career engineers? Firstly I’d say they need to be curious and passionate about their work… or to ensure they only work on what they are curious and passionate about. It might sound like a cliché yet that is what moves me and that is what makes me go the extra mile… without feeling as though it was a chore. I am fascinated passionate and almost in love with GaN semiconductor technology – and what you can make with it. A second piece of advice is to listen: listen to the market listen to your customers listen to your fellows etc… and adapt accordingly. My third piece of advice would be to make plans of what you want to do and achieve (both at a high level and a low level) get to work and get things done.

The winners were revealed this evening at the 94th Annual Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles.

“On behalf of everyone at Apple we are so grateful to the Academy for the honors bestowed on ‘CODA’ this evening” said Zack Van Amburg Apple’s head of Worldwide Video. “We join our teams all over the world in celebrating Siân Troy the producers and the entire cast and crew for bringing such a powerful representation of the Deaf community to audiences and breaking so many barriers in the process. It has been so rewarding to share this life-affirming vibrant story which reminds us of the power of film to bring the world together.”

“CODA”

Seventeen-year-old Ruby (Emilia Jones) is the sole hearing member of a Deaf family — a CODA or “child of Deaf adults.” Her life revolves around acting as an interpreter for her parents (Marlee Matlin Troy Kotsur) and working on the family’s struggling fishing boat every day before school with her father and older brother (Daniel Durant). But when Ruby joins her high school’s choir club she discovers a gift for singing and soon finds herself drawn to her duet partner Miles (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo). Encouraged by her enthusiastic tough-love choirmaster (Eugenio Derbez) to apply to a prestigious music school Ruby finds herself torn between the obligations she feels to her family and the pursuit of her own dreams.

“CODA” is written and directed by Siân Heder produced by Vendôme Pictures and Pathé with Philippe Rousselet Fabrice Gianfermi Patrick Wachsberger and Jérôme Seydoux serving as producers and Ardavan Safaee and Sarah Borch-Jacobsen as executive producers.

In this way more and more users will now be able to make subscriptions to hardware for the first time ever as compared to only digital services.With that being said the venture is still in its early development phase as confirmed by unnamed sources who chose not to be identified.With the adoption of hardware subscriptions the company hopes to embark upon a major strategy shift. After all Apple has solely relied upon selling its devices at full costs via carrier subsidies or perhaps with the help of installments.But what benefit will this bring to Apple at the end of the day?Well tech experts believe the move will assist the company in producing more revenue while making it so much easier for consumers to spend thousands on a range of new devices.Last year statistics proved how the Apple iPhone was responsible for producing the greatest sales while generating nearly $192 billion in the previous year which was more than half of the company’s total revenue.The general idea is to make the purchasing of iPhones or an iPad equivalent to the payment of iCloud storage or subscriptions of Apple Music on a monthly basis.Apple confirmed how it plans on allowing consumers the freedom to subscribe to hardware too with the company’s ID and app store account that they already use to purchase apps or subscribe to a number of services today.Instead of the classic installment program users can expect to pay just a monthly fee charge whose rate solely depends upon the device chosen.While Apple is certainly not the first to push forward with hardware subscriptions the decision to do so is being keenly observed by critics around the globe.Read next: Apple Continues Its Green Bonds Initiative Plans to Use Carbon Free Aluminum in iPhone SE,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYXBwbGUtaWNsb3VkLWNsYXNzLWFjdGlvbi1zZXR0bGVtZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple class action lawsuit: Company to pay $14.8M to iCloud subscribers in settlement,"Those of us who signed up for recurring 99 cent payments to Apple for more iCloud space years ago might get some of that money back soon.

That’s because Apple apparently breached its own terms of service resulting in the company agreeing to pay out a $14.8 million class action settlement per Macworld . The specific violation was that Apple apparently stored some iCloud data on third-party servers instead of its own. Apple continues to deny any wrongdoing but that isn’t stopping it from shelling out cash to make the problem go away.

According to the terms of the settlement  this applies to folks who paid any additional money for extra iCloud storage from Sept. 16 2015 to Jan. 31 2016. You also needed to have a U.S. mailing address attached to your iCloud account during that time so customers outside the States won’t get anything.

Folks who still subscribe to an iCloud storage plan will get the money through their Apple account while anyone who has since cut off the subscription will get a check in the mail.

The monthly fees for iCloud storage back then ranged from 99 cents for 50 GB of cloud space to $10 for 1 TB of space. That part is important because how much money you’ll get back depends on how much you paid during those few months the settlement is zeroing in on.

SEE ALSO: Apple and Amazon are changing the way we watch live sports

You probably shouldn’t expect a huge amount of money from this either way though. That $14.8 million sounds like a lot but once it’s dispersed among everyone who paid for iCloud storage a few years ago it could wind up being a check for $2.79.

Still free money is free money. All it took was for Apple to possibly compromise your personal data a little bit."

In a new video on his channel YouTuber and bodybuilder Will Tennyson met up with Ohlsen during the final week of the CrossFit Open and joined him in the 22.3 qualifier. This workout a variation on the ""Fran"" staple in CrossFit consists of:

21 pullups

42 double-unders

21 thrusters

18 chest-to-bar pullups

36 double-unders

18 thrusters

15 bar muscleups

30 double-unders

15 thrusters

""I think it's going to be short and spicy"" says Ohlsen. ""The regular Fran workout is a sub-2 minute workout. Increasing the difficulty a little bit it's gonna add a little bit of time but not a ton."" He estimates that he will need around five minutes to get through the entire thing—but actually completes the workout in 4:27 which he hopes will be enough to make him eligible for this year's CrossFit Games.

Then it's Tennyson's turn to take on the 22.3. He admits that he is trying a modified version which removes the double-unders substituting regular jump rope reps instead. ""This sucks but I kind of love it"" he says midway through the workout. ""These are fucking brutal man."" By the time he reaches the muscleup portion Tennyson is too fatigued to complete 15 reps of the calisthenic move so he switches to another set of chest-to-bar pullups instead.

""He's smoked right now"" remarks Ohlsen when Tennyson completes the workout in 11:57 and immediately drops to the ground. ""I know that feeling all too well.""

""Stuff like this is super super fun because it's difficult and you're not used to it"" says Tennyson once he is able to catch his breath. ""When you're bodybuilding for so long it gets repetitive and you just want to mix things up. To be taken out of your comfort zone so much just getting your ass kicked it feels freaking amazing.""

Rock joked he “could not wait to see Jada in G.I. Jane 2” and Will went onstage. The Oscars went quiet as you could read Will’s lips telling Rock to “keep my wife’s name out of your f****** mouth.” Of course we don’t know for sure what happened between them but it’s probable Jada’s hair and condition is a sensitive topic.

“A gift is pure when it is given from the heart to the right person at the right time and at the right place and when we expect nothing in return” Willow Smith wrote on Instagram. She shared a photo of her mom Jada Pinkett Smith’s shaved head with the inspiring caption this week. Pinkett Smith responded to her daughter writing back: “Willow made me do it because it was time to let go BUT … my 50s are bout to be Divinely lit with this shed.”

Although Pinkett Smith looks truly incredible for any age and stunning with a shaved head she made the big chop for an emotional reason. In 2018 she opened up about her battle with alopecia on an episode of The Red Table Talk. She called her sudden hair loss “terrifying” but felt she had to speak up as people were asking why she was wearing so many turbans.

“I’m been getting a lot of questions about why I’ve been wearing this turban” she said. “Well I’ve been having issues with hair loss. And I’m going to tell you it was terrifying when it first started. And I’m going to tell you I was in the shower one day and it just handfuls of hair in my hands.” Both Pinkett Smith’s mom and Willow listen emotionally as she says she was “shaking with fear.”

She says it’s why she kept cutting her hair into cool dramatic styles. “My hair has been a big part of me” she continues. “Taking care of my hair has been a beautiful ritual and having the choice to have hair or not. But then one day I was like I might not have a choice.”

Back in January 2020 Rep. Ayanna Pressley revealed her bald head in a powerful video about alopecia. There’s no doubt these honest conversations help many women at home dealing with the same condition.

More from Footwear News

The “Savage” rapper shared a photoset on Instagram yesterday that showed her modeling a sleek look suitable for the Houston musician.

For the outfit Thee Stallion went with a pink minidress from Diesel that featured the brand’s emblem in the middle of the garment in shiny chrome. The garment had a high neckline and a halter design.

As for accessories she went with a metallic pink shoulder bag emblazoned with the brand’s signature “D”. Also she wore a pair of multicolored hoops and a couple of diamond rings.

To ground everything she went with a pair of shiny pink pumps from Christian Louboutin. The shoes had a pointed-toe silhouette and had a height of approximately four inches for a modern yet streamlined finish.

When it comes to the “Realer” rapper’s clothing aesthetic she tends to fancy stylish and edgy silhouettes that she displays on her Instagram feed and on stage alike. For example she recently wore a black high-slit strapless gown paired with pointy pumps at the iHeartRadio Music Awards for a fresh take on old Hollywood glamour. Also during New York Fashion Week she wore an all-black leather look consisting of a trench corset and matching mini skirt paired with black pointy booties for a uniform look while sitting front row at the Coach fall 22 runway.

The Grammy winner has also made a new for herself within the fashion industry. In 2020 she created her own capsule collection with Fashion Nova. And in 2019 she became a brand ambassador for Coach.

Ethereum (ETH) wrapped up Saturday at $3100 for the second time since mid-February.

On CoinMarketCap Ethereum was a top 10 trending coin this morning with $3500 the next target.

Technical indicators are flashing green with ETH sitting well above the 50-day EMA.

It was a bullish day for ETH on Saturday with ETH joining the top ten crypto majors in positive territory.

Reversing a 0.29% loss from Friday ETH gained 1.35% on Saturday to end the day at $3146.

Despite the bullish session ETH left the Major Resistance Levels untested. ETH fell short of the First Major Resistance Level at $3172 with a day high of $3154.

Market Sentiment Drives ETH Back to $3100

Broader crypto market sentiment delivered support on Saturday. Following this week’s news of Three Arrows Capital staking 36401 ETH into Lido’s liquidity pool ETH is trending.

ETH Price Action

At the time of writing ETH was up by 0.31% to $3156. A bullish start to the day saw ETH strike an early high of $3170 before easing back. ETH tested First Major Resistance Level at $3171 early on.

A move through February’s high $3283 would bring $3500 into play.

Technical Indicators

ETH will need to avoid the day’s $3129 pivot to make another run on the First Major Resistance Level at $3071. ETH would need the broader crypto market to support another breakthrough to $3170 levels.

An extended rally would test the Second Major Resistance Level at $3196 and resistance at $3200. The Third Major Resistance Level sits at $3263.

A fall through the pivot would test the First Major Support Level at $3104. Barring an extended sell-off ETH should avoid a return to sub-$3000. The Second Major Support Level at $3062 should limit the downside.

Avoiding the day’s pivot would support a run at $3200.

Looking at the EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (above) it is a bullish signal. ETH continues to hold above the 50-day EMA currently at $3007. This morning the 50-day EMA pulled away from the 100-day EMA delivering price support. The 100-day EMA also pulled away from the 200-day EMA bringing the Major Resistance Levels into play.

Avoiding the 50-day EMA would bring $3500 levels into play.

Holding above the 50-day EMA brings $3500 into play.

Ever since her conservatorship battle ended Britney Spears has been very transparent about her mental health daily life — and even what she’s been loving lately. In a recent Instagram post Spears revealed that she’s been obsessing over the hit series Euphoria because it’s been amazing for her mental health.

More from SheKnows

On March 25 Spears posted a 15-second clip to her Instagram of her new favorite show. She posted it with the caption raving about the hit HBO series saying “For MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS WEEK a little while ago I watched this insane amazing show @euphoria … Good God it’s too good !!!! I’m a little behind anyway !!!! Watching this and being entertained by these crazy plots I suddenly felt all my anxiety go away … the show was like meditation !!!! It put a HUGE grin on my face … and if you want to be zen … there’s sound therapy … stillness … yoga… monk retreats … but last but definitely not least train your thoughts to think things that make you SMILE … YES you know THOSE !!!! YOU GOT IT ???? KEEP SMILING !!!!!”

In the clip we see half a scene from the first season of Euphoria with leading ladies Zendaya and Hunter Schaefer shooting a man on fire.

Fans quickly commented on how excited they were that their idol is also a fan of the show with people saying things like “Britney being a Euphoria fan… ok MIND-BLOWING” and “we love a queen with taste.”

According to US Weekly other stars love the HBO show just as much including Megan Fox Leonardo DiCaprio Lizzo and even Reese Witherspoon — and now Spears is on the list!

Not only do we love the fact that Spears is being so open about mental health especially during mental health week but we love that she’s finding activities and outlets for her self-care routine.

Euphoria is a teen-drama reboot available on HBO Max that follows a group of troubled teenagers as they navigate identity trauma relationships and high school. The show stars Zendaya Hunter Schaefer Maude Apatow Alexa Demie Jacob Elordi Barbie Ferreira and Sydney Sweeney to name a few. Almost instantly the show earned a cult following praising it for its honest portrayal of addiction and identity crisis. But it’s also been deemed controversial with many claiming the show glamorizes drug use and mental disorders.

As we said we love that Spears is finding her own self-care routine from binging hit shows to dancing her heart out. Now we’re patiently waiting for another glimpse into her ever-so-fabulous self-care routine.

Moscou n'a pas apprécié les propos de Joe Biden et le fait savoir. Le Kremlin a appelé samedi le président des États-Unis à rester ""réfléchi"" qualifiant ses attaques à l'égard de Vladimir Poutine d'""insultes personnelles"" après qu'il a qualifié Vladimir Poutine de ""boucher"" samedi en visite à Varsovie.

""Un chef d'État doit rester réfléchi"" a réagi samedi soir le porte-parole du Kremlin Dmitri Peskov auprès de l'agence TASS.

""À chaque fois les insultes personnelles de ce genre réduisent le champ des possibles pour nos relations bilatérales avec le gouvernement américain actuel"" a-t-il également mis en garde.

Un Poutine ""dictateur"" pour Biden

Le président des États-Unis avait eu des propos particulièrement véhéments samedi à l'égard de son homologue russe le qualifiant de ""dictateur"" et de ""boucher"" pour les crimes commis selon lui par l'armée russe en Ukraine. ""Cette guerre est un échec pour Poutine"" avait-il lancé alors qu'il se trouve en visite officielle en Pologne.

""Pour l'amour de Dieu cet homme ne peut pas rester au pouvoir "" a-t-il lancé avant que la Maison Blanche ne nuance ses propos assurant que Joe Biden n'avait pas appelé à un ""changement de régime"" en Russie.

Le chef de l'État avait en revanche fait part de son soutien à l'égard du peuple russe assurant qu'il n'était ""pas l'ennemi"" des États-Unis. ""Cette guerre n'est pas digne de vous peuple russe"" avait-il estimé.

Joe Biden qui est actuellement en visite officielle en Pologne où il a rencontré le président polonais Andrzej Duda et aussi échangé pour la première fois avec de hauts responsables ukrainiens depuis le début du conflit a souligné ""l'engagement sacré"" de Washington sur le principe de la défense collective des pays membres de l'Otan en lien avec le conflit en Ukraine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9wZTEuZnIvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9hY2NpZGVudC1kYXZpb24tZW4tY2hpbmUtbGEtZGV1eGllbWUtYm9pdGUtbm9pcmUtcmV0cm91dmVlLTQxMDIwODTSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvcGUxLmZyL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvYWNjaWRlbnQtZGF2aW9uLWVuLWNoaW5lLWxhLWRldXhpZW1lLWJvaXRlLW5vaXJlLXJldHJvdXZlZS00MTAyMDg0LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Accident d'avion en Chine : la deuxième boîte noire retrouvée,"Le Boeing 737-800 de la China Eastern Airlines qui reliait les villes chinoises de Kunming (sud-ouest) et Canton (sud) s'est désintégré ce lundi sur une colline boisée de Wuzhou (sud) dans la province du Guangxi. Les causes de la catastrophe qui a tué la totalité des 123 passagers et des neuf membres d'équipage ne sont pas encore connues. Toutes les personnes à bord de l'avion étaient de nationalité chinoise.

Le premier enregistreur de vol qui contient les conversations dans le cockpit avait été retrouvé mercredi et envoyé à Pékin pour y être analysé. Cette analyse devrait encore prendre plusieurs jours. Dimanche matin un nouvel ""objet cylindrique orange a été déterré"" a indiqué devant la presse Zhu Tao directeur de la sécurité aérienne à l'administration chinoise de l'aviation civile (CAAC).

""Les enquêteurs présents sur place ont confirmé (...) qu'il s'agit de l'unité de stockage de l'enregistreur des données de vol."" Cette deuxième boîte noire contient des informations cruciales comme la vitesse de l'avion son altitude et le cap suivi. ""Si d'autres parties de l'enregistreur ont été sérieusement endommagées l'unité de stockage des données semble relativement intacte"" et ""a été envoyée dans un laboratoire professionnel pour être décodée"" a souligné Zhu Tao.

Données inhabituelles

La télévision publique CCTV a diffusé dimanche des images de sauveteurs récupérant la boîte noire recouverte d'un peu de terre. Elle a été découverte à 15 mètre de profondeur. Les deux enregistreurs de vol désormais retrouvés les enquêteurs devraient obtenir d'ici quelques jours ou semaines de premiers éléments de réponse sur les causes de l'accident. Selon le site spécialisé FlightRadar24 l'appareil assurant le vol MU5735 avait perdu en seulement une minute près de 21.250 pieds (6.477 mètres).

Après une brève remontée il avait plongé à nouveau de 4.625 pieds (1.410 mètres) selon le traceur pour se trouver à 3.225 pieds (983 mètres) du sol. Il s'était ensuite écrasé. D'après plusieurs experts ces données sont relativement inhabituelles. Aucune suspicion ne se porte pour l'instant sur le commandant de bord et ses deux copilotes qui cumulaient respectivement 6.709 31.769 et 556 heures de vol selon China Eastern.

Sur la base d'une enquête préliminaire les états de service de ces pilotes étaient ""très bons"" et leurs situations familiales étaient ""harmonieuses"" avait précisé la compagnie aérienne. Un moment d'hommage aux 132 victimes a été organisé dimanche après-midi pendant trois minutes sur le site de l'accident une colline terreuse et pentue entourée de végétation selon CCTV. Les sirènes ont retenti et des pompiers en combinaison intégrale de protection blanche masque sur le visage ont tenu leur casque rouge sous le bras tout en baissant la tête en signe de respect.

Début des indemnisations

Après avoir confirmé les identités de la grande majorité des victimes grâce à des tests ADN la CAAC avait annoncé samedi que l'ensemble des personnes à bord de l'appareil étaient décédées. Il s'agit du pire accident d'avion depuis 1994 en Chine où la sécurité aérienne est toutefois jugée très bonne par les experts. Maintenant le bilan humain connu le processus d'indemnisation des familles des victimes a commencé a indiqué dimanche Liu Xiaodong le directeur du service communication de China Eastern cité par Chine nouvelle.

Des centaines de sauveteurs et enquêteurs poursuivent leurs recherches sur les lieux du drame. Aidés de pelleteuses ils récupèrent des débris de l'avion des restes humains et tout élément pouvant servir à l'enquête. Près de 34.000 morceaux de l'appareil ont déjà été collectés a indiqué dimanche Zhu Tao le responsable de la CAAC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZnIubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZ3JlZy15ZWdhLXRyb21wJUMzJUE5LW1hZXZhLWdoZW5uYW0tMTAyNDAwNzgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greg Yega trompé par Maeva Ghennam ?

Tout commençait pour le mieux pour les Rochelais qui poussaient vite leurs adversaires à la faute. Harry Glynn sanctionnait l’indiscipline vannetaise (11 pénalités concédées en première période) en assurant trois pénalités dans le premier quart d’heure (2e 4e et 14e). L’écart semblait suffisant pour conforter l’avantage et penser à ajouter les essais à la domination maritime. Mais sur leur première visite dans le camp local les Bretons envoyaient trop facilement le ballon jusqu’à l’aile et le capitaine Clément Vidoni aplatissait en coin (9-5 21e).

Sur le même sujet Rugby (Top 14) : Les Rochelais ne se sont pas trompés Dominateurs en conquête solidaires en défense précis au but les Jaune et Noir ont gagné un match crucial face au Racing 92 (19-0) concurrent plus que direct. Les revoilà dans le top 6

Le danger ne planera pas longtemps au-dessus des têtes rochelaises puisque rapidement Glynn inscrivait un essai (14-5 25e). Le Rugby Club Vannetais ne venait pas souvent dans le camp adverse mais concrétisait ses passages à chaque occasion. Ainsi Alexandre Borie passait une pénalité qui permettait à son équipe de rester au contact (14-8 29e).

« Des détails à régler »

Les hommes de Sébastien Morel arrivaient toutefois à valider leur domination et à donner une ampleur correspondant à leur supériorité grâce à un essai en puissance d’Aleksandre Kuntelia juste avant la sirène (21-8 40e). La deuxième période des Jaune et Noir ne sera pas du même niveau puisqu’ils ne seront quasiment plus jamais en situation de marquer. Au contraire des visiteurs qui jouaient crânement leur chance et revenaient au score avec un essai en bout de ligne de Isma-Elie Sanfo (24-15 60e).

« Nous sommes contents de gagner à Deflandre mais on s’est peut-être vus un peu trop devant à la pause »

Heureusement Borie ratait une pénalité à quelques minutes de la fin qui aurait pu relancer le suspense mais Hugo Aubry ajoutait en fin de match une pénalité longue distance (27-15 80e). Les Rochelais conservent ainsi leur deuxième place grâce notamment à la défaite de Clermont à domicile contre Brive (21-32). « On s’attendait à ce que Vannes vienne ici avec des ambitions. Nous sommes contents de gagner à Deflandre mais on s’est peut-être vu un peu trop devant à la pause. Notre jeu a été moins ambitieux par la suite. Il y a encore quelques détails à régler » analysait le troisième ligne maritime Oscar Jegou."

The space had been transformed by greenery filled with string musicians and dancers creating a “Midsummer Night’s” dreamscape just off Fifth Avenue.

“How is it out there?” Ms. Wintour said adding “You look incredible.”

Then the suspect’s relative is found dead in the gunman’s home,"CNN —

An armed man gave no warning as he walked toward the front of Jesus’ Dwelling Place Church in Pennsylvania on Sunday raised a gun toward the pastor’s face and pulled the trigger.

What happened next may have been divine intervention Pastor Glenn Germany said.

“I’m thankful to God that I’m still here because he definitely pulled the trigger” Germany told CNN affiliate WTAE.

The gunman “attempted to shoot but the firearm failed to discharge” Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement.

The incident in North Braddock was captured on the church’s livestreamed video. Immediately after the gunman pulled the trigger a church member tackled the suspect to the ground.

Police say Bernard Polite tried to shoot a pastor in North Braddock but the gun wouldn't discharge. Jesus' Dwelling Place Church

State police identified the suspect as 26-year-old Bernard Junior Polite.

It’s not clear why the suspect tried to shoot the pastor. Germany said he had never seen the gunman before Sunday WTAE reported.

“All of a sudden I just seen a gun pointing right at me” the pastor told the affiliate. “And at that point all I could do was run for cover.”

As Germany ran and hid behind a lectern the church’s cameraman rushed the gunman and tackled him to the ground according to WTAE. The pastor quickly emerged from behind the lectern and helped subdue the suspect.

Polite faces charges of attempted criminal homicide aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person court records show.

He was arraigned early Monday morning and was denied bail. He is being held at Allegheny County Jail and his preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 13.

It was not immediately clear if Polite has an attorney.

After the attempted shooting at the church police found the body of a man who was shot in Polite’s home Allegheny County police told CNN. The homicide victim was identified as 56-year-old Derek Polite a relative of the suspect from the church incident.

“County Police can confirm Bernard Polite a suspect in a previous incident Sunday morning at a North Braddock church is known to live at the residence where the shooting occurred and is a relative of the shooting victim” police spokesperson Jim Madalinsky told CNN in an email.

“At this point no charges have been filed in connection with the homicide and it remains an active investigation.”

After being introduced by roast master Kevin Hart she was greeted by an overwhelming round of boos coming from the audience. Even after she tried to start her monologue the negative reaction only got louder. It’s a shocking turn of events for the 43-year-old reality star who has been at the top of the world for almost two decades.

While there have been hints that the Kardashian family was losing some of its influence over the years the tide seemed to turn faster during the pandemic. It was hard to feel sorry for wealthy celebrities who were quarantined in their multi-million dollar mansions while the average American experienced a very different side to the lockdown. Now Kim’s appeal only seems geared toward her diehard fans not the masses who have long since moved on.

In January ELLE pointed out that the family’s products are no longer selling out on launch day and the pushback from critics is real. Evoluted believes that Kim’s decline started with her decision to wear the Marilyn Monroe dress at the 2022 Met Gala. From her crash diet to fit the gown to the allegations that the historic piece was torn because the fabric was so delicate. “I’m frustrated because it sets back what is considered professional treatment for historic costume” Sarah Scaturro chief conservator at the Cleveland Museum of Art told The Los Angeles Times. “In the ’80s a bunch of costume professionals came together to state a resolution that historic costumes should not be worn. So my worry is that colleagues in historic costume collections are now going to be pressured by important people to let them wear garments.”

If it’s not the red carpet or their Hulu show The Kardashians Kim seems to be mired in controversy every other month. We’re pretty sure Taylor Swift’s alleged diss track “thanK you aIMee” doesn’t help her image either. The Tortured Poets Department single’s first verse seems to point to Kim right away: “When I picture my hometown / There’s a bronze spray-tanned statue of you / And a plaque underneath it / That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school / And it was always the same searing pain / But I dreamed that one day I could say.” Swift described Kim as a “bully” in her 2019 ELLE essay writing “In my experience I’ve come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet.” Those snake emojis are coming back to haunt Kim.

In the end being too famous is an issue and this is the crossroad Kim finds herself in. Perhaps a step back from the spotlight would do her good — hey it worked for Lindsay Lohan. But she seems to flourish when the attention is on her except maybe this time. Fans are fickle and they can crush you almost as fast as they built you up and Kim has been on quite a long ride.

Revealed on Threads Gunn told fans to ""get ready"" for the July 11 2025 premiere date while fully revealing Corenswet's Superman. The image shows him sitting in what's presumably a Metropolis skyscraper very casually pulling up his boot while an earth shattering event takes places outside.

While this is a fresh new Superman from a fresh new DC Universe the suit itself doesn't appear particularly new as the sacred S symbol and its arms appear dirtied or faded. Though we'd already been shown the logo the new image reveals the rest of the suit and gives fans plenty more to analyze as they try to figure out Gunn's influences ahead of the film's release.

Superman previously Superman: Legacy will be the first film in the rebooted DCU's Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters but it's definitely not an origin story and also features a ton of other DC heroes and villains.

Alongside Corenswet's Superman stands Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane and the film also stars Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho María Gabriela as The Engineer and more. Gunn confirmed these actors will play the roles in other DCU projects too.

Chapter 1 of the DCU also features TV shows and while the exact contents have shuffled a tad since Gunn and co-CEO Peter Safran announced it in 2023 an animated series called Creature Commandos will officially kick off the new universe in late 2024.

Those issues have prevented the Department of Safety and Homeland Security from implementing the program to purchase the cameras for about 1000 officers and set up a central system to store the videos. The total cost budgeted for through fiscal year 2024 is $18 million.

The cameras themselves won’t even be bought until sometime this summer officials said.

Homeland Security Secretary Nate McQueen the former state police superintendent would not agree to be interviewed about the delayed rollout.

But spokesman Arshon Howard said in a written statement that agency officials have “been working diligently to complete the many steps needed to build the program framework. The full framework of this new program is multifaceted and includes contracting drafting regulation vendor selection and hiring and training staff to manage and review data.”

The bottom line though is that for the Dewey Beach shooting and potentially others by police in forces without cameras prosecutors still don’t have that critical tool to help decide whether or not the officers broke the state law for using deadly force. The cameras can also shed light on other controversial police encounters with residents.

More than 20 of the state’s nearly 50 police forces — including New Castle County the second-largest — do have cameras.

Wilmington which has the third-largest force started a bodycam program on its own since the law was passed and Dover is doing the same with an expected start date within weeks Sgt. Mark Hoffman said.

Howard of Homeland Security said other police forces have done so as well but did not specify which ones.

‘Whatever the holdup is in this moment is beyond me’

The revelation that Dewey Beach police state police and some two dozen other agencies still don’t have cameras rankles state Rep. Sherry Dorsey Walker chief sponsor of the legislation that passed in June and was signed by Carney on July 21.

That day Dorsey Walker called the law “a game-changer in police-community relations.”

But this week after learning of the delayed rollout she called the situation “disheartening.” She knew the rollout would take several months but expected cameras to be in use statewide by January at the latest.

“Whatever the holdup is in this moment is beyond me’’ Dorsey Walker said. “But whatever the situation is that’s preventing officers from having these cameras we need to figure that out sooner than later because the cameras are to protect the community as well as the officers. But if the camera is not activated then what is the protection for both?”

Attorney General Kathy Jennings whose office includes the Department of Civil Rights and Public Trust that investigates all police shootings and use of force that results in serious injury would not comment on the delay.",,,,,,,,,,,,

After finishing once-abandoned projects in Las Vegas and amassing a big portfolio of office space real estate investor Ofir Hagay has taken on a new venture: developing warehouses.

And for his first project he picked an area of Southern Nevada that is gaining momentum after years of not seeing much: Apex Industrial Park.

Hagay founder of Moonwater Capital and Weston Adams CEO of Western States Contracting told me they teamed up to develop an industrial park in Apex that would consist of multiple buildings on roughly 300 acres.

They are doing infrastructure work and hope to break ground on the first building which would span more than 900000 square feet in the fourth quarter this year Hagay said.

Apex off Interstate 15 at U.S. Highway 93 in North Las Vegas offers thousands of acres for potential projects but remains mostly empty desert. The main reason brokers and developers have said has been a dearth of infrastructure in the remote business park.

But utility service has been expanding to Apex and amid a warehouse boom that has depleted the tally of potential project sites in the valley and pushed up land prices Apex is seeing more construction plans.

Adams who has extensive land holdings in Apex and is mining a mountain there for construction materials previously teamed with the city of North Las Vegas on a water-pipeline project in the park.

Underscoring the need for basic utilities when the city announced the 12-mile surface pipeline’s groundbreaking ceremony in summer 2018 its news release said: “Decades-old problem solved: Water coming to North Las Vegas’ Apex Industrial Park.”

Adams told the Review-Journal last month that power also has been installed in the area and that he has designs for other infrastructure including sewer and gas.

“It finally feels like everyone’s moving in the same direction in Apex” he said.

Hagay — whose past projects include partnering to buy finish and sell The Gramercy a once-abandoned mixed-use project in the southwest valley previously called ManhattanWest — said the venture with Adams marks his first industrial development.

Southern Nevada has seen a yearslong warehouse-construction boom that has ramped up since the pandemic hit as the coronavirus outbreak sparked an accelerated shift to online shopping that has fueled more demand for distribution space.

“When you see what’s going on around us everything today is driven by deliveries” Hagay said.

He and Adams aren’t the only ones to venture to Apex lately.

Among them VanTrust Real Estate acquired around 350 acres at the southern edge of Apex a year ago with plans to develop a 4.5 million-square-foot industrial park and aluminum beverage can maker Ball Corp. unveiled plans last September for a new facility in Apex that according to the city would span more than 750000 square feet.

Amy Ogden an industrial-property broker with Logic Commercial Real Estate said Friday that land prices have climbed in Apex but remain much lower than in the Las Vegas Motor Speedway area a spot that’s been flooded with warehouse construction lately.

Lately she hasn’t heard anyone rule out a project in Apex. As recently as two years ago Ogden said it was “never a consideration.”

Investors hoping for a continued rally in the stock market following its first-quarter decline of as much as 12% may get just that over the next few weeks according to a Friday note from Bank of America.

The bank's widely-followed bull/bear indicator fell to the 2.0 ""buy"" level this week which has historically led to strong three-month forward returns for the global stock market. The last time the contrarian buy signal flashed was on March 18 2020 just a few days before the stock market bottomed amid the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The idea behind a contrarian buy or sell signal is to go against the wisdom of the crowd and do the opposite of what everyone else is doing before they ultimately follow your lead. BofA's indicator is flashing extreme bearish sentiment based on various internal market indicators suggesting that selling in the stock market is at or near exhaustion and prices could move higher as buyers begin to regain momentum.

Some of the indicators tracked by BofA's bull/bear system includes cash levels among investment managers bond and stock outflows from funds and equity breadth or participation of the average stock amid the market's broader upward or downward trend.

The bull/bear indicator has flashed eight buy signal since 2013 and since 2002 the signal has generated a median three-month forward return of 8% for global equities according to BofA. And in the months after BofA's contrarian buy signal flash stocks tended to outperform bonds and high-yield bonds tended to outperform government bonds illustrating the potential for a shift to a risk-on environment going forward.

But any subsequent rally in the stock market over the next few weeks should be viewed as an ""epic selling opportunity"" BofA said. That's because an ongoing shock in rising inflation higher interest rates and lower corporate earnings growth means the S&P 500 is more likely to trade below 4000 than it is to trade above 5000 in 2022 according to the bank.

BofA doesn't expect those shocks to get better anytime soon noting that recent producer price inflation readings suggests new inflation records are likely in the coming months. Meanwhile interest rate shock is poised to get worse as the Fed strongly considers 50 basis point rate hikes at its next meeting.

""Asset prices are driven by two things and two things only... rates and earnings"" BofA explained. The bank found previous periods when earnings growth decelerated while inflation and interest rates surged and they happened with a struggling stock market.

During those time periods the S&P 500 ""struggled bigly"" falling 11% 30% and 12% in 1969 1974 and 1977 respectively according to BofA.

But investors can navigate the strained macro backdrop throughout the 2020's by lowering their return expectations and owning small-cap growth European and strategic interest stocks BofA said.

What went wrong?,"John Monk

The State (Columbia S.C.)

Columbia S.C. — Everyone trusted Alex Murdaugh.

But for 10 years without anyone noticing or reporting publicly the disgraced South Carolina attorney allegedly stole $4 million from clients and embezzled cash from a client trust account held by his former Hampton law firm.

From 2011 to 2021 in 30 different transactions Murdaugh looted Peters Murdaugh Parker Eltzroth and Detrick’s Client Trust Account of millions of dollars and funneled clients’ money into personal bank accounts where he laundered the cash for his own use according to an analysis of theft charges in indictments against him.

In South Carolina’s storied legal profession strict rules govern how a law firm must keep client money safe.

But for 10 years not one partner in Murdaugh’s firm noticed anything wrong.

How was Murdaugh able to take money out of his firm’s accounts without notice? Several factors might have been in play:

His firm had few financial controls to guard against in-house embezzlements by lawyers. The firm recently told reporters with The State and the Island Packet and Beaufort Gazette that since learning of Murdaugh’s action the firm has “revamped” its procedures and now has strict financial security controls in place.

An atmosphere of trust surrounds lawyers in general and Murdaugh in particular. Murdaugh used that trust to keep his clients ignorant of money due to them in various settlements according to indictments.

Murdaugh used banks where he had checking accounts that enabled him to launder money stolen from clients according to indictments. One bank was the Palmetto State Bank headquartered in Hampton and a few blocks away from where his former law firm is located. The other bank was the Bank of America where Murdaugh had sham accounts he used to launder stolen cash indictments said.

“He was a lawyer and people trust their lawyer” said state Rep. Justin Bamberg a lawyer who is representing several of Murdaugh’s alleged financial victims. “Add to that the power of the Murdaugh name. It’s a powerful family name in the area and a lot of people talk about how big and powerful the Murdaugh firm was.”

In early September when Murdaugh’s law firm said it discovered he had been taking money the firm forced his resignation and reported the alleged theft to the State Law Enforcement Division and the South Carolina Supreme Court. Days later on Sept. 8 the South Carolina Supreme Court suspended Murdaugh’s law license.

Murdaugh was sued by his firm in October. His former partners alleged Murdaugh “submitted false documentation to the firm and to clients that allowed him to funnel stolen funds into fraudulent bank accounts.”

The firm did not explain in its lawsuit how exactly Murdaugh stole clients’ money.

It did not say how much money was missing or how long the thefts had been going on.

“I am immensely sorry to everyone I’ve hurt” Murdaugh wrote in a Sept. 6 statement released through his lawyers saying the grisly June shooting deaths of his wife Maggie and son Paul caused him to make regrettable decisions.

Murdaugh now sits in Richland County’s Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center charged with dozens of financial crimes.

He is unable to post his bond set at $7 million one of the highest in state history. Altogether Murdaugh so far faces 75 charges for schemes to defraud victims of $8.49 million that are included in 15 state grand jury indictments announced in November December January and March by the South Carolina Attorney General’s office.

No date has been set for trial.

His lawyer Dick Harpootlian has said Murdaugh is innocent until proven guilty.

Murdaugh was a South Carolina legal lion and the former president of the South Carolina Alliance for Justice the state’s pre-eminent trial lawyers’ group. He was the fourth-generation lawyer in a powerhouse law firm started by his great-grandfather who not only was a lawyer but also the elected solicitor or chief prosecutor in a five-county Lowcountry region that includes Allendale Beaufort Colleton Hampton and Jasper counties.

His father and grandfather also named Randolph Murdaugh also were elected solicitors.

“For over a century the Murdaugh name was trusted. It wasn’t just synonymous with the law — the Murdaugh name was the law” said Michael DeWitt who for nearly 18 years has been managing editor of the weekly Hampton Guardian. “The Murdaugh firm was who you turned to if you were hurt or wanted to file a lawsuit or if you had somebody in your family in criminal trouble you might turn to the Murdaughs and say ‘Hey can you help me out?’”

DeWitt is working on a book about the history of the Murdaugh dynasty.

“If you grew up in Hampton County like I did for three generations” DeWitt said “there was trust in the name of Murdaugh.”

How did Murdaugh get past his own law firm?

To some extent Murdaugh’s law firm appears to have operated on an honor system when handling client’s accounts.

“Partners in that firm especially legacy partners (a partner related to the firm’s late founder) such as Alex Murdaugh were not second-guessed or questioned when they requested checks to be written for client matters or client settlements” said a source familiar with how Murdaugh influenced his former firm’s check writing.

Numerous theft indictments against Murdaugh aren’t specific but said he “caused a check” to be written and disbursed from the firm’s client trust account in a way that could start the process of laundering them into money he put to his own use.

In one case in December 2011 Murdaugh “caused a check” from the firm’s Client Trust Account to be written with the description “Settlement Proceeds: Natasha Thomas” in the amount of $325000 and to be made out to Palmetto State Bank an indictment said.

“Murdaugh then used the $325000 trust account check — which was supposed to be compensation to Thomas for her injuries — to purchase a money order payable to a (Murdaugh) family member. Instead of compensating Thomas Murdaugh ... converted the money to his personal use” the indictment said.

That 2011 alleged embezzlement was Murdaugh’s first theft indictments said.

Lawyers said Murdaugh’s former firm likely held millions of dollars at times in client trust accounts.

The highly sought-after firm regularly won high-dollar settlements and sizable verdicts in lawsuits where plaintiffs sued corporations and wealthy defendants in personal injury wrongful death and medical malpractice cases. Although clients’ money is often kept in one account in firms like Murdaugh’s software keeps track of each individual client’s incoming and outgoing cash lawyers said.

Same as the firm the firm’s clients never noticed Murdaugh was taking their money.

Bamberg said Murdaugh appears to have made sure his victims who were due settlement money received at least one initial payment. Then Murdaugh took additional money that came in later to the Client Trust Account — money that the client didn’t know about Bamberg said. Money for clients from settlements often comes in various payments over time he said.

“Alex cherry-picked what he stole” Bamberg said.

In response to a series of reporters’ questions the firm said it has since taken steps to avoid a repeat of what happened.

A firm spokesman said after discovering Murdaugh’s “criminal activities” last fall it consulted with accounting and ethics experts and updated its financial practices.

“We are confident that our current methods and procedures are greatly improved and adequate to safeguard our clients’ funds. We will not allow a reoccurence of the unfortunate recent events” the spokesman said.

The firm said it also created a new position to oversee its enhanced security measures and has worked “diligently to make our clients whole.”

Asked what security procedures it had in place when Murdaugh worked there the firm declined to answer

“Somebody at the firm is supposed to be overseeing the accounting books things that should have been in place to protect the firm and the trust account money” said Lee Coggiola the former head of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel who said lawyers’ professional rules require law firms to maintain proper accounting procedures to safeguard money.

“It’s the responsibility of the managerial authority in the firm to assure there are practices in place to protect client money. A law firm could not be sanctioned for missing money but individual lawyers in the firm who are responsible for the trust account could be” Coggiola said.

John Nichols who now heads the Office of Disciplinary Counsel declined to comment recently when asked whether his office is investigating Murdaugh’s firm for not having proper safeguards to prevent lawyer theft citing pending investigations.

Murdaugh’s partners and others at his law firm likely had no reason to know he might be looting the Client Trust Account said Eric Bland a Columbia lawyer who sued Murdaugh on behalf of two of his alleged victims the sons of the Murdaugh’s deceased housekeeper Gloria Satterfield.

“As lawyers we always trust our partners. We think the best of them. And in all fairness to some of Alex’s partners they are busy practicing law and doing a damn good job for their clients” Bland said.

However Bland conceded “I have a small firm and I know every dollar that’s going in and out. But if you put 18 to 20 lawyers together especially a firm like that where money is in the millions and millions of dollars you have to have checks and balances. And maybe they grew faster than their ability to have checks and balances.”

How Murdaugh used the banks

Trust was a key way in how Murdaugh operated.

Over and over again state charges against him mention that he relied on “his prestige and reputation as a lawyer” to steal client’s money.

Murdaugh had bank accounts at Palmetto State Bank that he used to deposit large checks from the firm’s Client Trust Account and to begin the process of laundering the money for his own use according to state grand jury indictments.

“Our firm has a decades-long relationship with Palmetto State Bank a locally-owned community bank. We were unaware that Alex Murdaugh used the trust developed through that relationship to steal from our clients” said attorney Lee Cope in a statement on behalf of Parker Law Group the new firm recently formed by many lawyers in the old Murdaugh firm.

In another case on Jan. 21 2014 Murdaugh “caused a check” for $50684 to be written from the firm Client Trust Account and made out to Palmetto State Bank. The check was for the estate of Donna Badger who had been killed in a car accident according to a December indictment against Murdaugh.

“Relying on his prestige and reputation as a lawyer” Murdaugh then deposited the $50684 trust account check into his personal account at Palmetto State Bank and converted the money for his own use the indictment alleges.

Prosecutors allege that between 2011 and 2013 Murdaugh took $1.87 million from his law firm’s trust account in various checks madethe check payable to Palmetto State Bank and then converted the money for his own use to pay back family members outstanding debts and obtain cash.

Palmetto State Bank declined to comment on allegations Murdaugh used the bank to steal and launder money.

“The bank is unable to discuss matters that involve its customers’ accounts and matters that are the subject of pending claims” said G. Trenholm Walker a lawyer for Palmetto State Bank.

Russell Laffitte a member of a longtime Hampton banking family was CEO of Palmetto State Bank since 2020.

He was fired earlier this year after it came to light that he served as legal representative for some of the victims who had their money allegedly stolen by Murdaugh.

Laffitte is currently cooperating with law enforcement his lawyers said.

After about 2015 Murdaugh stopped using Palmetto State Bank and set up checking accounts in the Bank of America according to indictments.

One Bank of America account was created under the name of “Richard A Murdaugh Sole Prop DBA Forge” said lawsuits and indictments. Forge is a respected financial consulting company but Murdaugh appropriated the name for his own purposes the company has said.

In yet another example on Oct. 7 2015 Murdaugh had a check written from the firm’s Client Trust Account for $338056 to be made out to his personal Forge account at the Bank of America an indictment said. A note on the check contained the description “Proceeds for Investment — Deon Martin” who had been injured in an accident.

Murdaugh “had created this bank account for the purpose of misappropriating funds belonging to others with the illusion that the money was being paid to the legitimate company Forge Consulting” the indictment said. Once the money was in the Forge account Murdaugh “converted the money to his own personal use for expenses including but not limited to credit card bills cash and checks written to himself and associates” the indictment said.

In December one of Murdaugh’s alleged theft victims sued the Bank of America alleging it had failed to properly vet Murdaugh’s sham accounts and “aided and abetted Murdaugh’s financial crimes and money laundering.”

Murdaugh had two Bank of America accounts labeled “Forge” the lawsuit said.

“Bank of America is the bank of the money launderer. ... Bank of America is America’s bank of fraud” said the lawsuit filed by lawyers Bland and Ronnie Richter on behalf of Satterfield’s heirs.

Bank of America has denied the allegations.

In early March Bland and Richter reached a confidential settlement with the bank and the lawsuit was dismissed.

’It’s being unraveled’

Murdaugh’s best-known alleged fraud didn’t involve his firm’s Client Trust Account.

In 2018 after his longtime family housekeeper died of injuries in a fall at his house Murdaugh concocted a plan to have her sons sue him and collect money from his homeowner’s and personal liability insurance indictments said.

Pretending to befriend the sons Murdaugh and a longtime friend Beaufort attorney Cory Fleming told the sons Fleming was filing a legal action on their behalf to collect insurance money for them according to indictments.

Murdaugh got another longtime friend Palmetto State Bank banker Chad Westendorf to serve as the Satterfield’s estate’s personal representative according to indictments and evidence in the case.

Although a lawsuit was never filed Fleming managed to get insurance companies to pay $4.3 million into the Satterfield estate where the money was released to Fleming who funneled it to Murdaugh according to indictments and case evidence.

Fleming has been indicted on multiple financial charges connected to the Satterfield case.

He is accused of defrauding victims of $3.6 million. His attorney Debbie Barbier of Columbia told a judge last week Fleming is an “innocent man” and is not guilty of his charges.

Murdaugh had an “ability to develop complex creative schemes to steal and hide assets” said a legal filing by attorney Mark Tinsley who represents Renee Beach the mother of Mallory Beach a 19-year-old woman killed in a 2019 boat crash near Beaufort.

Renee Beach has named Murdaugh as a defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit alleging that Murdaugh helped his late underage son Paul illegally get alcohol in the hours before Paul was reportedly piloting a boat at a high rate of speed when it crashed into rocks causing Mallory’s death.

‘Do you plan to steal?’

Every year Robert Wilcox asks his law class one question.

”How many of you plan to steal money from your clients and lie about it?” said Wilcox a former University of South Carolina Law School dean who has taught legal ethics for 35 years classes that are mandatory to graduate law school.

For 35 years not a single student has raised their hand Wilcox said.

“For the last 20 years I also told them ‘Unfortunately some students who didn’t raise their hand have ultimately done that as lawyers’” he added.

Safeguarding client money is one of a lawyer’s highest duties and “rules require that the partners of a law firm have in place reasonable measures to protect against any violation of ethical duties by other lawyers including the misuse of funds” he said.

Wilcox said “reasonable measures” include having two signatures on checks written out of the Client Trust Account.

The bottom line Wilcox said is that “the system is built on integrity. It works best when the lawyer can be trusted.”

No matter how the Murdaugh case turns out the once-respected Murdaugh name is now shunned.

His law firm has rebranded itself and formed a new legal entity the Parker Law Group. Johnny Parker is a longtime Murdaugh partner and a respected lawyer in state legal circles.

All of South Carolina’s 10000-plus lawyers have been tarnished as news has spread about the ease with which so many clients were victimized for such a long time some say.

Richter an attorney who represents two of Murdaugh’s alleged victims said during Murdaugh’s bond hearing last fall that attorneys across the state have felt “outrage that our profession is stained.”

The Murdaugh story might have one bright side Wilcox said.

“Maybe we can be somewhat comforted that it’s being unraveled that it’s getting unwound” he said. “And at least the process was in place that once it was discovered it’s being dealt with.”

BNY the Irish subsidiary of fund administration giant Bank of New York Mellon Corporation said on Thursday that it sincerely regretted the breaches and had taken the necessary steps to rectify the deficiencies that gave rise to them.

Although no client money was lost the charge sheet doesn’t make pretty reading. BNY repeatedly failed to notify the Central Bank and obtain its approval prior to the commencement of new outsourcing arrangements. It repeatedly failed to monitor and assess the financial performance of the firms to which it had outsourced services.

It also repeatedly failed to submit correct annual outsourcing returns and it failed to notify clients prior to the commencement of an outsourcing arrangement.

With the breaches dating from 2013 and the first engagement by the Central Bank on the issue coming in 2014 this has been a long-running affair undoubtedly prolonged by BNY’s “inaccurate notifications” which the regulator said “served to minimise the seriousness and extent of the breaches”.

But BNY’s conduct is one thing. The potential risk to the financial system inherent in incorrectly managed outsourcing practices is another.

Guidance note

To its credit the Central Bank has stepped up its focus on the pervasive use of outsourcing by regulated firms in recent years. The cross-industry guidance it issued last December is a 73-page document that should leave regulated entities in no doubt that it will take a dim view of sloppy outsourcing practices that impair its ability to properly supervise financial firms.

One complicating factor this guidance note outlines is the use of sub-outsourcing also known as chain outsourcing. This is as it sounds where an outsourcing service provider in turn outsources certain aspects of their business creating “outsourcing chains that can become long and complex”.

It’s not hard to see how the regulator’s visibility might swiftly become quite poor. The BNY case represents the biggest string of outsourcing breaches the Central Bank has uncovered to date. But it wasn’t the first and it’s unlikely to be the last.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTA2NTc4MTEvRm91ci1EZXV0c2NoZS1CYW5rLWV4ZWNzLWZpcmVkLWNoYXJnaW5nLXN0cmlwLWNsdWItdmlzaXQtY29tcGFueS5odG1s0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDY1NzgxMS9hbXAvRm91ci1EZXV0c2NoZS1CYW5rLWV4ZWNzLWZpcmVkLWNoYXJnaW5nLXN0cmlwLWNsdWItdmlzaXQtY29tcGFueS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four Deutsche Bank execs are fired for 'charging strip club visit to the company',"Four New York-based employees of the financial powerhouse Deutsche Bank have been fired after they allegedly tried to expense a night out at a strip club in violation of company policy.

Ben Darsney former Americas head of equity capital markets was fired alongside Ravi Raghunathan Brandon Sun and Daniel Gaona after attempting to expense the night out as a legitimate restaurant visit according to Bloomberg.

Darsney 40 had worked for Deutsche Bank since 2010. He did not immediately respond to an inquiry from DailyMail.com on Sunday.

A Deutsche Bank spokesman told DailyMail.com in a statement: 'Deutsche Bank thoroughly investigates allegations of possible misconduct comprehensively and without bias.'

Brandon Sun was a director in the financial institutions group at Deutsche Bank. He was not accused of attending the strip club but of alleged involvement in the expense report

A Deutsche Bank spokesman told DailyMail.com in a statement: 'Deutsche Bank thoroughly investigates allegations of possible misconduct comprehensively and without bias'

'We do not condone violations of our Code of Conduct or Company Policy' the statement added.

'When required by the facts and circumstances we take appropriate remedial action.'

The bank declined to comment further on the circumstances of the incident but an insider told DailyMail.com that there were no allegations of harassment involved and the incident was not related to business activity.

Even going to a strip club with colleagues is a violation of Deutsche Bank's company policy and the error was allegedly compounded by attempting to expense the trip and then by efforts to cover up the incident.

According to the New York Post Darsney and Raghunathan the managing director who ran most of the bank's SPAC business took colleagues and a client to an unidentified strip club in February.

Others who were fired in the incident may have been accused of trying to cover up the expense report.

'People got fired who weren't at said event but lied and participated in coverup' an insider told The Post.

'Everyone was very well-regarded which made it hard' the person added of Deutsche's decision to fire the men.

Raghunathan Sun and Gaona could not be reached for comment by DailyMail.com and did not respond to inquiries from Bloomberg and the Post.

Sun a director in the financial institutions group at Deutsche Bank was not accused of attending the strip club but was allegedly involved in the expense report.

According to the Post the charges involved in the incident amounted to less than $1000.

The strip-club incident comes as Deutsche Bank pushes to put a greater emphasis on company culture and compliance.

Deutsche Bank said on Friday it had promoted its finance chief James von Moltke to the role of deputy chief executive officer.

Von Moltke will be the second of two deputies serving along with Karl von Rohr who has been in the role since 2018. He will also remain CFO.

Von Moltke joined Deutsche as CFO five years ago and has played a key role in the bank's overhaul by keeping a tight lid on costs and communicating with investors and the public.

'This gives us the right governance structure to succeed in the long term in this time of increasing complexity and volatility' Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said.

In 2019 Deutsche Bank embarked on a major restructuring that involved cutting 18000 staff and exiting some businesses.

It seems like those days when traditional financial and economic institutions like banks were skeptical of blockchain technology-based cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Now the banks like institutions are looking forward to seeking ways to cope with the new age currencies. Recently the largest bank of Israel Leumi became the latest example.

As reported by Reuters on March 24th Israel’s largest bank founded more than 120 years ago headquartered in the capital Tel Aviv-Yafo has entered the cryptocurrency world. For which the organizations partnered with New York-based financial technology and blockchain service provider company Paxos. This would result in enabling the firm to provide trading services for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

To be specific the banking institution anticipated allowing its customers and clients to buy sell and hold bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. As per the reports the bank would charge the minimum transaction cost of at least 50 shekels Israeli currency totaling around $15.

Although the official date of launching the services has not been cleared regulatory approvals from authorities like the Central Bank of Israel and the Tax Authority are pending. Once approved by authorities the bank’s online application would start cryptocurrency services allowing clients to invest in digital assets classes.

Apart from cryptocurrency services Bank Leumi also plans to simplify the process of tax collection. In order to do so the bank would retain taxes as per the guidelines showcased by the Tax Authority during the selling and converting of cryptocurrencies in shekels.

However the approach of the largest bank in Israel is different from recent steps taken by another Israeli bank Bank Hapoalim. The bank denied when a lady wanted to deposit her $320000 worth of bitcoin which she made by investing in cryptocurrency.

The trend seen by the banks to adopt cryptocurrencies and related operations initiated by prominent banks in America. Initially those banks such as JPMorgan Goldman Sachs Bank of America and Citigroup were critics of digital assets. But later on the institutions went down the road and adopted the crypto opportunities in their respective manners.

For instance Morgan Stanley allows its customers to invest in bitcoin with the help of several funds. On top of that to avail BTC exposure it purchased Grayscale’s bitcoin trust shares.

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMzM4NjQwNy9GV0FXLWZhbnMtc2xhbS1jcmluZ2UtYmF0aC1kYXRlLUZhcm1lci1Kb2UtQ2xhaXJlLmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTMzODY0MDcvYW1wL0ZXQVctZmFucy1zbGFtLWNyaW5nZS1iYXRoLWRhdGUtRmFybWVyLUpvZS1DbGFpcmUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Farmer Wants A Wife fans slam 'cringe' bath date between Farmer Joe and Claire: 'It felt awkward watching it!',"Farmer Wants A Wife fans were left 'cringing' on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants.

Farmer Joe was enticed to take a bath with Claire both of whom developed a connection with each other during their first 24-hour date together.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle.

The cattle and sheep farmer 33 offered another 24-hour date up for grabs with the marketing manager 36 pulling out all the stops to win.

'I saw the bathtub near our tent so yeah I just wanted to set up a little spot for us to share some time together' Claire told producers.

Farmer Wants A Wife Australia fans said they were left 'cringing' away from the TV on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants

However it seemed the plan 'fell flat' when awkward scenes showed the pair stripping down and stepping into the warm bath looking shy in front of the cameras.

The pair appeared uncomfortable sharing affections while in their underwear on TV but did attempt to share a kiss and caress one another in a cringey display.

'I couldn't watch the bath just a bunch of giggling it was so cringe' one person wrote on Facebook.

Another added: 'I know I felt awkward for watching haha not even a conversation going.'

'Yes it was so cringeworthy it was hard to watch' one user commented.

Others noted that it was only awkward because Farmer Joe did not appear to be as interested in Claire as she was him.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle

One wrote: 'To me that date thing that Claire planned for Joe fell flat I honestly don't think he's feeling it for any of the women.'

'No he is not feeling it with any of them but well and truly enjoying the game!' another agreed.

Farmer Joe has formed several connections this season but still hasn't had much luck after Susie walked out on him when she realised farm life was not for her.

Her unhinged ex-husband Rowan Baxter had jumped into her car carrying a brand new jerry can full of petrol and a knife.

Two weeks earlier the 42-year old had tried to break her wrist after breaching yet another intervention order to torment her.

The hulking brute could easily have snapped it in two but Ms Clarke had managed to talk him down.

Ms Clarke 31 and children Aaliyah six Laianah four and Trey three were killed at his hands in Brisbane's south on February 19 2020.

'Drive' Baxter said upon jumping into the front passenger seat of Ms Clarke's car as she prepared to take the kids to school from her parents' home in Camp Hill.

The terrified mum for one last time pleaded with Baxter to leave them alone.

While it's hard to imagine the terror Ms Clarke would have endured in those seconds an inquest currently before Deputy State Coroner Jane Bentley has heard her fight to save the children never ended.

With Baxter screaming in her ear Ms Clarke spotted a man with a hose in the distance.

Michael Zemek was washing his car that morning when he heard a car pull up outside his home.

Without a moment's hesitation Baxter began dousing his family in petrol.

Ms Clarke shouted from the car words Mr Zemek will never forget.

'Call the police call the police. He's trying to kill me. He's put petrol on me.'

Hannah Clarke had been trying to escape an abusive relationship when she and her children were incinerated

Hannah Clarke's father Lloyd Clarke was also at the inquest to hear the harrowing evidence. He said he was hoping the inquest would help determine how the system let his daughter and grandchildren down

Rowan Baxter pretended to love care and protect his children but burnt them all alive

Mr Zemek couldn't see or hear the children but could see Baxter holding Ms Clarke in a bear hug with both arms around her.

'He was sitting on his side and she was screaming' he said.

Mr Zemek described the 'resigned look' on Baxter's face as he approached the passenger side window to investigate.

With that the fate of Ms Clarke and her family was sealed and Baxter sparked his lighter.

'It was just a bang and a blackness sort of hit my face. I sort of turned my head around briefly … when I came to look up the whole of the inside front was ablaze' Mr Zemek told the inquest.

Off-duty paramedic Stephanie Ring just happened to be in the area when she witnessed the explosion.

Ms Clarke was yelling and crying: 'My babies are in the car ... why didn't I just stay in the car with them?’

She was still head-to-toe in flames Ms Ring said.

Ms Clarke continued to plead for someone to save her children as Mr Zemek desperately worked to douse the flames with his garden hose.

'I didn't save my kids I couldn't save my kids' Ms Clarke told him.

Such was the intensity of the blaze Mr Zemek could not even tell the children were inside the car.

'I didn't appreciate that they were there. I thought maybe they'd been killed somewhere else' he said.

The scene where Hannah Clarke and her children were murdered quickly became a shrine

Samantha Covey was driving her children to swimming lessons when she saw Ms Clarke's car engulfed in flames.

She found Ms Clarke lying on the grass near her car saying: 'My kids someone get my kids.'

Only three per cent of Ms Clarke’s skin was not affected by burns with most being full thickness indicating she would not survive from the injuries.

Multiple witnesses would attest to her bravery knowing full well her time was at an end.

'I can't believe he's done this. I've got a DVO I can't believe he's done this. Where are my babies where are my kids? How could he do this. That's my babies in there' she told Ms Covey.

As the shocked good Samaritan moved to extinguish the flames in the burning SUV an already badly burnt Baxter dived back into the vehicle to retrieve his knife.

Neighbour Kerry Fernandez who raced towards the flames with a fire extinguisher said Baxter was determined to ensure his children died.

'I felt like he was almost guarding the car' she said.

'He was not wanting me to put the fire out [and] it felt like if I went to the right side he'd follow me there if I went to the left side he'd follow me there.'

Hannah Clarke's only concerns were for her kids Aaliyah  six Laianah four and Trey three

Ms Clarke 31 and children Aaliyah six Laianah four and Trey three were killed at their hands of her ex-partner Rowan Baxter when he doused them in petrol and set them alight while they were in their family car in February 2020 in Brisbane's south

One of Queensland's top doctors who was at the scene said despite the severity of Ms Clarke's injuries he worked to 'reassure' her she would wake up in a 'better place'

Ms Fernandez was oblivious Baxter was holding the knife.

When fellow neighbour Reece Gourlay spotted the weapon the pair bolted across the street to warn others.

By then Baxter had himself sustained burns to 80 per cent of his body.

Neighbour Sarah Tranberg pleaded with him to drop the knife.

'I couldn’t see a lot of him because he was burned from head to toe' she said.

'I told him to drop the knife [that] it’s not worth anything drop the knife.'

With that Baxter plunged the knife directly into his heart and died on the side of the road.

One of Queensland's most qualified emergency medical respondents and medical director for the Queensland Ambulance Service Stephen Rashford could tell Ms Clarke had 'essentially non-survivable injuries' the moment he laid eyes upon her.

The only parts not scorched were the bottoms of her feet.

Ms Clarke was not 'screaming in pain' while he treated her adding that in some cases those suffering severe burns can be 'cognitively intact'.

'We reassured her as much as we could and wanted to basically say we would take any pain away and that we hoped she would wake up in hospital and be in a better place.

'That's always a very difficult conversation to have with anyone' he said.

He described the mother-of-three as 'incredibly courageous' and added after briefly speaking to her he believed her pain was not her 'primary issue' amidst the horror of what had happened.

It was her children.

Senior Constable Angus Skaines another first responder told the inquest Ms Clarke was able to give details of names and dates of births in the moments before she was sedated with painkillers.

'It was just amazing the things she was able to tell me and how much she was able to help us' Snr Const Skaines said.

'At a normal job even people are so worked up they can't get those details out.'

Audio from Snr Const Skaine's bodycam was heard at the inquest.

'My ex-husband he got he got in the …' Ms Clarke told Snr Const Skaine's.

'What's your ex-husband's name?' he asked.

'Rowan Baxter' she said.

'There's a protection order against him.

'We got in the car to go to school and he jumped in the front seat with me and had a jerry can.'

Ms Clarke told the officer she saw a man washing a car and asked him to call the police.

'And then (Baxter) just he poured petrol everywhere and just lit the car. And my three kids.'

Ms Clarke died later in hospital.

Deputy State Coroner Jane Bentley said the information given by Ms Clarke that day would have greatly helped prosecute Baxter in the event he lived.

WARNING SIGNS

Baxter had been described by church pastor Christopher Ensbey as having had an 'alpha male' personality who exhibited 'controlling and paranoid' behaviours.

Baxter had confided in him during a 'moment of vulnerability' about the impact the breakdown of his marriage was having on him.

'He knew something was wrong and had to change but he didn’t have the self-awareness to know what to do' Mr Ensbey said.

He had met the couple at their gym which was close to his church.

Mr Ensbey recalled Baxter training people until they would vomit.

Ms Clarke told the pastor that Baxter believed he was entitled to sex every day and controlled her daily schedule.

'I had never perceived the paranoia around relationship but at this point it felt like he was getting more and more paranoid about who she spent time with and her communications' Mr Ensbey said.

Lewis Bartlett who knew Baxter from about 2008 and employed Ms Clarke at his sports shoe store told the inquest she confided about intending to leave her husband late in 2019 and later said they had what was 'classed as a domestic violence relationship'.

Baxter had not hit her but 'had done other things' that she did not elaborate on.

Mr Bartlett said Ms Clarke told him that she could not do anything without Baxter's permission and her husband wouldn't let her wear shorts to work.

In the weeks before her death Ms Clarke asked Mr Bartlett how to write a will.

'She said if anything ever happened to her she wanted to make sure her children were well looked after and went to the right people' Mr Bartlett said.

When he replied that nothing would happen to her Ms Clarke said: 'No he's going to try and kill me.'

Ms Clarke said she had told the police her concerns and he thought things would be put in place to protect her.

Mr Bartlett said Ms Clarke had fears about what Baxter would do to her but didn't think he would harm the children.

Just a week before Baxter would kill his family Ms Clarke's best friend Nicole Brooks warned police she was concerned he was likely to harm them.

'I said ""I'm sure he's going to take them out''' Ms Brooks told the inquest.

But officers said they couldn't do anything until Baxter 'does something'.

'I said 'what if you don't get a second chance?'''

Ms Brooks told the inquest of Ms Clarke saying she was choked by Baxter when he was 'full of adrenaline' after a jujitsu class and telling her: 'You have no idea what I'm capable of.'

MURDER NOTE FOUND ON KILLER'S PHONE A chilling note was found on Baxter's phone after his death where he revealed his reasoning for killing his wife. 'I'm finishing your game. I don't want to play anymore. I have told the kids that you loved them. They will miss you I'm sure' he wrote. 'You destroyed my life and I cannot move on. I hope all this was worth it for you and your family. 'Now that you have no one to apparently control it you're a strong girl. You'll be fine.'

Ms Clarke's mother Suzanne Clarke told the inquest her eldest granddaughter Aaliyah fought back against her father despite living in fear of him.

She shared how the six-year-old once told her father not come back to the house after seeing him yell at her mother.

Mrs Clarke testified that while Laianah and Trey would speak to Baxter over video and FaceTime calls Aaliyah would sometimes refuse.

On one occasion the six-year-old was FaceTiming with Baxter and told him she needed to 'wash her hair' and walked away - promptly ending the call.

'And on days when he would sulk and not speak to Hannah [Aaliyah] would actually say to him: 'Daddy Mummy said sorry can't you talk to her?' But she would then be in trouble for coming into adult business' Mrs Clarke told the inquest.

After the couple separated Baxter continued to see his children but on Boxing Day in 2019 he fled with Laianah disappearing for more than two days.

Laianah was recovered by police on December 29 after the pair fled to northern NSW.

Laianah was returned to her mother and Baxter was served a protection order.

Ms Clarke told her mother and friends she feared for her life in the weeks before she would die.

'When he kills me he'll be in jail and what happens to the children?' she asked her mum during a conversation about making a will the week before her death.

Laianah was kidnapped by her father on Boxing Day 2019

The inquest has been told Baxter frequently threatened to take his own life during their marriage wanted sex every day called his wife a 'fat pig' wouldn't let her wear shorts or pink clothing - 'because that's for children' - and had to win races with his young kids.

'She was always walking on eggshells and trying to toe the line' Mrs Clarke said.

Asked about Baxter's actions that killed her daughter and grandchildren Mrs Clarke said she didn't think he knew how to love.

'His form of love is as a possession' she said.

Mrs Clarke told the inquest Hannah was 'a beautiful soul' bright bubbly and full of empathy.

She wanted people to know her daughter was strong loved her children and 'would have fought anyone to save them'.

Mrs Clarke said Aaliyah was articulate and bright a strong child who stood up to her father while Laianah who they called Little Middle was a 'little dynamo'.

Trey was the apple of his mother's eye and a mummy's boy she said.

Mrs Clarke said focusing on Hannah's legacy and giving her a voice helped her get out of bed each day.

She and her husband Lloyd have since become outspoken advocates against domestic violence and established the Small Steps 4 Hannah Foundation in their daughter's honour.

Mrs Clarke hoped for more understanding and awareness about family violence including through advertisements and education campaigns.

Ms Clarke's father Lloyd said outside court he hoped the inquest would determine how the system let his daughter and grandchildren down.

Economy Minister Gordon Lyons announced the appointment of Karen Baxter to the watchdog following consultation with Nadine Dorries UK Secretary of State for Digital Culture Media and Sport.

The Culture Secretary last week announced that Lord Grade was the government’s preferred candidate for the role of Ofcom chair.

Ms Baxter retired from policing in 2020 after a 30-year career in the RUC PSNI and the City of London Police.

And as Commander and National Coordinator for Economic Crime she oversaw the most serious financial investigations in the UK.

Ms Baxter also acted as police executive lead for cyber crime prevention. In 2020 she joined UK Finance as the managing director for intelligence strategy.

Ms Baxter said: “I am pleased to have the opportunity to take on this new role at an important time for Ofcom.

“The communications sector provides essential services to everyone across Northern Ireland and the wider UK and is critical to the future success of the economy.”

The Economy Minister said he was pleased to announce the appointment. “Karen has an extensive understanding of the issues facing the communications sector and how a successful communications sector contributes to a stronger economy.

“I am also grateful to the Ofcom board member for Scotland Bob Downes for his excellent work representing Northern Ireland in the interim period.”

Dame Melanie Dawes Ofcom chief executive said: “I am pleased to welcome Karen to Ofcom and look forward to working together as we deliver on Ofcom’s priorities. Karen brings with her significant experience and knowledge from her previous roles in policing and cyber security which are especially relevant to Ofcom’s growing remit.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzb3V0aGFmcmljYW4uY29tL3Nwb3J0L3NvY2Nlci9wc2wtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhL3N0dWFydC1iYXh0ZXItaGFzLXRvLWJlLXNhY2tlZC10by1zYXZlLWthaXplci1jaGllZnMtbW9yZS1wYWluLWJyZWFraW5nLW5ld3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stuart Baxter has to be sacked to save Kaizer Chiefs more pain,"JOHANNESBURG SOUTH AFRICA – AUGUST 18: Kaizer Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter during the 2021/2022 DStv Premiership season launch at FNB Stadium on August 18 2021 in Johannesburg South Africa.

Erstwhile Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Ntokozo Sikhakhane believes that appointing Stuart Baxter as the club’s head coach was an error.

Sikhakhane believes that Kaizer Chiefs need to face the facts when it comes to Baxter.

He says they need to cut him loose to progress.

Arthur Zwane would be a popular replacement for Baxter.

There has been a groundswell of support for Zwane to be given control of the team following his impressive stints as interim head coach.

Sikhakhane agrees that Zwane would be a good candidate to refresh Kaizer Chiefs.

Many fans were sceptical when the club announced Baxter’s return given his recent coaching record and the time that had passed between stints.

Kaizer Chiefs MUST sack Stuart Baxter

Sikhakane says that it is sad to see Kaizer Chiefs in their current space but feels that it isn’t surprising.

“It makes me sad to see Kaizer Chiefs like this like I said before coach Stuart Baxter was not a solution I don’t have anything against him but he was not the one this time around and I’m not surprised by the recent form” Sikhakhane told Soccer Laduma. “Coach Baxter did well in the past but he has failed this times around he must step aside you can see from body language from players and in the technical team there’s no unity anymore and that can mean one thing no results will come from the team one must go.”

“I think the solution is for Chiefs to release Baxter and give young blood an opportunity even Arthur Zwane can be the one.”

Chiefs’ 50 per cent win rate in the league is second only to Sundowns but they have given up a lot of ground to the reigning champions.

Expectations are high at Kaizer Chiefs and Baxter really needed to produce a title challenge which now appears unlikely.",,,

You don't have to be an investing genius to make a lot of money with stocks. Don't take my word for it. Just listen to what Warren Buffett one of the greatest investors of all time says.

Buffett wrote to Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.96%) (BRK.B 1.01%) shareholders last year about a way that any investor could amass significant gains. But the Oracle of Omaha didn't stop there. Buffett thinks this investing strategy could even make a monkey rich.

Monkey business

Buffett's underlying premise is that ""ownership of stocks is very much a 'positive-sum' game."" His reference was to a term used in game theory that describes a situation where the total of gains and losses will always be greater than zero. In other words all players will be winners over the long run.

It's important to remember that Buffett views buying stocks as buying a part of a business. That's an accurate take. In fact he wrote in his most recent letter to Berkshire shareholders that he and his longtime right-hand man Charlie Munger ""are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers.""

So what is Buffett's strategy that he thinks will make even a monkey rich? There are only three steps involved:

Throw 50 darts at a list of all of the stocks in the S&P 500 index. Buy the 50 stocks the darts land on. Hold those stocks for the long term.

That's it. Buffett did mention that the monkey should be ""patient and level-headed."" In particular he warned that the monkey shouldn't be tempted to make changes along the way. The legendary investor stated ""All that's required is the passage of time an inner calm ample diversification and a minimization of transactions and fees.""

Testing Buffett's strategy

Just out of curiosity I decided to test Buffett's ""monkey strategy."" I'll admit that I deviated a little from his prescribed approach though. My wife wouldn't be happy with me throwing 50 darts in our house. (She doesn't trust my aim that much.)

Instead I closed my eyes and randomly pointed to 50 different stocks that were members of the S&P 500 two decades ago. Why go back 20 years? I figured that was a sufficient period to meet Buffett's long-term hold criterion.

The average total return (including stock appreciation and dividends) of the 50 stocks in my ""monkey portfolio"" during this period was 741%. An initial investment of $10000 spread across those stocks would be worth around $84100.

In case you're wondering the biggest winner was Altria (MO -0.23%). The tobacco giant delivered a total return of 3050%. Some investors think that Altria is still a smart stock to buy now.

Fourteen other stocks that I chose randomly were at least 10-baggers. No stock delivered a negative return during the period. However Lumen Technologies (LUMN) came close with a total return of only 7%. Considering inflation I'd chalk Lumen up as a loser.

An even easier approach

Granted my single test of Buffett's strategy doesn't prove that it works. I suspect that a large enough number of tests to be statistically valid would deliver a smaller total return than what I obtained.

In fact I'm confident that would be the case. Why? There's an even easier investing approach that Buffett also really likes: Buying an S&P 500 fund. Following this strategy would have generated a total return of around 485% over the last 20 years.

Also I didn't include the costs associated with buying 50 different stocks. That makes investing in an S&P 500 fund even more attractive than Buffett's monkey-and-darts approach.

However I truly believe that Buffett is onto something. And I wish that I had a patient and level-headed monkey following his approach to help me invest years ago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9ob3ctd2FzaGVkLXVwb2xkLW1hbi13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1pcy1nZXR0aW5nLXRoZS1sYXN0LWxhdWdoLTExNjQ4MDU1ODA00gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9ob3ctd2FzaGVkLXVwb2xkLW1hbi13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1pcy1nZXR0aW5nLXRoZS1sYXN0LWxhdWdoLTExNjQ4MDU1ODA0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How 'washed up...old man' Warren Buffett is getting the last laugh,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-washed-upold-man-warren-buffett-is-getting-the-last-laugh-11648055804 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9ob3ctd2FzaGVkLXVwb2xkLW1hbi13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1pcy1nZXR0aW5nLXRoZS1sYXN0LWxhdWdoLTExNjQ4MDU1ODA00gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9ob3ctd2FzaGVkLXVwb2xkLW1hbi13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1pcy1nZXR0aW5nLXRoZS1sYXN0LWxhdWdoLTExNjQ4MDU1ODA0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS9nZW5lcmFsL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjIvMDMvMjYzMDkxNDAvaXMtcnlhbi1jb2hlbi1iZWNvbWluZy10aGUtbWlsbGVubmlhbC1nZW5lcmF0aW9ucy13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dNIBLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS9hbXAvY29udGVudC8yNjMwOTE0MA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Gamestop's Ryan Cohen Becoming The Millennial Generation's Warren Buffett? - GameStop (NYSE:GME),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/22/03/26309140/is-ryan-cohen-becoming-the-millennial-generations-warren-buffett on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS9nZW5lcmFsL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjIvMDMvMjYzMDkxNDAvaXMtcnlhbi1jb2hlbi1iZWNvbWluZy10aGUtbWlsbGVubmlhbC1nZW5lcmF0aW9ucy13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dNIBLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS9hbXAvY29udGVudC8yNjMwOTE0MA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The Americans continue to rule the full-size SUV segment and we have three models sharing top honours for 2022.

Winner

GM’s trio consisting of the Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe plus the GMC Yukon cannot be matched once again. Remember they won our Best Buy award in 2021 too.

Despite gas prices being much higher than they were last year demand for these three vehicles remains quite strong. They offer a pair of powerful V8 engines for excellent performance on the road.

Those who want to save at the pump can opt for a six-cylinder diesel engine that may be short on power but equally rich in torque resulting in commendable acceleration and significantly more frugal. If you travel a lot year in and year out this is arguably the engine to get.

Oh and all three SUVs inspire confidence when it comes to handling which contributes to a pleasant driving experience. Massive cabin space is another reason to pick any one of them.

Other Finalists

The runner-up for 2022 is the Ford Expedition which doesn’t have a V8 or a diesel engine. Rather it comes with a twin-turbo V6. The Expedition proves to be smooth and comfortable but not on the same level as the GM models in terms of dynamic attributes.

Designers have made a few tweaks inside while a new Timberline model aims to please off-road enthusiasts. Also the high-output V6 variant now generates 440 horsepower a gain of 40 horsepower.

Finally we put the ageless Toyota Sequoia in third place.

Until the completely redesigned 2023 model arrives customers still get a solid and dependable albeit old-school truck. If you’re looking for the latest technology or gadgets this is not the SUV you want. The Sequoia is a conservative yet sensible purchase although the V8 under the hood costs a pretty penny at the pump.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHRvcG1hZy5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9wczUtcHVsc2UtM2Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtaGVhZHNldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pulse 3D PS5 wireless headset review: The only choice,"If you own a PS5 Sony’s Pulse 3D headset isn’t just the best pair of gaming headphones it’s the right choice given its exclusive synergy with the console alongside a comfortable fit stellar sound and convincing spatial audio.

The PlayStation Pulse 3D wireless headset has been kicking about for a while now but for PS5 players this pair of cans continues to be seen as the best gaming headset for the console.

Why? Well beyond the bright sound profile comfortable lightweight design and impressive surround sound credentials there are some unique PS5 features unlocked by them that other third-party headsets can’t replicate.

This is worth talking about for anyone who has picked up a PlayStation 5. But is it worth the entrance fee? Spoiler alert — yes. Yes they are.

Pulse 3D wireless headset price and availability

You can pick up a Pulse 3D headset for $99 or £89 in either the white finish of the standard PS5 base plates or Midnight Black. That’s the same price as the Xbox Wireless Headset and £40 shy of the team favorite SteelSeries Arctis 7P+ . Yes I know the list price of the latter is actually a fair bit higher but much like weekend furniture sales you’ll very rarely see these at full price.

Looking back to 2021 stock seemed to be hard to come by for these cans but luckily that seems to have normalized now.

Pulse 3D wireless headset design

(Image credit: Future)

In a sea of big bulky metallic gaming headsets with retractable microphones and RGB lights the Pulse 3D is a visual triumph of stylish restraint.

The plastics used in creating these feel rigid to the touch but that PlayStation face-button texture you find on the base plates and DualSense controller does join the console suite together really nicely.

The rubber suspension headband is durable and the perfectly circular cups’ cushioning is covered with a comfortable and durable faux leather. With cheaper competition like the Eksa E910 offering a padded headband and a metal frame build the Pulse 3D headset cheapens out for what you’re paying.

(Image credit: Future)

However with these material choices comes a lighter weight of 10.4 ounces — 0.6 ounces less than the Xbox Wireless Headset and 2.5 ounces less than the SteelSeries Arctis 7P+. The featherweight construction contributes to the Pulse 3D wireless headset feeling cozy to wear for long play sessions.

On the left cup there’s the buttons for the power volume control and audio/microphone modes as well as the 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C connector. The I/O setup is a little chaotic when you’re trying to fiddle with settings in the heat of gaming.

Pulse 3D wireless headset comfort

Now I get that on paper a rubber head strap and hard plastic doesn’t sound like it lends itself to a comfortable wearing experience. But the Pulse 3D headset absolutely sticks the landing in this category.

The lightweight design is made to feel even lighter with the suspended headband and the plush cushions on the perfect circle over-ear cups (odd when you take into account most gaming headsets opt for an oval cup) lends itself to a snug fit without a strong clamp around your noggin.

That lighter sensation on your head makes for long-term comfort. My longest stints over the past couple weeks has been 6 hours on Gran Turismo 7 (before the game slowly started being ruined ) and one of those accidental 7-hour stints in the recently updated Cyberpunk 2077 where you start at a normal time blink then realize its 2am.

(Image credit: Future)

In both of these cases these did not get overly exhausting to wear at any point. Of course you do get a sensation of relief when you take them off your head but nothing to indicate these are harsh to wear in any way.

It’s also worth noting that while you cannot manually adjust the headband like on the Xbox Wireless Headset and SteelSeries Arctis 7P+ that’s not necessary on the Pulse 3D. The band itself is a moving part that adjusts itself based on where the cups are on your head. Some of you may not appreciate being able to make small tweaks to the wearability but the fact the headset sorts itself out is something I prefer for sure.

Pulse 3D wireless headset gaming performance

The 40mm neodymium drivers found in the Pulse 3D headset match up to the Arctis 7P and Xbox Wireless headset in terms of size and quality. Trust me when I say that much like Microsoft’s headphones you will be baffled at how headphones at this price can sound this good.

Its secret to success is tight Tempest 3D Audio integration with the PS5 which puts the likes of Dolby Atmos on blast with a thoroughly detailed immersive soundstage that feels bright and expressive at all levels without a hint of distortion.

Firing up Horizon Forbidden West is an amazing demonstration of what is possible and beyond the stunning visuals it breathes a new level of life into the world. Whether it’s within a forest and hearing the leaves rustle all around you the wind whistling atop a mountain the distant sound of machines or a mixture of all three within the heat of combat everything is well balanced and has its place in this spherical field of sound.

Gran Turismo 7 is a little more subtle since we’re dealing with a realistic racing sim rather than a gloriously over-the-top fantasy world but the sound here is still fantastic. You can actually hear the surface you’re driving on beneath you like the earthiness of dirt or the hard rumbling clatter of a curb on a turn’s apex.

With stereo sound most players are relying on the track radar to see competitors around them but with this headset I identified the location of the car next to me and how far away it was in order to avoid a collision on the overtake. And of course the background soundtrack remains ever-present in a way that doesn’t intrude on the audio cues you’re listening to in-game.

The Pulse 3D wireless headset elevated Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection  an already quintessential Hollywood-like blockbuster game to a whole new cinematic level. The spatial sound gets a real workout here and flipping back and forth between the PS4 and PS5 versions of Uncharted 4 shows you how dramatic the audio upgrade is between generations. That is further accentuated by the Pulse 3D headset as hundreds of sounds all have their own place around you.

Of course with the use of a USB dongle for 2.4 GHz wireless or 3.5mm headphone cable these work on PC too. While you won’t get the same impressive level of spatial audio performance as you do with the close integration between this headset and the PS5 they delivered that same clean bright undistorted profile while playing Portal 2 and Age of Empires IV.

Pulse 3D wireless headset music performance

One hurdle where most gaming headsets stumble is in music performance as drivers can be tuned to benefit a more cinematic gaming experience which compromises their ability to nail songs. Surprisingly I’m happy to confirm that’s not an issue here.

No matter what I threw at these whether it was the riotous cover of “Bittersweet Symphony” by Four Year Strong or the delicate “2009” by Mac Miller the lows were nice and warm without biting into the mids. What’s more the highs shined while placing them all into a soundstage that felt spacious around me.

You’ll notice some errors in the tuning by throwing classical music the headset such as Claude Debussy’s “Clair De Lune” as the Pulse 3D’s attempts to give the whole piano stave life leads to distortion in the highs but much like the Arctis 7P+ and Xbox Wireless Headset there are no deal-breaking issues to report.

Pulse 3D wireless headset microphone

The Pulse 3D headset packs dual noise-canceling microphones which have been positioned optimally to pick up your voice and isolate it from your surroundings.

In real-world use this results in a voice-pickup that is great for team chat for sure but not necessarily that great for general content creation like streaming as you can hear the slight hints of digital voice processing happening in the background.

It should come as no surprise that the competition with retractable microphones feature a better quality voice-pickup — putting the mic closer to your gob allows for better definition.

However we’re talking about a niche use case here. For the broader requirement to just talk to your mates while playing Sony’s headset more than holds its own.

Pulse 3D wireless headset features

This is the bit where we can get into the exclusive integrations you get by having a PlayStation headset with a PlayStation 5. These are twofold for PS5 gamers.

Firstly if you’ve already tried a wireless gaming headset with your shiny console you’ll know the frustration of having to manually change output sources if you want to flip back to speakers or just remove the USB dongle altogether. With the Pulse 3D headset you don’t have to. To paraphrase Apple: “it just works” as turning on and off the headphones automatically changes the audio output.

Secondly these have been specifically tuned to deliver the specific 3D audio that PS5 games possess. And while a decent amount of third party headphones can deliver surround sound there is a noticeable difference with the Pulse 3D — an improved richness to the tones around you and an increased liveliness to the tuning. I’ve reached out to Sony to see whether there is a technical reason for this. This section will be updated once I get an answer.

As for battery life you’re going to get 12 hours of playtime on a single charge which matches up to Sony’s promise. That is 3 hours shorter than the Xbox Wireless Headset and over half of the 30-hour stamina of the SteelSeries Arctis 7P+. In personal experience this was fine for me with a quick charge needed every week but we can’t ignore that this is lacking when compared to the competition.

Bottom line

(Image credit: Future)

The Pulse 3D wireless headset isn’t just a pair of headphones that are good for your games they are an essential extension of the PS5 experience.

Not only do you get a bright and expressive sound with a fantastic spatial quality you get all the convenience features afforded to you by the synergy of a Sony headset made for a Sony console.

Yes there are better options for team chat with a retractable microphone the plastic build isn’t quite as good as what you’d see in the competition There’s no bluetooth and there are much better options if you need something that’s multi-platform.

But overall if you want a pair of cans for the PS5 nothing else comes close. Just buy these.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByYWN0aWNhbGVjb21tZXJjZS5jb20vdGhlLWJlc3QtbmF2aWdhdGlvbi1mb3ItZWNvbW1lcmNlLXNpdGVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best Navigation for Ecommerce Sites,"Consumers in 2022 face an avalanche of data. We’re all forced to make countless daily decisions however minor.

Thus an easy-to-navigate ecommerce site one that simplifies decision-making is the first step to conversions. Visitors need to access information without getting overwhelmed. They need to determine instantly whether to continue down the funnel.

For ecommerce sites that funnel is often two three or even four navigation menus depending on the amount of content. Each facilitates decisions.

Micro-decisions

When setting up menus it’s essential to understand how shoppers make micro-decisions which are typically a variation of three subconscious questions:

What is this?

Who is this for?

What do I get?

These questions happen instantaneously. You’ve likely visited websites that aren’t clear about question one and then closed that tab and moved on. Once our brain confirms valuable information we make a micro-decision of whether to move to the next step.

Navigation needs to be straightforward to those who see value in your site. If a visitor decides to proceed the navigation must wisely guide her to the ultimate destination: a purchase of your products.

Navigation Options

Scrolling is a natural behavior. Social media platforms have taught us to scroll infinitely.

Hence many sites now opt for sticky menus that remain at the top as visitors scroll down exposing them constantly to the main navigation.

But importantly don’t add every search option to that top navigation. It will overwhelm and exhaust visitors’ brains. A better option is three or four navigation bars throughout the website. Multiple navigation bars each with a unique purpose allow visitors to make micro-decisions.

An example is BestBuy.com. Its top menu lists the company’s preferred navigation options: “Top Deals” “Deal of the Day” Totaltech Membership” “Credit Cards” and “Gift Cards.”

A second menu on the left is accessible from the top hamburger icon (three parallel lines). It’s much more detailed containing 17 product “departments.” Visitors who click that icon seek more info. They’ve decided to dig deeper and their brains expect more data.

A third Best Buy menu in the footer is comprehensive — a compilation of all navigation links grouped in sections. Having reached the bottom visitors have been exposed to additional info. Their brains are ready for more.

More Sales

In short website navigation should mimic the behavior of our brains. We seek easily understood info. We avoid difficult decisions. Guiding shoppers down that path — from simple to detailed — leads to more sales.

Today's best Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) deals $84.99 View $99.99 View Show More Deals

Google Nest Hub (2nd gen) specs Size: 7 x 4.5 x 2.7-inch

Display: 7-inch 1024 x 600 pixels

Speakers: 1.7-inch tweeter

Camera: None

Wireless: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WiFi Zigbee Bluetooth 5.0

The $99 Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) isn't like any of the best smart displays you’ve seen before. Not only is it a speaker for music screen for your Google Assistant needs and a communication center — but it tracks your sleep too.

When positioned on your nightstand the upgraded Google Nest Hub uses the Soli radar sensing chip to see how well (or not) you're sleeping at night. It's a little creepy and also a little fickle yet you might forget it’s there.

So what else is new? The Soli chip introduces air gesture controls too and there’s a new UI for managing the best Google Home compatible devices . As for sound the Nest Hub earns a spot on our list of the best Google Home speakers  although audio feels like an afterthought compared to all the fresh tricks laid out in this Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) review.

Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) price and availability

The second-generation Nest Hub is available now and costs $99.99 which is $30 less than the first Google Nest Hub 's starting price (back when it was called the Google Home Hub.) $99.99 is also the price of the Google Nest Audio  one of the best smart speakers to release in the last year.

This new smart display is more affordable than the larger Google Nest Hub Max  which starts at $229.99. But the Nest Hub Max offers features like a built-in camera that can keep you centered during video conferencing plus a larger overall display.

Update: Google is reportedly working on a Google Nest Hub 3 that could be a smart display and tablet in one device but there's no word on the release date.

Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) review: Design

Like Google's previous smart displays the second-generation Nest Hub looks like a 7-inch tablet perched on a fabric-covered oval stand. My Nest Hub Max completely towers over it.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

The new Nest Hub also comes in four colors: Chalk Charcoal Mist and Sand.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Though subtle the new edgeless glass display looks more modern and should be easier to clean. It should provide a better experience when you use the Nest Hub as you would one of the best digital photo frames  too.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Once again the display doesn't feature a camera like the Google Nest Hub Max or the similarly priced Amazon Echo Show 8 . While that's a bummer for video chatting it makes the Nest Hub an appealing choice in terms of privacy. Whether you want a camera on your counter or nightstand is a personal choice. Me? I usually grab my phone for video calls so the Nest Hub’s lack of camera doesn’t bother me.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

As most smart speakers and displays should the Google Nest Hub 2 features a physical microphone switch on the back so you can disable its microphones when you don’t want your assistant listening. However you’ll need the microphone on if you want to use Google Assistant as well as if you want to take full advantage of the device’s sleep sensing abilities.

Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) review: Sleep sensing

Among the handful of upgrades Google introduced for its newest Nest Hub sleep tracking (called sleep sensing) is the most noteworthy. While many of the best fitness trackers and best smartwatches can already track your sleep from your wrist the Google Nest Hub follows your zzz's from your bedside no skin contact necessary.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Instead you calibrate the Soli sensor and the microphones to keep tabs on your individual movements and sounds throughout the night. The process took less than a minute for me requiring a quick Google Fit integration and fake sleeping for a few seconds. Then when I woke up my display greeted me with an overview of my sleep similarly to how Apple Health sends me a notification with my Apple Watch sleep tracking information each morning.

Google’s daily sleep sensing metrics included my sleep duration schedule and quality in a timeline format. As my sleep profile grows the Nest Hub will compare my consistency night-to-night to offer actionable advice based on the timeline of your overnight activity and guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

For example if you cough frequently throughout the night your Nest Hub might suggest it's allergen-related and recommend it's time to get new bedding. It can encourage certain environmental changes based on smart home devices such as evening lighting lower thermostat temperatures or ambient sounds too. I had trouble getting to sleep for a few nights in a row so I took my Nest Hub’s suggestion of a thunderstorm noise soundtrack.

The Nest Hub does not provide specific sleep cycle data like some fitness trackers do but the actionable sleep tracking data is among the most comprehensive I’ve seen for a consumer-facing device. That is when the data is accurate — one night I accidentally placed a glass of water in front of my display interfering with radar sensing. I also imagine that if I shared my bed with another human my readings could be less accurate although Google says this shouldn’t be a problem. But on most nights my Apple Watch’s and the Google Nest Hub’s sleep duration readings fell within 10 minutes of each other giving me confidence in contactless sleep tracking.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Although being “sensed” still sounds a little creepy I forgot my display was watching me after a few days. Since my Apple Watch needs to be charged for overnight wear I spend more time than I’d like being prepared for sleep tracking. I appreciate the invisibility of the feature on the new Google Nest Hub.

Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) review: Other smart features

We've always liked Google's smart display UI but the new Nest Hub revamps the interface to make controlling all the best smart home devices more intuitive. My one qualm is that the display returns to the home screen if you don’t tap on your devices fast enough but the interface upgrade makes up for it. Of course I could always manage my devices as well as make voice calls launch videos and get answers to queries by asking Google Assistant aloud too.

On-device processing is nothing new for Google. On the Nest Audio the built-in chip allowed for a faster assistant. On the Nest Hub your assistant should learn your most common commands over time as well as process the best Google Assistant commands overall without sending data to the cloud. The added mic ( three total) should make it easier for your assistant to recognize its wake words as well. Expect speedy responses and effortless integration with your Google Maps  Google Calendar and other in-brand services.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

That includes YouTube which is a key advantage Google’s displays have over Amazon’s. I can also call up any of the best Netflix shows best Disney Plus shows and more as well. The Nest Hub Max’s larger display makes it a better vessel for watching shows but it doesn’t offer touch gestures like the new Nest Hub. That said I had some issues learning how to use touch gestures. You have to be fast and precise with your air tap to successfully pause or play video. You also need to be standing directly in front of the display for the tool to work. Still I could only get them to work half the time.

The final smart home feature worth calling out is support for Thread radio. Thread is the protocol that enables future integrations across multiple smart home companies. The network isn't immensely popular right now but more and more companies offer cross-brand compatibility. We're heading in the direction of a more unified smart home system and the Google Nest Hub is prepared to keep up.

Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) review: Sound quality

The Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) isn’t the smart speaker to get for sound. Yes it’s good for such a small display but I wouldn’t use it for music unless it’s the only speaker in my room. I favor the Nest Hub Max Sonos One or even my Amazon Echo Show 8.

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Google did boost the bass by 50% this time around which is an improvement over the total absence of bass in the first-generation model. When I listened to “The Joker” by Steve Miller Band I could hear the steady bass riff throughout. The vocals sounded strong at medium volume but when I turned the tunes up Miller’s bluesy voice started wavering.

Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) review: Verdict

Compared to the original Nest Hub the Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) is a more attractive smart display in every way. The aesthetic upgrades though minor make it look more luxurious than the fair $99 price suggests. I already liked Google Assistant's smart display UI but it’s somehow sharper than before. Soli’s sensing abilities though could be improved make sleep tracking less cumbersome than you’d expect. Even if it’s a little creepy.

I wish the speaker had more oomph but again you wouldn’t buy the Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) for the sound. Instead it’s an affordable visual and physical means for managing your smart home — and uniquely your sleep."

Globalization has shaped the world for the last 30 years but it's now coming to an end. That's the view of two of the world's best-known investors BlackRock chief Larry Fink and Oaktree chair Howard Marks.

""The Russian invasion of Ukraine has put an end to the globalization we have experienced over the last three decades"" Fink wrote in his latest letter to shareholders last week.

A day earlier Marks had shared a similar sentiment in one of his well-read memos. He said the war had made companies and governments realize how they'd become reliant on others.

""The recognition of these negative aspects of globalization has now caused the pendulum to swing back toward local sourcing"" he said.

But what exactly is globalization? Economists at the Peterson Institute define it as the growing interdependence of the world's economies people and cultures. It's brought about by crossborder trade in goods and services as well as by flows of investment people and information.

An end to the process would have dramatic consequences not least for investors who have become used to a highly integrated world.

Here are three areas where the end of globalization — if it comes — could have a profound impact.

Global energy markets

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has had a dramatic impact on the global economy and markets. No where is that more clear than in surging commodities prices. Brent crude oil which stood at around $64 a barrel a year ago is now trading at more than $110.

In Fink's view higher fossil-fuel prices will help drive the transition to green energy. That means the prospects for renewable energy companies could be bright in the medium term.

""More than ever countries that don't have their own energy sources will need to fund and develop them – which for many will mean investing in wind and solar power"" Fink wrote.

Yet the BlackRock boss was less optimistic about the short term. A need to cut back on Russian oil has driven countries like the US to increase their own fossil-fuel production.

Many investors have pivoted toward energy companies and commodities which plenty believe are set to keep rising over the next year as the war plays out.

Inflation

Closely linked to energy is the question of inflation. It's above 5% in Europe and the UK and has surged to a 40-year high in the US.

An end to globalization is likely to make things worse Fink and Marks warned.

Marks highlighted how ""offshoring"" — in which companies use cheap foreign labor to produce their products — has led to a sharp fall in the cost of goods.

The end of that process could give working-class communities in the US and Europe a boost. But it could also drive up prices simply because Western workers are more expensive.

""A large-scale reorientation of supply chains will inherently be inflationary"" Fink wrote. ""Central banks must choose whether to live with higher inflation or slow economic activity and employment to lower inflation quickly.""

Crypto and other opportunities

BlackRock's Fink who previously suggested bitcoin might be worthless now thinks digital currencies may have a role to play in a deglobalizing world. He said the war will force countries to reconsider their currency dependency.

""A global digital-payment system thoughtfully designed can enhance the settlement of international transactions while reducing the risk of money laundering and corruption.""

Marks went into fewer specifics but ended his memo on a hopeful note.

""After many decades of globalization and cost minimization I think we're about to find investment opportunities in the swing toward reliable supply"" he said.

Buy Any of These 3 BlackRock ETF Portfolios to Be Set for Life,"ETF chart stocks

Written by Tony Dong at The Motley Fool Canada

Active stock picking can be time consuming stressful and prone to variable results. For the average investor there is ample evidence that passive investing using a variety of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) following major stock market indexes is great way to go. This approach requires little time knowledge or effort.

Thankfully Canadian investors have access to a variety of asset-allocation ETFs to use as a one-stop shop for their investment portfolios. These ETFs provide a set of all-in-one investment portfolios that anyone can buy with just a single ticker. Let’s take a look at my top picks from BlackRock!

The 100% stock option

Young investors with a high risk tolerance and long time horizon can consider investing in a 100% stock portfolio especially given how bonds are expected to suffer in a rising interest rate environment. If this sounds like you the best ETF to buy might be iShares Core Equity ETF Portfolio (TSX:XEQT).

ADVERTISEMENT

XEQT grants instant exposure to over 9593 stocks covering the entire world’s investable market. The stocks in the ETF are divided roughly 45% in the U.S. 25% in Canada 25% in international developed markets and 5% in international emerging markets. Buying XEQT will ensure you match the market’s average return over time.

Currently XEQT also pays an annual dividend yield of 1.40% and has assets under management (AUM) of $1.78 billion. The fund costs a management expense ratio (MER) of 0.20% to hold which is extremely affordable for an all-in-one ETF portfolio that re-balances itself.

The 80/20% stock/bond option

Investors with a medium risk tolerance and time horizon (such as those in their 40s) should consider a portfolio with a heavier allocation to fixed income. To achieve this you could buy iShares Core Growth ETF Portfolio (TSX:XGRO).

XGRO holds the same stocks as XEQT but also includes a 20% allocation to investment-grade government and corporate bonds from around the world. The addition of a bond ETF will help lower volatility and reduce draw downs. Holding XGRO will also cost you an MER of 0.20% or $20 per $10000 invested.

Story continues

The 60/40% stock/bond option

Finally investors with a lower risk tolerance and a shorter time horizon (such as those in their 50s) should consider adopting a more balanced portfolio with a higher fixed-income allocation. iShares Core Balanced ETF Portfolio (TSX:XBAL) fits that role well.

XBAL holds the exact same stocks and bonds as XGRO but with a more balanced allocation of 60/40 stocks/bonds. The 60/40 portfolio is regarded as the optimal blend of risk and return making it highly suitable for a long-term holding in your retirement account. Like XEQT and XGRO XBAL costs an MER of 0.24%.

The Foolish takeaway

For new investors it’s very hard to beat BlackRock’s asset allocation ETFs. There’s no research required and no second-guessing. You are literally investing in the world stock market which is as safe as it gets. Without these ETFs it would be impossible for the average investor to buy and manage a portfolio of 9000+ stocks and bonds.

For an MER less than a quarter of what typical mutual funds charge you get instant diversification via thousands of global stocks and bonds with no rebalancing required. Buying XEQT XGRO or XBAL consistently and reinvesting the dividends will allow you to match the market in the long run and beat most retail investors!

Apocalypse Joins Global Day of Action for Climate March,"Hundreds of Bay Area students marched across San Francisco’s Financial District on Friday as part of a global day of demonstrations tied to the Fridays for Future youth movement.

Oakland’s Youth Vs. Apocalypse organized high schoolers and other young kids from across the region. The students walked from Embarcadero Plaza to the headquarters of the investment management company BlackRock on Howard St. and to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office on Sansome St.

The protestors painted their hands red and marked the pavement to symbolize how these groups are failing to protect their lives and futures.

“The world is in a state of crisis” organizers said in a statement. “The climate crisis threatens the sake of all life on earth. We recognize that the climate crisis does not impact people equally and disproportionately severely impacts communities of color as well as low income communities.”

A native of Trenton NJ Blackstone got started in music as a drummer at the city’s Old Bethel Baptist Church. Raised in Willingboro he moved to Philadelphia in 2000 to attend the University of the Arts where he studied music. It was there that he began hanging out at Black Lily a Tuesday night jam session hosted by Old City’s Five Spot that also played a role in the development of musicians like Jill Scott and John Legend.

Blackstone ended up meeting the late Roots manager Richard Nichols there and then through Roots drummer Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson (who himself was nominated for an Oscar this year for his film Summer of Soul (...Or When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised))  he began working in Jay-Z’s touring band. He would eventually drop out of UArts in 2003 but went on to graduate in 2013.

He’d go on to become bassist and music director for Rihanna in 2012 and worked with Eminem on his comeback show at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2014. He’s worked with artists ranging from the Jonas Brothers and Adam Levine to Kanye West and Janet Jackson.

But Philadelphians will probably care most about his role at Super Bowl LII in 2018 where the Eagles scored their lone Lombardi trophy. There he lead a 15-piece band during Timberlake’s halftime show.

“God could not have written this any better for my life” Blackstone told the Inquirer that year. “I couldn’t have scripted it any better.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm92aWRlbmNlam91cm5hbC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIyLzAzLzI2L21vcmUtdHJhZmZpYy1jYW1lcmFzLXdhdGNoaW5nLWRyaXZlcnMtcGF3dHVja2V0LWNlbnRyYWwtZmFsbHMtY3VtYmVybGFuZC83MTY4ODYyMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why more cameras are watching drivers in RI's Blackstone Valley,"As Pawtucket is debating whether to activate a network of surveillance cameras that can track vehicles being sought by the police video cameras have sprouted up at intersections in the nearby communities of Central Falls and Cumberland.

But the state Department of Transportation which installed the cameras said they aren't for surveillance. The cameras monitor whether a vehicle is waiting at a red light so the computer that monitors the traffic lights can give the vehicle a green according to department spokesman Charles St. Martin.

The department recently upgraded intersections on Broad Street from the Pawtucket line to the street's intersection with Mendon Road in Cumberland.

The cameras along Broad Street which is a state highway also known as Route 114 replace an older technology in which an electrical loop was embedded in the pavement. The loop sensed a change in the electrical field caused by a large mass of metal passing above it.

The camera system is better at detecting smaller vehicles such as bicycles and motorcycles which often evade detection by the loop system. This is part of the reason the camera system was chosen for Broad Street which is having a bike lane installed as part of recent upgrades.

The cameras which can see about 100 feet down the road can also be used in situations where loops can't be used — such as near bridges where the structure of the bridge prevents placement of a loop and in areas that are prone to potholes or where underground utilities have to be dug up frequently.

The loops are preferred for their simplicity in situations where they are appropriate St. Martin said.

The cameras aren't foolproof though he said. They can be blinded by heavy snow or by sun glare. In such cases the computer controlling the intersection goes into fail-safe mode just as it would if a loop malfunctioned.

The d:RI could be closer than ever to issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants

In fail-safe mode the computer acts as if a car is waiting at every approach to the intersection even when none are there. This impedes the flow of traffic and increases pollution as vehicles idle waiting for a red light to change when it didn't need to be red.

The department currently has cameras at three dozen intersections across the state.

What's up with Flock cameras in Pawtucket?

The city had 17 cameras installed as part of a 60-day trial that began Sept. 15 according to police Chief Tina Goncalves. They were shut off at the end of the trial and Goncalves is in discussions with the City Council whether to pay for their continued use and turn the cameras back on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAzLTI3Ly10aGUtbW9yZ2FuLXN0YW5sZXktZmFkZS11LXMtcHJvYmUtZHJlZGdlcy11cC15ZWFycy1vZi1hbmltdXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Morgan Stanley Fade': U.S. Probe Dredges Up Years of Animus,"Why did this happen?

The Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense revealed this in a Facebook post on March 20.

“Another group of militants linked to Yevgeniy Prigozhin a Russian propagandist close to Putin and owner of the Liga (Wagner) began arriving in Ukraine today” the intelligence agency claimed. “The main task of criminals is to eliminate the top military and political leadership of Ukraine.”

On February 28 The Times a UK-based daily had reported that more than 400 Russian-backed mercenaries were operating in Kyiv on orders from Moscow to assassinate President Zelensky and his cabinet colleagues.

The report specifically named Wagner Group a private militia run by Putin’s close associate Yevgeniy Prigozhin. While the latest intelligence alert could be part of Kyiv’s sustained information campaign against Moscow the practice of deploying mercenaries for special operations is not new something both Russia and its arch-rival America have been doing for years.

Earlier this month Ukrainian President Zelensky had urged foreign fighters to help defend his country against Russian troops. According to reports military contractors were scouting for ex-soldiers to take on Putin’s “hired killers” offering them each a handsome pay of $60000 a month.

Anyone with five years of military experience in eastern Europe would be eligible for this job. Additionally the candidate must be skilled in reconnaissance and rescue operations with “little to no support” and familiar with Soviet-era weaponry according to a previous report by The Times.

Blackwater’s Dark Past

In the wake of the Ukraine invasion Erik Prince the founder of the infamous Blackwater (now called ‘Academi’) mercenary group had reportedly told Fox News host Tucker Carlson that he could have stopped the Russian attack if only US President Joe Biden would have let him do it.

Tucker brings on Erik Prince who claims he pitched a plan to the Administration in Dec to have 140 fighter planes that were about to be retired from service sent to Ukraine flown by mercenary pilots and that Putin wouldn’t have invaded if Biden had agreed to his plan. pic.twitter.com/vz7c8vBLwk — Ron Filipkowski ?? (@RonFilipkowski) February 25 2022

Prince a former US Navy SEAL officer purportedly claimed that Biden had rejected his proposal to have his pilots take 140 aircraft to Ukraine which could have deterred the Russians. This is the same man whose actions had exposed America’s dirty war secrets in the Middle East more than a decade back.

In one of the most unjust decisions then-US President Donald Trump had in December 2020 pardoned four Blackwater mercenaries convicted of the murder of 14 Iraqi civilians including two children in Baghdad in 2007.

Prince’s sister Betsy DeVos had served as the Education Secretary in the Trump administration between 2017 and 2021.

According to The Guardian the four Blackwater mercenaries – Paul Slough Evan Liberty Dustin Heard and Nicholas Slatten – were part of an armored convoy that opened fire indiscriminately with machine guns grenade launchers and a sniper on the 14 unarmed Iraqis at Nisour Square in Baghdad.

In his book Blackwater: The Rise of the World’s Most Powerful Mercenary Army author Jeremy Scahill wrote:

“…Private security forces faced no legal consequences for their deadly action in the first five years of the Iraq occupation. As of Spring 2008 not a single had been prosecuted for a crime against an Iraqi…Within the Bush administration they were either praised or unmentioned. In Congress privatized war almost a non-issue…But following Nisour Square Blackwater and other mercenary firms suddenly lost their fiercely guarded covert status.”

The Nisour Square massacre was a blot the US cannot get rid of even today. It earned so much notoriety that Blackwater was forced to rebrand itself as ‘Academi’.

The Russian Deep State

Founded by Putin’s close confidante Yevgeniy Prigozhin the Wagner Group is the Russian version of Blackwater. This private militia is among the entities the West has sanctioned following Mosco’s military operations in Ukraine. It is accused of helping finance the mercenaries in Ukraine Libya and Syria according to Al Jazeera.

“The Wagner Group is responsible for serious human rights abuses in Ukraine Syria Libya the Central African Republic Sudan and Mozambique” the European Union said.

Putin denied this charge asserting that private military contractors have the right to work and pursue their interests anywhere in the world as long as they do not break Russian law. He also insisted the Wagner Group neither represented Moscow nor was paid by the government the Al Jazeera report said.

However there is more to this than meets the eye. Security analysts call the Wagner Group the de facto private army of Putin. Its founder Prigozhin is dubbed “Putin’s cook” for his close links to the Kremlin according to reports.

The Wagner mercenaries are purportedly trained by the Russian military and operate in close coordination with GRU a Russian military intelligence agency which maintains its own special forces units.

The United Nations and the Western governments have accused the Wagner Group of human rights violation in the Central African Republic and involvement in the conflicts in Libya and Mali.

Earlier Russia was believed to have deployed the Wagner Group in its war in Donbas to support separatist forces of Donetsk and Luhansk. Putin recognized the independence of these two breakaway regions of Ukraine three days before he ordered military operations against the country last month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpbGxib2FyZC5jb20vbXVzaWMvYXdhcmRzL3RyYXZpcy1iYXJrZXIta291cnRuZXkta2FyZGFzaGlhbi0yMDIyLW9zY2Fycy0xMjM1MDQ5NzU3L9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpbGxib2FyZC5jb20vbXVzaWMvYXdhcmRzL3RyYXZpcy1iYXJrZXIta291cnRuZXkta2FyZGFzaGlhbi0yMDIyLW9zY2Fycy0xMjM1MDQ5NzU3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian Hit the 2022 Oscars Red Carpet in Black,"With Travis Barker appearing as a musician at the 2022 Oscars the blink-182 drummer took the opportunity to walk Sunday night’s (March 27) red carpet with fiancé Kourtney Kardashian.

Another Boeing plane has been grounded after a fatal crash this time in China. That may be the least of the company’s problems in a crucial market.

The decision to ground the Boeing model 737-800 was made by China Eastern Airlines which operated the jet that crashed March 21 killing all 132 on board. The cause of the crash has yet to be determined and the grounding could be lifted soon if it turns out the cause was not mechanical.

But Boeing has plenty of other troubles in China the world’s largest aviation market. It is on the verge of being virtually shut out of the region as trade tensions between the United States and China have basically halted Boeing sales in the country for the last four years. The company has not announced any sales to a Chinese passenger airline since November 2017. Only six months ago Boeing projected the Chinese market would be worth $1.5 trillion in commercial aircraft purchases over the next 20 years.

It takes a long time to build and deliver planes after they’re ordered and Boeing continued to deliver jets to China’s airlines and leasing companies in 2018 and early 2019. But only 40 of them have been delivered since March 2019. That’s when aviation authorities around the globe grounded Boeing’s bestselling jet the 737 Max after two fatal crashes were found to have been caused by a design flaw. That grounding stretched on for 20 months.

The US Federal Aviation Administration cleared the plane to carry passengers again in November 2020 with most other countries’ aviation authorities following close behind. Airlines that owned the 737 Max were soon flying the plane again.

But not in China where the aviation regulator — one of the first to ground the Max after the second accident — waited another year to clear the plane to fly. Chinese airlines that own the planes still have not returned them to service.

“We would now expect further delays to Chinese reinstatement of the 737 Max while this accident is investigated at least until a likely cause is identified” said a note this week from Melius Research.

Key market

Losing a market as important as China would be a devastating blow to Boeing (BA) which has been hit by one problem after another over the last three years starting with the 737 Max crashes and then the pandemic which all but obliterated demand for flying and devastated the finances of its airline customers. More recently there have been issues with its latest model the 787 Dreamliner halting deliveries.

In 2017 and 2018 China accounted for more than 20% of Boeing’s global deliveries but since the start of 2020 the percentage has dropped to below 5%. (Boeing gets most of its revenue when a plane is delivered.)

Some experts believe Boeing has reached agreements to sell some planes to Chinese airlines in the last four years either through a leasing company or via sales in which the name of the buyer is not made public. But no aircraft orders are official without approval from the Chinese government which views plane sales as leverage in its negotiations with the United States on overall trade issues said Richard Aboulafia aerospace analyst with AeroDynamic Advisory.

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors in October “We remain in active discussions with our Chinese customers on their fleet planning needs and continue to urge leaders in both countries to resolve trade differences.”

The longer the current grounding drags on the more Boeing is at serious risk of losing out on the Chinese market analysts say.

Typically an airline is reluctant to switch between aircraft manufacturers because such a pivotal change increases the cost of pilot training and makes spare parts more costly. If Chinese customers with Boeing planes in their fleets were to start buying jets from rival Airbus (EADSF) it would be a long-term shift not easily reversed and one made by the Chinese government rather than the airlines.

“Boeing has its fans over there. But a political mandate in China is a political mandate” Aboulafia said.

He and other experts expect Boeing will eventually get back some sales and deliveries in China but at a much lower number than it was counting on just a few years ago.

China “can get some planes they need from Airbus but they can’t get all their planes from Airbus” said Ronald Epstein aerospace analyst with Bank of America. Aboulafia describes the relationship between China and Boeing as a “bad marriage with no possibility of divorce.”

The only good news for Boeing is China’s aviation sector is not as important as it appeared it would be a decade ago when experts were projecting the market would account for 30% of all global commercial jet purchases. China’s aviation industry was slowing even before the pandemic Aboulafia said from a 12.2% growth rate in 2018’s fourth quarter to 5.3% a year later just before the outbreak of Covid came to light.

If Boeing loses much of the Chinese market long-term it will be relegated to being a permanent No. 2 behind Airbus. Global commercial jet sales are essentially a duopoly between the two companies. Being a permanent No. 2 would put Boeing at a long-term competitive disadvantage Epstein said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2Vkd2FyZHNlZ2FsLzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvYWZ0ZXItZGVhZGx5LWNyYXNoLWZhYS1jaGllZi1kZWZlbmRzLXRoZS1zYWZldHktcmVjb3JkLW9mLWJvZWluZy03MzctODAwLXBsYW5lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After Deadly Crash FAA Chief Defends The Safety Record Of Boeing 737-800 Planes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardsegal/2022/03/26/after-deadly-crash-faa-chief-defends-the-safety-record-of-boeing-737-800-planes/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2Vkd2FyZHNlZ2FsLzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvYWZ0ZXItZGVhZGx5LWNyYXNoLWZhYS1jaGllZi1kZWZlbmRzLXRoZS1zYWZldHktcmVjb3JkLW9mLWJvZWluZy03MzctODAwLXBsYW5lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS93aGljaC1haXJsaW5lcy1oYXZlLWZsb3duLXRoZS1tb3N0LWV4YW1wbGVzLW9mLWVhY2gtYm9laW5nLTc2Ny12YXJpYW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which Airlines Have Flown The Most Examples Of Each Boeing 767 Variant?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS93aGljaC1haXJsaW5lcy1oYXZlLWZsb3duLXRoZS1tb3N0LWV4YW1wbGVzLW9mLWVhY2gtYm9laW5nLTc2Ny12YXJpYW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcmVzcG9uc2libGVzdGF0ZWNyYWZ0Lm9yZy8yMDIyLzAzLzI2L3RoZS13b3JzdC1kZWZlbnNlLXByb2dyYW0tb2YtYWxsLWFuZC1pdHMtbm90LXRoZS1mLTM1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The worst' defense program of all. And it's not the F-35,"When Vladimir Putin took over Crimea in 2014 the immediate reaction among defense lobbyists was ""borderline euphoric"" as one denizen of that world told me at the time. As might be expected the invasion of Ukraine has brought a bountiful harvest for the military industrial complex as manifested in the $782.5 billion budget for 2023 recently waved through by congressional appropriators. In every respect the proposed budget reflects the Pentagon's core strategy which in the words of the late Col. John Boyd is ""Don’t interrupt the money flow add to it."" Thus it is that we continue to pour cash into notorious sink-holes such as the F-35 fighter still unable to pass operational tests and for most of the time incapable of carrying out its combat missions.

Even worse than the F-35?

But despite the F-35's regular reminders that our system of ""defense"" hardly deserves the name there is another air force program largely unknown in the wider world that to my mind is the quintessence of everything that is rotten about the system; a perfect case-study not only in straightforward financial malfeasance but also in the unceasing and disastrous effort to substitute technology for human actions. I refer to the KC-46 aerial tanker.

The system worked

Flying tankers ""gas stations in the sky"" are the arteries of global U.S. military operations essential for deploying troops supplies and bombing missions around the globe. Since the 1950s this vital service has been largely provided by the Boeing KC-135 which first flew in 1956 as well as a smaller number of McDonnell Douglas KC-10s dating from the 1970s. These aircraft supply fuel via a retractable boom which is guided onto the recipient plane by an operator looking through a window at the back of the tanker. The system is simple and has worked with minimal mishap for some seventy years.

The dirtiest deal ever

In 2001 the air force requested bids for a new tanker to replace its aging fleet. Boeing won with a design based on its existing 767 airliner securing a contract for 100 tankers. But rather than simply buying the planes in the normal fashion the air force agreed to lease them from Boeing. This novel arrangement was burdensome to the taxpayer but vastly profitable to the corporation adding at least $10 billion to the cost of the program. Subsequent investigation revealed that Darlene Druyon the senior air force official negotiating the deal known to her peers as “the Dragon Lady.” had simultaneously negotiated a fat post-retirement contract for herself. Other senior Pentagon officials including the secretary of the air force as well as the Pentagon’s chief weapons-buyer were also revealed to have worked hard on Boeing's behalf. Druyun ultimately went to jail along with a senior Boeing executive. Asked in a senate hearing whether in thirty-three years of government service he had ""ever seen a deal as dirty as this one"" the chief auditor of the Pentagon's Inspector General's office replied ""No sir I have not.""

Boeing loses contract. Gets contract back. Delivers largely useless plane. Late.

Following exposure of these squalid dealings Boeing's contract was cancelled. A new competition handed the prize to a consortium of the Northrop-Grumman corporation and Europe's Airbus which offered a variant of the Airbus 330 airliner. Boeing fought back fiercely and succeeded in getting the airbus deal cancelled. A further competition seemingly tilted in Boeing’s favor handed the contract back to the corporation in 2011. Development proceeded with the plane dubbed the KC-46 ""Pegasus"" projected to enter service in 2017. The inevitable schedule slippages and cost overruns ensued and of course the KC-46 did not come into service on time. In early 2021 the USAF cleared the plane for only limited use meaning it could refuel some but not all of the air force's planes and fly exclusively over the continental U.S. thus deeming the plane useless for combat operations.

Let’s replace human eyesight

Amid a host of problems such as leaking fuel and ""foreign objects"" mislaid by careless construction workers inside the fuselage one fundamental defect defies solution despite hundreds of millions of dollars sluiced into efforts to solve it. As noted existing refueling systems rely on a boom-operator using his own two eyes to guide the boom. It's simple and it works. But the airforce had a better idea which it mandated be employed in any new tanker. Discarding the low-tech option of human eyesight the KC-46 moves boom control up to the front of the plane where a crewman sits in front of a video monitor featuring an image of the recipient plane and attempts to guide the boom via a Remote Vision System.

Bad idea

It doesn't work. As a Government Accountability Office report stated dryly in January this year the system did not provide ""visual clarity"" meaning that a lot of the time boom operators can't properly see the plane they're trying to refuel or connect with it properly when they do.

""The lack of visual clarity also resulted in undetected contacts with some receiver aircraft and in some cases damage to the receiver aircraft’s coating"" meaning that receiving pilots risk having their fuselages dented or windshields cracked. Boeing is now working on a second iteration of this disastrous system ""RVS 2.0"" which will feature high definition 4k video cameras infrared cameras laser rangefinders and “augmented reality” all in an effort to reproduce the visual clarity especially depth perception that comes with the traditional benefits of three-dimensional human eyesight.

Someone who knows

No one it seems bothered to ask the people who would be on the receiving end of the wondrous new technology. A veteran combat pilot friend who has ""tanked"" hundreds of times from various tankers put it this way to me in a recent email:

""The problem is that most systems we have tried to build to replace the human in the boom seem to be epic fails. Human eyes are still better at seeing things like closure rates / depth perception / and through high cloud ice crystals. I have had some wicked close calls that were saved by a human in the boom.""

We still trust Boeing and we will pay for that.

Under its 2011 contract Boeing was supposed to shoulder any development costs exceeding the “fixed price” $4.9 billion contract which might suggest stern resolve by the military to make the contractor pay for its failures. Of course the defense business doesn't work like that. Uncle Sam or at least General Sam always looks after his own. Thus the air force is pledged to continue buying twelve to fifteen planes a year at around $180 million a pop regardless of the fact that they are largely useless. Meanwhile the promised RVS 2.0 will not be independently tested before 118 planes altogether 60 percent of the production run of 179 KC-46s have already been built. In other words the air force has agreed to take Boeing at its word that the new system actually works. On the likely assumption that it won't the taxpayer will have to bear the burden of further attempts to fix the system.

Making the real world go away

This is not only a particularly egregious case of defense corruption but also an example of a deeper problem: the urge to displace direct perceptions of the real world in favor of costly and therefore profitable technological interfaces. At its most extreme this has given us drone warfare in which ""pilots"" in Nevada or some such remote location select human targets on the other side of the world. Reality does not need to be augmented.

Pobeda which is the low-cost arm of the country’s flag carrier Aeroflot is cutting its Boeing 737-800 fleet from 41 aircraft to 25 according to multiple media reports. The sources cite the airline’s acting general director Andrey Yurikov’s letter the air carrier’s employees.

In the letter Yurikov reportedly explains that the move would help the airline to accumulate a stock of spare parts that would last “until the lost supply chains are restored”.

In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on Russia prohibiting sales of aircraft spare parts as well as other related equipment to Russian airlines.

Since then several major aerospace companies have cut ties with Russia including Boeing which announced the suspension of parts maintenance and technical support for Russian carriers on March 2 2022.

“We have suspended major operations in Moscow and temporarily closed our office in Kyiv. We are also suspending parts maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines. As the conflict continues our teams are focused on ensuring the safety of our teammates in the region” the American manufacturer said at the time.

The first model developed in this era is the Kyalami named after the circuit where a Maserati-engined Cooper had won the ‘67 GP.

In the aftermath of the Oil Crisis the 1970s were a period of economic turmoil and social unrest in the Italian Republic. Colloquially referred to as the Years of Lead this period wasn’t particularly good for the Modena-based manufacturer founded by the Maserati brothers in 1914 in Bologna.Due to abysmal sales and a sense of stagnation de Tomaso decided to dismiss chief engineer Giulio Alfieri. He was central to for more than two decades. For example he oversaw the development of Maserati’s first mass-produced car the 3500 GT we’ve covered in detail in a previous article.With the help of American dollars from the Ford Motor Company de Tomaso developed three models: the Pantera the Deauville and the visually challenged Longchamp. The latter is a short-wheelbase take on the Deauville and it also served as the basis of the Kyalami. Penned by the amazing Pietro Frua the Maserati-branded gran turismo is rocking the very same chassis as the Longchamp yet it’s decidedly different in many other respects.Take for instance the powerplant. Alfieri’s legacy lives on in the engine bay of the Kyalami where you’ll find 4.2- and 4.9-liter V8 engines based on the 4.2 that premiered in the Quattroporte. Those lumps are derived from the 4.9-liter V8 used in Maserati’s first V8 road-going car the 5000 GT.Obviously more desirable than the 351ci Ford Cleveland engine in the Longchamp the Tipo AM 107.21.42 cranks out 266 horsepower at 6000 revolutions per minute and 289 pound-feet (392 Nm) at 3800 rpm. The only transmission available was a five-speed manual gearbox the ZF S5-24-3.Torque is unchanged for the Tipo AM 107.23.49 although it peaks earlier at 3000 revolutions per minute. The larger engine also happens to be more potent by 10 horsepower for a grand total of 276 ponies at 5600 rpm. The 4.9-liter Kyalami came standard with a BorgWarner three-speed automatic rather than the Ford C6 of the Longchamp. The ZF manual was optional.Tipping the scales at 1670 kilograms (3682 pounds) this half-breed needs just over 7 seconds to reach 100 kilometers per hour (62 miles per hour). If you keep your right foot planted on the accelerator pedal the speedometer needle will eventually go to 240 kilometers per hour (148 miles per hour).An indirect replacement for the Mexico that we’ve also covered in a previous write-up the Kyalami was unveiled in November 1976 at the Turin Motor Show alongside a prototype for the third-generation Quattroporte.Riding on a 2600-millimeter wheelbase the 2+2 grand tourer is a unibody like the Mexico before it. Double wishbones up front an independent rear axle with hydraulically-assisted inboard brakes featuring 286-millimeter discs 15- by 7.5-inch magnesium wheels from Campagnolo Michelin XDX tires power steering and two fuel tanks also need to be mentioned.Gifted with either Weber 40 DCNF-6 or 42 DCNF-6 depending on the displacement the Maserati V8 flaunts two valves per cylinder an 8.5:1 compression ratio and a single distributor supplied by Magneti Marelli. Both displacements feature alloy blocks and heads. We also need to highlight DOHCs that allow the Tipo 107 to rev higher than the 351C.From a visual standpoint it’s easy to identify the Kyalami through its circular headlights rather than the Ford Granada-sourced rectangular units of the Longchamp. Fabricated entirely from steel the Mazza is tastefully appointed with Connolly leather upholstery and “mousehair” on the dash.Standard features also include air conditioning electric windows as well a power driver-side mirror. Only 200 units were produced in total split between 125 examples with the 4.2 and 75 cars with the 4.9-liter engine.",,,,,,,,,

39 new homes are being built in Marton near Gainsborough as part of a £12 million housing scheme. Two to four-bedroom single and two-storey properties in Stow Park Road are being constructed by E5 Living UK which wants to build high specification eco-friendly homes.

It is also building 100 new homes at King’s Park in Grimsby as well as further sites in Market Rasen and Casitor. The first properties in Marton are expected to be on the market by the autumn.

E5 is also building a new car park at the neighbouring Marton Academy and is looking to further support local charities and organisations during the process. Cleethorpes based Hodson Architects is leading the project.

E5 Director Kevin Stevens said: “We are delighted to bring these much needed new homes to Marton particularly as there’s a nationwide shortage of single storey and eco-friendly homes. People want to live cleaner and take responsibility for themselves concerning the environment we all live in.

“Our experience in Lincolnshire to date has shown that buyers are keen on the open plan contemporary style properties we deliver as they offer more flexible living and suit the way we use our homes today. We pride ourselves on delivering a high specification of homes as standard far in excess of the traditional new builds on offer so we’re expecting a lot of interest when they come to market.”

Andy Miles Director of Kenmore Design added: “Working with E5 Living UK and in this area of Lincolnshire is an exciting development for us. We will be building on our supply chain network here which will have a valuable impact on the local economy.

“E5 has a clear vision for a new generation of homes at Marton Meadows and we’re looking forward to delivering them.” The selling agent for the project is Lincoln's Mount and Minster.

James Ward partner at Mount & Minster said: “It is a fantastic opportunity for environmentally conscious buyers who demand the highest standards of build quality and luxury finishes. E5 has really listened to what the market is asking for and the new homes in Marton will deliver this with style.

""I am excited to bring to market a development of extremely well designed and built high spec properties; it is a perfect fit with the Mount & Minster brand.” Potential buyers can register their interest here.",,,,,,

Physicians are challenged continually to explore other options that may offer solutions for hard-to-treat cases. But questions remain as to which drugs might have indications beyond those that are FDA-approved and which new medications may be worth prescribing despite open questions about their long-term risks and rewards.

Creating successful treatment plans around the off-label use of biologics and new medications provided the focus of a session conducted at the American Academy of Dermatology’s 2022 Annual Meeting by David Rosmarin MD FAAD clinical investigator and vice-chair for research and education at Tufts Medical Center Boston Massachusetts in collaboration with Adriane A Levin MD FAAD director of the atopic dermatitis program at Brigham and Women's Hospital and an instructor in dermatology at the Harvard Medical School both based in Boston Massachusetts.1

The speakers highlighted strategies for optimizing the delivery of appropriate treatments for individual patients’ needs. Their review of the literature on off-label biologics use and new medications centered on TNF-alpha inhibitors anti-IL-17 antibodies anti-I-L23 biologics dupilumab (Dupixent; Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) and apremilast (Otezla; Amgen).

“Unfortunately it takes a lot of money and a lot of resources for a company to get an indication for medication” Rosmarin said. “So a lot of the time the uses for medications aren’t consistent with the label.”

Dupilumab is one example he said. “It’s currently approved for atopic dermatitis (AD) asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis” he noted. “But we see that it works with other conditions such as hand eczema or allergic contact dermatitis and patients who have HIV pruritis.”

There have also been recent studies which showed the drug’s effectiveness in treating chronic spontaneous urticarial and prurigo nodular as well according to Rosmarin.

“Some other inflammatory disorders where it can be used include alopecia areata and Grover’s Disease” he added. “Some evidence shows it can be combined with other psoriasis biologics if a patient has both psoriasis and atopic dermatitis simultaneously” Rosmarin added. “It’s been used very recently for some rare genetic syndromes such as Hailey-Hailey disease Job’s syndrome and Netherton syndrome. Those are all exciting uses.”

Dupilumab is gaining some traction in bullous pemphigoid an autoimmune blistering disorder occurring mostly in the elderly that in Rosmarin’s view lacks adequate treatments. He also noted recent cases in which this medication improved outcomes for patients with epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa and pemphigus vulgaris.

“So there has been a lot happening with the use of dupilumab for blistering disorders but the most evidence in the blistering space has been with bullous pemphigoid” Rosmarin said. “Currently there are case series regarding its efficacy in blistering disorders. In a case with 13 patients at least 12 had some clinical improvement with a little over half having complete clearance of both their blisters and itch: 75% having complete resolution of blisters and 85% having some improvement in their itch. Many responded quite rapidly.”2

Dupilumab is also now being tested in a phase 3 program (Liberty-BP NCT04206553) for an indication in this but that study will be a few years away he added.

“A lot of this is very new literature and some of it is not well-known. However it’s important to know because sometimes we are faced with diseases where we need more options” Rosmarin said. “We want treatments that are effective as well as safe for our patients and knowing about these alternative uses allows us to provide them to patients and help them get better.”

He added that most dermatologists will be faced with these rare cases at some point in practice and knowing about these solutions better prepares them for their treatment plans.

Turning to apremilast an oral small-molecule phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor with a multilevel immunomodulating mechanism of action Rosmarin catalogued its on-label uses in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis active psoriatic arthritis in adults and Behcet’s disease.

“In terms of other uses though there are case series of it being used for pyoderma gangrenosum hidradenitis suppurativa seborrheic dermatitis and also one of my favorite uses in lichen planus” Rosmarin said.

He pointed out other possible additions to the seborrheic dermatitis armamentarium: topical roflumilast foam (ARQ-154; Arcutis Biotherapeutics) now in phase 3 trials (Stratum NCT04973228) and topical crisaborole (Eucrisa; Pfizer) another PDE4 inhibitor that has been used off-label for treating this skin disorder.

“In terms of lichen planus there are some patient cases demonstrating that apremilast can improve outcomes and there’s also some evidence about the use of anti-IL-17 anti-IL-23 biologics for lichen planus as well” Rosmarin said.

Anti-IL-17 is approved for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and psoriasis within the dermatology space. Secukinumab’s (Cosentyx; Novartis) safety tolerability and efficacy were studied in a recent Phase 3 trial (NCT01989468) although results have not yet been published Rosmarin noted. “Physicians also look to IL-17 for dissecting scalp cellulitis” he noted.

Similarly for IL-23 there was a case for pyoderma gangrenosum which Rosmarin noted can be a challenging disease to treat.

“The goal is for people to understand better the mechanism by which these medications work so we have a broader view on how to treat some of these off-label diseases” he said. “We want to understand their actions so we can think about them as more than just for their label.”

But this layering of nails is not always readily apparent on clinical examination commonly leading to the wrong therapy and no resolution to the problem according to an expert update at the 2022 American Academy of Dermatology 2022 annual meeting in Boston Massachusetts.

Misinterpretation of the yellow discoloration a common feature of retronychia means ""many patients are maintained on antifungal therapy for years and years with no change in their condition"" reported Phoebe Rich MD director of the Nail Disorders Clinic Oregon Health & Science University Portland.

Infection is not commonly involved in retronychia but importantly antifungals and antibiotics ""have no role in treating the underlying disorder"" Rich said.

The term retronychia and its description is only about 20 years old according to Rich who cited work by David A. de Berker MBBS PhD a consultant dermatologist at University Hospitals in Bristol UK. His publication on this disorder appeared in 1999 with a more detailed description published about 10 years later.

Recently the body of literature on this disorder has been growing contributing to an increasing consensus about etiology diagnosis and treatments to consider in the context of causes and severity Rich said.

Some but not all patients have abnormal formation of the nail bed increasing susceptibility to retronychia but trauma or microtrauma typically serve as a trigger in most cases. Dancing high heels steel-toed shoes and other sources of trauma to the toes are implicated.

Whether or not patients have an inherent susceptibility injury separates the existing nail from the matrix and nail bed so that newly forming nail begins to grow under the nail rather continuing to push out the old nail.

Susceptibility is increased substantially in individuals with a shortened nail bed according to Rich. In severe cases when there is simply inadequate nail bed for the nail growth to attach recurrence is common or even inevitable. Even when the nail is removed and regrowth appears normal at the end of a year those patients with very short nail beds cannot count on a cure.

""Due to the slow growth of nails it might take 2 or 3 years for the problem to recur"" Rich cautioned. For this reason cure rates reported for the various interventions at 1 year might not predict longer-term benefit.

Retronychia is usually a clinical diagnosis based on the presence of the increased bulk of the toenail when overlapping nails cannot be seen. This is not necessarily a single overgrowth. In some cases multiple layers of nails are stacked one on top of the other. Xanthonychia (yellow nail) is usually present.

""The layering might not be visible without removing the nail"" said Rich explaining one reason that the diagnosis is sometimes missed. Ultrasound is a noninvasive means to confirm the problem although Rich warned that imaging is not necessarily reimbursed.

""There is no diagnosis by histopathology so it cannot be confirmed with biopsy"" Rich said.

Treatments range from conservative strategies particularly topical or intralesional steroids in mild cases to more invasive procedures such as clipping of the nail plate or surgical avulsion. All can be effective when used appropriately according to Rich.

""The more invasive procedures are the more effective but the caveat is they are also associated with more complications"" said Rich citing for example the risk of nail dystrophies. Due to the increasing number of studies the relative benefits and risks of retronychia treatment have now been summarized in a recent review. Rich suggested the review is one of the most recent and detailed evaluations of the topic that ""I encourage everyone to read.""

Despite progress in describing retronychia Rich said that there might be more to learn about risk. In particular she cited the work of Dana W. Stern MD a specialist in nail disorders who is in private practice in New York City. Stern is pursuing a hypothesis that at least some cases are due to potentially targetable biomechanical issues.

""I have observed that many of the younger patients in my practice with retronychia seem to have atypical foot anatomy"" said Stern who was contacted by Medscape Medical News to explain this area of research. ""I am collecting cases and hoping to explore this issue in more depth.""

She said that foot anatomy in relationship to retronychia has not been adequately evaluated.

""In my review of the literature I could not find a single study that showed imagery of the feet"" she said. She is considering a collaboration with others including Rich to explore this as a factor in retronychia.

Asked about risk of misdiagnosis Stern reiterated some of the points made by Rich. In particular she agreed that discolored nails alone should not be a reason to initiate antimycotic therapy without considering the possibility of retronychia.

""So many providers are not familiar with the diagnosis and only 50% of yellow thickened nails are in fact onychomycosis"" she said. ""We end up seeing a plethora of patients [with retronychia] who are unfortunately misdiagnosed for years.""

Rich has reported financial relationships with AbbVie Boehringer Ingelheim Bristol-Myers Squibb Cassiopea SpA Dermavant Sciences Eli Lilly and Company Galderma Laboratories Janssen-Ortho Kadmon Corporation LEO Laboratories Moberg Derma Novartis Pharmaceuticals Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and UCB. Stern has reported a financial relationship with Rare Beauty Brands. Both Rich and Stern said they have no disclosures related to this topic.

The discovery of JAK inhibitors (JAKi) has been pivotal in the treatment of symptomatic MF by reducing spleen size and alleviating cytokine-related symptom burden [1]. Despite this up to 50% of MF patients discontinue JAKi by 2–3 years and only one quarter of patients remain on treatment at 5 years [2 3].

Prospective trials of JAKi therapy provide little information after patients discontinue therapy and safety specific follow up is completed. Although survival following ruxolitinib cessation is poor in the range 13–16 months the clinical course and reasons for JAKi failure in MF patients are not well characterized [4567]. Criteria for JAKi failure are variably defined in retrospective studies and second-line JAKi therapy trials [8910]. JAKi therapy may fail for a variety of reasons including sub-optimal/loss of spleen response severe cytopenias progression to an accelerated or blast phase (AP/BP) of disease secondary malignancies other than AML recurrent severe infections or other non-hematological toxicities. Recognition of patterns of failure is important to accurately characterize and plan treatment strategies in these patients.

We conducted a retrospective study analyzing a molecularly annotated mature dataset of MF patients treated with JAKi followed in a prospective MPN registry (NCT02760238) at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. We evaluated the impact of baseline clinical and molecular factors on clinical outcomes and therapy failure. We characterized different patterns of JAKi failure according to consensus criteria of the Canadian MPN Group (Supp. Table S1) [11] and its impact on survival. In a sub-set of patients with paired samples we evaluated the impact of clonal evolution on outcomes following JAKi failure. Cohort selection study definitions molecular and statistical analysis are summarized in Appendix.

After search of our MPN database and exclusion of ineligible patients (Supp. Fig. S1) 113 patients with a diagnosis of MF in chronic phase treated with JAKi along with a sample for mutation analysis were included. The baseline patient disease and treatment related characteristics of the study population are summarized in Supp. Table S2.

During the course of the study period 85 (75%) patients died with median follow-up in survivors of 74 (range: 21–120) months. A total of 107 (95%) patients experienced JAKi failure; and cumulative incidence of JAKi failure at 1 3 and 5 years was 34% 71% 87% respectively (Supp. Fig. S2). Multivariable analysis is summarized in Supp. Table S3 for both cumulative JAKi failure and OS from JAKi initiation. ECOG performance status and CBL mutation demonstrated significant predicative value for both JAKi failure and OS from JAKi initiation; while the number of mutations predicted OS but had no significant effect on probability of JAKi failure. Platelet count did not predict either JAKi failure or OS while transfusion requiring anemia (RBC Tx) was predictive for OS in model 1 and JAKi failure in both models.

The clinical features at time of JAKi failure are summarized in Supp. Table S4. In MVA (Supp. Table S5) failure from AP/BP disease high DIPSS and ECOG ≥ 2 were significantly associated with inferior survival following JAKi failure (Fig. 1a–c).

The patterns of JAKi failure were as follows: sub-optimal (n = 8 7%) or loss (n = 35 33%) of spleen response (n = 43 total 40%); cytopenias (n = 24 22% total; thrombocytopenia = 14 13%; transfusion dependence = 10 9%); AP/BP transformation (n = 15 14%); non-hematological toxicity (n = 21 20%) and second malignancy (n = 4 4%). For all patients (n = 107) median [95%CI] OS following JAKi failure was 13.6 [9.0–19.6] months. Median survival by pattern of failure was: 4.1 [1.0–5.3] months for AP/BP; 17.5 [6.5–27.0] months for cytopenias; 21.8 [11.7–44.5] months for loss of/suboptimal spleen response; 0.3 [0.3- not reached] months for second malignancy and 13.6 [0.2–24.6] months for non-hematological toxicity (p < 0.001). There was no association between baseline mutations number of mutations or number of HMR mutations and pattern of JAKi failure (Fig. 2a).

Emergent mutations were more frequently observed in patients with JAKi failure due to AP/BP (n = 7/10) than failure due to cytopenia (n = 1/10 P = 0.006). Full size image

Analyis of paired sequencing was performed on 55 patients (Fig. 2b) who had a later molecular sample available either at the time of JAKi failure (n = 49) or after at least 3-years sustained clinical response to JAKi therapy (n = 6). Of the six patients with ongoing benefit from therapy: three patients had the same variants detected two patients had dropout of mutations and one patient had two emergent mutations (NRAS BCORL1) and dropout of JAK2.

At time of JAKi failure 24 (49%) patients had no change in observed variants. Dropout of 18 previously identified variants in 12 (24%) patients was observed; with dropout of JAK2 (n = 4) and TET2 (n = 4) the most commonly observed. A total of 29 emergent mutations were observed in 19 (39%) patients. The most common emergent mutations were in KRAS (n = 4) and ASXL1 (n = 4); with RAS pathway genes (KRAS NRAS CBL and PTPN11) and HMR the most common class of emergent mutations occurring in 9 (47%) patients each. Emergent mutations were more frequently observed in patients with JAKi failure due to AP/BP (n = 7/10 70%) than failure due to cytopenia (n = 1/10 10% P = 0.006); while there was no significant difference when compared to patients with failure due to loss or lack of spleen response (n = 8/23 35%) non-hematological toxicity (n = 3/4 75%) or secondary malignancy (n = 0/2 0%). The median overall survival following JAKi failure was significantly shorter in those with emergent mutations compared to those without (p = 0.02 Fig. 1d).

This study provides further understanding of the clinical and molecular outcomes following JAKi failure. Our analysis differs from previous studies looking at outcomes after JAKi discontinuation as we used standardized JAKi failure definitions as opposed to relying on drug discontinuation as the sole indicator of failure. Despite this key difference the overall survival following JAKi failure is poor and similar to previous reports [4567]. In MVA clinical variables including ECOG performance status RBC Tx and molecular factors including CBL and total number of mutations predict OS independent of MIPSS risk category. A shorter time to JAKi failure was predicted by ECOG RBX Tx and CBL mutation; though not by MIPSS or total number of mutations. These results add further evidence and validation for the consideration of CBL mutations in future revision of the definition of high-risk MF [12].

Our study has expanded on previous research by describing and analyzing clinical features correlates and outcomes according to the pattern of JAKi failure. Patients who develop AP/BP or non-hematological malignancy on JAKi have a dismal prognosis; while outcomes following spleen progression or cytopenias have comparable outcomes. It is also important to note that in clinical practice these failure reasons do not occur in isolation. For example a patient may develop cytopenias requiring a dose reduction in JAKi and as a result the patient then loses their spleen and/or symptom response. Adherence to standardized criteria of JAKi failure will help in early recognition of the pattern of failure facilitate clinical trial enrollment and understanding of comparative effectiveness of novel agents.

The emergence of mutations in our cohort was common occurring in 37% of patients. This contrasts with previous reports from Lundberg et al. which detected only two new mutations in chronic MPN patients during 133 patient-years follow-up [13]. The difference in observed mutation rate may be in part due to patient population as that study had <20% of the cohort comprised of MF patients. The population of MF patients requiring JAKi therapy may have more advanced disease and molecular complexity compared to those not requiring pharmacologic intervention.

The clinical significance of clonal evolution as evidenced by the emergence of new mutations on paired analysis is an area of ongoing research. Consistent with previous reports our data demonstrate that variant emergence is associated with inferior survival following JAKi failure [5 14]. Baseline mutation profile did not predict the pattern of JAKi failure; though emergent mutations were noted to be more common amongst patients with AP/BP. Our study had frequent emergent ASXL1 mutations (21% of patients with emergent mutations) similar to a study from MD Anderson [5] but there were also frequent emergent mutations in the RAS pathway (47% of patients with emergent mutations overall; 21% KRAS). Differences between these cohort studies may be due to use of JAKi failure rather than drug discontinuation as our endpoint; or the larger panel of genes evaluated by NGS used in our study in particular with the inclusion of CBL [5 15]. Our data suggest that detection of newly emergent mutations at the time of JAKi failure may further inform poor prognosis with mutations in RAS pathway and HMR genes frequently observed at time of failure. How activating mutations in alternative growth signaling pathways such as RAS may influence resistance to JAKi and subsequent outcomes with second-line therapies warrants further investigation.

In conclusion we demonstrate that outcomes following JAKi failure are significantly correlated with the pattern of failure. Patients who transform to AP/BP have dismal outcomes where as those with sub-optimal or loss of response or significant cytopenias have similar outcomes. Baseline molecular signatures did not predict the pattern of JAKi failure; however development of emergent mutation at time of JAKi failure is observed more frequently with AP/BP disease.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9uY2xpdmUuY29tL3ZpZXcvZHItd2Vrc2xlci1vbi1hZGRyZXNzaW5nLWRpc3Bhcml0aWVzLWluLWx1bmctY2FuY2VyLWNhcmUtZGVsaXZlcnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dr. Weksler on Addressing Disparities in Lung Cancer Care Delivery,"Benny Weksler MD MBA FACS FACCP system chief Thoracic Surgery Division of Thoracic & Esophageal Surgery Allegheny Health Network (AHN) Cancer Institute discusses efforts being made at his institution to address disparities in the delivery of care and its impact on the screening and treatment of lung cancer.

SUBSCRIBE The Neanderthal in Us Anne-Françoise Pelé When our ancestors Homo sapiens reached Europe between 56800 and 51700 years ago the continent was populated by Neanderthals. After thriving in Eurasia for over 300000 years Neanderthals vanished from the Earth about 40000 years ago. Why did they become extinct? What did humans inherit from Neanderthals? Could archaic genes help us fight diseases? Paleogeneticists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Germany are on a mission to elucidate this prehistoric “cold case.” Image: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural HistoryJohn Gurche/Chip Clark The name Homo neanderthalensis was coined by geologist William King in 1864 after the first specimen of an early human fossil was discovered in the Feldhofer Cave of the Neander Valley in Germany (tal — a modern form of thal — means “valley” in German). Neanderthals are ancient relatives on the hominid family tree. According to Max Planck Institute geneticists modern humans and Neanderthals coexisted in western Europe for up to 5000 years and degrees of genetic traces from such encounters can still be found in the genome of people outside Africa. On average people living today carry between 1% and 2% Neanderthal DNA. Recent research led by Janet Kelso a computational biologist at the Max Planck Institute has shown that Neanderthal DNA influences variation in skin tone hair color sleep patterns (night cavers and bonfire partygoers you are covered!) and smoking behaviors (smokers blame your Ice Age ancestors!). Similarly segments of Neanderthal DNA found in modern humans would be responsible for the degradation of fats. By bringing together fossil skull data brain imaging and genomics an interdisciplinary research team led by the Max Planck Institute found that Neanderthal genes influence the brain development of modern humans. They affect the shape of the skull and the areas of the brain responsible for planning and coordinating movements. Researchers demonstrated the effects of this Neanderthal DNA on gene activity in the putamen a basal ganglion and in the cerebellum. Several genes that humans received from Neanderthals also play an important role in shaping our immune system. In 2020 researchers at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the Max Planck Institute demonstrated that a segment of DNA that causes their carriers to have an up to 3× higher risk of developing severe Covid-19 is inherited from Neanderthals. Six months later the same team showed that Neanderthals also contributed a protective variant and half of all people outside Africa carry a Neanderthal gene variant that reduces the risk of needing intensive care for Covid-19 by 20%. During their research they also found that the same gene variant that increases the risk of falling seriously ill with Covid-19 reduces a person’s risk of contracting HIV by 27%. Whether it is genesis or genetics that underlies our thinking prehistoric legacy is invoked to draw lessons about who we essentially are. Analog Devices × EE Times RF Signal Chain Discourse: Properties and Performance Metrics Substantial understanding of fundamental characteristics for RF technologies that underpin any RF signal chain allows RF engineers to easily translate them into key requirements and specifications of the target application. In this paper we provide guidance on the main properties and metrics used to characterize RF devices and quantify the performance metrics associated with RF systems. READ NOW Let the Memory Live Again Brian Santo At a point in the future that might be nearer than many expect the industry is going to need an entirely new data storage medium to store hundreds of terabytes probably petabytes and maybe even exabytes. At the moment each of the three likeliest possibilities is more exotic than the next. They’re holograms 5D quartz and DNA. The relentlessly growing surge of data that must be transmitted processed and stored is a constant challenge. The industry anticipates that moving from electronics to photonics will be the path to growth in transmission throughputs and processing speeds but storing photons is not an option. So how to move beyond semiconductor memory? Holograms have been around for decades but holographic memory still needs quite a bit more R&D work. The basic concept is to store images in crystals. To read a beam is trained on the crystal and a high-res camera captures the image; the image data gets translated back into digital data. Multiple images can be stored in the same volume; change the angle of the beam to read different images. Lithium niobate crystals are rewriteable. The fundamental concept of 5D storage harks back to compact disks and DVDs. Recording CDs requires making physical pits on a flat medium. To read illuminate the surface with a laser. Is there a pit? Yes-or-no is one-or-zero. That’s 2D. DVDs work the same way but they have multiple layers. That’s 3D. The medium for 5D is a specialty quartz. A laser reader notes not just whether or not there’s a pit but also the optical property of birefringence. As the name suggests birefringence has two states. Now we’re at 5D. Developers say it’s possible to store eight bits in a single pit. If the technology can be perfected a 12-inch crystal platter could hold hundreds of terabytes and the medium would be stable for a thousand years. DNA storage leaves traditional electromechanics behind. DNA consists of strands of the amino acids adenine guanine cytosine and thymine (AGCT) which can be combined in endlessly variable order and can be correlated to binary digits (bits). Strands of AGCT can be assembled stored in liquid and read out. While 5D quartz can be expected to last a thousand years there’s an example of DNA being sequenced from the tooth of a mammoth that died a million years ago. By one estimate 4 grams of DNA could hold all the data the entire world could generate in one year. At the moment DNA storage is a lab curiosity exorbitantly expensive slow

and subject to errors from mutation – a novel consideration in electronics. That said the promise of unlimited storage volume and astonishing longevity of DNA has all of the biggest data center operators monitoring the technology. There are at least 20 organizations who say they can perform DNA storage. DNA storage companies have attracted over $1 billion in funding since 2020. Gene Therapy Isn’t Science Fiction Barbara Jorgensen If you know nothing else about genes you know that they are microscopic and complex and differentiate humans from amoebae. In addition to determining features such as hair and eye color in humans genes can also cause disease. Gene therapy seeks to correct defective genes to manage a variety of health conditions. Science fiction has had a field day with genetic manipulation — think “Jurassic Park” — but adding inhibiting editing or replacing genes are bona-fide medical treatments. Within a gene DNA can be modified to manage blood disorders vision loss cancer heart disease diabetes and cystic fibrosis. CRISPR is perhaps the best-known technology in the field: It’s a tool for editing genomes allowing researchers to easily alter DNA sequences and modify gene function. But in laboratories electronic equipment does a lot of the heavy lifting. Centrifuges incubators and freezers are typical lab instruments. Then there’s process automation which can increase sterility levels in fluid transfer and eliminate manual handling. A sample taken from a patient for example may be returned to that patient after it’s been processed. Sensor technology and analytics increase the scalability of equipment and therapies and reduce time and headcount. The first successful nuclear gene transfer in humans (approved by the National Institutes for Health) was performed in 1980. To date more than 2600 clinical trials in gene therapy have been conducted. China has become the dominant location for gene therapy trials due to the nation’s expanding research ecosystem and significant governmental support for emerging technologies. China is the only country in the top five — U.S. China U.K. Germany France — where non-industry sponsored trials outnumber industry-sponsored trials (73% versus 27%). One therapeutic success story centers around vision loss. Researchers identified a gene — RPE65 — associated with blindness and used a harmless virus to insert a healthy gene underneath a patient’s retina. In 2017 the U.S. FDA approved voretigene neparvovecrzyl (marketed as Luxturna) for the treatment of any heritable retinal dystrophy caused by the mutated RPE65 gene. The cell and gene therapy market was valued at $4.99 billion in 2021 according to research firm Arziton; the segment is forecast to reach $36.92 billion by 2027 with a CAGR of 39.6%. Key players are Gilead Sciences Novartis Smith Nephew Amgen Organogenesis Roche (Spark Therapeutics) Dendreon Vericel and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Why So Blue? Stefani Muñoz When I first adopted my puppy back in 2021 many of those around me inquired whether she was part chow. When I asked why they thought so they would say it was because part of her tongue was blue which is characteristic of the chow chow breed. One Embark DNA test later and lo and behold — my puppy was indeed part Chow. I then began to wonder why exactly chows have blue tongues while many other canine breeds don’t. It’s said that chows originated in China about 2000 years ago first appearing in Chinese artifacts dating as far back as 206 B.C. Many historians believe that chow chows were the inspiration behind the design of the stone lion statues that commonly guarded Buddhist temples and it’s said they were considered “war dogs” often named “man kou” meaning “dog of the Barbarians.” According to Chinese legend when Earth was created and the first stars were placed into the heavens parts of the sky fell to the earth. Chows deemed ever-curious creatures licked the blue pieces of sky from the ground staining their tongues deep blue. Other sources claim the breed’s blue-tinged tongues were inherited from bears. Turns out it comes down to their genetics — more specifically their pigment cells. Similar to humans a canine’s genetic code determines both the type and amount of pigment cells present depending on the genetic makeup of their parents. There are two primary pigments found within canines that determine not only the color of a dog’s tongue but also their eyes nose and so on: eumelanin and phaeomelanin. Eumelanin produces a black color while phaeomelanin produces a red color. It’s important to note however eumelanin determines the color of a canine’s nose tongue lips and eyes whereas phaeomelanin determines the color of fur. The reason behind chow’s blue tongues is the presence of excess eumelanin within the mucous membranes of their tongues. A deeply blue tongue is an indicator that a chow is purebred while only a partially blue tongue could indicate that the chow contains some other time of canine DNA. Chows aren’t the only dog to exhibit blue tongues nor the only mammal: Blue tongues are common in the Chinese Shar Pei Eurasier and Thai Ridgeback as well as polar bears giraffes and blue-tongued lizards.

By means of electronic kits for kids I also show them how electronics works. It’s great fun and educational too. Who was (or is) your mentor? I had several leaders and mentors in my career. I was taught how to be an inspirational leader and I was taught the importance of building up true relationships that go beyond business. This mentor taught me not to accept any easy explanation and more importantly to always question results. Who is your favorite musician writer or artist? I like all types of music with a strong preference towards (hard) rock music and particularly [Italian rockstar] Vasco Rossi Queen Iron Maiden Metallica… you could say I like energetic music. What is the biggest threat to society posed by technology today? I think the biggest threat posed by technology today is to lose the human contact and interaction which is increasingly being substituted by virtual interactions. It is something we need to be mindful of. What advice would you give to early-career engineers? Firstly I’d say they need to be curious and passionate about their work… or to ensure they only work on what they are curious and passionate about. It might sound like a cliché yet that is what moves me and that is what makes me go the extra mile… without feeling as though it was a chore. I am fascinated passionate and almost in love with GaN semiconductor technology – and what you can make with it. A second piece of advice is to listen: listen to the market listen to your customers listen to your fellows etc… and adapt accordingly. My third piece of advice would be to make plans of what you want to do and achieve (both at a high level and a low level) get to work and get things done.

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why do brown eggs cost more than white eggs? Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vc3BvcnQvYXJ0aWNsZXMvYzZweWtwcDFwMmpv0gEzaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9hcnRpY2xlcy9jNnB5a3BwMXAyam8uYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Land Norris: McLaren driver is 'everyone's favourite' says team chief Zak Brown.,"McLaren boss Zak Brown called Lando Norris “everyone’s favourite driver” after the Briton won his first grand prix in Miami on Sunday.

It took six seasons and a 110 starts before Norris 24 finally topped the podium at a grand prix with second his previous best finish.

""I think that was a massive win for Lando and a lot of support behind it chief executive director Brown told BBC 5 Live.

""I never met anyone who doesn't like Lando.""

The turning point in Sunday's grand prix came when Norris took advantage of the race restarting with 27 laps to go beating Red Bull’s world champion Max Verstappen into second.

Brown said that Norris is ""everyone's favourite driver or number two or number three but I've never heard even number four and I've certainly never heard anyone not like [him]”.

Norris' win could signal the beginning of an end to Red Bull's dominance with chief technical officer Adrian Newey leaving the team and some uncertainty around Verstappen's future.

Brown disagrees however: “No I think that would be a bit premature thinking their time has gone but clearly with everything that has been going on this year and now Adrian Newey leaving it’s clear that team has some issues beyond the race car"" he said.

Brown did not rule out McLaren making a move for Newey when asked about the matter before the grand prix.

""They will miss Adrian Newey and I believe there is some truth to the Max Verstappen rumours so stay on top of your game or you can quickly slide back"" he added.

The next race in the F1 calendar is in Imola Italy and will take place from 17-19 May.

So says Chef Lauren Hotetz whose lucky detour has now resulted in a new catering meal prep and private in-home dining business – Up High ‘N Hungry.

For Chef Lauren the journey to Salida began as a child playing as a “McDonald’s cook” in her grandmother’s basement in Louisville KY. At age 15 she walked into a TGI Friday’s restaurant kitchen in Louisville and talked her way into her first foodservice job. Riding the “rush” of a slammed kitchen she got hooked and hasn’t looked back.

Later Hotetz worked for major spirits distiller Brown-Forman in Louisville doing high-end Kentucky Derby parties as well as catering sports events for two local universities. Drawn to Colorado in 2016 Chef Lauren connected with a number of the top chefs in Denver including well-known favorite Troy Guard of TAG Restaurant Group at Los Chingones and also # Hash TAG a breakfast hotspot.

Chef Lauren also worked with Lon Symensma (ChoLon Asian and Leroux European Bistro). Here Hotetz ascended from line cook to becoming “Chef Lauren” honing her cooking skills on a wide variety of cuisines while drawing on the business and operations skills from her earlier work.

An avid outdoors enthusiast Chef Lauren was doing a thru-hike of the Colorado Trail when she ambled off to Salida in search of high-quality (ideally hot cooked from scratch) calories need to refuel. With convenience taking precedence and being on foot she soon was back on the trail again when inspiration struck. What about a food truck serving high quality nourishing meals? Stopping at trailheads and other places where hungry hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts emerged like bears from their dens in springtime? And what better name for the new venture than ‘Up High ‘N Hungry’?

With the idea in mind Hotetz decided to stake out Salida as her basecamp making a bold move from a restaurant paycheck to striking out on her own. Getting to know people downtown and in the neighborhoods confirmed that Chef Lauren had made a good choice. “It was the midst of the pandemic yet unlike in the city people were totally about helping each other. Free food pantries people helping strangers it was heartwarming to see how the community handled it- I couldn’t shake it” she recalled.

And while she’s pivoting her dream to meet emergent needs who knows? The food truck concept may yet surface sometime down the road as operations mature she says.

Fast forward five months and Chef Lauren’s vision refocused after locals learned “You’re a chef? – we need you here in town”. And with that Salida is now fortunate to have a multifaceted new food concept. Building on relationships with two local commercial eateries (The Little Red Hen and Robin’s) Chef Lauren has a variety of space and equipment serving as her prep commissaries. Up High ‘N Hungry is focused on three areas: small event catering private chef meal preparation and in-home-dining.

Having had a great experience with private chef service in Denver some years ago this reporter was keen on having the concept come to Chaffee County. Flexible plans using locally-sourced ingredients for three or more meals a week are tailored to diner’s preferences and available for pickup or delivery.

“Community-driven” menus come after a consultation with each client and the back and forth that sparks creativity. It’s a great way to add variety and relieve people from most menu planning shopping and preparation when they’d rather be doing other things. In honor of her grandmother’s inspiration for the kitchen seniors receive a discount on recurring meal packages.

Private in-home catering provides meals for “Date Nights” special occasions and theme dinners prepared and served by Chef Lauren. “It’s more than just the food; it’s about connecting with my clients listening to what they want and then making it all happen” she said. “It doesn’t have to be fancy to taste good. I am a firm believer that as long you put your heart and soul into it…you can taste the love inside. It’s a real thing” she continued.

While Chef Lauren has current personal-favorite flavor profiles and cuisines she did grow up after all on Southern food hospitality and “foods that make you feel really good”. She’s grown into Asian cuisine and enjoys its creativity and beautiful presentations. “I could eat Mexican food all day every day…and because I like to eat it I enjoy cooking it too. I gained a good knowledge of these flavor profiles from the team at Los Chingones. Tacos – I’m down with that” she said warming up to the topic.

“Meat (cooked rare) potatoes and fish too. I was actually a fish cutter at Mitchell’s Fish Market in Louisville so I learned a lot about their flavor profiles and how to work with them” she continued. Noting a lack of fresh fish in local markets and limited choices elsewhere Chef Lauren hopes to be able to source fish for those who miss that recognizing the challenges of getting high quality seafood many miles from the nearest coast.

Given her wide tastes in food and all that she’s learned from her mentors with all of her service offerings Chef Lauren doesn’t want to be labeled or boxed in. She feels there is so much more that Salida dining can be known for. It needs to cater to locals for sure but also expand everyone’s taste buds – that’s what keeps diners coming back for more and restaurant people challenged and creative.

And with Salida being “discovered” people from all over the country expect both new and familiar experiences each time they return. With all this in mind Chef Lauren prefers to be known as the caterer who goes out of her way to source locally give back to the community create and cultivate relationships with her clients.

Salida has an extended supply chain today but historically was known for livestock and agriculture a trend that is starting to come back. “Farmers and ranchers are putting heart and soul here and they don’t get enough credit” Hotetz says. “I want to help and grow relationships with Badger Creek Poncha Creek Gardens Rocky Mountain Garlic and others. This helps generate revenue that stays in the community rather than going to the big purveyors in the city.

I’m so looking forward to summer farmers markets and doing more locally-based menus” she said.

Already off to a great start Chef Lauren held a grand opening launch party at Vino Salida on March 13. Coming up Chef Lauren will be giving back to the community. She’s signed up for The Alliance’s Annual Chocolate Lovers Fantasy to be held from 5:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. April 14 at Mt. Princeton.

Looking further ahead to September 1 she is teaming up with local food producers and other farmers and members catering the SOIL Sangre de Cristo annual celebration at Everett Ranch in Salida. A busy season lies in between.

“With over 20 years in the business I can’t see myself being happy doing anything else. Yes I’m a perfectionist but mostly I cook with love and passion” Hotetz says. “I feel like I belong here in Salida; all this materialized for a reason. I am gung-ho and intent on leaving a stamp here – my own stamp” Chef Lauren said in closing.

""I wish you all could see the smile on my face"" Jones wearing a mask to prevent the spread of coronavirus told a crowd gathered at the site of the former Dan River Inc. finishing building in Schoolfield.

For Danville a Caesars Virginia casino has been a long time coming. Now the city — with roots weaved through textile manufacturing — is on the verge of a transformation into a tourism destination.

How we got here

It was in December 2018 when state Del. Danny Marshall R-Danville approached city officials about the possibility of the Virginia General Assembly considering whether to allow certain cities to have a referendum on casinos.

In January 2019 legislation to allow casino gambling in Virginia was introduced in the General Assembly. But that was on the condition that the idea would be approved by voters in a local referendum.

In March 2020 the Virginia House and Senate approved legislation to allow five cities in Virginia — Danville Bristol Norfolk Portsmouth and Richmond — to hold local referendums on whether to allow a casino to operate in those cities.

In the first week of March 2020 before the coronavirus pandemic triggered a chain of stay-at-home orders and shuttered businesses across the nation Danville officials heard closed-door presentations from four casino companies the finalists that responded to a December 2019 request for proposals to bring a gambling facility here.

Under the conditions of that request for proposals potential operators had to choose a possible casino location for either the White Mill property or in Schoolfield both iconic former Dan River Inc. textile sites. Each candidate could also pick one other site in the city.

Caesars was the lead contender from among four finalists — seven had initially responded to the city's request for proposals issued in December 2019 — hoping to bring a casino resort to Danville. City officials and a representative from the company announced during that event at the Schoolfield site May 18 2020 that Danville leaders were in negotiations with Caesars Entertainment for a possible project there.

Officials banking on expected voter approval believed that a casino development at Schoolfield — the property that included the former Dan River Inc. finishing building — would bring more traffic to that part of the city and attract additional businesses.

Jacqueline Grace vice president and assistant general manager at the Horseshoe Baltimore resort in Maryland which is part of Caesars Entertainment spoke at the May 2020 announcement.

""We are going to build an amazing project"" she told the crowd.

Caesars Entertainment’s resorts operate under Caesars Harrah’s and Horseshoe brand names.

Danville City Manager Ken Larking told the crowd the project would bring in $34 million in annual revenue for Danville. Of that more than $30 million would come from gaming taxes and supplemental payments to the city and $4 million would be generated from real estate meals sales and lodging taxes.

In addition Caesars' proposal included at least $20 million in upfront payments to the city to cover land acquisition and other public investments.

The Danville City Council officially selected Caesars Entertainment as the city's casino provider in June 2020.

Schoolfield is significant as one of the largest textile mill villages in Virginia and the South. The village was founded as an independent company town in 1903 by Dan River Inc. which owned all the houses and other buildings in the town. The city of Danville annexed Schoolfield in 1951.

The industrial site in Schoolfield covers about 85 acres and roughly 700000 square feet of structures including the 617000-square-foot former finishing plant which can be seen from West Main Street in Schoolfield.

Voters say yes

On Nov. 3 2020 city voters decided to roll the dice and approve a casino in Danville.

Caesars which has purchased the Dan River Inc. property in Schoolfield where it plans to open in 2023 originally expected to create 1300 jobs and invest $400 million in the project.

The casino resort would include multiple restaurants and bars a hotel with 300 four-star guest rooms a 35000-square-foot conference center a 2500-seat live-entertainment venue a pool and a spa. It would also have 2000 slot machines 75 table games 16 poker tables and a sportsbook to wager on various sports competitions.

In August casino representatives announced the scope of the project would expand.

The price tag for the initial $400 million project would be more than $100 million higher said a senior vice president with Caesars Entertainment.

“We’re going to be north of $500 million” Robert Livingston told about 75 members of the community during a public input meeting held Aug. 23 at the former Dan River Inc. Welfare Building on West Main Street.

Also the estimated number of hotel rooms is expected to be 500 instead of 300 he said.

Caesars Virginia senior director of design and construction Mark Schlang told attendees that the prominent three smokestacks at the former Dan River Inc. site in Schoolfield will be made into an iconic part of the project.

The smokestacks — known as the “Three Sisters” — will anchor the entertainment forum at the casino resort he said. Caesars also will add more towers.

Multiple restaurant venues and a brew pub and sports bar will also be part of the resort said Schlang who also mentioned celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsey.

Also “there will also be a Starbucks in there somewhere” he said of the casino project.

There will also be an outdoor pool area and a parking garage with 1200 spaces Schlang added. Other features could include fire pits hot tubs a spa and a VIP area he said.

A common design element will be red brick with tonal colors and lighter elements as well a nod to the textile history.

What's next

The conceptual design for the project is complete with work currently being done on schematic designs that include figuring out where pieces of the project fit together Livingston said.

“The architecture is on track in blending Caesars with the rich history of the community” he said.

Visitors to the casino resort can expect to see a pedestrian entrance and a secondary car entrance from West Main Street Schlang said.

In September architectural renderings of Danville’s future casino resort were revealed at a ceremony at the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research.

“This is a milestone moment” Jones said. “There is great anticipation and excitement here.”

Jones other members of Danville City Council Marshall and other city and educational dignitaries were present as representatives of Caesars Entertainment shared slides overhead of the planned Caesars Virginia.

The architectural firm for Caesars Virginia was Marnell Companies.

Dave Howryla president of architecture with Marnell explained the renderings of the exterior and interior of the resort.

“The Three Sisters [three brick smokestacks] are the best element on the site and everything is based on them. They will be cleaned up and they will be the focal point” he said.

The company obtained original images of the brick mill building and based the design of the casino on those. The 18-story hotel was kept lower than the Three Sisters and a four-story parking garage is nestled into the terrain to look like two stories.

The Caesars-branded hotel rooms are “real modern clean and comfortable” and based on Caesars' color palette.

Demolition began in September to make way for the Caesars Virginia casino with officials expecting the process to take several months to finish.

Work begins

Work began in early January to prepare for the removal of the former Dan River Inc. finishing building to make way for the casino.

Hazardous materials abatement was underway for the building and will continue through early March Livingston told the Danville Register & Bee.

“The structure will then be clear for removal with an estimated timeline into early summer” he said.

Building material deemed appropriate will be crushed and reused on site where possible with some brick targeted to be recycled and used in landscape areas he said.

Caesars Virginia issued a request for proposals for construction of its upcoming casino and hotel resort in December. The goal is to mobilize the contractor on site in the spring with construction on the new buildings — including the hotel towers — to start soon thereafter.

The date for the groundbreaking which still hadn't taken place as of mid-March for the casino’s construction will depend on the general contractor and the weather.

Demolition of the finishing building will not slow down the project.

“Construction will begin in other areas of the site so debris removal and crushing will take place simultaneously with the new construction” Livingston said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL2Jsb2cuYWRhZnJ1aXQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvY2Flc2Fycy1vdGhlci1sYXMtdmVnYXMtcHJvcGVydGllcy10dXJuaW5nLWxpZ2h0cy1vZmYtZm9yLWVhcnRoLWhvdXItZWFydGhob3VyLWNvbm5lY3QyZWFydGgtZWFydGhob3VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caesars other Las Vegas Properties Turning Lights Off for Earth Hour @earthhour #Connect2Earth #EarthHour,"Earth hour takes place from 8:30 to 9:30 tonight and the Las Vegas strip will look a little different as some venues go dark during this time via Casino.org

“Las Vegas is a city that offers the maximum amount of entertainment"" Enrico Bertaggia said.

Bertaggia has run Dream Racing at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway for about a decade. He knows a thing or two about racing cars winning the Italian Formula Three championship in 1987 and had 8 entries in the Formula One championship. He believes Las Vegas will host an F1 race in the near future.

“Fans love Las Vegas"" Bertaggia said. ""People love Las Vegas. They know Las Vegas as one of the cities that is known from all over the world.""

Nevada officials have already been buzzing about a race. Governor Steve Sisolak tweeted back in October that he met with F1 officials to talk about bringing a race to the valley. Bertaggia says it will draw an international crowd.

I’ve had the opportunity to meet recently with @F1 leaders and I’ve appreciated their time on this topic.



I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again - the Silver State is quickly becoming the entertainment AND sports capital! https://t.co/O2ipBeUE2M — Governor Sisolak (@GovSisolak) October 19 2021

“For sure a lot of Europeans because Europeans love Las Vegas and I think it will be a very successful event” he said.

It wouldn’t be the first time Las Vegas had an F1 race as the valley hosted the Caesars Grand Prix in 1981 and 1982.

“It reminded me when I was a kid and I imagined what was Las Vegas” Bertaggia said.

Bertaggia says F1 won’t be competing against other circuits like NASCAR in the area and says having another major car race is a win for Las Vegas motorsports in general.

“It will not change"" he said. ""In my opinion the attention on NASCAR or the local championship IndyCar that they race in America. I think it’s going to maintain and increase the number of spectators that are probably going to see both.""

Morgan Partner to Invest in Diverse Entrepreneurs,"An $80 million investment powered by J.P. Morgan will support more than 400 companies through 37+ programs in 9 cities to create opportunities for wealth creation often constrained by institutional structural and systemic barriers

Open to founders of all backgrounds this program has been designed to provide equitable access to funding and support for entrepreneurs who are Black Hispanic and Latino Indigenous American and Pacific Islander

Techstars today announced a new accelerator program powered by J.P. Morgan that will invest more than $80 million in diverse entrepreneurs and founders across the country. Techstars and J.P. Morgan began partnering in 2021 to develop this program focused on advancing equitable access to funding in major economic centers.

In the first half of 2021 Black entrepreneurs received just 1.2 percent of U.S. venture capital funding. Additional data show that Latino founders raised only 2 percent of U.S. venture capital investments in 2021. This partnership seeks to help bridge the racial and ethnic wealth divide through Techstars’ unique startup accelerators that provide access to capital one-on-one mentorship and customized programming for early-stage entrepreneurs.

“The data and experience show founders from diverse communities and backgrounds represent an untapped market with tremendous financial upside for investors the entrepreneurs and the communities they operate in. With J.P. Morgan our goal is to be more intentional in the way our programs attract support and invest in Black Latino and other underrepresented founders” says Mäelle Gavet CEO of Techstars.

“Together with Techstars our goal is to improve access to the capital and other resources needed by underrepresented entrepreneurs to start fund and then scale their businesses” said Kristin Kallergis Rowland global head of alternative investments at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.

With 27% of Techstars’ existing portfolio company CEOs identifying as Black Hispanic and Latino Indigenous American American Indian or Alaska Native Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Middle East/North African this partnership is designed to create further support for diverse founders of high-growth early-stage startups to generate greater income stronger influence and wealth creation.

“The multi-year program will focus on entrepreneurs and founders that have been overlooked by traditional venture capital sources” said Tiffany Lewis head of diverse manager strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “This new commitment will advance the shift toward more equitable economic opportunities through access to financial services mentorship quality education and training and promoting inclusive business practices.”

Over the next three years the investment will be distributed to more than 400 companies through 37 Techstars programs in 9 U.S. cities. The first five cities Atlanta Chicago Detroit Miami and Washington D.C. launch today with a call for applications from entrepreneurs of all backgrounds. The Los Angeles New Orleans New York and Oakland programs will launch in 2023. All nine of these high-growth technology ecosystems were selected for several strategic reasons including the prominence of the diverse make-up of their populations which each program seeks to reflect.

Each of the three-month programs will support founders like Jasmine Jones who went through Techstars’ Kansas City Accelerator in 2020.

Co-founder of Techstars portfolio company Cherry Blossom Intimates  Jasmine describes her Techstars experience as opening doors of possibilities with no limit to success. “I met more than 90 mentors who helped me to refine my business model build my cap table and raise $1.25 million in 30 days.”

“What made me excited to be a part of the Techstars program is that it opens doors to new possibilities and business potential” Jones said. “The network is invaluable.”

Cherry Blossom Intimates is an online accredited medical facility and brick and mortar boutique. During Techstars Jasmine also launched Myya the first direct to consumer post-mastectomy brand that also accepts insurance and connects patients to certified fitters for post-mastectomy bra and prosthesis fittings from home.

Measuring impact and ensuring accountability within this multi-city U.S. program is paramount as these small steps forward can help narrow the gap in the racial wealth divide and growing economic inequality. While the programs are open to founders of all backgrounds their recruitment efforts will have a focus on Black Latino and Hispanic entrepreneurs and those who identify with being racially and ethnically diverse. Progress will be tracked regularly and shared with senior leadership across both organizations. These efforts will further allow for maximum program impact and aim to bring an enhanced equity and inclusion lens to the wider investment community.

Pregame notes

In Kristaps We Trust - With Kyle Kuzma on the shelf and Bradley Beal’s last game aeons ago it’s been Kristaps Porzingis showing off some star power for the Wizards. In the last four games with Kuz out Porzingis has averaged 23.8 points per game on 47.8% shooting from the field to go along with 8.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks. KP will surely be the foc

al point early and often one that Golden State’s defense will be zoned in on from the jump.

Missing Stephen Curry - These same two teams faced off just two weeks prior with Stephen Curry torching the Wiz for 47 points and spoiling any attempts at a comeback. The Warriors star unfortunately got injured the very next game against the Boston Celtics. Since then Golden State has gone 1-4 in their last five contests dating back to that same win over Washington. Look for them to try and break out of their Stephen Curry-less slump in D.C.

Dangerous Deni - Ever since a three-game scoreless stretch earlier in the month Deni Avdija has turned it up a notch offensively. The second-year wing has averaged 13.2 points off the Wizards bench in the last seven games dating back to that first Warriors encounter. He’s fresh off a career-high 21 points in their latest win against the Detroit Pistons which encouragingly came via another career-high of 16 field goal attempts. Expect the Israeli to carry over some of that aggressiveness on Sunday.

How? By making their vehicles more expensive in a bid to compensate for the profits lost due to the lack of necessary inventory. Consequently some people couldn’t buy new anymore ultimately deciding to purchase used.

With more demand for second-hand cars those obviously became more expensive as well. The market remains as volatile as it was a few months ago so it’s still a good opportunity to offload a car to make a nice profit. Case in point YouTuber Brennen Taylor figured out he should try and sell his rare BMW M4 CS. He cites rising gas prices as the motivator behind the decision to get rid of the performance coupe.

However with 3.65 million subscribers on YT surely gas money shouldn’t be much of an issue. He’s thinking about getting a Porsche Taycan a car that starts at $82700. Those who can spend that kind of money on a vehicle can certainly afford gas right? If you haven’t heard of Brennen Taylor it’s because he doesn’t have a car channel on YT. Instead he’s a foodie with a BMW M4 CS bought back in 2019.

The M4 CS Was Positioned Between The M4 Competition And M4 GTS

When it was launched in the United States the M4 CS retailed for six figures. Specifically it carried a starting price of $104095 or nearly $30000 more than an M4 Competition. His car was originally ordered in Lime Rock Grey metallic making it rarer than the 1200 units that were sold in the United States. Brennen Taylor’s visit to CarMax ended in disappointment as he was offered only $64000.

A quick search on listings in North America shows CarMax’s appraisal is slightly lower than the average asking price for an M4 CS. Consequently the YouTuber turned down the offer but taking it to another CarMax is an option he’s considering.

The work will be ongoing through the voyage forcing one port of call to be replaced.

Carnival Glory Repairs

The cruise line is planning some repairs to the Carnival Glory on the upcoming voyage that departs New Orleans on Sunday March 27 2022. A letter was sent to guests informing them that repair work would commence on Sunday on the ship’s docking machinery.

Due to work taking place through the cruise the scheduled call to Mahogany Bay Isla Roatan in Honduras on Wednesday March 30 has been canceled. The port will be replaced with Progreso Mexico on March 29.

Carnival Cruise Line said in the letter “When Carnival Glory returns to New Orleans on Sunday our team will be commencing repair work on the ship’s docking machinery. The work will continue during the cruise and as a result it is necessary to replace our call on Mahogany Bay Isla Roatan with a visit to Progreso. Mexico on Tuesday March 29.”

No further details on the repair work were detailed in the letter but Progreso would be the obvious choice for repairs on a Conquest-class vessel. Located in Progreso is a repair facility by Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri the same company which built the Carnival Glory in 2003. The pier in Progreso is also significantly larger than at Mahogany Bay.

There are no other changes to the seven-day western Caribbean itinerary which also includes three sea days along with a scheduled call in Belize on March 31 and then Cozumel Mexico on April 1. Carnival Glory will return to its homeport in New Orleans on April 3.

Carnival Glory is part of the popular Conquest-class and was constructed at the Monfalcone shipyard in Italy. The ship last underwent a dry dock in June 2021 where the new red white and blue livery was added. There was also a wet dock in January 2022 which was for routine hotel maintenance and cosmetic updates.

The ship is 110000 gross tons and has a guest capacity of 2980 at double occupancy and 1150 international crew members.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJlbnNhbGF0aW5hLmNvbS9tdWx0aWV0aG5pYy1jb2xvbWJpYS1zaGluZXMtaW4tYmFycmFucXVpbGxhLWNhcm5pdmFscy1ncmVhdC1wYXJhZGUv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGFwcmVuc2FsYXRpbmEuY29tL211bHRpZXRobmljLWNvbG9tYmlhLXNoaW5lcy1pbi1iYXJyYW5xdWlsbGEtY2Fybml2YWxzLWdyZWF0LXBhcmFkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Multiethnic Colombia shines in Barranquilla Carnival’s Great Parade,"By Hugo Penso Correa

Barranquilla Colombia Mar 27 (EFE).- With a spread of multiethnic folkloric expressions representing multicultural Colombia the Great Parade of Tradition was held Sunday on the second day of the Barranquilla Carnival.

The parade allowed those attending the “Vía 40 Cumbiodromo” to appreciate the dances music rhythms diversity and generational heritage that keep the most important popular festival in Colombia alive dubbed a “Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity” by UNESCO.

Groups danced to the rhythm of cumbia mapale garabato congos farotas and son de negro among many other folkloric expressions that throughout history reached the Barranquilla Carnival in the boats that crossed Colombia’s main Magdalena River.

The Great Parade of Tradition paid tribute this year to the “Harlequin Devils” a dance product of European African and indigenous cultural syncretism in which participants in multicolored dresses act as fire breathers while they dance to delight the public.

This dance whose origin is in the Caribbean region of Colombia when men dressed as demons danced in processions outside the temple with spurs and rattles was accompanied by carnival queen Valeria Charris who wore a fancy traditional dress to honor them.

Like every year cumbia is the most important rhythm in the Barranquilla Carnival parades. This dance of African indigenous and Spanish origin is the result of miscegenation between these cultures during colonial times in northern Colombia.

Also on stage were the mapale an African dance whose name comes from the rapid movements of a fish when it is taken out of the water and the garabato which represents the victory of joy over death.

Similarly the congos which represent a battle for joy and the farotas representation of indigenous revenge against Spanish rapists among others continue to be renewed in the carnival.

They also played son de negro a dance in which dancers wear blackface and make funny faces to represent mockery in the face of life’s adversities in addition to countless costumes with allegorical messages to the fauna and the importance of its preservation.

In addition to the parade through the Cumbiodromo in northern Barranquilla massive carnival celebrations were held in the city such as the Carlos Franco Grand Parade which runs through the southern neighborhoods as well as the Comedy Encounter and the Festival of Litanies where current events are satirized.

The Orchestra Festival was also held Sunday at the Romelio Martínez stadium where groups compete for the Congo de Oro and the Baila la Calle an avenue converted into a large dance floor where thousands of people gather. to enjoy the music of about 20 groups. EFE

Shiozawa is consistently seeking to expand the realm of communication mediated through her work. While projecting her childhood memories and everyday feelings into the two-dimensional works she is also aiming to represent a world that is perceived through means other than sight by cultivating ways of expression using sound light and three-dimensional forms.

The boundless galaxy is the major scene in Shiozawa's works. She uses acrylic oil and alkyd resin on wood board to build up the exceptional appealing layers of light and shadow in the Milky Way. Growing up in the Netherlands her compositions and lines feature European elements such as wooden windmills classical arches and church steeples. To present the visional and realistic scenes Shiozawa scrapes the paint away with different sizes of technical pens. Through her paintings the audiences can glimpse the imaginary connection of their inner consciousness along the breach of the world.

Neither Qantas nor any other airline has ever flown regular service from DFW International Airport to Melbourne the capital of the country’s state of Victoria. Qantas has been flying from DFW to Sydney since 2014 and before that flew to DFW from Brisbane Australia going back to 2011.

Qantas is a part of the Oneworld airline alliance led by American Airlines.

It’s one of several new international routes DFW has welcomed in recent months with a flight between DFW and Helsinki Finland starting Sunday the same day that Air France comes back to the airport after a two-year break during COVID-19.

Turkish Airlines started a DFW-Istanbul flight in September as well. DFW now has service slated for 71 international destinations.

Several countries have announced plans in recent weeks to lower COVID-19 restrictions and U.S. air carriers are calling on the federal government to drop masking and international testing mandates too.

Camaliot is a campaign funded by the European Space Agency and its first project focuses on making smartphone owners around the world part of a project that can help improve weather forecasts by using your phone’s GPS receiver.

The Camaliot app works on devices running Android version 7.0 or later that support satellite navigation. The way satellite navigation works phones or other receivers look for signals from a network of satellites that maintain a fixed orbit. The satellites send messages with the time and their location and once it’s received the phones note how long each message took to arrive then use that data to figure out where on Earth they are.

Android’s support for raw GNSS data recording is key to tracking changes in the ionosphere

Researchers think that they can use satellite signals to get more information about the atmosphere. For example the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can affect how a satellite signal travels through the air to something like a phone.

The app gathers information to track signal strength the distance between the satellite and the phone being used and the satellite’s carrier phase according to Camaliot’s FAQs. With enough data collected from around the world researchers can theoretically combine that with existing weather readings to measure long-term water vapor trends. They hope to use that data to inform weather forecasting models with machine learning. They can also track changes in Earth’s ionosphere — the part of the atmosphere near space. Creating better ionospheric forecasts could be relevant in tracking space weather and could eventually make Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) more accurate by accounting for events like geomagnetic storms.

Camaliot could eventually expand to include more attempts at collecting data on a massive scale using sensors present in “Internet of Things” connected home devices. “We took inspiration from the famous SETI@Home initiative where home laptops help seek out signs of extraterrestrial life.” Vicente Navarro an ESA navigation engineer said in a press release.

App users can compare their measurements to other Android users Image: Camaliot

The project aims to gather information from all over the world — and from several different satellite constellations. There are several different Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) constellations like the US Global Positioning System (GPS) Russia’s GLONASS China’s Beidou or the EU’s Galileo. Japan and India also operate smaller regional constellations. An FCC order in 2018 allowed more devices to use GPS and Galileo signals together for increased location accuracy.

While older Android phones can participate in this project the Camaliot project lists more than 50 newer models with dual-frequency receivers which can simultaneously pull two GNSS signals with different satellite frequencies. Phones confirmed to contain dual-frequency receivers include the Google Pixel 4a Samsung Galaxy S21 the Galaxy S21 Ultra — mostly those with high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 5G chipsets.

Navarro says that “the combination of Galileo dual-band smartphone receivers and Android’s support for raw GNSS data recording” work together to increase the possibility of how much data can be collected solely from people using their smartphones.

Camaliot is available only for Android users Image: Camaliot

How to use Camaliot

Here’s how you can begin using the Camaliot app on your Android phone after downloading it from Google Play:

Select “start logging” and place your phone in an area with a clear sky view to begin logging the data Once you have measured to your liking select “stop logging” Then upload your session to the server and repeat the process over time to collect more data. You can also delete your locally-stored log files at this step.

In addition to being able to view your own measurements against others accumulated over time you can also see a leaderboard showing logging sessions done by other participants. Eventually the information collected for the study will be available in a separate portal.

For registered users their password username email address and number of measurements will be stored in Camaliot’s database but they won’t be used in post-study publications and products according to Camaliot’s privacy policy. Specifically Camaliot says that the need for extensive personal data is for scientific purposes and environmental monitoring and that its need for processing data is “necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest namely for the conduction of this scientific study.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9pbmRpYS1jaXZpbC1hdmlhdGlvbi1taW5pc3Rlci1tb3JlLXdpZGVib2R5LWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India's Civil Aviation Minister Pushes For More Widebody Aircraft: Is It Possible?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9pbmRpYS1jaXZpbC1hdmlhdGlvbi1taW5pc3Rlci1tb3JlLXdpZGVib2R5LWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24vYWlybGluZXMtLy1hdmlhdGlvbi9hZnRlci10d28teWVhcnMtcmVndWxhci1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWZsaWdodHMtdG8tcmVzdW1lLWZyb20tc3VuZGF5L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkwNDYyOTc1LmNtc9IBqAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24vYWlybGluZXMtLy1hdmlhdGlvbi9hZnRlci10d28teWVhcnMtcmVndWxhci1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWZsaWdodHMtdG8tcmVzdW1lLWZyb20tc3VuZGF5L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MDQ2Mjk3NS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After two years regular international flights to resume from today,"You Might Also Like: Delhi airport expects to connect to over 60 global destinations after resumption of overseas flights

After a coronavirus pandemic-induced hiatus of over two years regular international flights are set to resume from Sunday with airports and airlines getting ready for normal overseas operations. Battered by the pandemic the airline industry is slowly coming back to normalcy and the resumption of normal overseas flights is expected to provide a fillip to the sector.The Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in the national capital which is also the country's largest airport expects international flight departures to witness a significant jump in the first week of April after the resumption of regular international operations.While Indian carriers are prepared for normal international services various foreign airlines including Emirates Virgin Atlantic and LOT Polish have also announced plans about their services to and from India.Scheduled international passenger flights have remained suspended since March 23 2020 in the wake of the pandemic and they will now restart from Sunday.Overseas flights are being operated now under bilateral air bubble arrangements with various countries.On March 8 the civil aviation ministry announced that regular overseas flights will resume from March 27 amid a decline in coronavirus cases.The government has also revised the COVID guidelines for international flight operations including the removal of the requirement to keep three seats vacant on overseas flights for medical emergencies.Besides the requirement for the crew for having a complete PPE kit has been done away with.In a statement on Saturday IndiGo Chief Commercial Officer Willy Boulter said the airline is keen on resuming international operations back to pre-COVID levels but that will also depend on factors like arrival guidelines of various countries.""We certainly have plans to open new destinations in the near future as well as pump up capacity on our existing routes as travel further opens up. Reaching economies of scale in such a dynamic environment where ATF and other fixed costs are constantly going up becomes challenging"" he said.IndiGo is the country's largest airline.On Friday a DIAL spokesperson said ""Post resumption of commercial operations South East Asia and Europe are expected to be the main drivers of further international passenger growth"".DIAL the operator of IGIA expects to connect to over 60 international destinations after the resumption of regular overseas flights.IGIA is the country's largest airport and handled around 1.8 lakh passengers per day during pre-COVID times.The spokesperson had also said the number of international Air Traffic Movements (ATMs) is likely to increase from 165 per day to 300 per day in summer 2022.The total weekly departures of international flights are expected to increase 66 per cent in the first week of April once the regular overseas flights commence according to the spokesperson.This is in comparison to the flights that operated under bilateral air bubble arrangements during winter 2021.On Friday Gulf carrier Emirates said it would re-introduce pre-pandemic service frequency across its destinations in the country from April 1.Prior to late March 2020 when the scheduled international services were stopped by India Emirates was operating 170 weekly flights to nine destinations including Delhi Mumbai Chennai and Kolkata.All these flights are being restored now starting from April 1 as per the airline.These 170 weekly flights include 35 services to Mumbai 28 to Delhi 24 to Bengaluru 21 each to Chennai and Hyderabad 14 to Kochi 11 to Kolkata nine to Ahmedabad and seven to Thiruvananthapuram SriLankan Airlines  on Friday said it would start operating up to 88-weekly flights to India to match the pre-COVID flight schedule.

Caterpillar in Lafayette has been involved with some of the most famous movies in history such as ""Aliens"" and the ""Transformers"" franchise as well as with the building of one of the most famous American landmarks – the famous Hollywood sign.

Lee Fosburgh Caterpillar's heritage services manager oversees a wide variety of Caterpillar's historical documents photographs antique machines and more.

Do-over:15 films that didn't deserve the best picture Oscar – and the ones that should have won instead

""We have a collection"" Fosburgh said ""in a facility that's 13000 square feet but there's I think we claim there's like eight football fields of just paper records. But we also have artifacts we have antique machine collection of Caterpillar machines we've over a million photographs you know. It's kind of everything just (in) Caterpillar history...""

Caterpillar Fosburgh said was originally formed by two different companies – Holt Manufacturing Company and C.L. Best Tractor Co. He also maintains their records as well as any companies Caterpillar absorbs.

Caterpillar machines have appeared in some of the most recognizable movies and franchises of all time. CAT machines have made appearances a certain James Bond film.

""Probably the craziest thing that we've had"" Fosburgh said. ""...There was a 'James Bond' movie called 'Skyfall' and there was a hydraulic excavator that was used in that movie that was on top of like during a train while (it) was moving and it was kind of moving around during a chase scene... We had that in our collection for a while the actual one that was used in the movie. But what Caterpillar did was to make it available for everyone to see it we actually donated it to the Ian Fleming Foundation.""

A very recognizable use of Caterpillar machinery takes place in the 1986 sequel ""Aliens"" when Sigourney Weaver's character Ripley wears the Power Loader suit in a fight with the titular alien.

While the robotic suit used in the movie is a work of fiction those involved in creating the suit for on-screen use knew they wanted a recognizable brand on the suit.

""...they created this suit that you know the people wore in the movies but what they wanted to put on the suit was our logo"" Fosburgh said. ""So it wasn't really a product per se but they wanted to use the logo. And they saw CAT as this innovative company you know but also like you know like kind of a strength of company. And they thought people would relate to that and could see us like using something like that in the future. So that's how that came about.""

Despite the Power Loader actually not being an available Caterpillar product movies occasionally use nonfictional CAT machinery to show customers and viewers the purposes and power of their machines.

Just plain bad movies:Razzies royally torch 'Diana' musical and 'Space Jam 2' show love to Oscar favorite Will Smith

""But that's what for example 'Transformers' was"" Fosburgh said. ""That we were developing a new line or were about to launch a new line of what we call hydraulic excavators... and kind of that idea was used to when they created you know digitally these transformers. That was what that was based off of. So it was a way to get that word out there (of new excavators).""

Caterpillar was also involved with building one of the most famous landmarks associated with the movie industry the Hollywood sign.

""...C.L. Best Tractor Co. they made a tractor called (the) Best 60"" Fosburgh said. ""And when the merger happened it became the Caterpillar 60...it was kind of the iPhone of you know the tractor world... When they brought the letters up to build the sign they pulled Best tractors off of the job sites and they pulled essentially those letters and worked to put them into place.""

Caterpillar continues to serve as the fourth largest employer for Lafayette with some of the leading jobs fields in Lafayette being transportation equipment metal and metal products and manufacturing according to citytowninfo.com.

""You know what really appeals to me (about working at CAT) is it's so cool working for essentially a company that has a footprint in almost every country across the globe"" Fosburgh said. ""And you really get to work and meet such a diverse workforce. And you get to kind of work with people you maybe never would work with before at other types of companies.""

The 94th Academy Awards will air at 8 p.m. Sunday on ABC as well as online through Hulu Live TV YouTubeTV AT&T TV and FuboTV.

Singer Sebastián Yatra (aka the ~angelic~ voice behind “Dos Oruguitas”) is right there with you. In an interview with CNN en Español he admitted that “to watch a Disney movie about Colombia that shows different elements that are so specific about my country the people the family…knowing that I am part of that I started crying like a little child.” Although Encanto is laden with moments that will def make you ugly-cry one of the most emotional and poignant parts juuuuust so happens to take place in the third act when “Dos Oruguitas” plays over Abuela Alma’s heartbreaking flashback to a moment with Abuelo Pedro.

If that’s not enough Sebastián underscores the significance of the fact that not only is the song played in full Spanish without subtitles but it also “is the first time that Disney leaves a song sung in Spanish playing all over the planet. So it is not only in the United States and throughout Latin America that they hear ‘Dos Oruguitas’ in Spanish but also in China Russia Afghanistan…wherever it is playing it is in Spanish.” BRB crying part 1000.

Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song this year “Dos Oruguitas” is perfectly encapsulated by Encanto writer Lin-Manuel Miranda in an interview with Vulture: “The idea was to make a song that sounded like it had been around for 100 years being sung on street corners.” The song’s key metaphor is that of a caterpillar’s transformation into a butterfly.

The writer recalls:

“I was spitballing with Jared Bush and Charise Castro Smith the codirectors and writers on the film and said ‘Well butterflies are just kind of nature’s original miracle in a way right?’ These caterpillars start building this thing with no understanding of why they’re doing it and they’re going to completely destroy themselves and become a new thing. I thought What if the folk song has these two caterpillars who are in love? Who have to separate and they don’t know why and they don’t want to? But they have to. Because that’s how they become the next version of themselves. It felt like a really beautiful nature metaphor for what the family was going through en masse. And also the painful separation that we’re seeing in front of us onscreen.”

Although Lin-Manuel initially struggled to write the ballad (as “Dos Oruguitas” was his first-ever song written in Spanish) he admits he kept chipping away at it with the help of a thesaurus that rarely left his side. In fact he said he began to have dreams in the language again for the first time since his childhood in Puerto Rico.

From the initial inspiration of “Dos Oruguitas” to its final execution we’re nothing short of obsessed and we can’t wait to hear it IRL at the 2022 Oscars this Sunday. Check out the song clip and Disney+ link to Encanto below and learn the lyrics ahead of Sebastián’s performance. (Bonus points if you learn the song in English and Spanish.)

“Dos Oruguitas” Spanish lyrics

Dos oruguitas enamoradas

Pasan sus noches y madrugadas

Llenas de hambre

Siguen andando y navegando un mundo

Que cambia y sigue cambiando

Navegando un mundo

Que cambia y sigue cambiando

Dos oruguitas paran el viento

Mientras se abrazan con sentimiento

Siguen creciendo no saben cuándo

Buscar algún rincón

El tiempo sigue cambiando

Inseparables son

El tiempo sigue cambiando

Ay oruguitas no se aguanten más

Hay que crecer a parte y volver

Hacia adelante seguirás

Vienen milagros vienen crisálidas

Hay que partir y construir su propio futuro

Ay oruguitas no se aguanten más

Hay que crecer a parte y volver

Hacia adelante seguirás

Vienen milagros vienen crisálidas

Hay que partir y construir su propio futuro

Dos oruguitas desorientadas

En dos capullos bien abrigadas

Con sueños nuevos

Ya solo falta hacer lo necesario

En el mundo que sigue cambiando

Tumbando sus paredes

Ahí viene nuestro milagro

Nuestro milagro

Ay mariposas no se aguanten más

Hay que crecer a parte y volver

Hacia adelante seguirás

Ya son milagros rompiendo crisálidas

“Two Oruguitas” English lyrics

Two oruguitas

In love and yearning

Spend every evening

And morning learning

To hold each other

Their hunger burning

To navigate a world

That turns and never stops turning

Together in this world

That turns and never stops turning

Two oruguitas

Against the weather

The wind grows colder

But they’re together

They hold each other

No way of knowing

They’re all they have for shelter

And something inside them is growing

They long to stay together

But something inside them is growing

Ay oruguitas

Don’t you hold on too tight

Both of you know

It’s your time to grow

To fall apart to reunite

Wonders await you

Just on the other side

Trust they’ll be there

And start to prepare

The way for tomorrow

Ay oruguitas

Don’t you hold on too tight

Both of you know

It’s your time to grow

To fall apart to reunite

Wonders await you

Just on the other side

Trust they’ll be there

Start to prepare

The way for tomorrow

Two oruguitas

Cocooned and waiting

Each in their own world

Anticipating

What happens after

The rearranging?

And so afraid of change

In a world that never stops changing

So let the walls come down

The world will never stop changing

(Never stop changing)

(Never stop changing)

(Never stop changing)

Ay mariposas

Don’t you hold on too tight

Both of you know

It’s your time to go

To fly apart to reunite

Wonders surround you

Just let the walls come down

Don’t look behind you

Fly till you find

Your way toward tomorrow

Ay mariposas

Don’t you hold on too tight

Both of you know

It’s your time to go

To fly apart to reunite

Wonders surround you

Just let the walls come down

Don’t look behind you

Fly till you find

Your way toward tomorrow

Ay mariposas

Don’t you hold on too tight

Both of you know

It’s your time to go

To fly apart to reunite

Wonders surround you

Just let the walls come down

Don’t look behind you

“Dos Oruguitas” was written by Lin Manuel Miranda and performed by Yatra for the Disney film Encanto which premiered in 2021. Yatra a singer-songwriter from Colombia appeared at the 2022 Oscars to perform a live rendition of the track following its nomination for Best Original Song. The song’s nomination sparked some surprise among fans of Encanto considering the breakout success of another song on the film’s soundtrack: “We Don’t Talk About Bruno.” But according to Miranda “Dos Oruguitas” simply made the cut sooner when it came time to submit a song for Academy Awards consideration.

“I’m still proud of ‘Dos Oruguitas’ as the submission” Miranda said on an episode of Variety’s Awards Circuit Podcast in 2022. “When those are the parameters you have to pick the thing that best exemplifies the spirit of the movie and it contains all of it inside this song—as opposed to a journey of a particular character. It’s the foundational story but I’m not going to say it wasn’t hard.”

Judging from Yatra’s beautiful performance at the Oscars you really can’t go wrong with any song off of the Encanto soundtrack—and we’d wager to say “Dos Oruguitas” does tick all the boxes of a heartfelt award-worthy ballad. In Encanto the song plays during an important flashback scene where protagonist Mirabel learns about her grandmother Alma’s life and the hardships she endured—from her romance with her husband Pedro to the sacrifices they had to make as a couple to save their family from war. Lyrically the song speaks about two caterpillars falling in love before having to let go of one another which serves as a metaphor for the events that transpired in Alma and Pedro’s life. Read on ahead for the full “Dos Oruguitas” lyrics in English and Spanish.

By Molly Ryan

When Thalia Tatham went vegan she felt sushi was missing from her life. Rather than quelling the craving she adapted it — thus House of Vegano was born.

After selling her products at local pop-ups and markets and finding she was far from being the only vegan to miss the cuisine’s distinct umami Tatham’s first official dining location opened its doors on March 21.

“The first week has been a whirlwind and I am in full gratitude of all the love and support that we are being shown” Tatham told The Crow’s Nest.

House of Vegano is a 10-minute drive from USF St. Petersburg located at 655 31st St. S. in the Body Electric athletic complex. Courtesy of Molly Ryan | The Crow’s Nest.

Located at 655 31st St. S. in the Body Electric athletic complex House of Vegano is a 10-minute drive from the University of South Florida St. Petersburg.

As vegan-friendly restaurants continue to populate the area House of Vegano distinguishes itself through a vibrant atmosphere and high-top bar seating where customers can watch how the sushi-making process unfolds.

While many perceive sushi as strictly seafood House of Vegano aims to prove that the classic flavors — as well as Tatham’s unique twists — can exist outside the realm of tradition.

“Vegans oftentimes feel like an option when entering the restaurants” Tatham said. “Here we cater to you.”

(Left to right) The volcano roll the sweet potato summer roll the caterpillar roll and the spicy vegan shrimp roll use marinated fruits vegetables and mushrooms to mimic familiar flavors. Courtesy of Molly Ryan | The Crow’s Nest.

Currently House of Vegano is only offering its signature rolls which range from $16 to $23 — the volcano roll the spicy krab roll the caterpillar roll the spicy vegan shrimp roll and the sweet potato summer roll — wherein different fruits vegetables and locally-grown mushrooms are marinated to mimic the savory flavors garnished with plant-based caviar and house-made sauces.

However Tatham assured this is part of a “slow roll out” and that ramen dumplings poke bowls and house salads will be making their way onto the menu. She also plans to incorporate secret menu items.

According to Tatham orders can also be modified to be soy or gluten free “so there are no barriers for those with celiac or allergies.”

Tatham’s dedication to inclusivity goes beyond the menu.

A nod to the 1980s “ballroom” culture House of Vegano’s namesake draws from the various “houses” that would not only compete in the grandiose balls but would allow queer people of color a space to freely express themselves.

House of Vegano owner Thalia Tatham pays tribute to Mexican painter Frida Kahlo through a mural. For Tatham Kahlo is source of strength and resilience.

The restaurant also features a mural and tribute to Mexican painter Frida Kahlo whose art famously challenged the notions of gender class identity and postcolonialism.

“Kahlo for me is a source of strength and resilience” Tatham said. “There are hidden messages [in the mural] — one being the name of her last painting ‘Viva la Vida’ [or] ‘Long Live Life’.”

Tatham who was an emergency medical technician prior to opening House of Vegano expressed that she first went vegan to treat lupus — an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the body’s tissues and organs. After her diet change Tatham’s flare ups were “nonexistent.”

“For me transitioning [to a plant-based diet] was for a change in my health but ended changing my heart” Tatham said.

House of Vegano sushi can also be purchased at the boutique vegan grocery store Black Radish Grocer.

The project’s centerpiece is an indoor-outdoor tenants-only hospitality suite on the third floor designed to exploit market demand for wellness and collaborative-work facilities.

Lever House joint-venture leaseholders WatermanClark and Brookfield Properties will launch Lever Club an ambitious tenants-only lounge and hospitality venue inside the green-glass tower as part of the redevelopment when the building reopens early next year.

WatermanClark co-founder and managing partner Ric Clark said “Our intention is to support employers’ desire to respond to their employees in the post-pandemic world. Our redevelopment will create an environment where people want to be with a focus on health wellness and flexibility.

“The one thing we hear from young executives is that they don’t want to be chained to their desks.”

Lever Club means to address that issue head-on. It will feature 15000 square feet of outdoor space in two landscaped terraces situated on the building’s north and south sides. The terraces are to flank an indoor complex of 15000 square feet that will include a private restaurant conference rooms and health facilities such as training rooms and showers.

3 Outdoor space at the revamped Lever House building will be for tenants to use during nice days. Such space is in-demand as executives say people don’t want to be chained to their desks — and want other places in an office building to gather. Tomorrow AB

The third floor was once used by original owner Lever as a hospitality center — “There are pictures of their people playing shuffleboard” Clark said — but in recent years was used as office space. The tower’s current revamping will also include a top-to-bottom interior refurbishment and an advanced DOAS filtration system to provide 50% more fresh air than in other DOAS-equipped buildings.

Most visibly to the public the ground-level plaza beneath the tower — which Clark called “historically dark and dreary in winter” — is being redesigned with new lighting and a new ceiling to make it attractive year-round.

Lever House brought the International Style glass curtain-wall style to Park Avenue two years before the larger Seagram Building did. Architects Skidmore Owings & Merrill famously crafted a smaller structure than zoning allowed with a mere 260000 square feet on 26 floors the tower set perpendicular to the avenue to maximize light and views.

3 The historic Lever House building on Park Avenue has struggled in recent years for tenants but a revamp should make it a hot address once again its new management says.

But it struggled in recent years despite its architectural distinction.

Previous owner Aby Rosen’s RFR Realty undertook a modest modernization program in 2000. But Rosen fell behind on ground-lease payments to the land-owning Korein family and turned the keys over to WatermanClark and Brookfield in 2020.

The new owners took full control in 2020 — “The lease is extremely long-term and it shouldn’t be a problem for us” Clark said. City Finance Department records list the leasehold purchase at $240 million.

“There were only four or five tenants when we took over in 2020. We worked with them to facilitate their leaving. An empty building isn’t scary for us. It gives us the opportunity to do what we’re doing which we couldn’t’ do in a building full of tenants” Clark said.

3 The third floor will offer a gathering space and the landscaped outdoor area will also an additional gathering space. Floor plates tat the building are only around 11000 square feet each. Tomorrow AB

Lever House with floors of only 11000 square feet each is an anomaly — essentially a boutique property in a Park Avenue market of giant floor plates. Clark said the setup “creates a pretty rare Manhattan opportunity for a single tenant but we’ll more likely rent to multiple tenants taking one or two floors. There are far more 11000 or 22000 square-foot users in the market than there are for 260000 square feet.”

The building’s reopening comes during a Park Avenue resurgence after a few years of relative decline.

“The East Midtown rezoning “totally changed the complexion of Park Avenue” Clark said. In addition to JP Morgan Chase’s rising new headquarters tower properties in the East 40s and 50s have been landing large new leases as owners pump hundreds of millions of dollars into contemporizing structures built in the 1950s and 1960s.

Clark declined to cite asking rents for Lever House. But market sources said the likely target is for triple-digit rents in the $200 per-square-foot range.

A newly renovated tank inspired by CenterPoint Energy hosted the event and offered alternative healing methods such as aroma therapy chakra screening reiki sound healing and art therapy.

Organizers hope that this event will inspire new ways of thinking about health and self-care.



“Now more than ever we need to tap into the value and healing resources that true community involves. Our overall health is dependent upon the proper balance of the mental physical emotional and spiritual aspects of ourselves. When one of those things is out of alignment our whole system begins to suffer. ” said Misty Brown owner of Wellspring Healing Studio and founder of Love Shack.

Organizers of the event want to make this a multi-day event in the future and will need to find venues who would be willing to host.

One such technology is of self-driven automobiles which has recently garnered a lot of attention and high acceptance rate in the last few years. There are now self driven or autonomous vehicles (AVs) almost everywhere around the world.

Taking a cue from the general application of AVs the logistics industry has also started to fiddle with the technology. Behold the autonomous semis! Semi-trucks or Semis are a very popular mode of freight movement in the US and when you consider the ongoing shortage of labor in the US trucking sector these self driven semi-trucks seem like a good idea. They show a promising future of trucking by being unsusceptible to driver shortages increasing vehicle prices fuel price volatility performance limitations and safety concerns.

The pilot projects for autonomous semi-trucks are being run on the American Sun Belt i.e. the states of Texas Arizona and Florida by various trucking companies. Considering that the weather conditions in these states are little more welcoming than the rest of the country throughout the year these states are the ideal ‘testing labs’ for autonomous semis. These trucking companies are fairly confident about the success rate of autonomous semi-trucks on the highways at least.

Alphabet’s self-driving truck venture Waymo Via last month announced it is teaming up with truck fleet operator C.H. Robinson — which has a network of nearly 200000 shippers and carriers and data on more than 3 million trucking routes — to deliver freight between Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston using automated trucks.

However a new research from the University of Michigan and Carnegie Mellon University exploring the impact of autonomous semi-trucks on the long haul trucking operator hours in the US presents a different side of the coin. The study points to the fact that if the technology is deployed throughout the country i.e. in all weather conditions it could impact up to 94% of long haul trucking operator hours – which would mean loss of around 500000 jobs. However if the technology is restricted to the southern states where the majority of companies are currently testing automated trucking only 10% of operator-hours are impacted. The study also says that the increase in short-haul operations will not compensate for the loss in long-haul operations and transfer hub deployment could create short haul jobs in locations that are different from where long haul truckers currently live.

Let us now look at the Transfer Hub Model – a possible method of deployment of this technology. So a human driven truck will take the cargo from origin to truck port A through the urban/sub-urban (more complex) route. From there the cargo will be loaded to an autonomous semi-truck which will transport it to truck port B through the highway. Then again it will be loaded to a human driven truck which will take the cargo to the intended destination via the urban/sub-urban route. However this is just one of the many ways the technology can be deployed.

Transfer hub model of deployment

There are many arguments when it comes to dependence on autonomous semi-trucks some in favour and some against it. There is the factor of humans losing work to machines although some argue that the estimates are exaggerated. Then there is also an argument that the technology will ease the pressure on truck drivers as long-haul trucking is a tedious job. Another thing to consider is that a machine can fail leading to accidents and other safety lapses which may turn fatal in some cases.

These conflicting arguments make one thing clear – the deployment of automated semi-trucks needs to be done after all possible pros and cons of the technology have been taken into consideration as it would impact hundreds and thousands of not trucking industry workers but those of auxiliary sectors too.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But for Boston University the zigzagging tower going up on its campus along Commonwealth Avenue will be officially known as the Center for Computing & Data Sciences. And when it opens in January 2023 the Suffolk Construction-built edifice will be one of the greenest towers in the city. At about 350000 square feet a BU spokesman said the $305 million computing center will be the largest carbon-neutral building in Boston.

Some see a stack of books about to tumble into the Charles. Others see a Jenga game nearing its completion.

The unusual design can be attributed to KPMB Architects a Toronto-based firm selected to fashion a building that would “make a statement” and “mark the dynamic change in the University” as president Robert Brown told BU Today in 2018. The 19-story building will mostly consist of classrooms computer labs meeting spaces and offices though the top two levels are for the mechanical systems.

It’s hard to argue that the building does not “make a statement” particularly when it comes to environmental sustainability. BU will not use natural gas to heat the building; geothermal wells will provide the bulk of the heating and cooling. It will be the first fossil-fuel free building on BU’s campus.

As the first quarter wraps up this week we get to review the impact current developments around the world have had on the most important driver of stock prices over the long-term: earnings.

The corporate earnings outlook has been relatively stable despite the backdrop of war in Ukraine. Although the unofficial start of the earnings reporting season is still a couple of weeks away there is the potential for market moving news ahead of these announcements. The weeks around the end of the quarter often see companies who expect to fall short of their earnings targets downwardly revise their guidance. So far the changes in first quarters' earnings estimates have been modest.

Earnings-per-share growth in 2022 for companies around the world (as measured by the MSCI All Country World Index) is now expected by FactSet analysts' consensus to be up 6%. Prior to the invasion the consensus was at 7% a difference of only 1%. Higher post-invasion forecasts in the energy materials and industrials sectors partially offset modest declines across other sectors.

Pre- and post-invasion 2022 EPS estimates

Source: Charles Schwab FactSet data as of 3/25/2022. Forecasts contained herein are for illustrative purposes only may be based upon proprietary research and are developed through analysis of historical public data.

Geographically earnings per share estimates for 2022 show that the rising trends in the U.S. U.K. and Japan have not changed much this year. Despite Europe's proximity to the conflict and dependence upon Russian energy supplies earnings growth is still expected to be higher than it was at the start of the year though lower by about 1.5% from pre-invasion levels.

Percent change in 2022 EPS forecasts since start of year

Source: Charles Schwab FactSet data as of 3/25/2022.

There are a couple notable pre- and post-invasion differences:

Canada a major commodity producer has jumped higher since the start of the conflict bolstered by higher prices.

Emerging markets (EM) when measured in U.S. dollars have dropped—tied to the earnings of Russian oil companies dropping out of the index and weakness due to EM currencies falling versus the U.S. dollar. Notably China and other major emerging market earnings outlooks haven’t changed much.

Reflecting the changes in estimates since the start of the year analysts' forecasts for earnings growth in 2022 are still positive across countries and regions heading into the first quarter earnings reporting season as you can see in the chart below.

2022 earnings growth still seen positive across countries and regions

Source: Charles Schwab FactSet data as of 3/25/2022. Forecasts contained herein are for illustrative purposes only may be based upon proprietary research and are developed through analysis of historical public data.

Although forecasts for the year are usually raised during the earnings season as companies typically exceed quarterly estimates there is greater uncertainty this season given the Ukraine conflict inflation and lingering COVID-19 waves.

One of the best leading indicators of the trend in earnings expectations is the global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI). This survey of business leaders from companies around the world is typically about three months ahead of analysts' forecasts for earnings over the coming 12 months as you can see in the chart below of the past 20 years.

PMI leads earning trends

Source: Charles Schwab Bloomberg (PMI) and Factset (MSCI) data as of 3/25/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The level of 50 on the PMI is the threshold between expansion and contraction in manufacturing and tends to align with the division in the outlook between growth and decline in earnings for all companies over the coming year. We will get March's reading of the global manufacturing PMI on April 1. This month's preliminary PMI readings for major countries like the U.S. Germany France and Japan were resilient despite the war reflecting only a small dip. If this trend is confirmed with the final global PMI reading on April Fools' Day it suggests the outlook for earnings growth is likely to continue.

Of course the future direction of the PMI and the outlook for earnings remains tied to the impact of the war and sanctions among many other factors that include inflation and central bank actions. Further escalation of sanctions may have greater earnings impact; current sanctions have been cautiously implemented to avoid disruption of energy supplies. However investors may take some comfort that the earnings impact so far has remained modest and global companies appear to be on a path for earnings growth this year.

Spectrum broadband is coming to nearly 95 percent of Dillon County and it is coming soon.

This was the good news shared at a recent Dillon County Council meeting by Ben Breazeale Senior Director of Government Affairs at Charter Communications.

Breazeale said that Charter had received federal grants to build out broadband to 75-80 percent of Dillon County.

Charter was given six years to build out in 40 different South Carolina counties; however Breazeale said as a result of the influence of Rep. Jackie Hayes and others Dillon County was accelerated to the front of the line. Breazeale shared the map shown with this article and said the blue region showed the initial 75-80 percent.

He then referenced another map also shown with this article that shows the area south of Latta. He said he worked carefully with the county administrator and GIS expert to take in as many addresses as possible to get Dillon County to 95 percent. He said they identified 346 addresses south of Latta which was the most they could feasibly get to reach 95 percent.

He said the contract that was coming before council on the day of his presentation would take in those additional addresses. Charter will pay half of the cost of these additional addresses which totals about $1.5 million. Charter’s portion is $830000 and the county part is $750000 which will come from American Rescue Plan funds.

The total investment in broadband for Dillon County is $10 million. Breazeale announced that the work will start the second quarter of 2022 and will be completed by the third quarter of 2023.

Breazeale praised the work of the county former County Administrator Clay Young and the council on this project.

The last map shows the additional areas about 100-200 addresses that are outside of the area and the cost is prohibitive to get to those addresses. He did say that the state was setting up a broadband grant program and they would be going to the state and asking for funds to get to these additional addresses.

Councilman Gerome “Gee” McLeod said that the sooner they get started the better. He made the motion to approve the agreement to take in the additional addresses seconded by Councilman Jamal Campbell. All present voted in favor.

Breazeale said they love working with Dillon County. Councilman Stevie Grice said that he appreciated Charter and Rep. Hayes for making Dillon County first.

Breazeale said Hayes was an asset as was council and Clay Young who did a great job in working through the details. Young who was present for the presentation thanked Breazeale and said he appreciated Councilman “Gee” McLeod for staying on top of it with him.

The video of this meeting can be found on The Dillon Herald’s channel on YouTube.

The 2325 square foot Chipotle restaurant will contain approximately 65 seats and a mobile pick up drive-thru lane. The site plan also includes accessory parking stormwater management facilities lighting landscaping and utilities.

Unless I received an additional call from upper management I was told I could return to work for my next scheduled shift – as long as I felt comfortable doing so.

After listening to the voicemail I knew I had to return to work regardless of my comfort level.

If I called out my managers and co-workers would have to compensate for my absence. But they were already struggling amid the ongoing shortage of fast food workers.

Therefore I was hesitant to text my manager that I couldn’t come in.

Due to this hesitancy there were days when I would work even when I felt slightly under the weather or exhausted. Working five days a week at the time I felt the physical toll of long laborious shifts during which I often took on multiple roles due to staff shortages.

Such occurrences are common at fast food restaurants that prioritize sales and customer satisfaction over employee health.

A recent report published by UCLA and UC Berkeley researchers regarding poor conditions faced by fast food workers found that more than half of respondents weren’t notified by management when exposed to the coronavirus in the workplace.

According to the career service platform Zippia more than half of fast food workers are between 20 and 30 years old making subpar working conditions a pressing issue for the UCLA community.

Legislative action such as a higher minimum wage and greater representation of fast food workers in the policymaking process can best address the conditions discussed in the report and experienced by myself and other students.

Though the fast food industry implemented some COVID-19 precautions their effectiveness in preventing exposure for workers is questionable. UCLA and UC Berkeley researchers found that 25% of respondents said they had contracted COVID-19 and 50% said they knew a co-worker who had tested positive despite the case rate for Los Angeles County being 15% at the time of research.

Luke Shen a first-year data theory student worked at Furai Chicken in Orange County last summer. Shen said there were precautions against COVID-19 in place but he was still concerned about being exposed to the coronavirus.

“So many people had it so just with the regular flow of customers in and out I think the chances are that (I was exposed) at some point” Shen said.

Too often managers and customers alike place the responsibility of ensuring safety on the workers.

Once while working as a cashier a customer confronted me for not enforcing the mask policy. I politely agreed with her as she said unmasked customers were a threat to customers and employees.

I had heard from other employees about confrontations with unmasked customers that turned hostile. As an 18-year-old who was navigating her first job then I was unwilling to tell a potentially aggressive grown man to put on his mask.

I didn’t get paid enough for that.

Hostile interactions related to COVID-19 precautions weren’t limited to my workplace. In the report 53% of the workers surveyed said they had negative interactions with customers when requesting compliance with COVID-19 regulations.

Ixáyac Cortéz a third-year history student and barista at Starbucks said he once encountered a customer who claimed to be exempt from wearing a mask.

“​​It was our responsibility (to speak with maskless customers) and if they weren’t listening then a supervisor would get involved” Cortéz said.

He added that if a customer wasn’t cooperating the employees would try to serve them as quickly as possible or simply refuse service.

With LA County having removed its mask mandate at the beginning of March the issue of confronting maskless customers has not gone away but rather evolved into asking dine-in customers for proof of vaccination.

Worryingly there are also discrepancies in safety protections for workers between locations. Silvia Hernandez an apprentice manager at Chipotle Mexican Grill in Westwood said employees are supposed to take time off if exposed to the coronavirus. However the manager at the Chipotle I worked at until February told me to come in if I was comfortable.

It should not be the responsibility of workers to ensure the safety of the public and themselves but rather the company’s regardless of the financial costs. Businesses can invest in higher quality masks thermometers and cleaning supplies and employers can encourage employees to prioritize their well-being by offering paid sick leave.

However there are financial and logistical limitations that may inhibit companies from offering such measures.

In an interview with the Daily Bruin for an article published in January UCLA and UC Berkeley researchers said that although there are corporations that may refuse to provide adequate protective measures some business owners simply may not make enough revenue to fund such measures.

That reasoning makes sense but it’s difficult to stomach when you’re working for a multibillion-dollar company that has more than enough resources to keep its workers safe. In 2020 Chipotle Mexican Grill generated $6 billion in revenue an adequate amount for providing us with more than a thermometer that only worked half of the time.

Better conditions require legislation. Voters must show their support for bills in favor of workers’ rights and representation to pressure corporate officials to prioritize the safety of their employees.

In addition to increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour we should all encourage our state senators to pass Assembly Bill 257 which would establish the Fast Food Sector Council within the Department of Industrial Relations and include seats on the council for fast food workers. Having passed by a 41-21 vote in favor of the bill by legislators the bill will now be considered by the California Senate.

Only with the representation of employees can conditions for workers improve.

Fast food workers shouldn’t be expected to put aside their safety to protect a corporate bottom line.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zeXJhY3VzZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAzL3RocmVlLXJlc3RhdXJhbnRzLWhhdmUtdW5zYXRpc2ZhY3RvcnktaW5zcGVjdGlvbnMtb25lLW9yZGVyZWQtdG8tY2xvc2UtODUtb3BlcmF0aW5nLWFjY2VwdGFibHkuaHRtbNIBmAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zeXJhY3VzZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAzL3RocmVlLXJlc3RhdXJhbnRzLWhhdmUtdW5zYXRpc2ZhY3RvcnktaW5zcGVjdGlvbnMtb25lLW9yZGVyZWQtdG8tY2xvc2UtODUtb3BlcmF0aW5nLWFjY2VwdGFibHkuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three restaurants have unsatisfactory inspections one ordered to close; 85 operating acceptably,"Things continue to be busy at the Onondaga County Health Department.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

Pennsylvania State Police have charged Bernard Polite 26 of Braddock after he entered and attempted to shoot pastor Glenn Germany while the pastor was delivering a sermon at Jesus' Dwelling Place Church on Sunday. Pastor Glenn Germany / Facebook

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

Last month a man was reported to be walking into nearly a dozen area churches includes St. Sebastian Church in Ross Township and yelling at a priest that he was the devil.

A mansion on the Black Sea coast often linked to Russian president Vladimir Putin has been refashioned to include a church equipped with a throne according to a report by Russian investigative outlet Proekt. It published the videos of ""Putin's palace"" which were recently renovated. The existence of the mansion was first revealed in 2021 by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny who had said that it has a wine cellar a casino and an ice rink. Russia has not official reacted to the Proekt report.

The palace is sealed off from rest of the Russia by 17000 acres of forest and a special no-fly zone.

""Many viewers of Navalny's video remembered the entertainment areas - with a pole a casino as well as a room with toy cars and a railway"" Proekt said in its report adding that none of these areas exist anymore.

It also said that renovations suggest Putin ""seems to be obsessed with war and religion"".

The photos show a home church featuring a triptych and a wooden throne. The walls of the room are decorated with crosses and the triptych appears to depict a ""Saint Prince Vladimir"" two art historians and one icon painter said Proekt further said.

The outlet made a particular mention of a chandelier which it said has been made using red crystals from the French manufacturer Baccarat and costs $1 million.

In his 2021 video Mr Navalny had claimed that the property costs $1.3 billion and alleged it was paid for via an elaborate corruption scheme in which Putin gave top jobs and lucrative government projects to his allies at partially state-owned energy giants.

Thousands of Russians had come out on the streets in 2021 when Mr Navalny published the expose on Mr Putin's Black Sea complex.

But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had dismissed the claims in the report at the time calling it ""pure nonsense"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjEwMTFub3cuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDQvc291dGhlYXN0LWxpbmNvbG4tY2h1cmNoLXN1c3RhaW5zLTE1LW1pbGxpb24tZGFtYWdlLWZpcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southeast Lincoln church sustains $1.5 million in damage from fire,"LINCOLN Neb.

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

William Bohman (Bill) of Mt. Lookout passed away peacefully in his home on March 17 2022 after a long illness. Bill was born on October 3 1932 to Harry and Anna Bohman of Covington. He was preceded in death by sisters Norma (Eugene) Lankheit Louise (Ray) Dickerson Josetta (Lee) Uphaus and Anna (Rich) Loheide. Those left to cherish his memory are his wife of 58 years Mary Kay Asbrock Bohman and his five children: Bill (Hyun) Bohman Joe (Ting) Bohman Tom (Jen) Bohman Mary Beth (Tyson) Bohman and Jennifer (Marc) Auville. He will be missed by his twelve grandchildren: Billy Michelle Matthew Joseph Quinn Katie Claudia Julia Leo John Tommy and Emma. He is also survived by his sisters-in-law Betty (Al) Corson and Ruth Ann (Jim) Doerger.

Bill grew up ice skating on frozen ponds in Covington and playing endless games of baseball. At 18 he was drafted into the Army during the Korean War. He was stationed in Alaska where he played baseball at all hours of the night. He returned home and attended Villa Madonna College thanks to the GI Bill. Bill enjoyed many summers boating on the Ohio River with his best friend Larry Goodwin. Mary Kay joined him on the river for their summer of boating and dating before they wed in July of 1963. The couple settled in Mt Lookout to raise their children and Bill had a full career as a financial auditor after earning an MBA at XU. He was a devoted husband and father coaching sports teams and cooking up big batches of homemade donuts chili and goetta for his family.

In retirement Bill had a second career working as a landscaper at Kings Island where planting and tending the flowers and ornamentals brought him much fulfillment. He was an avid bike rider enjoying Mt. Lookout’s endless hills and daily rides through Ault Park. He also loved hiking on the Appalachian Trail a lifelong dream with friends Larry and Roger Bien. Bill was endlessly curious about the world always reading the paper and he had an uncanny memory which made him a tough competitor at trivia nights.

Bill’s 89 years brought him many friends and he will be sorely missed by all.

Tejay Antone (who underwent Tommy John surgery in August) was placed on the 60-day injured list to create roster room.

March 24: Pham is guaranteed $7.5MM on the deal coming in the form of a $6MM salary and a $1.5MM buyout on next year’s mutual option Nightengale further reports.

March 23: The Reds are in agreement with outfielder Tommy Pham on a one-year deal reports Bobby Nightengale of the Cincinnati Enquirer. The deal which contains a mutual option for 2023 is pending a physical. Financial terms have not been disclosed. Pham is a client of Vayner Sports.

Pham was one of the game’s more underrated players early in his career with the Cardinals and Rays. Between 2017-19 the right-handed hitter posted a .284/.381/.475 line while averaging nearly 22 home runs and stolen bases apiece per season. Pham routinely posted high-end exit velocities and walk rates while making a decent amount of contact. A high ground-ball tendency kept him from emerging as an elite power threat but he was a well-rounded and highly productive offensive player.

Over the 2019-20 offseason Tampa Bay traded Pham and Jake Cronenworth to the Padres in a deal that sent Hunter Renfroe and Xavier Edwards back to the Rays. While Pham was the headliner of the swap from the Friars’ perspective Cronenworth proved to be the more valuable pickup. Pham struggled to a .211/.312/.312 mark during the shortened 2020 season the only below-average offensive showing of his career. Last year’s .229/.340/.383 slash was a tick above average by measure of wRC+ but it still came up well shy of his early-career numbers.

Pham who didn’t emerge as a regular until his age-29 campaign turned 34 earlier this month. It’s certainly possible his recent downturn is attributable to aging but it’s worth noting he dealt with a few health issues in San Diego that probably also had a deleterious effect on his performance. Pham missed a month in 2020 after fracturing the hamate bone in his right hand an injury that could certainly have sapped some of his power. Last offseason he was the victim of a life-threatening stabbing attack that required 200 stitches to close a wound in his back.

Remarkably Pham returned by Opening Day and didn’t spend any time on the injured list. Yet he was open about how the incident affected his offseason routine and it’s possible he was never fully healthy in 2021. Pham actually performed much better in the first half of the year than he did in the second — he didn’t merely start slowly while recovering from the stabbing — but it’d be understandable if he weren’t up to the physical grind of a 162-game season coming off the prior winter’s tribulations.

Pham’s dip in results has been attributable to what has happened on balls in play. Last season’s 13.9% walk rate remained excellent while his 22.8% strikeout percentage is right in line with his career marks. Pham still made plenty of authoritative contact. His 47.6% hard contact rate and 94.9 MPH average exit velocity on balls hit in the air were both definitively better than average. The results didn’t align with those batted ball numbers though as Pham saw a career-low 13.5% of his fly balls clear the fences.

San Diego’s pitcher-friendly home ballpark didn’t seem to do the veteran outfielder any favors. Pham’s .412 weighted on-base average on fly balls was far outstripped by his .562 “expected” weighted on-base on those batted balls per Statcast. A few more of those flies should clear the fences at the hitter-friendly Great American Ball Park perhaps enabling Pham to post numbers closer to his career norms.

That makes him a sensible buy-low target although the signing comes in the broader context of a strange offseason for the Reds. Much of the winter was focused on the club’s cost-cutting efforts. They parted ways with Wade Miley Tucker Barnhart Sonny Gray and Jesse Winker and seemingly made no effort to retain free agent Nick Castellanos. Those all thinned out a roster that was marginally above-average (83-79 with a +26 run differential) last season.

That’ll make it difficult to make a serious run at contention in 2022 but Cincinnati has made a few short-term moves in recent days. They acquired Mike Minor from the Royals and signed each of Donovan Solano Colin Moran and Hunter Strickland building out the margins of the roster. Pham may be the most impactful of those moves but competing this year while slashing costs still looks to be a difficult needle for general manager Nick Krall and his staff to thread.

Pham figures to replace Winker as the primary left fielder. Jake Fraley whom the Reds acquired from the Mariners in the Winker/Eugenio Suárez trade is better suited for left but could see some action in center field. Tyler Naquin will probably move from center to right after rating poorly defensively leaving Fraley Nick Senzel and Shogo Akiyama as the options in center. That’s not an ideal group but there weren’t many capable everyday center fielders available in free agency or trade this offseason. Pham isn’t a perfect positional fit but installing his bat into the lineup should help an offense that lost two of last season’s top three hitters.

Companies with high profits and revenue per employee are presumed to be the most successful. Alphabet Microsoft and Meta Platforms owner of Facebook are such companies. These tech companies are among the largest in the United States based on revenue and they are among the youngest large companies. Several were founded in the past 25 years. However a group of relatively small companies leads the list of highest profit per employee.

Data for the recent “Profit per Employee” research paper from software company Tipalti came from the Fortune 500. The paper examined 914 major companies most of which made a profit per employee in the last year. Only 238 reported a loss per employee. The company that has the most profits per employee is Air Lease. The company reported $516 million in profits or $4.3 million per employee.

Air Lease with an employee count of 120 buys passenger planes and leases them to airlines. The process allows carriers that do not have capital access to planes. Air Lease makes its profit largely off the interest it charges these carriers. The company was hurt by the trouble with the aviation industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic but its financials have started to recover.

When the company announced its 2021 results John L. Plueger chief executive officer and president commented: “We had a strong fourth quarter and second half of 2021 that benefited from continuing airline industry recovery as seen in our cash collections operating metrics fleet expansion and record lease placement.”

Air Lease owns 474 planes that it leases to 118 customers in 60 countries. The company is based in Los Angeles. (See if Air Lease is also among the 50 best companies to work for.)

To find the 50 companies with the most profits per employee 24/7 Wall St. reviewed Tipalti’s “Profit per Employee” research paper. Very few of the companies with the highest profit per employee are large tech companies. Meta is highest among these ranking 11th with a profit of nearly $500000 per employee based on over 58000 workers. Several financial firms are ahead of Meta.

Mortgage giant Fannie Mae has profit of $1.5 million per employee based on 7700 workers. This places it second on the list. The third is private equity firm KKR at $1.3 million per employee based on 1583 workers. (Find out if any of the companies on this list were also among the most innovative companies in 2021.)

Ketika Jokowi memberikan arahan pada acara Afirmasi Bangga Buatan Produk Indonesia yang digelar di Bali dan disiarkan secara daring pada Jumat (25/3/2022) lalu Presiden bahkan sampai melontarkan sindiran keras kepada sejumlah anak buahnya.

Menurut Jokowi rincian anggaran modal untuk pusat daerah maupun BUMN sangat besar.

""Kalau digunakan kita enggak usah muluk-muluk dibelokkan 40 persen saja 40 persen saja itu bisa mentrigger growth ekonomi kita yang pemerintah dan pemda bisa 171 persen"" kata Presiden.

""Yang BUMN 15 sampai 17 persen. Ini kan 2 persen lebih enggak usah cari ke mana-mana tidak usah cari investor kita diem saja tapi konsisten beli barang yang diproduksi pabrik industri UKM kita. Kok tidak kita lakukan. Bodoh sekali kita kalau tidak melakukan ini"" tambah Kepala Negara.

Presiden juga memaparkan situasi dunia yang serba tidak pasti akibat terdampak pandemi Covid-19 dan perang antara Rusia dan Ukraina. Akibatnya terjadi sejumlah dampak mulai dari krisis energi krisis pangan hingga inflasi yang dirasakan oleh banyak negara di dunia.

Oleh karenanya Jokowi menilai antipasi yang bisa dilakukan Indonesia yakni memanfaatkan APBN APBD hingga anggaran BUMN untuk mendorong pertumbuhan ekonomi dalam negeri.

Dari Berdikari sampai Bangga Buatan Indonesia

Pernyataan Presiden Joko Widodo tentang barang buatan dalam negeri yang dinilai kurang diminati sebenarnya bukan hanya kali ini terjadi. Walau Pemerintah silih berganti ajakan menggunakan produk dalam negeri terus bermunculan.

Presiden pertama Republik Indonesia Ir. Sukarno sudah menggaungkan soal kemandirian bangsa dalam hal kreasi produk dan kecintaan terhadap barang buatan lokal.

Sukarno pernah melontarkan kata Berdikari pada sekitar 1950-an. Berdikari artinya berdiri di atas kaki sendiri. Akronim itu disampaikan supaya bangsa Indonesia bangkit setelah meraih kemerdekaan dengan cara membuat dan menggunakan barang-barang buatan dalam negeri.

Menurut Sukarno jika bangsa Indonesia punya ketergantungan terhadap barang impor dan tidak berdaya dalam membangun dengan membuat sendiri dan membeli produk dalam negeri maka lambat laun negara akan hancur dengan sendirinya.

“Berdikari percaya kepada kekuatan sendiri tidak mengemis-ngemis” kata Sukarno dalam buku Kesaksian tentang Bung Karno 1945-1967 karya Mangil Matowidjojo.

Gaung berdikari perlahan meredup setelah kekuasaan Sukarno berakhir pada 12 Maret 1967 sebagai dampak dari kondisi inflasi dan perekonomian Indonesia yang terpuruk. Kondisi diperburuk oleh peristiwa Gerakan 30 September yang membuat kondisi politik Indonesia kacau balau.

Era Orde Baru yang dipimpin Suharto kemudian menggantikan Orde Lama. Semangat untuk mengajak masyarakat membuatn dan membeli barang produksi dalam negeri kembali muncul pada 1985.

Pada 1 sampai 31 Agustus 1985 pemerintah masa Orde Baru menggelar pameran bertajuk Pameran Produksi Indonesia (Indonesia Expo/PPI 1985) di kawasan Taman Monas dan Pekan Raya Jakarta (PRJ). Saat itu arena PRJ masih bertempat di Monas.

Pameran itu digelar bertepatan dengan peringatan 40 tahun kemerdekaan Indonesia.

Dikutip dari Kompas edisi 19 April 1985 Gubernur DKI Jakarta saat itu Soeprapto dan Menteri Perindustrian Hartarto Sastrosoenarto (ayah dari Menteri Koordinator Bidang Perekonomian Airlangga Hartarto) mengatakan PPI 1985 bertujuan membangkitkan kesadaran kecintaan semangat serta kebanggaan rakyat Indonesia dalam menggunakan produksi bangsa sendiri.

Selain itu PPI 1985 menjadi ajang promosi barang-barang buatan dalam negeri dan mendidik generasi muda serta meningkatkan jiwa kewiraswastaan dan kecintaan terhadap tanah air. Suharto yang langsung membuka pameran itu.

Lima tahun kemudian pemerintah Orde Baru kembali menggelar pameran serupa yakni PPI 1990. Pameran itu digelar pada 15 Agustus sampai 15 September 1990. Tujuannya pun masih tetap sama yakni membangkitkan kesadaran dan kecintaan masyarakat dalam menggunakan barang produksi bangsa sendiri.

Rezim Orde Baru tumbang pada Mei 1998 dan Suharto menyatakan berhenti dari jabatannya setelah gelombang aksi unjuk rasa. Di era reformasi gerakan cinta produk dalam negeri kembali dimunculkan.

Presiden Megawati Soekarnoputri pada 2003 kembali menggelar PPI yang bertepatan dengan peringatan Hari Kebangkitan Nasional (Harkitnas) ke-95. Kegiatan itu digelar di arena Pekan Raya Jakarta di Kemayoran Jakarta Pusat.

Ketika Indonesia sudah memasuki tahun keenam krisis ekonomi. Menurut Menteri Komunikasi dan Informasi Syamsul Muarif meski dalam kondisi krisis ternyata apresiasi masyarakat terhadap barang-barang produksi dalam negeri belum nampak.

""Di negara-negara tetangga kecintaan pada produk dalam negeri merupakan suatu keniscayaan dalam proses penguatan perekonomian mereka"" kata Syamsul seperti dikutip dari Kompas edisi 20 Mei 2003.

Gerakan mencintai produk Indonesia kembali muncul pada 2009 di masa pemerintahan Presiden Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY).

Presiden SBY meresmikan kampanye cinta barang buatan dalam negeri bertajuk ""100% Cinta Indonesia"" beserta logo bersamaan dengan pameran kerajinan Inacraft yang digelar di Jakarta Convention Center 22 April 2009.

Presiden Joko Widodo turut menggencarkan kampanye untuk membeli barang buatan dalam negeri melalui program Bangga Buatan Indonesia (BBI). Program itu diluncurkan pada 14 Mei 2020 di tengah pandemi Covid-19. Tujuannya pun masih sama yakni kampanye nasional untuk mempromosikan produk-produk Indonesia. Pencanangan kampanye itu juga didukung dengan logo baru.

Russian steel giant Severstal has lost up to a third of its sales and could become the first major Russian company to default after invading Ukraine. This is stated in the editorial article of the American edition of The Wall Street Journal.

“The company's steel products are stuck in warehouses across Europe one of its overseas subsidiaries is left without money to pay employees and sales staff struggle to find new customers. A long-term relationship collapsed overnight and Western equipment - from computers to excavators - was suddenly banned ”writes the WSJ.

On Wednesday Europe's third-largest steelmaker failed to pay its debt despite having funds after Citigroup Inc. froze the payment of interest to investors on the company's bonds. Citigroup declined to comment on the move. Severstal did not default nor did bondholders or credit rating companies.

""Severstal used to be a respected company deeply integrated into the global trading system but now things are rapidly changing for the worse for them"" says David Kachot director of steel and raw materials research at Wood Mackenzie.

The EU imposed sanctions on Alexei Mordashov who owns a 77% stake in Severstal on February 28. Brussels said that Mr. Mordashov's media company actively supported Russia's destabilization of the situation in Ukraine and that he profited from doing business in Crimea.

Severstal executives first learned about the sanctions from the media and informed Mr. Mordashov who according to a person familiar with the situation was surprised by the EU's actions. After an overnight conversation with leaders Mr. Mordashov issued a statement that he was not close to politics and described the fighting in Ukraine as a tragedy.

“I have absolutely nothing to do with the current geopolitical tensions and I don’t understand why the EU has imposed sanctions against me” said Mr. Mordashov.

Even before the invasion European customers began avoiding Severstal as Russia built up its military forces on the border with Ukraine according to a source familiar with the situation. When Mr. Mordashov came under sanctions the number of cancellations began to increase.

According to a WSJ source one railway shipment of iron ore bound for Finland was stopped and turned around and steel destined for customers was stuck in Severstal warehouses in various countries including Poland the Netherlands and Germany.

Shortly thereafter industry consultants technology providers and Western banks told Severstal that they could no longer work with the company. Four foreign directors of the company have left its board including one who has worked at Severstal both as an executive director and a member of the board of directors for more than a decade.

Severstal warned at the time that it would soon be unable to send money to a subsidiary in Latvia that specializes in steel customization. If this company runs out of money its employees won't get paid.

A Russian steelmaker is facing a $12.6 million interest payment problem to bondholders. For several weeks its depository bank Citigroup did not say if it could pay back the money it held in a U.S. account on behalf of Severstal a source familiar with the matter said.

Citigroup later told Severstal that the company needed permission from the US Office of Foreign Assets Control to make the payment. Severstal stated that it intends to fulfill its obligations and will apply for any licenses necessary to make the payment.

“This is an extraordinary situation for us which arose through no fault of ours” says Alexander Shevelev CEO of Severstal in a comment. He emphasized that Severstal maintains a stable financial position and confirms its readiness and desire to fulfill obligations on debts. “We look forward to cooperation from our paying agent who like us must act in the interests of bondholders including both Russian and foreign residents” he added.

Even salaries paid to Severstal employees in Russia go through international financial institutions. For example Austrian Raiffeisen Bank International AG which said it was considering exiting the country is handling some of the company's payroll the source said.

Mr. Mordashov according to the WSJ ""dramatically fell out of favor"" with the United States. Just a year earlier it had aired on Bloomberg TV as a Russian response to the founder of Amazon.com Inc. Jeff Bezos. ""Severstal""",,,,,,,,,

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic UCB laid off all of its theater staff on both coasts in a move that many performers and staffers felt was handled poorly by co-founders Amy Poehler Matt Besser Matt Walsh and Ian Roberts. In April 2020 the UCB theater in Hell’s Kitchen and the UCB Training Center on Eighth Avenue shut down marking the end of an official space for UCB in New York. Eight months later in December 2020 the co-founders announced the closure of the Sunset Theater in Los Angeles. In a letter addressed to the UCB community they said that the organization was pursuing nonprofit status for its theater and school. The letter also stated that UCB would be working with Project Rethink an initiative launched by a group of veteran BIPOC performers; community members had also raised general concerns about mismanagement and systemic racism within UCB.

McAvoy told Deadline that there are many “great plans” for the relaunch of UCB. “Our first priority is to reopen theaters and training centers in Los Angeles and New York with diversity equality and inclusion front and center” he said. “The additional resources at our disposal will enable us to pay performers for stage time and enhance the UCB 4 Scholarship Program which will continue to aid underprivileged students.” Reportedly UCB’s new management will work with the Arts Consulting Group a third-party firm that has consulted the UCB community on diversity initiatives including the creation of an HR department and the formation of a committee to oversee and execute diversity equity and inclusion initiatives.

Project Rethink said in a statement that it encouraged UCB4 to hire the Arts Consulting Group in order to help UCB “become a safer and more inclusive theater.” The group added that over the past year it made significant progress toward creating a sustainable business model but said that “the landscape changed significantly” once the offer of a sale was on the table. According to Project Rethink Elysian Park Ventures expressed interest in collaboration. “We met earlier this year to discuss what a partnership might look like” the statement said. “But after a lot of consideration Project Rethink has decided to dissolve and step away from consulting with this new business venture. Best of luck to the new owners.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbm9ydGgtcGhpbGx5LXByb2dyYW0tcmV5Y2xlLXJldHVybmluZy1jaXRpemVucy_SAU1odHRwczovL3doeXkub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL25vcnRoLXBoaWxseS1wcm9ncmFtLXJleWNsZS1yZXR1cm5pbmctY2l0aXplbnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,North Philly program employs returning citizens for an environmental purpose,"PAR-Recycle Works provides training and therapies that include financial literacy digital literacy cognitive behavioral therapy conflict resolution mindfulness forklift operation and support in getting driver’s licenses. The idea is to set people up for success in their time with the organization which is usually six to nine months.

“It is a way for individuals to get their lives back after incarceration” PAR-Recycle Founder Maurice Jones said.

The United States incarcerates more of its population than any other country in the world. In Pennsylvania Philadelphia has the highest incarceration rate of any county and approximately 25000 people come back to the city every year from prison. Out of that 17500 end up going back to prison. U.S. Department of Justice statistics say that over 68% of those released from prison in the first three years will be reincarcerated.

“Being from the city understanding the city having an upbringing from the hood I know what it’s like. I’ve been a statistic I’ve been to jail and I know what people are faced with when they come home without support” said Jones.

A way to reduce recidivism is to help returning citizens become self-sufficient. Keeping them employed helps them to have a steady income while also building up their resumes and teaching skills.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbW9uZXkvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS90aGlzLWxpYy1sZWQtc2NoZW1lLW9mZmVycy1wZW5zaW9uLW9mLXJzOS0yNTAtcGVyLW1vbnRoLXRvLXNlbmlvci1jaXRpemVucy0xMTY0ODI5NTczNjc3Ni5odG1s0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9tb25leS9wZXJzb25hbC1maW5hbmNlL3RoaXMtbGljLWxlZC1zY2hlbWUtb2ZmZXJzLXBlbnNpb24tb2YtcnM5LTI1MC1wZXItbW9udGgtdG8tc2VuaW9yLWNpdGl6ZW5zL2FtcC0xMTY0ODI5NTczNjc3Ni5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This LIC-led scheme offers pension of Rs9250 per month to senior citizens. Check details | Mint,"There are numerous schemes available for senior citizens currently either be fixed deposits post office saving schemes tax-free bonds or other capital market instruments. Nowadays senior citizens can shop through their desirable saving schemes that offer an attractive rate of returns and ensures maximum security - and accordingly park their hard-earned money for a specific tenure. Unlike these deposits scheme there is one particular scheme that provides a pension after a lumpsum amount invested for a certain period of time. This would be LIC-led Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY) - which provides a fixed monthly pension for 10 years.

PMVVY is a pension scheme for senior citizens with a minimum age of 60 years. There is no maximum limit on elderly age. The scheme has a policy term of 10 years with a minimum pension of ₹1000 to maximum of ₹9250 per month for the entire term.

The scheme is available for investment till March 31 2023. However LIC is offering a guaranteed 7.4% per annum for financial year FY22 on this scheme for 10 years if purchased before March 31 2022.

On its website LIC says ""For Financial Year 2021-22 the Scheme shall provide an assured pension of 7.40% p.a. payable monthly. This assured rate of pension shall be payable for the full policy term of 10 years for all the policies purchased till 31st March 2022.""

The largest insurer in India LIC is the sole authorizer to operate this scheme.

The scheme can be purchased with payment of a lumpsum amount. However a pensioner will have a choice to either select the amount of pension or the purchase price. A maximum amount of ₹15 lakh can be invested in this scheme. That means if an elderly spouse plans to opt for the scheme then both can invest up to ₹30 lakh and earn a fixed monthly pension of about ₹18500 for 10 years in one family.

The maximum pension plan in the scheme is - Rs9250 per month ₹27750 per quarter ₹55500 per half-year; and ₹111000 per year.

Under the scheme the first installment of pension is payable after 1 year 6 months 3 months or 1 month from the date of purchase of the same depending on the mode of pension payment i.e. yearly half-yearly quarterly or monthly respectively.

Similarly depending upon the different modes of pension payments the scheme will offer from 7.4% to a maximum 7.66% interest rate per annum. For instance a senior citizen can earn a 7.4% rate on monthly instalments while the interest rate is 7.45% and 7.52% on quarterly and half-yearly instalments. Further for yearly instalments the scheme offers 7.66% per annum.

PMVVY interest rate is better than compared to many bank fixed deposits and also post office saving schemes. The government-owned Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) gives a 7.4% interest rate while SBI gives a 6.30% interest rate to senior citizens on their FDs below ₹2 crore on 5 years to 10 years tenor. Also ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank offer a 6.35% interest rate to senior citizens on 5 years 1 day to 10 years tenure.

To invest in PMVVY the pension payment shall be through NEFT or Aadhaar Enabled Payment System. The purchase of the policy under this Government-subsidised scheme requires unique Aadhaar number validation.

There are many benefits available under PMVVY. On survival of the Pensioner during the policy term of 10 years pension in arrears (at the end of each period as per mode chosen) will be payable. However on the death of the Pensioner during the policy term of 10 years the purchase price shall be refunded to the beneficiary. Meanwhile there is also a maturity benefit available on the scheme where on survival of the pensioner to the end of the policy term of 10 years purchase price along with final pension installment shall be payable.

Also there is a loan facility available under the scheme however after the completion of 3 policy years. The maximum loan granted shall be 75% of the Purchase Price. Notably the rate of interest to be charged for the loan amount will be determined at periodic intervals.

Furthermore PMVVY allows premature exit during the policy term under exceptional circumstances like the Pensioner requiring money for the treatment of any critical/terminal illness of self or spouse. The Surrender Value payable in such cases shall be 98% of the purchase price.

Jin Young Ko who has won six of her last 10 LPGA Tour starts continued setting records on Friday at the JTBC Classic presented by Barbasol. Ko fired a 1-under par 71 to enter the weekend at 8-under par and tied for fourth three shots behind leader Nanna Koerstz Madsen.

In so doing Ko continued her rounds-under-par streak. Thirty-two consecutive outings have seen Ko post a red number an all-time LPGA Tour record. The last time Ko shot even or over par was the Amundi Evian Championship last July.

But this was the first time in 17 rounds going back to October 18 that Ko has put up a number that did not begin with a 6. On Thursday in Carlsbad she extended the all-time LPGA Tour record she already held for most consecutive rounds in the sixties. The mark is now 16.

The only person likely to break it soon is Jin Young Ko herself who will start counting again this weekend.

“I feel like people don’t give her enough credit for how dominant she is and how consistent she is” Cheyenne Knight said after watching Ko’s first two rounds in the states since she won the CME Group Tour Championship last November. “She always strives to be better. She’s definitely someone that I look up to. And I feel like she’s never fully satisfied. How good she is in every aspect of her game is incredibly impressive.”

It’s extraordinary when you dive deeper into the numbers. If it wasn’t for a 71 in the first round of the BMW Ladies Championship in Korea last fall the consecutive rounds in the 60s would have been 30.

Counting Friday’s 1-under par performance in her last 11 starts Ko is 151 under par.

In that stretch she has made birdie on just under 30% of the holes she’s played. Think about that. On three different continents in all kinds of weather over two different seasons in close to six months’ time Ko has birdied almost one out of every three holes she’s played.

She’s also carded 13 bogey-free rounds and is hitting more than 80% of her greens in regulation an average of 14.5 greens hit per round.

“The stats are very impressive” Stacy Lewis said on Friday in Carlsbad. “She’s probably the best ball striker we’ve seen in a really long time. As long as she can stay healthy I think the sky’s the limit for her.

“I don’t think people realize how hard it is when you take time off and then come right back into it and keep doing what you’re doing. She’ll take two or three weeks off and it’s like she never missed a beat. Most people it takes a round or two to get back in the groove. But she just seems to go right back into it. And it doesn’t matter what style of golf course it is which goes back to her being a good ball striker. A good ball striker can play on any golf course.”

Knight agreed on the ball-striking front comparing Ko to one of the all-time greats. “I don’t anyone has seen this since Annika (Sorenstam)” Knight said. “We’re just trying to keep up with her. I hope people fully grasp what she is doing. It’s very Tiger-esque. And I feel like nobody really has that on any tour right now except for Jin Young.

“I hope a lot of people tune in and see how good she is.”

Hye-Jin Choi had another take on why Ko is so dominant at the moment. “I feel like she has a strong mind” Choi said.

But Choi did agree with others on one thing when it comes to Jin Young Ko. “She is on a different level” she said. “I really admire her.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vMjQ3d2FsbHN0LmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXJlcG9ydC8yMDIyLzAzLzI2L3RoaXMtY29tcGFueS1oYXMtdGhlLW1vc3QtcHJvZml0cy1wZXItZW1wbG95ZWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Company Has the Most Profits Per Employee,"This Company Has the Most Profits Per Employee Scott Olson / Getty Images News via Getty Images

Companies with high profits and revenue per employee are presumed to be the most successful. Alphabet Microsoft and Meta Platforms owner of Facebook are such companies. These tech companies are among the largest in the United States based on revenue and they are among the youngest large companies. Several were founded in the past 25 years. However a group of relatively small companies leads the list of highest profit per employee.

Data for the recent “Profit per Employee” research paper from software company Tipalti came from the Fortune 500. The paper examined 914 major companies most of which made a profit per employee in the last year. Only 238 reported a loss per employee. The company that has the most profits per employee is Air Lease. The company reported $516 million in profits or $4.3 million per employee.

Air Lease with an employee count of 120 buys passenger planes and leases them to airlines. The process allows carriers that do not have capital access to planes. Air Lease makes its profit largely off the interest it charges these carriers. The company was hurt by the trouble with the aviation industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic but its financials have started to recover.

When the company announced its 2021 results John L. Plueger chief executive officer and president commented: “We had a strong fourth quarter and second half of 2021 that benefited from continuing airline industry recovery as seen in our cash collections operating metrics fleet expansion and record lease placement.”

Air Lease owns 474 planes that it leases to 118 customers in 60 countries. The company is based in Los Angeles. (See if Air Lease is also among the 50 best companies to work for.)

To find the 50 companies with the most profits per employee 24/7 Wall St. reviewed Tipalti’s “Profit per Employee” research paper. Very few of the companies with the highest profit per employee are large tech companies. Meta is highest among these ranking 11th with a profit of nearly $500000 per employee based on over 58000 workers. Several financial firms are ahead of Meta.

Mortgage giant Fannie Mae has profit of $1.5 million per employee based on 7700 workers. This places it second on the list. The third is private equity firm KKR at $1.3 million per employee based on 1583 workers. (Find out if any of the companies on this list were also among the most innovative companies in 2021.)

Russia and its giant hydrocarbon reserves which had been locked up behind the Iron Curtain became available to the world. Russia came to be seen as a reliable supplier. It became the world’s largest natural gas exporter. Of the 98 million barrels of oil (crude condensate and refined products) that moved around the world every day 7.5 million was supplied by Russia alone.But that was before the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin attacked Ukraine at a time when the global energy market was tight. He expected Western nations to protest but not act. However the force of public opinion has compelled them to rethink their dependence on Russian oil and gas.The US Japan and South Korea have stopped or cut imports of Russian oil. The UK which meets 8% of its demand with Russian oil has said it will do so by the end of the year. Demand for a ban is getting louder in the Eurozone. Trading houses are finding it hard to get buyers for shiploads of Russian oil and oil loading at Russian docks has fallen by 2 million barrels per day. So how will the Ukraine war change the global energy map?In an article for The Economist American energy expert Daniel Yergin predicts Russia will be a “reduced energy power” after the war. “Although it remains a necessary supplier for now its role is certain to diminish.”Yergin is not hedging. Popular sentiment about the war aside governments have to take a pragmatic view. After two years of the pandemic the world is battling high inflation. It is not a good time to ban supplies from a country that produces almost as much oil as Saudi Arabia. Already as a result of sanctions on Russia oil prices have rocketed to an eight-year high and gas prices are up by 40%.Then there’s the nature of Russian petroleum exports. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) Russia is the world’s largest exporter of oil (crude condensates and liquid products) and the second largest exporter of crude after Saudi Arabia. It is not possible to replace the commodities and raw material it provides at short notice without causing shortages and price rise.Consider Europe for example. It needs to stock up on oil and gas before winter but many European refineries are partly owned by Russian companies and are connected with the Druzhba oil pipeline. If the pipeline is shut oil for these refineries may have to be brought by sea but Europe’s oil import terminals may not be able to cope with the additional shipments immediately. The alternative — importing additional oil and gas from the Middle East or the US — will be costly in comparison to piped supplies.What is likely Yergin says is that Russian gas sales to Europe will taper over the next five years. In that time expect Europe to build more renewable energy capacity as a security measure. France will build more nuclear plants. Electric vehicle sales will shoot up but in the short term coal use could also rise.Of course Russia will then try to stay in the game by increasing its supplies to China India and other Asian countries. China the destination for 20% of Russian oil exports and India which imported 3% of its demand from Russia last year have already ramped up their purchase of Russian crude. And despite banning Russian crude Japan may still import Sokol crude from the Sakhalin-I project where a Japanese company Sodeco has a stake.However Russia will face other challenges in diverting its petroleum exports to the east. Arranging transport and negotiating deals that do not involve the US dollar are big hurdles. If Europe turns to the Middle East for supplies driving up prices for their regular customers India and China both Asian powers could turn to discounted Russian oil in a big way provided the suppliers take care of shipping and insurance.So eventually the oil streams of the world will change direction. However a prolonged Ukraine conflict could hurt Russian output as Western oil firms abandon their investments in the country and the fear of sanctions prevents new buyers from taking over.So expect oil to remain on the boil unless Iranian and Venezuelan barrels start flowing but that does not look imminent either. For now Russia will remain the pivot of the world energy pendulum.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9yZW5ld2FibGVzL2JhdHRlcnktbWFrZXItY3lnbmktdG8taW52ZXN0LTQwLW1pbGxpb24taW4tbmV3LXBsYW50L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkwNDU0Mjk0LmNtc9IBggFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy9iYXR0ZXJ5LW1ha2VyLWN5Z25pLXRvLWludmVzdC00MC1taWxsaW9uLWluLW5ldy1wbGFudC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTA0NTQyOTQuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Battery maker Cygni to invest $40 million in new plant,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday justified the hikes in fuel prices thrice in the last four days saying that the oil prices had gone up within the international market owing to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine which was beyond the Indian government's control. Speaking at a session titled ""New India New Manifesto-Sab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas "" at the ABP Network's inaugural 'Ideas of India ' summit here on Friday Gadkari Minister for Road Transport and Highways also said that ""Sometimes Hindutva is projected in a wrong way.""""In India 80 per cent of the oil is imported. Amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine the oil prices have spiralled up within international markets and we can not do anything about that"" he said when asked about the high petrol and diesel prices and how the government was planning to the issue.The minister said that he has been making a pitch for making India self-reliant since 2004 ""with which we need to make our own fuel"" while laying stress on the need for developing indigenous energy generation capabilities.Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 80 paise a litre each on Friday the third increase in four days as oil firms recoup losses from holding rates during the period prior to the recently-concluded assembly elections.These hikes are the steepest single-day rise since the daily price revision began in June 2017.With three increases beginning March 22 petrol and diesel prices have gone up by Rs 2.40 a litre.A record 137-day hiatus in rate revision ended on March 22 with an 80 paise per litre increase in rates and similar hikes have followed in the subsequent days.The prices had been on a freeze since November 4 ahead of the assembly elections in five states -- a period during which the cost of crude oil soared by USD 30 per barrel.""India will soon have a Rs 40000 crore ethanol methanol and bio-ethanol production economy reducing our dependence on petroleum imports"" he said.Leading car and two-wheeler manufacturers in India are working on developing products with flex-fuel engines which will be launched in the coming months he mentioned.Highlighting the manufacturing capabilities of India in developing battery and green hydrogen technology he said ""The prices of IC (internal combustion) engines and electric vehicles will be on par in India in the next two years. We are working on developing green hydrogen production indigenously in the country by harnessing it from sources like sewage water and biomass.""Emphasising that the BJP does not ""accept"" any discrimination based on caste religion language or gender he said ""Sometimes Hindutva is projected in a wrong way. The basic principle of Hindutva is justice for all and appeasement of none.""According to Gadkari in the BJP's philosophy ""nationalism"" is the primary focus.""The second focus lies in good governance and development while the third most important pillar is Antyodya  under which we try to uplift those who belong to socially and economically backward classes"" he said.Stating that ""the Supreme Court has rightly described Hindutva as a way of life"" Gadkari said that religion and community are different from each other.""So sometimes Hindutva is interpreted as anti-Christian and anti-Muslim. In the last seven years (since the Modi-led NDA government came into power) none of the Central government schemes have been discriminatory against anyone. There was no communal approach in our schemes"" he said.On the non-BJP states not declaring the movie 'The Kashmir Files' tax-free unlike some BJP ruled states he said ""The Indian Constitution has a Federal structure. Every state government has a right either to make or not to make a movie tax-free. We respect that.""On being asked about the lack of a strong opposition in the country Gadkari said ""I want to tell the opposition that in politics no defeat is ultimate.""He quoted former US president Richard Nixon  ""A man is not finished when he is defeated but a man is finished when he quits.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2JlbmdhbHVydS9zYXZlLWVuZXJneS1paXQtYi1wcm9mLWRyaXZlcy1ob21lLW1lc3NhZ2UtdXNpbmctc29sYXItYnVzL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkwNDY3MTg1LmNtc9IBigFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2JlbmdhbHVydS9zYXZlLWVuZXJneS1paXQtYi1wcm9mLWRyaXZlcy1ob21lLW1lc3NhZ2UtdXNpbmctc29sYXItYnVzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MDQ2NzE4NS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Save energy: IIT-Bengaluru professor drives home message using solar bus,"Prof Chetan Singh Solanki began travelling in his bus-turned-home with facilities such as TV electric stove and AC last year and has gone to more than seven states

BENGALURU: Picture this: A bus with all the equipment one uses at home — AC air cooler electric stove laptop-charging unit television — completely powered by solar energy. This isn’t a prototype project but the completely functional bus-turned-home of IIT-Bombay professor Chetan Singh Solanki Solanki who has pledged not to go home until 2030 and live and travel in this solar bus gave a demonstration of the vehicle at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) on Saturday.The bus is fitted with 3.2kW solar panels and 6kWh battery storage. It has a 3kVA inverter and the engine runs on diesel.Solanki started living in his bus last year and has since travelled from Bhopal to more than seven states before reaching Bengaluru on March 18. He will travel to Kerala and Tamil Nadu between March 29 and April 30. “I’m travelling to create awareness and inspire action. This bus is an example of how you can run your life on solar energy” Solanki said adding that using lesser energy moving closer to one’s workplace and using bicycles can all help conserve energy.Pointing to the ticking climate clock he said there is an urgent need to use resources mindfully and not pollute. “I will not visit my family but my family can visit me periodically and spend time here in the bus.

The new brand identity represents an innovative reimagining of the iconic soft drink brand that has been popular in the Chinese market for 38 years.

Sprite's refreshed look aims to give China's young consumers exactly what they want by providing a youthful modern and bold appearance and expanded choice via the all-new Sprite no sugar portfolio.

The design also makes Sprite products more easily identifiable on the shelf. Accompanying the branding is a new no sugar mint flavor as well as no sugar fiber among Sprite's range of products.

China is Sprite's biggest market globally in terms of sales volume. Being ""iconic"" is in Sprite's brand DNA and so it always keeps up with the latest consumer trends and continuously innovates its product range.

""Sprite is an iconic mega-brand in China loved by consumers of all ages and from all walks of life. I feel incredibly proud that we are the first market globally to launch this new bold brand identity together with a range of innovative premium no sugar choices"" said Ella Liu vice-president of marketing Greater China at The Coca-Cola Company Sprite's parent company.

""We have reinvented this iconic brand to refresh a new generation of consumers in China together with all of our existing consumers"" Liu said.

Youthful design

The new brand identity is an almost complete redesign of nearly every aspect of Sprite's appearance ranging from the iconic new Chinese logo to bottle labeling bottle caps and secondary packaging. The branding was co-designed by the company's China marketing team together with their global counterparts.

By highlighting iconic brand elements while eliminating unnecessary details the new design aims to make Sprite stand out even more and make a bold statement to a generation of consumers who express themselves more boldly than ever.

""The new brand identity for Sprite is sharp and clear－it cuts through the noise and conveys confidence as an iconic brand"" said Rapha Abreu global design director at The Coca-Cola Company.

""The new identity is bold and embraces the audacity of self-expression by being dynamic distinctive and modern.""

Jasmin Vinculado global sparkling flavors president at The Coca-Cola Company said ""In line with values we believe and Generation Z consumers identify with the new Sprite brand identity stands for boldness and clarity.""

Generation Z refers to those born between 1995 and 2009.

""We are confident that fans in China will enjoy this new look and will continue to stay even more refreshed and cool whenever they face heat with a 'new look' Sprite"" Vinculado said.

Landmark launch

With a history of 38 years in China Sprite has long been loved by generations of Chinese consumers. While celebrating its heritage Sprite also wants to add greater emphasis on its appeal directly to young people. By engaging young consumers through a multichannel approach directly relevant to their lives and interests Sprite aims to reveal itself as the cool and cutting-edge choice for this moment and for the future.

To announce the news of Sprite's latest look to as many customers as possible and spark their curiosity and excitement the brand has rolled out an extensive advertising and marketing campaign. This campaign has been led by the CEOs of the two bottling partners and features promotional trade activities and livestreams introducing a vast range of special promotions for Sprite fans across the nation.

Consumers can hardly miss the new branding with its adorning billboards promoted in pop-up stores in major shopping centers and appearing in multimedia and social media. With this exciting launch across China the new-look Sprite is set to capture the imagination and drive excitement among both longtime fans and a new generation of cool young consumers.

By building a unique connection with Generation Z the launch of Sprite's new brand identity is just part of Sprite's wider strategy to define itself as the beverage for all those who pursue coolness trendiness and cutting-edge lifestyles.

Sprite's latest launch in China sets the tone and is the precursor for further rollouts in the company's other global markets.

The Coca-Cola Company made the splashy announcement on all of their social media platforms Friday night - the same time Young went off for 33 points and 15 assists in a 121-110 over the Golden State Warriors.

The 15-second promo shows a block of ice being chiseled into a work of art portraying Young and two bottles of Sprite. The announcer says ""Sprite's best when it's cold. That's why we signed the coldest player in basketball. Welcome to Team Sprite. Take a bow Trae Young.""

I wrote in December that 2021 will serve as Young's villain origin story. But 2022 will mark the beginning of the phenom point guard getting his flowers. This is far from Young's first national ad campaign. He had a Christmas Day commercial with State Farm he has the best-selling signature basketball shoe with Adidas and is set to appear in a Netflix movie starring Adam Sandler.

Sprite knows what they are doing by snatching up Young. Not only is he balling out on the court (most days he leads the league in total points and assists) but the younger generation of fans love him. Little kids everywhere flock to Hawks games across the country in hopes of getting an autograph or maybe even a pair of game-worn shoes.

For reasons beyond my comprehension Young continues to receive hate and disrespect. Whatever that's fine because he seems to channel it into his game better than any current NBA player. Trae Young is officially a superstar and a household name - there is no looking back. In his words ""another day another opportunity.""

Or at least that was the prevailing mood at Derbion this weekend as hundreds of shoppers came down to the new Frozen Kiosks stand in the shopping centre to get their hands on the refreshing treat.

The new kiosk opened last Saturday and according to its managers it has had a better than expected launch. It offers six flavours of the iced drink: blue raspberry and cherry Tango cherry and plain Coca-Cola and lemon and strawberry Fanta. On March 26 the stand even welcomed ""Ned Sheran"" an Ed Sheeran lookalike who drew hundreds of fans down to get a picture while he handed out slushies.

But with temperatures in Derby hitting 20C on Saturday and my sad memories of being left with just a rather disappointing cup of ice when I had slushies as a child I went to put their products to the test. I bought three medium slushies: Electric Lemon Fanta Cherry Tango and plain Coca-Cola because after all sometimes the old ways are the best.

They cost £4 each and I was given a full cup with large slushies costing £4.50 and a ""mega cup"" which you get to keep setting you back £6.50. Wanting to get the full effect in the lovely weather I headed down to the gardens opposite Derby City Council's HQ to take my first sip.

Here is what I thought of each one:

Coca-Cola - 6/10

I would describe this in football terms as akin to Chelsea. Always decent and sometimes the best if the other options are poor but usually slips just below the leader. It is literally Coca-Cola as a slushie which is of course nice. And if you love Coca-Cola anyway then this is for you but it won't be mind-blowing.

Compared to the other two options while certainly refreshing it was a bit plain. If you can only get that one then you won't be disappointed but there are perhaps better options.

Cherry Tango - 8/10

Right now we're talking. I really enjoyed every aspect of this one in terms of flavour packing a real cherry punch and also a slight fizz.

This was a refreshing drink which gave me a big zap of sweetness. It is actually sugar-free as is the blue raspberry Tango but it definitely cheered me up and made me look forward to summer more than I already am.

It did fall down on one point which is that it made my tongue go dark red. That is the one factor that knocks it down to second but a solid choice if I ever saw one.

Lemon Fanta - 10/10

Seeing as Fanta limón was the drink of choice during those holidays to Spain I enjoyed as a kid I had high hopes for this. I was not disappointed in any sense.

While the yellow colour could be matched only by the Trent Barton Sixes bus that went past as I was drinking it I am a big fan of lemon and lime flavoured things anyway.

The Fanta slushie options are not completely sugar-free but have low amounts of sugar according to Frozen Kiosks which owns the stand and others around the country. Like the cherry Tango this gave me a lovely sweet kick and took me back to another memory of my childhood caravanning with my grandparents on the Norfolk coast.

While I may be biased this one was definitely my favourite.

What the bosses had to say

Customers can ask for a mix-and-match of flavours. The kiosk will be in Derbion for at least five years and Frozen Kiosks plans to roll out more across the East Midlands after opening its first in Cardiff with more flavours to be added in future.

Co-founder and director Kyle Braithwaite said: ""The plan is to have seven open by the end of the year and we will grow organically next year with more locations opening. The key is all about the brand and quality of what we have got to offer.

""It has its own cult following especially Tango Ice Blast and while you have a lot of retailers opening it's a niche product. Our core audience is teenagers up to people who are about 30. It's not a kid's thing and not an adult thing it's based around people like university students.""

While many of us who have tried slushies before may have had the disappointment of sucking all the syrup out and being left with a cup of ice that doesn't happen with Frozen Kiosks' machines Kyle says. That is because its machines mix the right amount of syrup water and also add in some carbon dioxide to give the drink its distinctive fizz which also means that the ingredients don't separate.

Garry Buckle who is another co-founder and director says that the flavours will change with the seasons. He said: ""When you're a kid you always want one when you're by the seaside and it stays with you. It's just a product that especially in a warm environment is just refreshing and nice.""

The kiosk currently has four staff which will increase to six if demand grows. The stand can be found on the ground floor in Derbion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zY29yZS9uby1tb3JlLWNva2UtdG8tcXVlbmNoLXRoZS10aGlyc3QtaW4tc2Nob29sLWZvb3RiYWxsLTM3NjA4NjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No more Coke to quench the thirst in school football,"Copa Coca-Cola has been the heartbeat of school football. In fact it is rightly referred to as the ‘Schools World Cup’. Yet for the first time in almost three decades the premier schools competition will be held under a new name – the USSSA Boys Football.

Coca-Cola’s sponsorship was the longest sports contract in Uganda.

The Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association (USSSA) is yet to announce a new sponsor for the boys’ tournament that will be held in Arua although the girls’ tournament will be held under the banner of Fresh Dairy.

“It is going to be a tough test for the organisers in Arua. But I hope USSSA have learned a lot from the high standards we have been used to for the past 20 years” Nimrod Kintu head coach of Amus College in Bukedea says.

‘Pay to play’

Organisers of what came to be called as Copa Coca-Cola Schools Championship have been offering schools perks including meals soft drinks and uniforms (for teams that reach the quarterfinals).

All teams needed was transport to the venue as Coca-Cola’s sponsorship catered for the rest. Yet for now the tournament will become more expensive.

Copa has been a big tournament for obvious reasons. It has been held in more than 60 countries attracting more than one million participants annually.

What started in Zimbabwe in 1988 was formalised under Copa Coca-Cola in 1998 when it was first launched in Mexico. The aim of Copa Coca-Cola is to create the world’s largest and most inclusive football grassroots programme.

With the approach now towards ‘pay to play’ some schools could be in a fix.

To subscribe to the USSSA tournament a school contributes Shs38000 for each player per day for the duration of the tournament. To field 18 players for 14 days a school now needs Shs9.5 for subscription.

“The tournament will obviously become expensive for many teams” Yusuf Kasirye head teacher of Namagabi SS Kayunga said in a recent interaction.

Building the wall

Patrick Okanya president of the USSSA says they hope to have nailed down a sponsorship by the time the tournament kicks off next month.

The schools’ football fiesta started in 1986 as the UTV Cup and was held in Kampala for seven years until it became a national competition in 1993. For the next three years the tournament would be called the National Post-Primaries until the famous 1996 tournament in Masaka when Coca-Cola fully funded the competition.

“Coca-Cola’s involvement opened many windows of opportunity” says Kennedy Mutenyo the former promotions manager of soft drink company.

For 26 years Mutenyo was the face of Coca-Cola at the schools championship.

“It became a universal tournament with fairness at the forefront” he says explaining that before 1999 the organising committee used to invite teams that had not qualified.

“We made sure that the only way to participate was for you to win in your district” Mutenyo said.

The tournament was one of the most highly rated youth competitions in Uganda which started competitive regional tournaments in 2014.

“Through Copa we built a critical mass and local clubs such as KCCA and Vipers started believing in young players” Mutenyo said.

Before 1993 repeaters were a common problem in the tournament.

David Katende Ssemakula the assistant general secretary of the National Council of Sports (NCS) has always been critical of schools that instead turn their school teams into football clubs.

“Repeating a class is not a crime. But instead of students playing football some had become footballers in the schools. They were repeaters on the pitch. It used to undermine young players” he said.

When repeaters were eroded private schools took the championship seriously and started offering sports bursaries.

With Coke gone Fresh Dairy has made some inroads and is already sponsoring the girls tournament.

In part the current crop of young players began their journey into football. Mike ‘Sulaiman’ Mutyaba for instance was used by Standard High Zzana as a 15-year-old in 1996 something unheard of before. Later others such as Allan Okello Julius Poloto were spotted.

Apart from building a talent pool that would be used for national teams Copa Coca-Cola platform has also trained referees. The organisers insist on Fufa sending upcoming referees and most have risen to the top after the tournaments.

Rule of law

If there is anything that made the tournament tick it was the uncompromising leadership under Raphael Bwire Ouma former Old Kampala SS head teacher.

Copa is reputed for fair application of the rules and equality before the rules. But even then they struggled to put an end to the use of non-bona fide players.

Previously Mutenyo suggested the use of photos on examination slips could help solve the challenge yet up to now many schools go ahead to forge result slips for students.

But Mutenyo hints that not all members of the executive committee were committed to combating mercenaries.

“The country pays heavily because you are training people how to become corrupt. Corruption starts in schools. Students are taught how to get away with fraud by altering names age or impersonating other students” he says."

Arnold a 6-foot-1 quarterback in the 2023 class who is committed to Oklahoma shined during the Elite 11 Dallas Regional and was one of two quarterbacks who earned on invite to the Elite 11 Finals later this summer.

“It felt great” Arnold said of getting the invite to the Elite 11 Finals. “It’s something I’ve looked up to for a while now watching Justin Fields and Trevor Lawrence a while ago. I felt at first I started a little slow and kind of picked it up moving on and by the end I was throwing pretty good.”

Competing against the likes of Baylor commit Austin Novosad Texas Tech pledge Jake Strong and other Power 5 quarterback prospects Arnold’s arm strength and accuracy stood out.

Arnold’s arm endured as well as the pop was still on his throws well into the nearly four-hour event something Arnold told SI Sooners he was cognizant of coming into Sunday.

“At the beginning too I was trying to save my arm and not burn myself out” said Arnold “because I knew our last station was the Pro Day.”

Novosad earned the highest grade at the Pro Day throwing station but Arnold put in a solid performance as well alongside the future Baylor Bear.

Arnold’s performance at the Elite 11 Regional matched the expectations the event organizers had coming into the weekend Elite 11 Director Brian Stumpf said.

Ryan Chapman / SI Sooners “First and foremost we always go off the tape in the fall” Stumpf said on Sunday. “What they do in pads is most important. Ryan Chapman / SI Sooners “… (Arnold’s) a dual-threat guy he’s not just a pocket guy. He can move the chains on the tough third and shorts if they needed to.” Ryan Chapman / SI Sooners Stumpf said the performances Arnold put on tape for Denton Guyer High School are what initially led to the Oklahoma commit getting an on-the-spot invite to the Elite 11 Finals and his performance on Sunday only confirmed the talent he possesses.

On top of having a strong and accurate arm Stumpf said Arnold also impressed in the physical testing portion of the event.

“He tested pretty well today” Stumpf said. “I think he was in the lower 4.7’s so one of the better times in terms of the testing we did at the beginning of the day.”

Arnold stood out amongst a class of talented quarterbacks on Sunday something that has become standard for the Elite 11’s yearly stop in Dallas Stumpf said.

“This was a strong regional last year with three invites on the spot” he said. “Really strong group again today and he was right there at the top of it.”

Now Arnold will focus on finishing his baseball season before turning his attention to the Elite 11 Finals later this summer.

The exact date and location for the event is still to be announced but the Finals are likely to occur toward the end of June on the West Coast.

The company plans to emerge as the largest food and FMCG company in the country with the merging of food businesses under Ruchi Soya. According to the company’s founder yoga guru Baba Ramdev who is also the face of the company this will create a formidable player in the FMCG segment and would even outperform the largest FMCG companies in the country.

In an interaction with Moneycontrol Baba Ramdev also claims that the FMCG companies such as HUL ITC Dabur Colgate-Palmolive have tried to replicate Patanjali Ayurved’s success with natural products but have not gained any ground. He also discusses the path ahead for Ruchi Soya and Patanjali Ayurved the focus categories and the reasons for the merger.

Please note the text has been edited and translated for brevity and clarity.

You are often heard talking about making Patanjali Ayurved and Ruchi Soya the top FMCG company in the country? What is the roadmap you have set for this?

For Ruchi Soya we will be focusing on four portfolios. First is its traditional oil business which has refined oil and now we are also introducing natural virgin oil to it in a big way. This will be meant for the premium segment. The refined oil portfolio already targets masses and now with natural virgin oil we will reach out to the premium segment. And on top of this Patanjali Ayurved’s edible oil and cow ghee products will also be merged into Ruchi Soya making it the number 1 oil and ghee company in the country. So the traditional business will get a boost from Patanjali’s portfolio. Our ghee brand itself is over a thousand crore brand and we are a leading brand in virgin oil mustard oil rice bran oil.

It will be difficult to make Ruchi Soya the top FMCG company in the food and FMCG space just based on its offerings so we decided to transfer the entire food portfolio to Ruchi Soya which is a big thing. Our food portfolio has very strong brand equity and sells on the basis of brand trust. We house popular products such as chyawanprash medicated juices etc. Our food portfolio is about Rs 5000 crore and in the next two-three years will clock a revenue of Rs 10000 crore. We are building the segment to target masses as well as premium consumers. We have introduced low unit products for masses. Ruchi Soya also houses our biscuit portfolio already which has products like milk biscuits and ‘atta’ biscuits.

The third category is nutraceuticals which are purely premium products. We are selling multivitamins iron whey protein in this segment and have shaken the dominance of MNCs in it. With the introduction of natural and organic products in the segment the chemical animal-derived and synthetic products that were being sold have been replaced. We have made history with the acceptance that we have gained for Nutrela Nutraceuticals just in the nine months of its launch. The fourth pillar is of palm plantation. This has huge potential and will be spread over lakhs of acres of land. It will help in bringing down the country’s dependency on exports for palm oil.

From next year onwards you will see all these categories contributing a large share to Ruchi Soya’s business. We will see the contribution of nutraceuticals and food grow and the results of palm plantation will show in the next three-five years. Overall we have strong brand equity and we plan to pay off the debt of the company after the FPO in one go and improve our working capital. We have a big portfolio and a strong customer base I doubt any other company has it.

But why have you decided to merge the food businesses under Ruchi Soya now?

You have to understand first of all it would have been difficult for any other company to launch an FPO amidst the current environment of distress share market volatility and the threat of a possible third world war. But we are always up for challenges. People dare when they have a good track record perform a vision for the future and are confident.

However we realised that investors were a bit confused. We were receiving concerns about how the two companies – Ruchi Soya and Patanjali – would be positioned. So to clear these doubts….also the investors will benefit when the food business is transferred. Benefitting investors means our company will grow and hence we decided to merge the food businesses.

How are you merging the distribution of Ruchi Soya and Patanjali Ayurved?

Like how we had done with our biscuit portfolio for which distributors were completely different. We transferred the entire business to Ruchi Soya along with distribution and manufacturing and put a non-compete agreement in place. So all the businesses that we will transfer to Ruchi Soya we will transfer their manufacturing distribution too. We anyway have a separate team for food and non-food.

What will be the focus areas for Patanjali Ayurved going ahead?

Patanjali has four portfolios. One is dental care under Dant Kanti we have a large hair care portfolio under Kesh Kanti and have a good market share in the segment; we also have a strong portfolio of skincare and home care products. Take our aloe vera gel it is a segment we created and we have about 70-80 percent market share in it. Several companies right from Hindustan Unilever to Emami tried to get into the segment but their products could not gain acceptance in the market. We plan to make it bigger going ahead. Similarly in home care our herbal dish wash bar is a category leader.



In medicine we do not have a competition. We have created cures for lifestyle diseases. There is no company parallel to Patanjali Wellness. We have established an integrated practice through naturopathy.

Most people in our country think charity should only be done by saints and corporates should focus on business but when you serve the nation then crores of people trust you.

You had gained market share with the launch of Dant Shakti in the oral care segment. Have you been able to increase your share in it? Also which are similar emerging segments for Patanjali Ayurved?

Our dental care brand is over a thousand crores and now we have launched Patanjali Sensitive which again is a market of over Rs 1000 crore. We think we can gain a market share of 25-50 percent in this segment too. So we have a huge potential in this segment.

In haircare Kesh Kanti Advanced has been launched which is bigger than Indulekha. We should be able to clock Rs 1000 crores with this brand in the next three-four years. If you evaluate each brand in terms of the capital market then each brand of ours is worth Rs 50000 crore. We are focusing hugely on medicine.

We have big plans for Patanjali going ahead. First let’s make Ruchi Soya big and then we go ahead with this too.

Several other companies are now launching natural products and you are not the only company positioned in the ‘natural segment’ anymore. Colgate-Palmolive for instance has also rolled out a toothpaste based on natural ingredients. Similarly several companies including D2C brands have launched cow ghee. So don’t you think it will make it challenging for you to gain market share from here on?

Everybody knows these companies are copycats. They have copied us. If you think about it which is the leading company in the ayurvedic segment known for its natural products? People of the country know Swami Ramdev and Patanjali Ayurved. Nobody can replicate our brand equity. Nobody can take our share and I am not saying this in arrogance. A brand like Hindustan Unilever spent thousands of crores on Ayush but they did not achieve anything. Similarly Colgate Vedshakti was launched! The ingredient they (Colgate-Palmolive) have introduced is of no use when it comes to dental care. They do not know the formulation (of natural products) and people do not trust them.

The consumers do not connect with these companies. And anyway if the market expands then several brands enter it. In the last two years during the pandemic companies introduced ghee; even Dabur entered the segment and launched ghee mustard oil. ITC launched ghee. They have all tried launching our products thousands of crores were spent but they did not achieve anything out of it.

Competition should be there in the market as then consumers will realise our value. But people do not trust competition. The brand game is dependent on trust. FMCG companies can rope in brand ambassadors by spending Rs 5-10 crore they can make good ad films and can launch products through their product distribution but they cannot bring Ramdev. How will they build trust? I have spent 30 years serving this nation. We are not talking in arrogance or ignorance but we are what we are.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Why are fans being punished over their ineptitude to figure it out? It’s a joke.

Laurie not amused

Kiz: Throughout the course of this pandemic when we longed for a good hug Comcast and Altitude have instead thrown mud. Who would’ve thought this television tiff would be harder to eradicate than COVID-19? It has done a disservice to Nikola Jokic Nathan MacKinnon and most of all local fans searching for a reason to smile.

I watch condensed YouTube highlights from the Nugs and Avs every morning with my son but it’s not the same as watching an entire game. Kroenke Sports & Entertainment missed a huge opportunity to capitalize on the fact the Broncos and Rockies have been terrible the past couple of years while KSE has the best shows in town with an MVP and Stanley Cup contender.

Zakaveli irked

Kiz: Old-school fans often lack the tech savvy to pirate and live-stream games while there are elementary-school kids in Denver with no memory of seeing Joker or MacK play on TV. The Nuggets and Avs are killing off their fanbase on both ends of the age spectrum.

I can’t believe this dispute has lasted three seasons. I have been able to watch the games (cough) but since I can’t easily get it on our family’s television I watch alone in my office instead of alongside my 8- and 10-year-old kids.

R.B. Castle Rock

Kiz: Two of the coolest things I love about sports? No. 1: A winning team can foster a sense of community pride. No. 2: A big game is capable of getting our noses unstuck from the cell phone and bring families together around the TV. So ain’t it sad that pirating a Nuggets telecast has become just another excuse for a father to go hole up alone in the den?

This is a lost season for the Nuggets and that’s sad considering the talent we’ve put together. I don’t understand how a pro athlete isn’t ready 12 months after an ACL tear.

Matt patience taxed

Kiz: In projecting guard Jamal Murray to return about April 1 from a torn ACL I was guilty of being overly optimistic (as is my wont). Blame me. Cut Murray some slack. After a serious injury the last big challenge for an athlete is getting his mind right.

At the end of last season the Broncos and Drew Lock were a fumble away from beating Kansas City who barely won without an injured Tyreek Hill for most of the game. With the addition of Russell Wilson at quarterback the Broncos have a shot to dethrone the Chiefs as AFC West champs.

J.D. proud girl dad

Kiz: The trade of Hill to Miami was the beginning of the end for the Chiefs’ six-year reign as kings of the AFC West.

And today’s parting shot is a neighbor kindly checking on this old sports hack to say “Hello in there” and make certain everything is OK with me. (My story sticking to it.)

Kiz I thought you passed away. Glad to hear you are still relevant.

Virginia",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzI2L3dhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWlzLXVuZGVyZXN0aW1hdGluZy12ZXJpem9uLXN0b2NrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Don't Underestimate Verizon's Stock,"Verizon's core business is steady but it has a huge growth opportunity with 5G broadband.

Three months ago I got so sick of a spotty internet connection from Comcast that I bought a (very expensive) wireless business plan from Verizon (VZ 1.13%) for my home office. Unfortunately 5G wasn't available where I live so it was a 4G LTE connection but speeds were comparable to Comcast and the wireless box was far more reliable than my home Wi-Fi.

To my surprise a few weeks later I learned that 5G had been turned on in my neighborhood. 5G Home was now available for just $70 a month ($30 less than Comcast broadband). A few emails and phone calls later and a 5G Home box was on its way. My 4G LTE wireless router was headed back to Verizon.

A little over a month in 5G Home from Verizon is more reliable than my cable internet is. I'm ready to cancel Comcast broadband. This story may be anecdotal but it could be revolutionary for Verizon on a large scale. I'm not sure the market even realizes Verizon could have a massive growth business on its hands.

Reaching into the home

A vast majority of Verizon's revenue comes from wireless services and related hardware for businesses and consumers. At the end of 2021 the company had 115.4 million wireless retail connections and just 13.1 million combined Fios video internet and digital voice connections with another 6.9 million wireline broadband connections. Not surprisingly wireless is growing adding 1.1 million net subscribers last year. Meanwhile Fios lost 222000 connections offset by 241000 net additions for wireline broadband.

The general story of these numbers is that Verizon is huge in wireless phone service but hasn't been particularly successful at reaching into the home. And it's losing customers in the Fios business which has never lived up to expectations.

But this dynamic may change with 5G Home wireless broadband service. It's faster and cheaper than cable and DSL broadband at least in some areas and it'll be a huge opportunity for Verizon if the company can bundle these products successfully. Verizon has said that its 5G Home service is already available to 100 million homes and the rollout is going much faster than expected. Management hoped to have 11 million home broadband subscribers by 2025 but I think that's underestimating the business's potential.

The new bundle

We're starting to see Verizon offer discounts for multiple services but it's not a true bundle company yet. For now it's bringing together 5G smartphone coverage with 5G Home broadband. But I think that's just the start.

Dozens of streaming services are now available and some are sold through Verizon. Bundling these services together with two wireless services makes sense especially as streaming companies look for more distribution options.

Don't underestimate the edge

I've focused primarily on consumer services Verizon will be able to bring to the market with 5G. But another significant impact could be on what's known as the edge. Verizon is calling this the ""network-as-a-service"" for businesses building solutions for computing at the edge of the cloud.

In general the idea is that computing power doesn't need to be done entirely on devices like computers and smartphones. Some computing can be pushed to the ""edge"" crunching numbers and analyzing data streams at a network hub near the user. As the company connecting devices to the internet Verizon is a likely player here.

It's not clear how big Verizon will be able to make this business but like Verizon Home it's an incremental addition of revenue and margin for the company. The core smartphone connection business is strong -- broadband and the edge is about growth.

Verizon's stock is cheap given its growth potential

Telecommunications stocks may not be the market's favorites but there's a lot to like about Verizon stock. Shares trade for an earnings multiple under 10 the dividend yield is 5% and as I highlighted I think there's a lot of potential for growth.

Suppose the edge or 5G broadband provides even a few percentage points of additional growth. In that case they could change the narrative of this company from being a very slow-growth high-capital-cost operation to a very profitable business growing the bottom line by 5% or more per year. I think the value is compelling enough but from what I've seen from 5G Home there's more growth in Verizon's future than investors are giving it credit for.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vbW9yZXRoYW50aGVjdXJ2ZS5jb20vaG93LXRvLXdhdGNoLXBseW1vdXRoLXdoaXRlbWFyc2gtaGlnaC1zY2hvb2xzLWdpcmxzLWJhc2tldGJhbGwtdGVhbS1wbGF5LWluLXN0YXRlLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to watch Plymouth Whitemarsh High School's girls basketball team play in state championship,"The Plymouth Whitemarsh High School girls basketball team faces off with Mt.

Just two days ago he was traded from the Toronto Blue Jays a team considered to be a legitimate World Series contender to the Rockies a team facing an uphill climb to make the playoffs after three consecutive losing seasons.

“Initially when I heard (about) the trade I was super excited” Grichuk said Saturday when he arrived at the Rockies’ Salt River Fields complex. “They had signed (Kris) Bryant already and that shows that they aren’t throwing the towel in.”

Bryant who signed a free-agent deal for seven years $182 million on March 18 will play primarily left field. Grichuk who was traded for left fielder Raimel Tapia and minor-leaguer Adrian Pinto will play center and right plus be used as a designated hitter.

Grichuk started in center in Saturday’s game against Texas and made a quick statement to his new teammates hitting a two-run 450-foot homer to left in the fifth inning.

Grichuk signed a five-year $52 million contract with Toronto prior to the 2019 season. He’ll make $10.33 million this season but the Blue Jays sent the Rockies cash considerations that will offset much of that salary.

Grichuk 30 slashed .241/.281/.423 with 22 home runs and a career-high 81 RBIs in 149 games for Toronto last season. He played mostly center field and designated hitter. In eight seasons with the Cardinals and Blue Jays he hit .245 with 156 home runs.

Grichuk touched on a variety of topics Saturday:

* On the challenge of playing center at Coors Field: “I’ve played there a little bit as a visitor but obviously not for half a season. I was talking with Charlie Blackmon this morning a little bit about it and I’ll talk to the training staff and the strength staff a little bit more about taking care of my body differently to withstand a full season playing out there.

“I know it’s not easy but there are guys who have done it for a number of years and I will lean on them.”

In 12 career games at Coors Field Grichuk has hit .192 (9 for 47) with three home runs and six RBIs.

* Did he expect the trade? “Honestly no. I didn’t really know about the outfield situation (in Colorado). I talked to my agent going into the offseason. The (Blue Jays) were open to trading an outfielder or two and we knew they wanted to get a left-handed bat. I kind of heard it could be me … so I knew something was possible but I didn’t know the Rockies were looking for an outfielder. It was a little bit of a shock but definitely an exciting one.”

* On being traded for the third time in his career: “It’s part of the game. Obviously being in the game for a little while now I realize there are things I can’t control and things I can’t worry about.”

Welker update. Corner infield prospect Colton Welker 24 said Saturday that he’s suffering from a bacterial virus that’s made the vision in his right eye “foggy.”

The condition is being treated with antibiotics and Welker hopes to get back on the field in a few more days. He said he’s had the condition before including last season adding that it usually takes about 10 days for the eye to clear up.

Transactions. The Rockies optioned right-handed pitcher Noah Davis and infielders Ezequiel Tovar and Elehuris Montero to minor-league camp. Additionally the club reassigned right-handed pitchers Zach Lee and Nate Griep both non-roster invitees to minor-league camp.

""Opening Day is coming whether we're ready for it or not"" manager AJ Hinch said. ""I think our guys are getting closer to being ready.""

What happened

The Tigers' top hitting prospects — Riley Greene and Spencer Torkelson — are gaining momentum in their pursuit of making their MLB debuts on Opening Day on April 8 at Comerica Park.

""Confidence is there"" Torkelson said. ""I feel great and I'm having a lot of fun. They knew what they were going to get and they're getting it.""

In the third inning Greene and Torkelson drew back-to-back walks — on 10 pitches and eight pitches respectively — from Phillies right-handed reliever Connor Brogdon. Greene came around to score on a sacrifice fly from Robbie Grossman for the Tigers' first run.

In the fourth Greene beat the shift against left-hander Damon Jones. He pushed an 0-2 slider the opposite way for a double. It was the Tigers' first hit of the game. That scored Jeimer Candelario cutting the Tigers' deficit to 4-2. Hustling on the bases allowed him to stretch a single into a double.

""We're always learning new things every day"" Greene said. ""I was on the fastball and he was definitely coming back with a slider there. It's just small things like that that we're getting to learn more and more every day. We feel pretty good about it. We're seeing the ball well. We're playing good working hard. Whatever happens happens.""

Torkelson scored the game-tying run in the sixth inning after hitting a second-pitch curveball from righty Michael Kelly to the left-field corner for his third double of the spring. He scored on Willi Castro's two-out double evening the score at 6-all.

""I feel great"" Torkelson said. ""I'm seeing the ball really well. I feel like I'm on time for the fastball and then I'm adjusting to the off-speed even without two strikes so I'm happy with that.""

Harold Castro produced the Tigers' go-ahead run with an RBI single off lefty Jeff Singer as part of an eight-run seventh inning.

Greene 21 finished 1-for-1 with one double one RBI and one walk; Torkelson 22 went 1-for-2 with one double and one walk. Greene is hitting .333 in seven games while Torkelson is hitting .313 in seven games.

""They're just continuing to learn and grow and do different things"" Hinch said. ""They just need experience and reps. They don't really need to show me anything other than just continue to make a case for coming north with us.""

Starting out

Right-hander Matt Manning was roughed up in his second spring training start allowing four runs (one earned) on five hits with three strikeouts.

A three-run second doomed Manning.

""He had trouble with two outs"" Hinch said. ""At the two-out mark he was fine and then some damage happened. Maybe a little missed execution maybe a little pitch selection maybe a little bit of both. He got his reps in and needed to control damage with two outs. That was a big key today that he can work on.""

The Phillies' first three batters in the inning: Rhys Hoskins (flyout to center) Johan Camargo (fielding error by second baseman Jonathan Schoop) and Alec Bohm (swinging strikeout on 81.8 mph slider).

Schoop's fielding error forced Manning to face Matt Vierling who hit a hanging slider for an RBI triple to put the Phillies ahead 1-0. Manning's slider averaged 81.8 mph a product of a recent tweak he made; he is aiming to get it back to last year's 85.4 mph average.

""If it's not moving horizontally then it's just spinning up there like a BP (batting practice) fastball"" Manning said. ""I've thrown the good ones. I know what it feels like when it's good. It's just getting that repetition.""

Then former No. 1 overall pick Mickey Moniak crushed Manning's fastball for a two-run home run to center. Manning struck out Kyle Schwarber on three pitches — sending him down swinging with a 94.8 mph fastball — to conclude the second frame. All three runs were unearned because of Schoop's mistake.

The Phillies went up 4-0 with two outs in the fourth inning as Hoskins tagged Manning's 92.9 mph sinker for a 447-foot solo home run. Manning struck out Bohm looking with a fastball to finish his outing.

For his 50 pitches (35 strikes) Manning used 24 four-seam fastballs (48%) 11 curveballs (22%) six sliders (12%) five changeups (10%) and four sinkers (8%). He recorded seven swings and misses: two each with his four-seamer slider and changeup and one with his curveball. He logged eight called strikes including two with his curveball.

His fastball averaged 94 mph.

""I like where it's at"" Manning said of his curveball. ""I've got my swings and misses. I'm getting the weak contact the flares. I'm getting guys out of their power stance getting them out in front. That's where I like to use it. I think the slider comes in next for the hard swing and miss.""

At the plate

Although Greene and Torkelson played key roles shortstop Javier Baez produced the momentum-shifting hit. After Eric Haase and Grossman worked walks Baez ripped a two-run double to right field. He cut the Phillies' lead to 6-4 in the fifth inning.

In the next inning Derek Hill hit a solo home run to spark a two-run sixth.

The Tigers went ahead 7-6 on Harold Castro's RBI single in the seventh and Ryan Lavarnway upped the margin to 9-6 with a two-run single to center off right-hander Andrew Schultz. Haase followed with a 416-foot home run for three runs to give the Tigers a 12-6 lead.

Trei Cruz from minor-league camp started the seventh with a walk. For his second plate appearance in the inning he hit a two-run double to the right-field corner to make it 14-6.

On the mound

Left-handed closer Gregory Soto replaced Manning and struck out two of the three batters he faced in the fourth inning. He threw 11 of 16 pitches for strikes maxing out at 98.8 mph with his sinker.

""He needs the adrenaline of the game to get himself going"" Hinch said. ""His arm strength is in perfect shape. He didn't pitch winter ball for the first time in his life so I can see a little bit of rustiness. He threw one changeup which was good that he threw it. We don't know how much he's going to use it during the season.""

A throwing error by Baez put Jean Segura on first base with one out in the fifth inning against right-hander Will Vest. Didi Gregorius put the Phillies in the driver's seat 6-2 with a two-run home run. Vest returned for the sixth and pitched a scoreless inning.

Right-hander Michael Fulmer fired a scoreless seventh inning. He threw 13 of 18 pitches for strikes and sat around 92 mph with his fastball. Lefty Andrew Chafin allowed two runs on four hits in the eighth but he retired consecutive batters to escape further damage.

""A little step forward"" Hinch said of Fulmer. ""His fastball ticked up a little bit and he was able to throw his slider pretty good. He threw a couple curveballs. Both he and Chafin need reps. You're only going to get those in a game especially for veteran guys like that.""

Jacob Barnes a righty pitched a scoreless ninth.

Three stars

1. Baez 2. Greene 3. Soto.

Jessica Rinaldi | Reuters

ExxonMobil  the top oil and gas producer in the U.S. is piloting a project to mine bitcoin in North Dakota according to people with knowledge of the matter. For over a year Exxon has been working with Crusoe Energy Systems a company based in Denver said the people who asked not to be named because details of the project are confidential. Crusoe's technology helps oil companies turn wasted energy or flare gas into a useful resource. Similar to ConocoPhillips ' mining scheme in North Dakota's Bakken region Exxon is diverting natural gas that would otherwise be burned off into generators which convert the gas into electricity used to power shipping containers full of thousands of bitcoin miners. Exxon launched the pilot in late January 2021 and expanded its buildout in July. While Exxon hasn't talked publicly about its work in the space Eric Obrock a 10-year veteran at the company said on his LinkedIn profile that from February 2019 to January 2022 he ""proposed and led the first successful commercial and technical demonstration of using Bitcoin Proof-of-Work mining as a viable alternative to natural gas flaring in the oil patch."" Obrock's title on his profile is NGL industry outlook advisor referring to the natural gas liquids market. Obrock told CNBC through a LinkedIn message that he's been advised that he can't speak to the media on this topic. Exxon didn't respond to a request for comment. Exxon's bitcoin project isn't really about making money from the cryptocurrency. Rather the company has pledged to reduce emissions as part of an industrywide effort to meet higher environmental demands. In early March Exxon joined other oil companies in committing to the World Bank's ""Zero Routine Flaring by 2030"" initiative introduced in 2015. The type of crypto mining arrangement it's pursuing with Crusoe reduces CO2-equivalent emissions by about 63% compared with continued flaring. Exxon's bitcoin mining work in North Dakota was first reported by Bloomberg which said the company is also considering similar pilots in Alaska the Qua Iboe Terminal in Nigeria Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale field Guyana and Germany.

Mining bitcoin in the Bakken

The problem Exxon and Conoco are addressing has existed for years: What happens when drillers accidentally hit a natural gas formation? Unlike oil which can be trucked out to a remote destination gas delivery requires a pipeline. If a drilling site is close to a pipeline producers can sell it right away. But if the pipe is full or if the gas is 20 miles away drillers often burn it off. That's why you typically see flames rising from oil fields. In addition to the environmental hazards drillers are also burning cash. Enter bitcoin mining which only requires an internet connection and can be done from anywhere. And because miners' primary variable cost is energy they're incentivized to find the cheapest sources of power. ""This is just a great way to bring that demand to the wasted energy and solve two problems at once"" said Cully Cavness president of Crusoe whose backers include Valor Equity Partners one of Tesla 's largest investors. ""Solve the energy appetite of bitcoin and solve the stranded energy flare gas problem for the energy industry."" Cavness said Crusoe has 150 employees and works with Norway's Equinor ASA  Canadian oil producer Enerplus and Devon Energy  based in Oklahoma City.

Permits from North Dakota's Division of Air Quality show Crusoe can run 20 portable engines with 11 currently in use at well sites across the state. Two of the engines are operational at wells run by XTO Energy Exxon's oil and gas fracking subsidiary at the Jorgenson Deep Creek Site. Cavness said most of Crusoe's 80-plus data centers are deployed in the Bakken. ""We're really moving the needle on flared volumes"" Cavness said. ""More than 10 million cubic feet of gas per day that would be flared is not flared because we've deployed our systems."" The World Bank in its most recent Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership report recognized Crusoe as offering an innovative solution to flaring.

Solving the methane problem

The Bakken formation became an important source of new oil production in the U.S. in the last couple decades with the boom in hydraulic fracturing or fracking. Craig Thorstenson has been working at the permitting program at North Dakota's Division of Air Quality since 1989. He says North Dakota has always been an oil state to some extent but growth in the Bakken lifted the state to second in the country before it slipped to third last year. Thorstenson who was born and raised in Bismarck the state capital said the change ""was quite a shock for us."" Residential housing couldn't keep up with demand. ""We were having a population boom"" Thorstenson said. ""People coming in wanting to get jobs. People living in the Walmart parking lots."" More drilling meant more wasted gas which affected the entire Williston Basin that spreads across part of Montana the Dakotas and into Canada. That's a big reason why Crusoe invested heavily in the area. ""At points in not-that-distant history the basin was flaring almost up to a fifth of the gas that was being produced there"" said Cavness. Thorstenson said the amount of wasted natural gas is finally trending lower. In a March report North Dakota's Department of Natural Resources estimated that currently 93% to 94% of natural gas is being captured. In 2014 the commission had a capture goal of 74%. Drillers have historically chosen flaring as a way to dispose of excess gas because it's less damaging to the environment than venting which releases methane directly into the air and produces greenhouse effects that have proven to be 84 to 86 times as powerful as CO2 over a 20-year period. Even with flaring some methane does escape due to wind and other factors. On-site bitcoin mining can be especially impactful because 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air according to Adam Ortolf who runs business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities. ""Nobody will run it through a generator unless they can make money because generators cost money to acquire and maintain"" Ortolf said. ""So unless it's economically sustainable producers won't internally combust the gas."" Crusoe's systems are built to make the process financially viable for drillers. The company brings its equipment onto the oil pad allowing it to convert otherwise wasted natural gas into electricity which then powers computing at the well site. ""When we put it through our generator we get up to 99.9% combustion of that methane"" Cavness said. ""Not only are we using the otherwise wasted energy we're also significantly reducing methane emissions."" Cavness said his main takeaway from the United Nations' latest global climate summit in Glasgow Scotland was that methane is the low-hanging fruit. ""That's the thing we want to solve as an energy industry"" he said. WATCH: Texas crypto miners power down to ease grid pressure",,,,,,,,,,,,

Limited to a 1-year production run (due to government regulations on the vehicle’s current architecture) instantly making the performance SUV a future collectible.

With an original production run of just 2000 units Dodge//SRT expanded the production due to demand adding an additional 1000 units to the mix. With numbers making it rarer than the drag racing-oriented 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon the Durango continues to draw huge upcharges when they come up for sale.

Over the past year we have seen a number of the high-performance three-row SUVs end up on the popular online automotive auction site Copart. It seems that the Durango SRT Hellcat has become quite the investment as a number of SUVs have been destroyed at an alarming rate.

In this latest post it seems that another one of these beloved 710 horsepower SUVs has faced its demise. Located in Philadelphia Pennsylvania this Durango SRT Hellcat has suffered a massive front-end impact and pushed the supercharged 6.2-liter HEMI HELLCAT V8 engine against the firewall. Since the impact was so harsh it is unknown how many miles are truly on this vehicle due to the odometer no longer working.

We pulled the original window sticker for this particular Hellcat. The Vice White-painted Durango was pretty well-optioned when it left the dealer lot. With an original sticker price of $90440 this Hellcat featured the following equipment…

Technology Group – $2395 Advanced Brake-Assist Lane-Departure Warning Plus Full-Speed Forward-Collision Warning Plus Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Stop

Jack was very passionate about the youth in our community and he would be grateful if in his honor you were able to donate to the NICU at Arnot Ogden at arnothealth.childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org or St. Jude's Children's Hospital at stjude.org.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS9ueXMvY2FwaXRhbC1yZWdpb24vY29tbXVuaXR5LzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvYWxiYW55LXJlc2lkZW50cy1yZWZsZWN0LW9uLW5laWdoYm9yaG9vZC02MC15ZWFycy1hZnRlci1lbWluZW50LWRvbWFpbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reflecting on neighborhood 60 years after eminent domain,"The Empire State Plaza has been part of the Albany skyline for half a century. The project took several years cost millions of dollars and the eminent domain of one neighbor. That process got underway 60 years ago.

It’s a good thing Angelo Kontis still has many old photos throughout his home.

What You Need To Know The Empire State Plaza has been part of the Albany skyline for half a century



In total about 7000 residents and business owners were forced to relocate



The state seized 98 acres of land for the plaza project

“This is the Eagle Theatre which is a block and a half from where the house was” Kontis said. “I spent many Saturdays there watching westerns.”

They’re the only thing left other than his memory to bring him back more than half a century to the Albany neighborhood he grew up in.

Kontis can recall all of the immigrants who settled there in the early 20th century including his father who came from Turkey and later opened a shoe repair shop.

“In addition the back of the store was a small importing grocery store” Kontis said.

His father owned the building on Hudson Avenue. His family lived upstairs. Kontis attended nearby Philip Schuyler High School where he played basketball. Life as he says was good there.

“Because of its diversity and because of all the vibrant going on on a day-to-day basis” Kontis said.

Today Kontis’s old neighborhood has been replaced by state buildings. His old home sat in between what is now The Egg and the Corning Tower.

On March 27 1962 residents and business owners of this neighborhood were told their properties has been appropriated by the state via eminent domain for the future site of the Empire State Plaza.

“As a young person it was upsetting to me. I do remember that because I kept thinking of all of our childhood friends my parents’ friends"" Barbara Lucas-Roberts who grew up on Jefferson Street said. ""It was such a connected neighborhood.""

Her old home is now the location of the New York State Museum. She was 12-years-old when her family was forced out of their home.

“When you think back to ‘Wow I used to sleep over here at this museum’ yeah it was quite strange” Lucas-Roberts said.

“Certainly in the 40s and 50s the South End of Albany was a wonderful wonderful place to live and to grow up” said Michael Mullen another former resident.

His parents owned a cathedral shop at the corner of Madison Avenue and Eagle Street. He was 15-years-old when his parents wrote a letter to then-Mayor Erastus Corning pleading for relief from this takeover.

“For them it was very difficult” Mullen said. “They put their life’s savings into the business.”

In total about 7000 residents and business owners were forced to relocate. The state seized 98 acres of land for the plaza project.

“We realized that we could tell a different history of urban renewal one that was a social history focused on the people affected” said David Hochfelder one of the founders behind the blog 98 Acres in Albany.

Documenting and sharing the stories of lives that were uprooted the site analyzes several other urban renewal projects around the country and how they have impacted cities.

“This project took north of a billion dollars” Hochfelder said. “Typical urban renewal projects were around tens of millions.”

He says there are many lessons to take away from the construction of the Empire State Plaza like the permanent impact tearing something down has as well as how this action will affect future generations.

“I often say that was a full-circle moment” said Lucas-Roberts said who ended up working for the state at the plaza.

Mullen and his family moved just off of New Scotland Avenue but their business never took off again. Kontis says his father’s shoe repair shop also never reopened.

He does however occasionally go down to the plaza for July 4 and other events. For Kontis it’s an opportunity for him to reflect on the neighborhood that he once called home.

“Inevitably I’ll pause and look around and say this is where I try to recall what it used to be like and what it is now” Kontis said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd2VzdGZhaXJvbmxpbmUuY29tL2hvc3BpdGFsaXR5LXRvdXJpc20vcG91Z2hrZWVwc2llLWdyYW5kLWhvdGVsLXNvbGQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Poughkeepsie Grand Hotel sold,"Visions Hotels LLC based in Corning New York which operates 49 hotels in New York state along with properties in Pennsylvania and Connecticut has purchased the Poughkeepsie Grand Hotel for an undisclosed sum from Bonura and DiBrizzi Enterprises.

The Dutchess Country Industrial Development Agency gave its approval to transferring an existing IDA agreement covering the hotel from Bonura/DiBrizzi to Visions.

Visions said that it would be investing approximately $7 million in improvements to the hotel and would be rebranding it as a Double Tree by Hilton. Visions said that the improvements would generate more than 20 construction jobs and result in the creation of more than 30 permanent full-time jobs.

Minesh Patel chief financial officer for Visions told the IDA “I would like to thank the board for consideration of this. We’re going to continue with the banquets in a veryÂ strong manner but enhance it with a flag franchised hotel which I believe the city town county really could use and really will really help in attracting people.”

Design Display and Build

The OnePlus Nord CE 2 5G has been improved over its past generation it’s now more powerful better in design and faster at charging speeds. The Nord CE 5G is just below its higher variant OnePlus Nord 2 5G which supports a better CPU primary camera and comes in a premium glass design all with a higher price tag of course.

Speaking of its design the Nord CE 2 5G is covered in a glossy finish 7.8 mm slim design the front is covered with a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 while the back looks like glass not exactly glass but gives you a smooth feel. The overall design of the smartphone feels very good solid looks premium and more refined.

The backside has a triple camera setup on the top left side with a 64 MP main camera. On the front side you see the gorgeous 6.43-inch Fluid AMOLED display with a 90 Hz refresh rate and a resolution of Full HD+ (2400 x 1080 pixels).

The right side has a power key while the volume controls are on the left along with a SIM tray that also carries a dedicated microSD card slot. It supports dual SIMs with 5G functionality and dual standby. The fingerprint scanner is just under the display not side-mounted like the others but the loudspeakers on the phone aren’t stereo. The bottom side has a USB Type-C port a 3.5 mm audio jack loudspeakers and a microphone with a second one on the top.

Software and User Interface

The OnePlus Nord CE 2 5G runs on its homegrown Oxygen OS 11.3 based on the Android 11. The security patch on the phone is dated 5th January 2022. The interface looks more stockish than customized if you are familiar with the stock Android interface.

The Oxygen OS 11.3 has loads of extra features on top of Android 11 you do get customizations and features in the Oxygen OS as well as security updates however it’s still behind in terms of Android version updates many smartphones have already received the Android 12 update the Nord CE 2 5G is stuck with the Android 11 out-of-the-box. Nevertheless sooner or later the smartphone might be updated to the newer Oxygen OS 12 (based on Android 12) which we saw in the OnePlus 9 Series.

You will find least apps installed on the phone most of them are from Google a few from OnePlus no third-party apps found on the phone. The user interface is clean and lag-free the experience is super smooth due to its 90 Hz refresh rate and there are various Oxygen OS optimizations.

Hardware Performance and Gaming

OnePlus has this time picked up a MediaTek chip instead of a Qualcomm for the Nord CE the predecessor equips a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G SoC while the Nord CE 2 5G packs a MediaTek Dimensity 900 SoC a faster processor overall. The CPU is another highlight of this phone aside from its fast charging capability.

About the CPU the Mediatek Dimensity 900 is an upper-midrange SoC manufactured in a 6nm process consisting of 2+6 core configurations two high-performance ARM Cortex-A78 cores clocked at 2.4 GHz and six power-efficient ARM Cortex-A55 cores clocked at 2.0 GHz. Furthermore the chip integrates a quad-core ARM Mali-G68 MC4 (quad-core) GPU for gaming and graphics apps.

The rest of the specs include RAM with up to 8 GB RAM LPDDR4X and 128 GB UFS 2.2 storage the highest offering among its two variants the base variant comes in 6 GB RAM with the same 128 GB storage option which can be extended via a microSD card. The price for the base variant i.e. 6 GB + 128 GB is ₹23999 while for ₹1000 more you get its 8 GB RAM variant.

It’s very similar to the Dimensity 920 the performance of the chip is faster than that available on its predecessor. It also competes with the Snapdragon 750G and 765G powered smartphones and emerges with a better position in benchmarks but not when compared to the Snapdragon 778G it has close competition though. If you are planning to game on it the GPU performs well and runs many games if not all at high graphics settings.

Cameras

The cameras on the phone are way too similar to the setup you see on its predecessor the OnePlus Nord CE 5G. It seems the OnePlus Nord CE 2 5G offers the same camera specs you will find a triple camera setup with the 64 MP camera being the primary. The rest two cameras are 8 MP ultra-wide-angle and 2 MP macro no fourth camera is available you don’t see OIS and telephoto camera either. The front has a 16 MP selfie camera for selfie and video calling needs.

The 64 MP camera performs very similarly as compared to the camera found on its first-gen. Although the camera package performs well in the daylight and appears to be good for this price segment there are no big changes you see in the camera if you own the Nord CE 5G you won’t find anything significantly new here.

Features of its camera include Portrait Night Dual Video Slow-Mo Expert Movie Ultra Resolution and a few more. It does record 4K at 30 fps for 60 fps it records in 1080p mode (even supports 120 fps). You also have the 480 fps super slow motion and the camera records wide-angle videos which is a great feature.

Battery Life and Charging

For its battery it has the same 4500 mAh size you see on its Nord series smartphones the OnePlus Nord 2 5G as well as the OnePlus Nord CE 5G both have the same capacity battery and hence you can expect a similar battery life. You can get up to 2 days of battery depending upon your usage.

Surprisingly the Nord CE 2 5G has played a smart move by offering a super-fast 65W SuperVOOC charging which uses an output of 10V 6.5A and it gives a cutting edge over the smartphones and its rivals in this segment. Expect a full charge in about 30 minutes from 1% to 100%.

Verdict

The OnePlus Nord CE 2 5G has been improved in terms of design performance and fast charging. You get a wonderful 65W SuperVOOC fast charging that takes approximately 30 minutes to fully charge the battery a 90 Hz Fluid AMOLED display and cameras that you can rely on. For the price of ₹23999 the OnePlus Nord CE 2 5G is a reasonable choice among the contenders.

As the Biden Administration recently banned all Russian imports of gas oil and energy gas prices could continue to rise here in the states. Even though Russian oil accounts for only 3% of U.S. crude oil imports demand for Russian oil in other countries is also driving up prices in the U.S.

A History of Gas Prices: Do You Remember How Little You Once Paid?

As gas prices reach record highs of $4.3 per gallon according to Reuters Americans may be looking for cheaper ways to fill up. If you are a member of a warehouse club like Costco you may be tempted to take advantage of their lower-than-average fuel prices. But is the price too good to be true?

This week in Santa Clara California — where gas prices sit well above the national average at $5.45 per gallon — Costco is charging club members $4.82 per gallon according to SiliconValley.com.

How can retailers like Costco and Walmart offer such low prices for gas? Simple: Warehouse clubs have the volume and financial prowess to sell gas at rock-bottom prices (and razor-thin margins) as a way of luring customers in to buy other merchandise.

What’s more membership sales make up 75% of the store’s profit. Costco for instance is banks on customers signing up for a membership card to get cheap gas. Then once consumers have the membership they are likely to look for ways to save money on everything from groceries to electronics.

Most gas stations are independently owned meaning they aren’t big enough to order huge volumes at discounts the way wholesale clubs like Costco BJ’s and Sam’s Club can. The wholesale clubs aren’t making much profit off gas. But they are betting that consumers will seek out their low gas prices then enter their stores and spend money on other things.

That’s a pretty good bet when gas prices are as high as they are now.

Since its founding in 1983 the big-box chain has amassed over 114 million cardholders overall and over 500 warehouses across the country. While these locations continue to thrive not all warehouses are made equal. In fact one Utah location happens to be the most unique store in the U.S.

Known for its skiing destinations mountains and national parks Utah is also home to the biggest Costco location in America located in Salt Lake City which is arguably the most unique location too.

6 Things You'll See at Costco This Year

Standing at a whopping 235000 square feet it towers over the average Costco warehouse (typically sized at 146000 square feet). One reason for the store's massive size is that it's both a regular Costco warehouse and a Costco Business Center. Employees of this location have even been reported to walk up to 10 miles per day. (Speaking of employees this store even made headlines for its employees performing lifesaving first aid.)6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Inside this Salt Lake City warehouse includes unique offerings such as a giant dairy room along with full-sized roasting pigs lambs and goats that are available for purchase. Keep in mind that although the chain itself is known for its vast assortment of alcohol and liquor due to state laws you won't be able to find those libations at the Salt Lake City location.

A former employee of the Salt Lake City store recalled in a comment on a MilesQuest article how shoppers would be taken aback by just how big the store actually is. The employee even noted that some people managed to get lost while roaming the aisles!

If you ever plan to visit this store it's best to arrive early. One shopper wrote in a comment on a response to an Only In Your State story that although the store opens at 7 a.m. on weekdays it's best to show up a few minutes before opening time to get the best shopping experience.

TAKE STOCK I work at Costco – the asterisks on price labels in the store are a huge warning to customers and one you can’t ignore

A COSTCO employee has revealed exactly what the asterisks on price labels mean for shoppers.

The unnamed worker said the marking might means consumers want to stock up on the product while they still can.

That's because the asterisk means that the location you are in does not plan to reorder the item the worker told Readers Digest.

And while it means that the product has been discontinued it also means it is likely at its lowest price as a result.

A Costco membership costs $60 per year but it can pay for itself in savings after just a few trips to the store.

Even longtime Costco shoppers might be missing out on all the money-saving perks and benefits they can access with their membership.

The Sun has already listed four ways to save money at the store.

BudgetBroJoe a TikTok influencer who shares personal finance tips on social media has also shared the inside scoop at secret Costco pricing.

He said if a price ends in $0.99 it is a regularly priced item.

If there is a price tag with an asterisk and a discount he said when in doubt you can still purchase it and return it if you don't like it.

Price tags with an asterisk but end in $0.97 means it has been discounted.

Plus the asterisk means it likely won't be in stock the next time you come back.

Other odd pricing like $0.49 $0.79 or $0.89 typically means the product is regular-priced merchandise.

Prices ending in $0.88 or $0.00 usually mean that the manager has discounted regular goods in order to clear stock quickly.

Costco has almost 560 stores across the US. You can find your nearest one by checking its store locator tool.

The best bargains at Costco are typically located at the back of the store Lifehacker added.

The best shopping route is to start at the back of the warehouse and the ends of aisles. Then work your way up to the front.

There are plenty of fancy tools you can fill your kitchen with but few may be as important as a good cutting board. As The City Cook writes ""A board protects both the food being cut as well as your countertop."" Having the right kind of board can be crucial to keeping your knives in tip-top shape by helping to prevent them from getting dull (via Bon Appétit).

If you've ever been in the market for a new cutting board you likely know that there are a variety of different options available. However Serious Eats argues that wood is ""far and away the best material"" to go for when picking a board due to it being sanitary durable and gentle on your blades with teak being one of the best types of woods you can choose (via Bob Vila).

Unfortunately teak boards can often come with a price tag that reaches in the triple digits so when the shopper behind Costco fan Instagram account @costcohotfinds spotted a two-pack of Tramontina Teakwood Cutting Boards at their local warehouse for less than $20 this week they knew they had to spread the word. ""I love these and this is such a good deal!"" they captioned a post about the kitchenware though it appears that some Costco shoppers that have already purchased the product weren't quite as pleased.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzI2L2Nvc3Rjb3MtaW5zdGFudC1ib2JhLXRlYS1pcy1iYXNpY2FsbHktbWFnaWNfcGFydG5lci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco's instant boba tea is basically magic,"This story first appeared on Food52  an online community that gives you everything you need for a happier kitchen and home – that means tested recipes a shop full of beautiful products a cooking hotline and everything in between!

In many major cities in the U.S. the fastest way to get boba tea requires simply walking out the door — these days shops serving the tapioca-sphere-filled plastic cups crowd in alongside Starbucks and Dunkin' to fight for the country's drink dollars. But for those times when putting on pants seems too big an obstacle or for folks that live too far from the rapid proliferation of Taiwanese-style tea shops Costco offers a solution: instant boba tea. Naturally I had to try it.

Called Taiwan Boba Milk Tea and made by the company J Way Foods the Costco pack includes enough boba and flavor pouches to make 10 cups of tea and costs $14.79. The cost works out to about $1.50 per cup making it a significant savings over buying the drink in a shop where they usually start at almost three times that.

To prepare the instant boba tea you microwave the boba inside the plastic packaging for about 20 seconds. Then for most of the drinks you empty the flavored powder into two ounces of hot water and mix. Following that add ice and cold water or milk before adding in the boba themselves. The pack even includes an oversized boba straw which completes the experience.

The ten-pack includes passionfruit–pineapple green tea with fruity boba crème brûlée milk tea with caramel boba classic milk tea with brown sugar boba and taro milk tea with brown sugar boba. Each cup tastes nearly exactly like the advertised flavor and the boba plumps up nicely and softens to a pleasant chewiness in the microwave.

It might not have perfectly replicated the tea shop experience but it came darn close at a fraction of the cost — especially since my kids couldn't tell the difference at all. Of course if you don't live near a Costco either you can purchase the tea on Amazon or Walmart at slightly different prices — or enjoy a DIY home boba experience instead. The path you choose may take more than 20 seconds but you'll be rewarded no matter what."

Companies with high profits and revenue per employee are presumed to be the most successful. Alphabet Microsoft and Meta Platforms owner of Facebook are such companies. These tech companies are among the largest in the United States based on revenue and they are among the youngest large companies. Several were founded in the past 25 years. However a group of relatively small companies leads the list of highest profit per employee.

Data for the recent “Profit per Employee” research paper from software company Tipalti came from the Fortune 500. The paper examined 914 major companies most of which made a profit per employee in the last year. Only 238 reported a loss per employee. The company that has the most profits per employee is Air Lease. The company reported $516 million in profits or $4.3 million per employee.

Air Lease with an employee count of 120 buys passenger planes and leases them to airlines. The process allows carriers that do not have capital access to planes. Air Lease makes its profit largely off the interest it charges these carriers. The company was hurt by the trouble with the aviation industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic but its financials have started to recover.

When the company announced its 2021 results John L. Plueger chief executive officer and president commented: “We had a strong fourth quarter and second half of 2021 that benefited from continuing airline industry recovery as seen in our cash collections operating metrics fleet expansion and record lease placement.”

Air Lease owns 474 planes that it leases to 118 customers in 60 countries. The company is based in Los Angeles. (See if Air Lease is also among the 50 best companies to work for.)

To find the 50 companies with the most profits per employee 24/7 Wall St. reviewed Tipalti’s “Profit per Employee” research paper. Very few of the companies with the highest profit per employee are large tech companies. Meta is highest among these ranking 11th with a profit of nearly $500000 per employee based on over 58000 workers. Several financial firms are ahead of Meta.

Mortgage giant Fannie Mae has profit of $1.5 million per employee based on 7700 workers. This places it second on the list. The third is private equity firm KKR at $1.3 million per employee based on 1583 workers. (Find out if any of the companies on this list were also among the most innovative companies in 2021.)

Morrison. Raised in Richwood Dave graduated from Richwood High School. He played basketball and kept his younger brother Larry in line. T.E. ran a feed and seed grocery store and Dave helped with deliveries to homes during summers. He played trumpet in the high school band and a professional jazz band until he went to college. David was raised with a golf club in his hand which became his passion especially playing at Cherry Hill Country Club. David attended West Virginia University to earn a bachelor’s in mining engineering (Coal) with a Registered Professional Engineer in Mining designation. He returned home to marry his high school sweetheart Nancy Bennett in 1956.

Also in 1956 David began his career with Maust Mining in Tioga WV where he was the first engineer hired by the company. After a few months he and Nancy moved to Carrolton OH and he worked for Consol in their deep mines. Here they welcomed their daughter Kim in 1957. Dave Nancy and Kim then moved to Charlton Heights WV with Warner Collieries where Barry joined the family in 1958. Their family moved to many small towns in West Virginia where David helped open and manage mines for Pittston Coal Company. They returned to Richwood in 1960. When coal down turned he worked for Westvaco as an Industrial Engineer in Covington Virginia; back to Richwood WV to manage mining operations for Sewell Coal Company/Marybill WV; to Summersville WV to manage coal oil gas and timber property leases for Western Pocahontas. When CSX merged its WV operations to one location including Western Pocahontas Dave and Nancy moved to Huntington West Virginia to manage their coal land properties.

Dave was a superb golfer and enjoyed many rounds with Gene Carl Dan his son Barry his son-in-law Mike his brother Larry and his dad T.E. to name a few. He also hosted bridge parties every Friday night with Gene Carl and Dan at his house with lots of arguing and laughter. Another passion was watching West Virginia University Mountaineers play any sports. He was also thrilled when Barry was in the Mountaineer band until he left for the New England College of Optometry in 1979. Recently he was complaining that the WVU basketball team was having such a bad year after a great one last year. When he and Nancy moved to Huntington with CSX Dave began to follow the sports at Marshall University because Kim had graduated from there in 1979.

One of his proudest moments with his father and brother in attendance and having achieved the same level was becoming a Master Mason of the Grand Lodge of WV AF and AM Lodge No. 53 in Huntington WV.

Dave and Nancy went to many PGA events with friends for years. His favorite tournament was The Masters. After retirement they traveled and continued to care for Clia and T.E. through their late 90s and 100s. He and Nancy went to see bluegrass bands every Saturday night for many years and even attended some festivals in West Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Florida and Georgia. Dave watched golf every day for the last 15 years.

Dave was “Papooh” to grandchildren Kelly Kristen Ella and Blake as well as great-grandchildren Chloe and Wyatt. David and Nancy moved from Huntington WV to Covenant Village in Gastonia NC in 2016 to be closer to family.

David passed away peacefully on March 26 2022 and is survived by his wife of 66 years Nancy Lee of Gastonia NC. His children: Kim Maguire and her husband Mike of Gastonia NC and their children Kelly Maguire of Holy Angels in Belmont NC and Kristen Peterson and her husband Ryan of Lewisville NC and their children Chloe and Wyatt of the home; Dr. Barry Morrison and his wife Dr. Rebecca of Winchester VA and their children Blake and Ella of the home. David’s brother Larry Kent Morrison and his wife Betty of Bluefield VA.

The family wishes to thank the wonderful staff of Covenant Village for their warm and attentive care of David as well as Nancy. The Hospice of the Lincolnton office staff also have a special place with Nancy Larry Kim and Barry.

A memorial service will be held in Richwood WV later this year. In lieu of flowers memorials may be sent to Holy Angels 6600 Wilkinson Boulevard Belmont NC 28012; Covenant Village Benevolent Fund 1351 Robinwood Road Gastonia NC 28054; or Hospice and Palliative Care Charlotte Region 900 Donita Drive Lincolnton NC 28092.

However despite the significance of the historic accomplishment Cummins insists she’s just like anyone else who participates in the training.

“It’s the same as anyone else getting their SWAT certification” she said. “To me I finished school so girl or not I finished. And that’s all that really matters.”

METRO SWAT

The Orange County Sheriff’s Office hosted the Metro SWAT training in February. To be part of the training Cummins had to complete tryouts in September 2021.

Participants ran 400 meters; carried a 20-pound sandbag; and did five pull-ups 10 push-ups and 15 sit-ups. They then had to repeat all the exercises three more times in less than 14 minutes total.

Cummins said she was interested in the training because she wanted to expand her skill set.

The Central Florida Metro SWAT team encompasses Ocoee Apopka Winter Park Maitland and Winter Garden police departments.

As a member of SWAT Cummins will experience more training with firearms and movement get to know other agencies and obtain the chance to go on call-outs outside of just the small area of Ocoee.

After tryouts the officers are sent to SWAT school where they engaged in two weeks of mental and physical challenges for about 100 hours.

During Orange County SWAT seminars the officers participated in firearm training tactical shooting while moving learning blocks including medical and breaching building searches and scenario-based exercises.

Cummins said none of the exercises was too rigorous or damaging to the body and the hardest part of the training was her lack of sleep.

At the time she was working night shifts so getting used to waking up on a daytime schedule around 4 a.m. and heading out for 10 hours of training was tough.

“When we finished the training I went home and slept for like 12 hours” she said laughing.

Officer Cummins and fellow Ocoee PD Officer Jeffrey Hall earned their certifications Feb. 18.

WOMEN WARRIORS

Although Cummins is the first woman to earn the certification from Ocoee PD there is another woman on SWAT from the Winter Garden Police Department.

“Don’t get me wrong it’s an accomplishment but I think there’s this common misconception” she said. “I mean in the 1980s women weren’t treated as fairly. But for me starting in 2018 no one has treated me any differently. It’s really more about your goals and what you want to do with your law-enforcement career.”

She said she has had more hurdles being left-handed than being female.

“Being female has nothing to do with it” the officer said. “Being a girl at the department hasn’t really hindered me.”

Cummins said every squad at Ocoee has at least one girl.

“I definitely see it as a good proportion of female officers to male officers” she said. “Ocoee is pretty well staffed with women.”

Ocoee Police Chief Saima Plasencia said Cummins’ accomplishment is both admirable and historic.

“Completing SWAT school is no easy feat; she endured long days of physical activity and mental challenges to complete the training to become a member of the team” the chief said. “She was the only woman graduating from her training class as all the other participants were men. Her desire and determination to accomplish this goal was always evident. We are so very proud of what she has accomplished.”

HOMETOWN HERO

Cummins was born and raised in the area and attended all of the local schools. In her high school years she worked for the city of Ocoee in the Parks and Recreation Department.

Cummins attended college in St. Petersburg where she studied criminology but her heart eventually led her back to her hometown.

“It was one of those things where you grow up and you’re like ‘I want to get out of my hometown’” she said. “After those four years I was like you know what? I’m going to go home.”

Cummins has a natural knack for interpreting and interacting with the troubled youth in the area. Only a few short years ago she was one of them. At 25 Cummins is one of the youngest officers in the Ocoee department.

“Ironically I was not a very good teenager” she said. “Because I wasn’t the best kid I had a different perspective of Ocoee.”

Cummins is inspired to work with juveniles especially teenagers.

“They can get in a little bit of trouble but there’s still a chance they’re going to turn out perfectly fine” she said. “I’m not perfect but I think I turned out OK.

“When dealing with the community children the elderly and animals especially they don’t really have as strong of a voice so you kind of have to be the voice for them” she said. “That’s the bigger part of what inspires me to do this work.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L3Bha2lzdGFuLXZzLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1wYXQtY3VtbWlucy1oYWlscy1pbnRlcmltLWNvYWNoLWFuZHJldy1tY2RvbmFsZC1hZnRlci10ZXN0LXNlcmllcy13aW4tMjg0NDYxMNIBiQFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L3Bha2lzdGFuLXZzLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1wYXQtY3VtbWlucy1oYWlscy1pbnRlcmltLWNvYWNoLWFuZHJldy1tY2RvbmFsZC1hZnRlci10ZXN0LXNlcmllcy13aW4tMjg0NDYxMC9hbXAvMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pakistan vs Australia: Pat Cummins Hails Interim Coach Andrew McDonald After Test Series Win,"After Australia's 1-0 Test series triumph over Pakistan on Friday captain Pat Cummins praised the influence of interim coach Andrew McDonald in the team's victory. Nathan Lyon's five-wicket haul and skipper Pat Cummins' three-wicket haul helped Australia in bowling out Pakistan at 235 and claiming a victory by 155 runs on Day 5 of the third Test. ""He's fantastic Very diligent very thorough strategic very organised. He is a huge part of this tour win ... and all the support staff. It's not just the players that walk out we have got a squad of 30-odd people working so hard. He (McDonald) has been an important part"" cricket.com.au quoted Pat Cummins as saying.

Earlier pacer Mitchell Johnson described Cummins as ""gutless"" and accused him of having an agenda to get in a coach he wants but the Test captain dismissed the accusations.

""It's not my place to appoint the coach but he has been fantastic. We need a new style of coaching and skillset"" said Cummins.

Cummins' next captaincy assignment is a two-Test tour of Sri Lanka in June and July before a four-Test tour of India starting in September.

""The amount of confidence we will get out of winning over here not just as a team but so many individuals ... being able to stand up to Asian conditions it's huge for the Sri Lanka tour later in the year"" said Cummins.

""It's probably not as much (spinning) conditions here as what we'll get in Sri Lanka. But I think the last Asian tours that I have been on there's a lot of talk in Australia that we have got to change our game to suit over here. This is a good lesson that the basics of batting and bowling that we play in Australia can hold up over here. If anything it reaffirms that our game can hold up"" he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG5jcmljaW5mby5jb20vc3RvcnkvcGFrLXZzLWF1cy0yMDIyLTNyZC10ZXN0LXRoZS1tZW5hY2UtYW5kLXVuZmFpcm5lc3Mtb2YtcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtMTMwNzM5NNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG5jcmljaW5mby5jb20vc3RvcnkvcGFrLXZzLWF1cy0yMDIyLTNyZC10ZXN0LXRoZS1tZW5hY2UtYW5kLXVuZmFpcm5lc3Mtb2YtcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtMTMwNzM5ND9wbGF0Zm9ybT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The menace and unfairness of Pat Cummins,"Life is manifestly unfair; we know this. It is unfair in so many trivial ways not to say anything of the more important ways and then one day you open your eyes and Pat Cummins is bowling and life? Jeez there's no end to its unfairness.

We're living through a great pace age. Cummins bowls alongside Josh Hazlewood who's kinda Glenn McGrath  kinda Stuart Clark  better than the latter forever evoking the former . He also bowls alongside Mitchell Starc a rangier Mitchell Johnson who comes without the bad and the really bad days.

(Note to self: don't forget Tim Southee Trent Boult Kyle Jamieson or Neil Wagner because everyone does.)

In opposition Jasprit Bumrah and Kagiso Rabada are magnificent one like nobody else the other with the latent electricity of Michael Holding . They are generational talents and will be all-time greats.

(Note to self: don't forget Southee Boult Jamieson or Wagner because everyone does.)

James Anderson and Stuart Board are greats already and if Jofra Archer ever comes back he'd be a shoo-in.

(Note to self: don't forget Southee Boult Jamieson or Wagner because everyone does.)

Beyond them there are Mohammad Shami Ishant Sharma Kemar Roach and Shaheen Shah Afridi - quality fast bowlers everywhere in all shapes and sizes some going some coming.

Don't forget Southee Boult Jamieson or Wagner. Everyone does but this roll call comprises two of the top three greatest fast bowlers the country has produced a rare unique young talent and then Wagner a man so permanently pumped he must even sleep aggressively.

But all of them when Cummins bowls like he has just done in Pakistan or the Ashes before that or the Border-Gavaskar Trophy before that or the Trans-Tasman Trophy before that or the Ashes before that - this could go on - they might look at him and wonder how and why it is that life is this unfair.

Batters of course are plenty familiar with the unfairness of Cummins. If you are new to Cummins like Abdullah Shafique was this series you become familiar real quick. Shafique is young and assured and has looked very much at home in international cricket. In time people will look at this series see that he top-scored for Pakistan see that Cummins got him only once in six innings and conclude that he won the battle.

Except that had Australia's cordon had a better series Cummins may have dismissed him three more times and we'd be talking bunnies. The one dismissal also illustrated precisely why Shafique had won nothing - not the battle not the war. He was well-set on 96 on the final day in Karachi  Cummins came back before lunch and dropped seamlessly into a groove like a needle on to vinyl. He showed Shafique a slightly wider off-stump line for an over; then as Shafique waited at the non-striker's end the next over showed that he was getting reverse both ways to Babar Azam. When Shafique faced up again he got suckered into driving a ball that was easily wide enough to leave but one he couldn't because he was unsure which way the ball would go and by how much.

If you're familiar you may learn anew. Mohammad Rizwan reckons Hazlewood is the toughest bowler he has faced but after this series he will re-assess. Because he is rarely looked as worked over as he was by Cummins in the first innings in Karachi. He was in more trouble in the seven balls he faced from Cummins that afternoon than he was through all 44 international matches combined last year; swing seam pace bounce it was an outrageous little flutter of Cummins' skills.

What it wasn't though was especially different from his usual mode which is also the most resounding endorsement of his bowling. He doesn't need to drastically change what he does wherever he goes even on pitches as unresponsive as these because what he does is that good. However much Hazlewood evokes him nothing is more truly McGrathian than this.

Cummins - and Australia - found sustained reverse for the first time since Sandpapergate. In any series with less diplomacy riding on it than this one how they managed it would have been played up much more than it was. But a wholesome survey of Cummins' work this series is clear as to the method deployed: park outside off on a length or just back of it and stay there. Nearly 60% of the 661 balls he bowled in the series were in this channel not that different to the 55% from December 2020 to before this series. Maybe the off-stump line was a trifle tighter than it would've been on better surfaces. At least that is the inference from the fact that he made Pakistani batters play at more balls than he usually does. On average they left just under one ball per over whereas over the last 18 months or so batters have usually left nearly two balls per each Cummins over.

Destroy 'em! Pat Cummins flattening the batters' stumps was a familiar sight • AFP/Getty Images

Fast bowlers fret and tinker when they travel as is natural when the two most critical elements to their trade - the ball in their hands and the surface beneath their feet - change depending on where they are. On low slow surfaces such as those in this series they often go fuller and straighter or use more cutters or any other variations. Apart from bowling in shorter bursts Cummins didn't change anything.

There's a danger that all this come across a little if not dull then utilitarian; assembly-line bowling where no ball is distinguishable from the other. And it is true that because Cummins' genius is on such consistent and abundant display it can sometimes make it appear more matter of fact. But it's not. You only have to recall the yorker to dismiss Rizwan on the final day in Lahore  or the one to Babar in Karachi that he somehow kept out or that return catch off Azhar Ali (unfairness manifest because no human beings you cannot do that) to know how spectacular Cummins can make cricket look.

And remember his pace because cricket is always a better look with real pace. Pace is where the game is at its most physical its most athletic and dangerous and demanding in what it asks of the deliverer of pace and the person tasked to keep it out. Cummins is genuinely quick a man who hovers in the 140s kmph so comfortably you suspect he could go faster only he is too polite because now that would make batters look really silly. It's that kind of pace the kind that works on any pitch. No contemporary combines those traits - the high pace with the extreme accuracy - like Cummins does.

Only the very greatest ever have which is the company he is keeping now - and everywhere you look numbers are putting him inexorably in the all-time category . He is mingling with the finest West Indian fast bowlers in terms of the best performances in Pakistan by any non-Pakistani fast bowler.

Give or take a Dale Steyn this has been one of the finest performances in the continent by a visiting fast bowler.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzY2FmZS5pbi9jcmlja2V0L2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjIvbWFyLzI2L3Bhay12cy1hdXMtMjAyMi1wYXQtY3VtbWlucy1sYXVkcy1oaXMtc2lkZXMtYmF0dGluZy1hZnRlci10ZXN0LXNlcmllcy13aW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PAK vs AUS 2022 | Pat Cummins lauds his side's batting after Test series win,"In the recently concluded three-match Test series between hosts Pakistan and Australia the tourists win by 1-0. The series was an important one from the historical point of view as it was for the first time that Australia toured Pakistan in 24 years.

Australia’s Test captain Pat Cummins expressed happiness following their win at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. He said that the way his side batted in the first innings was ‘fantastic’.

“In the first innings the way we batted the way we put ourselves in front was fantastic. Thought if we bowled to our potential it was enough. Was kind of weird that the trend of the game was that the first couple of wickets were hard to get once it got 30-40 overs old” said Pat Cummins in the post-match presentation.

Australia had set a target of 351 runs to Pakistan. Nathan Lyon's five-wicket haul and skipper Cummins' three-wicket haul helped Australia in bundling out Pakistan at 235 to claim the remarkable victory by 115 runs on Day 5 of the third Test match. Cummins was adjudged the Player of the Match for picking up eight wickets while Usman Khawaja who scored 496 runs in five innings at an average of 165.33 received the Player of the Series award.

Further Cummins praised the entire squad for carrying on the momentum after a dominating Ashes win earlier this year.

“The really great thing about this whole squad is .. we played really well in Australia in the Ashes. And now here. Swepson probably didn't get the just rewards was an important member of our bowling group. We've been so well received here. Didn't know what to expect here but it has been an amazing experience. Been a lot of fun. Competitive cricket. In a lot of way it's been more important than just the result” he added.

This was Australia's third Test series win in Pakistan. The first two Tests in Rawalpindi and Karachi were ended in draws. Now both teams will be facing each other in a three-match ODI series starting from March 29.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Debutant’s brutal baptism; Khawaja’s freak feat as Cummins stars: Aussie series ratings,"Australia has clinched the three-Test series against Pakistan 1-0 after a dramatic day five victory in Lahore on Friday.

USMAN KHAWAJA — 9.5

496 runs at 165.33 HS 160 two centuries two fifties

A truly remarkable series from easily Australia’s best batter. Many things were remarkable about Khawaja’s performance in Pakistan. The most obvious is the sheer size of the run mountain he produced in the country of his birth. 496 runs in just five innings with an average of 165.33 are series numbers many can only dream of. The consistency however was equally astonishing. Khawaja was not dismissed for less than 90 runs in Pakistan. But his assuredness with the bat at the crease particularly against spin and his calm sense of leadership was a pleasure to watch from an Australian perspective. His only blemish for the series was dropping a sitter with only a few overs to play in Karachi. Had he taken the catch Australia would have had two overs to bowl at Pakistan’s No.9 and No.10 batters to claim a win. It should only be seen as a minor detail however given Khawaja’s potency with the bat.

DAVID WARNER — 5

169 runs at 33.80 HS 68 two fifties

David Warner was unable to bat at the same level of proficiency as his opening partner Khawaja and looked a little out of sorts at times — particularly to Shaheen Shah Afridi. Spare a thought for Warner because in a series noted for its easy batting conditions the opener did have one of the harder jobs to face a fired up Afridi with the new rock. Afridi often challenged the outside edge of Warner who looked a little shaky at times particularly in the channel just outside off-stump. Warner still scored two fifties while his average of 33.80 doesn’t tell the full story given he twice sacrificed himself to the cause as Australia looked for quick runs in the second innings in Karachi and Lahore.

MARNUS LABUSCHAGNE — 6

170 runs at 34.00 HS 90 one fifty

This was a series that started strongly for Marnus Labuschagne who was arguably Australia’s best batter in Rawalpindi where he looked certain to make a century. With the second new ball however he nicked off and his series took a turn from there. He had limited opportunities after being run-out for a duck in Karachi while both of his second innings knocks in the series came when quick runs were needed. His big chance was in the first innings in Lahore when plenty of runs were on offer if he could just get set. But he went fishing outside stump second ball to be out for another duck. Outside of the first Test he simply couldn’t impose himself on this series and failed to find the same touch as Khawaja or Smith. Produced two brilliant run-outs in the series which he gains an extra mark for.

STEVE SMITH — 7

226 runs at 56.50 HS 93 three fifties

Still no truly big score from Steve Smith but this was a return to form of sorts. Time appeared to stand still at times this series for Smith particularly in Rawalpindi where he was on-course for a century before a cheap wicket down legside to Nauman Ali. If there was a criticism of Smith apart from not reaching three figures it was that he was overly conservative at times. His strike rate of 37.29 was well below any of Australia’s top seven batters with the next slowest being Cameron Green on 44.92. Smith soaked up 579 balls in the space of just three innings and arguably needed to be more assertive to break his century-drought. Smith’s overall mark might seem low but that’s because he had a nightmare in the slips this series until the final day. Many of his chances were difficult but there were so many drops and missed opportunities that it became hard to keep count.

TRAVIS HEAD — 3

68 runs at 22.66 HS 26

Head had little opportunities with the bat this series but when he did the end result was disappointing. It seemed virtually impossible to not make runs in Rawalpindi until Head threw his wicket away for eight runs off seven balls. There was to be no redemption in Karachi where he played around a straight one from Nauman to be out for 23. Head looked determined to make amends in Lahore when he grinded his way to 26 off 70 balls but it simply wasn’t his series as Naseem Shah sent down a beauty to find his outside edge. Overall it was massive slide after being named player-of-the-series at the Ashes. But given the limited opportunities and the fact he was often batting with plenty of runs already on the board take his form with a pinch of salt.

CAMERON GREEN — 6.5

155 runs at 51.66 HS 79 one fifty

Three wickets at 57.00 BBI 1-18 SR 134.0

Like in the early stages of the Ashes Cameron Green looked tentative with the bat early. After a slow start he threw his wicket away for 48 when plenty of runs were on offer. He missed out in Karachi too but ended the series on a high with his 79 in Lahore. This was arguably his best knock in Test cricket so far. Australia was 5-206 and the innings could have went either way but Green stepped up and played with an authority beyond his years and experience in Test cricket — this in just his third overseas Test appearance. Only he could stop himself from reaching a century and he went on to admit that thoughts of reaching three figures clouded his mind when he was bowled by Naseem Shah.

Green chipped in with the ball but wasn’t overly dangerous to Pakistan’s batters with the threat of the natural extra bounce his height produces neutered by the slow pitches.

ALEX CAREY — 7.5

179 runs at 59.66 HS 93 two fifties

Alex Carey entered the series under some pressure but he stepped up when it mattered to lock down his spot long-term. Carey’s average of 59.66 was the second-highest of the Australians while he made two fifties in just three innings. His first was a 93 in Karachi where his century dream was crushed by Babar Azam of all people. He backed that up with a 67 in Lahore. There will still be some questions around his ability in quicker bouncier conditions — like at home. But in Pakistan his ability to sweep and reverse sweep on low and slow tracks made him weapon for the Australian middle-order. With the gloves he started the series with a handful of mistakes in Rawalpindi but was back to his best in Karachi and Lahore in what were tough conditions for wicketkeepers.

MITCHELL STARC — 7.5

Eight wickets at 34.12 BBI 4-33 SR 77.0

It was a slow burn for Starc who went wicketless in Rawalpindi but found some form in the final two Tests. The ball started reverse swinging in Pakistan’s first innings in Karachi and Starc swooped exploiting it brilliantly to take 3-29 as Babar’s side was rolled for 148. That couldn’t be reproduced in the second innings but in Lahore it was Starc who blew away Fawad Alam and Mohammad Rizwan in quick succession to set up another spectacular collapse. Starc was quiet for long period of the series but when he wasn’t his impact was arguably like no other.

PAT CUMMINS — 9

12 wickets at 22.50 BBI 5-56 SR 55.0

In what was a brutally tough series for the quicks Cummins still somehow found a way to shine. You simply wouldn’t know how gruelling it was from his figures but two sizzling spells in Lahore saw Cummins blow this series wide open at the death. After one wicket in Rawalpindi and three in Karachi Cummins ripped through Pakistan with his 5-56 in Lahore as the hosts lost 7-20. Two quick wickets in the middle session of the final day to remove Fawad Alam and Mohammad Rizwan put Australia firmly on the path to a historic victory. No other Australian had an average below 34 and none a strike rate below 75. Cummins was simply in a class of his own particularly when it mattered most. He came under fire for not enforcing the follow-on in Karachi although he shouldn’t be blamed for Australia not getting the job done in more than 170 overs. Made a sporting declaration in Lahore that proved to be spot on.

NATHAN LYON — 8

12 wickets at 44.91 BBI 5-83 SR 109.5

It took until the last day of the last Test before we started seeing deliveries spinning sideways and kicking hard out of the rough. After a tortured two-and-a-half years of trying to bowl out sides in the fourth innings Lyon defeated the curse in style with three massive top-order wickets and five in the fourth innings in Lahore overall. It’s not often you get the chance to spin your side to a win on day five. Even less so when the series is up for grabs. It was a clutch performance that should be celebrated given the troubles that preceded it. Earlier in the series Lyon was relatively quiet in a nation where the quicks typically do the damage. He wins more than enough marks for his performance in Lahore alone.

MITCHELL SWEPSON — 4

Two wickets at 133.00 BBI 2-32 SR 272.00

A tough debut series for the leggie but he’ll be better for the experience. Swepson took two wickets in his debut innings — including that of Babar Azam — but it was a gruelling series from there. He ended up not taking another scalp for the rest of the series finishing with a whopping strike rate of 272.00. It should be said that he did have his fair share of bad luck with numerous chances missed off his bowling. In the end Swepson wasn’t nearly as consistent enough with his areas to build pressure and ask enough questions of the batters.

JOSH HAZLEWOOD — 3

No wickets economy 1.96 BBI 0-8

Having only played one Test at the Ashes Hazlewood only played one Test in Pakistan too. And it was the most gruelling of the lot for the fast bowlers who had to toil away on a Rawalpindi road where Pakistan lost just four wickets across 239 overs. Selectors felt like Australia needed two spinners for the remainder of the series and given Mitchell Starc’s reverse swing ability Hazlewood was the one who made way. By no means bowled poorly in the conditions in Rawalpindi but can’t score much higher given it's a mark for the entire series."

Anne Hathaway’s transparency on important hard issues is one of the many reasons we love her. The Oscar-winning actress recently opened up about her past pregnancy journeys for her cover story for WSJ. Magazine. Hathaway not only said she’s open to welcoming a third child in the future but got candid about her fertility issues and postpartum journeys with her two kids.

She said ‘There’s this tendency to portray getting pregnant having kids in one light as if it’s all positive. But I know from my own experience it’s so much more complicated than that. When you find out that your pain is shared by others you just think ‘I just feel that’s helpful information to have so I’m not isolated in my pain.’ I mean what is there to be ashamed of? This is grief and that’s a part of life.’

Hathaway tied the knot with her husband of nearly ten years Adam Schulman back in 2012 in a small ceremony. The two share two sons together named Jonathan Rosebanks 6 and Jack 2.

Speaking from the red carpet of the 2022 Oscars the actor was asked about his choice of performance having previously expressed a desire to feature on the hit reality series.

Garfield was attending the ceremony having earned a nomination for Best Actor for his role in the Netflix-released musical Tick Tick... Boom!

E! presenter Laverne Cox asked Garfield who he would impersonate on Drag Race prompting the actor to visibly agonise over an answer.

“No... no... who’s it going to be? Who would it be?” he said. “Something come. I need something to come. That’s an unfair question to ask in a high-pressure high-stakes environment.”

Closing his eyes in thought he eventually responded: “Meryl.”

“Why not?” he added. “Let’s give it a try. She’s hilarious!”

Kruger and Reedus have known each other since 2015 after meeting on the set of the drama film Sky. A year after meeting they started dating instantly becoming a fan-favorite couple. Then in Nov. 2018 Kruger gave birth to their daughter named Nova which is her first child and Reedus’ second child. Reedus has a son named Mingus Lucien 22 with ex-girlfriend Helena Christensen.

Earlier this year Kruger opened up to the Sunday Telegraph that she’s so grateful that she didn’t become a mama until after her 20s and 30s. She said “I am so glad I did not have a kid at 30. I think I would have absolutely resented it for all the things that you have to give up because today I am happy to do so.”

She added “I have been to every party I have been to every country that I wanted to visit. So I’m 100 percent ready and willing to give my kid that attention. But at 30 I know I would not have been ready to do this properly.”

Jessica Chastain walked off with the Outstanding Lead Actress trophy at Sunday’s 94th annual Academy Awards

for her role as the late titular televangelist in The Eyes of Tammy Faye.

Chastain — who had been slightly favorited to win — prevailed over fellow nominees Olivia Colman (The Lost Daughter) Penélope Cruz (Parallel Mothers) Nicole Kidman (Being the Ricardos) andKristen Stewart (Spencer).

This marks Chastain’s first win; she had been previously nominated for Supporting Actress for 2012’s The Help and Lead Actress for 2013’s Zero Dark Thirty.

In remains to be seen how many people actually watched Chastain’s golden moment. Organizers are hoping this year’s ceremony — hosted by Regina Hall Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes — will rebound from the pandemic-delayed 2021 Oscars which amassed just 10.4 million total viewers — down a whopping 56 percent year-over-year. (Prior to 2020’s first host-less Oscars which were held a month prior to what would be the onset of the COVID pandemic the “record holder” for smallest audience was the 2018 telecast hosted by Jimmy Kimmel which drew 26.5 million viewers.)

Two Minnesota neighbors are among those who seek out old beauties instead—and who have amassed staggering collections of classics.

When Lee Anderson bought his first antique boat a 1938 Chris-Craft Resorter in 1985 he named it after his wife Katharine. “When I was a boy my dad had a wooden boat on the lake in northern Minnesota where we spent the summers” says Anderson 82. “I always wanted one. After Katharine I kind of got the bug.”

More from Robb Report

Forty-five boats later Anderson still owns the 19-footer—which he describes as “not terribly valuable” but one he’ll never sell—as well as the definitive collection of vintage North American boats with many valued in the millions. Anderson is now focusing on pre–World War II one-off race boats such as the 1924 Baby Bootlegger which won the American Power Boat Association Gold Cup in 1924 and 1925 and storied models from then rock-star builders including Gar Wood and Hacker and even rarer Canadian mahogany brands. To make the cut a boat must have a history so intriguing that it makes other collectors jealous. “Scarcity is what’s important to me” he says.

Anderson houses 10 vessels in a special wing of his home on Gull Lake Minn. that doubles as a showroom with tracks that lead down to the shore so he can launch them during the summer. He keeps 12 others in the water under canopies. “I don’t like the boats to not be used” he says. “I try to keep them all going every summer.” Anderson is regularly seen piloting two or three different woodies per day around the lake.

On the same chain of lakes lives John N. Allen (the men’s Naples Fla. homes are close by each other too) who also owns one of the country’s largest and rarest collections of classic wooden boats. “I’d see Lee running those boats before anyone else was interested and it kindled my interest” says Allen 67. His first acquisition: a 1929 Gar Wood triple-cockpit in 2001. “That was 29 boats ago.”

Allen’s collection includes the two oldest Chris-Crafts in existence—both dating to 1922—and a 1926 Gar Wood 33-foot Baby Gar called Bolo Babe powered by a V-12 Liberty engine. He’s now restoring Teaser an almost 40-foot-long fast commuter that in 1925 beat the 20th Century Limited train in a race along the Hudson from New York City to Albany. Allen declines to pick his favorite though it might be easy to guess. “Princess Paige is a 1926 Earl C. Barnes named after my only daughter” he says. “It’s the closest thing I’ve ever seen to a jewel box on the water.”

Allen considers himself a steward of the rare treasures. “So many valuable boats have been destroyed over the years” he says. “I take a lot of pleasure in restoring them and moving them into the future.”

DRI,Darden Restaurants,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzI2L2RhcmRlbi1yZXN0YXVyYW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Darden Restaurants Lowered its Outlook,"The restaurant chain sees a slightly tougher selling environment ahead.

It hasn't been long since Darden Restaurants (DRI -1.19%) stock was popular with investors seeking to bet on a strong growth rebound associated with the waning of the pandemic. The idea was that the owner of major national brands including Olive Garden would see a huge traffic rebound as consumers returned to their pre-pandemic eating habits.

Darden's latest earnings report did show sharp sales gains compared to late 2020. However that surge was tempered by several negative trends that are threatening the chain's short-term sales and earnings outlook.

Let's dive right in.

Sales are up

The growth picture was mixed through late February. On the positive side Darden enjoyed stronger sales gains than management had predicted back in December with revenue jumping 41% to $2.45 billion. Most investors were looking for more modest gains of about 30%. Darden's December selling month was especially strong management said as customers flocked back into restaurants after nearly two years of eating mostly at home.

Yet those gains started to reverse with the rise of the omicron variant of the coronavirus which reduced customer traffic and amplified staffing challenges in January.

Overall then Darden's average weekly sales hardly improved compared to 2019 before the pandemic struck. ""This was a quarter of stark contrasts"" CEO Gene Lee said in a press release .

Expense challenges

Wall Street was bracing for bad news on the earnings front and it turns out that those worries were justified. Darden faced higher costs on food inputs labor transportation and most other expenses. Those spikes were only partly offset by higher menu prices since the company sees low prices as a key competitive advantage.

This situation resulted in shrinking profit margins with third-quarter restaurant-level earnings falling to $467 million compared to $469 million two years earlier. The profit picture won't improve quickly either as inflation is running at about 6% right now for most of Darden's expenses.

Looking ahead

Darden's updated growth outlook translated into a slight downgrade to reflect the weaker start to the 2022 calendar year. Revenue should grow by 9% to 10% overall compared to the mid-December forecast range of between 9% and 11%. Darden's comparable-store sales forecast saw a similarly small reduction.

The company is now planning to open about 35 new stores this fiscal year putting it at the low end of the range it issued a few months ago. And inflation is running slightly faster than executives forecast too at 6% compared to 5.5% back in December.

None of those challenges mean that the business is losing its edge in the restaurant industry. On the contrary Darden is almost sure to set sales and earnings records this year.

But the growth rebound is a bit less dramatic than many investors were expecting and profits are likely to be pressured at least through 2022 by rising food and labor costs.

The stock's decline in the past year already seems to reflect that slight downgrade to the outlook. Darden's returns are also boosted by a quickly growing dividend that today yields over 3%. As a result income investors might consider adding this restaurant giant to their watchlists.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether you need equipment for home or the farm Tri County Equipment has just the right tool for the job. For the past 37 years Tri County has been serving the Thumb Area with full lines of agricultural commercial and residential products. With a massive line of those familiar green and yellow John Deere products Tri County has become the go-to source for agricultural residential landscaping and construction equipment.

Scotty Wadsworth whose family has owned and operated Tri County Equipment since founding the business in Sandusky in 1985 is the sales manager overseeing the growing company and its approximately 175 team members.

“We have a great team of individuals who all pride themselves on doing what we’ve done best for the past 37 years which is taking care of our customers” said Wadsworth. “We know most of our customers by name and can almost predict what they need when they walk in our doors. We’re here to help their business go right even if that business is just the best yard on the block.”

Although Tri County’s main focus is agricultural equipment including tractors combines sprayers balers and more the well-known company also offers residential home and workshop products along with landscaping equipment for homeowners including mowers and side-byside vehicles.

Though Tri County Equipment has become home to countless reliable brands and products it was ultimately the John Deere farm equipment on the Wadsworths’ farm that inspired it all.

The original Sandusky location was an official John Deere dealer and within three years the family opened another location to serve a growing customer base. That expansion has never slowed down. Today along with the original Sandusky location the business has locations in Bad Axe Birch Run Burton Caro Fenton Lapeer Marlette Reese Rochester Hills and Saginaw.

“The size and scale of our operation allows us to be more competitive with our pricing” explained Wadsworth. “We buy the best possible equipment at the best possible prices and we pass on the savings to our customers which is why we have such loyalty among the families and individuals that we’ve been working with for all these years.”

It’s not only their pricing and reliable service that keep people coming back. It’s the fact that Tri County goes above and beyond to ensure that they support the communities that support them. Along with providing substantial support to local programs like 4-H Future Farmers of America (FFA) and county fairs in the surrounding area Tri County also makes it a point to give back as much and as often as they can. Wadsworth himself is a founding member of the nonprofit Goodtimers a group of young men who enjoy raising funds to give back to local communities in times of need.

“Giving back has always been a large part of who we are as a company and I’m happy to carry on that tradition” added Wadsworth.

Ridgeway - Preston Matthew Pettit more commonly known as ""P"" or ""Little Mick"" was welcomed into this world as a special gift from God on December 9 2001. He was the second son of his adoring parents Michael (""Mick"") Pettit and Debra Rectenbaugh Pettit and the ""little"" brother to Brandon Pettit. Brandon and Preston were raised country and bonded by their natural love and genuine compassion for farm animals everything show calves shared competitive nature and the Iowa State Cyclones. Preston was born the little brother Brandon ""never asked for"" but Preston steadily matured and worked his magic to become Brandon's biggest champion and loyal companion.

From the moment he entered the world his infectious mischievous eyes captured many hearts. His admirable personality traits and qualities were many. Preston is repeatedly described as ""a fine young man"" and ""one of the hardest workers I have ever known."" He used his charm to make friends and cut deals. He was precious. He had ""that amazing smile."" He had an old soul and a kind heart. He was a big dreamer and accomplished doer. He was an entrepreneur. He could sell ice to Eskimos. He was unmistakably good with babies. He was a pain-in-the-butt to Brandon's friends. He was persistent yet compassionate. He did not know a stranger. He helped the underdog. He was uniquely creative and an ""out-of-the-box"" thinker. He purposely colored outside the lines. He understood and appreciated the value of experience. He understood the need to give back and help others. He opened doors for others and doors were opening for him.

He identified himself not as a rulebreaker but as a rule bender. He was ornery--but in a loving way. He confidently questioned authority and held his stance. He set a school record for red cards. He disliked the classroom but thrived outdoors and was awarded an Iowa FFA Degree. Purposely squeaking by he earned his Indianola High School diploma in 2020.

He was proud of his trucks. He was riding four-wheelers at the age of four more often than not expertly tilted on two wheels. He achieved his goal of competitive racing with the ""big boys"" at the Warren County Fair (proudly doing an unfortunate but exhibitionist last place lap on two wheels to cheering fans). He moved up to driving tractors by age seven and semis by age nine. He could perfectly back a cattle trailer into a narrow spot on the first attempt. He was John Deere green and had a passion for antique family farm equipment specifically his ""Grandpa R's"" 318 John Deere lawn mower and his ""Grandpa P's"" 4020 John Deere tractor.

He was an athlete. Preston was an ""Indianola Brave"" with a special group of young boys and had an original technique for faking a pitch to pick off a runner. He was a quarterback for the SF 49ers. He was a skilled bowler.

He was a picky eater—two staples were (1) PB&Js with only Skippy Peanut Butter and Smucker's Grape Jelly spread on both insides of the sandwich triangle slices with the crust cut off and (2) Pettit pulled beef sandwiches.

He loved everything country and nothing city. He was ""the guy"" in the neighborhood hired to mow your yard. His lines were perfectly straight and developed into a manicured golf course pattern with each successive cutting of the grass. He was a Trump fan tried and true (able to cast his first vote in 2020). His relationships with older farmers were effortless.

He respected his elders. He created and mastered ""the Grandpa handshake."" His good nature shone in his relationship with his Grandmas not calling out any cheating by ""Grandma P"" and tilling ""Grandma R's"" garden without her having asked.

He unapologetically took the time to enjoy nature his Snaps often capturing picturesque sunrises and sunsets with insightful captions. He was fiercely loyal to his friends and matured into a man with his best friend Chandler Lowry (and the help of his family friend Nathan). He adored his girlfriend Kylie for her strength and beauty both inside and out. He had faith and was grateful. It was important for him to earn respect and make his family and friends proud of him; he did. He stole our hearts. We were all blessed.

He honored and protected his Mom and never denied her a hug. He was wise beyond his years often reminding his Mother to just use common sense--""Don't use a five-dollar word when a fifty-cent word will do."" He was witty informing his Mother when he left home after high school graduation that the dent his truck put in the garage door was simply him leaving her ""a handprint on the wall."" He humored his Mom playing piano letting her take his picture and competing in mock trial. He adored and was proud for his Dad to call him ""my son."" He was the spitting image in temperament and mannerisms of his Dad—without irony nicknaming him ""MickyBobby."" Following in his father's footsteps Preston did and drove everything fast and in his image and in his own way. He learned to drive the tractor and lawnmower through the ""patient"" instruction by his Dad. He was his parents' baby boy and one of two apples of their eyes. We were the ones privileged to be his Mom and Dad.

Most important he was a passionate farmer. He dreamt of making a life on his own farm owning land to plant and harvest crops and nurturing pastures to grow his Red Angus Cattle herd. He was well on his way to realizing that dream having planted his first cornfield by age fourteen combining 200 acres of corn and soybeans for his ""Grandpa R"" by age fourteen baling countless cornstalks and haybales for his Uncle Dave each summer working as a farmhand for neighbor Vinton Red Angus and driving the auger wagon ""dumping on the go"" for his Uncle Scott and ""Grandpa P."" At eleven he started his own Red Angus Cattle Herd with his first heifer calf a labor trade from his mentor and ""third grandpa"" David Vinton and within a few years growing it to a 17-head cattle 17-head calf and 2-bull herd. He insightfully knew his success as a young farmer was blending the experience and wisdom of all of his Grandpas with his keen understanding of new technology. After graduating high school Preston Ozzy and his Red Angus Cattle Herd moved to the Kjos farm in Ridgeway Iowa. There he attended Northeast Iowa Community College and with the mentorship of Carlton Kjos pursued his passion for farming. He was without question destined for success as a dedicated steward of the land and an attentive caretaker of his cattle.

Preston was preceded in death by his great grandparents Lonnie and Lillian Pettit Lucretia (""Tete"") and Arthur (""Art"") Bakerink Ralph and Thelma Rectenbaugh and Vernon and June Gissible.

Preston is survived by his parents and only brother his beloved Australian Shephard Ozzy his cherished girlfriend Kylie McVey his paternal grandparents Lowell and Carmalita (Janet) Pettit his maternal grandparents Dana and Marlyn Rectenbaugh his godparents uncle Joseph and aunt Angela Baudler his farmparents uncle Scott and aunt Melissa Pettit his farmparents uncle David and aunt Audra Rectenbaugh his uncle Todd and aunt Karyn Pettit first cousins Chelsea (Curtis) Travis (daughters Chanelle Stella and Ivy Marlyn) Jasmine (Anthony) Nastasi Amber (Michael) Baudler Ava Alena and Allegra Rectenbaugh Tyler (Rheanna) Pettit (sons Brady and Bentley) Taylor (Natalie) Pettit and Logan Pettit David (Megan) (daughter Arya) Carson Alex and Bradley Pettit too many friends and buddies (young and old) to count and the lives impacted in such a short time here on earth immeasurable.

Peterson talks about the early days in the '90s when the company was just getting started out of his basement in Rochester. Then he breaks down how a a surge in online auction participation slowed manufacturing of new equipment and a low inventory of used equipment have put the farm equipment industry in an unprecedented place.

ROCHESTER Minn. ― Greg Peterson has been charting auction prices before they were accessible on the World Wide Web and he's never seen anything like this.

Due to a surge in online auction participation slowed manufacturing of new equipment and one of the lowest inventories of used equipment ever the market for farm equipment has reached an unprecedented point .

Machinery Pete — one of the largest marketplaces for used farm equipment — was founded over three decades ago by Peterson of Rochester.

Back in 1989 Peterson who's from Benson Minn. started Machinery Pete out of his basement in Rochester where he researched and tracked down auction prices for farm equipment starting in the Midwest and eventually across the country.

Peterson said that the online farm auction industry became ""unbelievable"" starting two years ago this month when the curtain fell and the pandemic hit.

""I could see a quantum leap forward in the farm machinery online space"" said Peterson of the time about two weeks after the pandemic started.

For over a decade before then Peterson said he could see that the farm machinery online space was ""way behind"" the online farm construction auction space. He said pre-pandemic nearly 80% of non-ag equipment sold by Ritchie Bros. — a company that sells industrial equipment and trucks through live and online auctions — were buyers online.

""And on the ag side it was more like 20% maybe up to 35% of online bidders were the winning bidders on a physical auction"" said Peterson.

But when the pandemic set in farm equipment auctioneers were forced to go online only. He said at that point the market was coming off a depressed period which began around 2014. But he could see an uptick starting around 2019.

Peterson said the thought might be that during a pandemic farmers would pull back on spending. But due to a commodity price bump the prices went higher than ever.

""If you went back over my 32 years and charted auction prices against the price of corn — it's a complete direct match"" said Peterson.

Production pinched

Rolling into 2021 the supply chain issues started to arise said Peterson and became more severe as time went on. In February of last year Peterson wrote in Farm Journal Magazine warning of the time ahead.

""I was hesitant to do that but I felt compelled to have to say that if you need anything equipment wise — just get it and don't worry about what you pay for it just get your hands on it"" he said. ""Because if you read the tea leaves this ain't gonna be good because the production of new is going be severely pinched in.""

He said with commodity prices up after a six-year period of downturn equipment was at the top of the list for many farmers. But due to supply chain issues farm operations were not able to invest in upgrading equipment.

""Now you've got all kinds of precision things like precision planting high speed planting and all the data applications — farmers wanted to update"" he said. ""But the manufacturers couldn't make enough and so used values just kept going higher and higher and higher.""

Tidal wave

As 2021 winded down Peterson wrote again to expect a ""tidal wave"" of year-end tax buying. He said that even though some accountants say the Section 179 tax deduction is overdone a lot of farmers use it as a strategy to save on taxes which Peterson said ""they get hit from every angle"" on.

""And so the end of 2021 was incredible"" he said of used machinery prices. ""I've never seen anything like it — and honestly it's gotten higher in 2022.""

Peterson said he hasn't seen prices like this in his 32 years and he said it's dangerous for farmers to just assume it's only due to inflation. The underlying issue lies in a very low used inventory level.

""The driving factor is the tightness with used inventory levels on dealer lots around the country the tightest ever"" said Peterson.

Recently to get an understanding on the situation Peterson and his team ran the numbers on a single category — 175-plus horse power tractors — at Machinery Pete. Picking one day -- Feb. 18 — they looked back three years and compared the dates.

""It was confirmed what we knew anecdotally"" he said. ""There's 79.3% fewer five-year old tractors for sale on dealer lots now than three years ago.""

In the past Peterson said whenever commodity prices fell and profit conditions became more negative there was always excess used inventory sitting around the country.

""And now there's not"" he said. ""You've got to look backwards at how many new units in tractors combine sprayers and planters were sold in 2015 2016 '17 '18 and '19 — and those numbers were all down.""

Peterson's advice for farmers looking to purchase machinery in the near future is to think long term and more aggressively. And farmers' relationships with their dealers will become much more important through the end of this year.

""Just stay in closer communication with your dealer maybe than you had before so that if come harvest they're aware of what you're thinking"" he said. ""I would be a little more proactive with your dealer; that'd be my advice.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9ubGluZS5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy90ZXJyeS1hbGFuLXdoaXBwbGUtMTkzOC0yMDIyLDI4Njc1MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Terry Alan Whipple: 1938-2022 | The Daily Chronicle,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://www.chronline.com/stories/terry-alan-whipple-1938-2022,286750 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9ubGluZS5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy90ZXJyeS1hbGFuLXdoaXBwbGUtMTkzOC0yMDIyLDI4Njc1MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

A group of Orthodox Jewish girls who were barred from two flights last summer is suing Delta Air Lines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines for discrimination according to a lawsuit.

The 19 plaintiffs from New York were part of a 54-person tour group of Jewish teenagers and their chaperones visiting religious sites in Europe including Holocaust memorials in Ukraine and the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland from late July until early August last year.

In a complaint filed on Tuesday the plaintiffs allege that treatment on their return journey was ""a devastating reminder at the hands of Delta Air Lines and KLM Airlines that antisemitism and discrimination against the Jewish race continue in 2021.""

During the first leg of the group's journey home — a KLM-operated flight from Kyiv to Amsterdam on August 6 2021 — flight attendants disciplined the girls for failing to comply with COVID-19 safety protocols Insider previously reported.

Some tour group members took off their masks to eat homemade kosher food. According to the complaint a flight attendant disciplined them for removing their face coverings to eat outside of the plane's designated mealtimes.

Other passengers who snacked outside of the allotted time for eating were not disciplined the complaint said.

The Orthodox Jewish girls were given a ""final warning"" notice for unacceptable behavior and non-compliance with COVID-19 protocols which threatened them with arrest if they failed to comply the complaint said.

The KLM staff targeted them with warnings ""solely for the purpose of unlawfully harassing plaintiffs because of their Jewish race ethnicity and/or religion"" the complaint alleges.

During a layover in Amsterdam a KLM security official told the group they would not all be able to board their flight home. A document barring 19 passengers from boarding the Amsterdam to New York flight was presented to the group according to the complaint.

The list of barred passengers from the group of 54 included two tour group members who the complaint said had not traveled on the first leg of the trip from Kyiv to Amsterdam with the girls accused of breaking COVID-19 protocols.

""By barring Plaintiffs from traveling without any regard to their individual conduct Defendants sought to target and penalize the group of Jewish passengers as a whole by barring 19 of its members from traveling"" the complaint said.

Last August the group's rabbi Yisroel Kahan told Insider that he spent the night calling New York lawmakers including Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand to reach out to Delta Air Lines to remedy the situation.

The following morning on August 7 2021 the plaintiffs were booked onto a Delta flight to New York. Once on the plane one of the girls swapped seats with an unaffiliated passenger.

A video reviewed by Insider appeared to show a woman confirming that she asked the teenager to switch seats with her.

According to the complaint the plaintiffs were ordered off the plane for ""misbehaving.""

The complaint said that the plaintiffs accused Delta of discrimination and treated the group ""differently and worse than non-Jewish passengers"" who had tried to move seats without being disciplined.

It is also alleged that a KLM security official repeatedly taunted the tour group while they waited in the airport after being deplaned.

The group was offered a flight reservation for later that day but it would have involved traveling after the start of Shabbat — the Jewish day of rest when observant Jews are not allowed to travel by car or plane. They spent the night in Antwerp Belgium and traveled home to New York with United Airlines on August 8 2021.

They are now asking for compensatory and punitive damage and per the complaint for Delta and KLM to comply with US federal and state anti-discrimination law and to be prohibited from ""discriminating on the basis of race ethnicity and religion and in particular discriminating against Jewish persons.""

""While Delta has no specific comment on this pending litigation compliance with flight crew member instructions for the safety and well-being of everyone is paramount"" a Delta Air Lines spokesperson told Insider by email. ""Delta also has zero-tolerance for discrimination in any form in all aspects of our business.""

Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors

The move by the Federal Aviation Administration will let leading airlines keep their dominant positions at major airports into late October even if they drop some international flights.

Normally airlines that fail to use their assigned rights or “slots” at John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in New York and Reagan National Airport outside Washington risk losing them. However regulators waived that rule in March 2020 when airlines cut flights due to the pandemic.

The FAA has extended the slot-use waiver four times with the last grace period set to expire Sunday. Instead the FAA will extend the waiver for international flights only through Oct. 29 it said in a decision scheduled to be published in the Federal Register next week.

The agency cited “the evolving and highly unpredictable situation globally” around COVID-19.

The FAA will also extend relaxed rules regarding flight schedules at Newark (New Jersey) Liberty Airport Chicago O’Hare Los Angeles International and San Francisco International.

The waivers were supported by the trade group for large U.S. airlines plus Lufthansa British Airways and other big international carriers. Smaller airlines often oppose such measures which they say make it harder for them to grow at the busiest airports.

The FAA’s action comes as U.S. air travel edges closer to pre-pandemic levels.

More than 2 million people per day have passed through airport security checkpoints in March a decline of 13% from the same month in 2019 according to government figures. Trade group Airlines for America says international travel to and from the U.S. is down 42% from 2019.

With plenty of options on the table to get from New York City to Nice France I opted for Delta Air Lines and its Delta One suite product on the Airbus A330-900neo to Paris in a bid to understand if anything material had changed in the two-plus years since I had tried it.

Right off the bat it was clear that Delta’s digital game was strong but not without some weak points. A few days before departure I received an email providing the option to pre-order my meal. The menu featured a few interesting selections that were specifically tailored for the high-value New York-Paris route — a nice touch! Later I observed that the pre-order option was used by most of the passengers around me so Delta is clearly doing a good job of communicating this option before the date of departure.

On the other hand the recently relaunched FlyReady platform that Delta uses for COVID-19 document verification was a letdown. I was able to upload my proof of vaccination for entry into France but after quickly verifying the information the platform reverted back to pending status. The system also prompted me to fill out a passenger locator form but brought me to a French website that did not contain that form and provided no way to upload proof that I had filled out the form. Every time I told the system that I had completed the form it reverted back to saying it was incomplete. Thankfully whatever information I managed to provide was enough as I was able to receive my boarding passes in the Delta app without issue.

I popped into the SkyClub at JFK T4 for a few minutes before boarding finding that the lounge was overcrowded. I did manage to find a space to sit but it simply wasn’t a relaxing spot.

A few hot food options were enjoyable as a pre-departure snack and the bar was well stocked.

I was disappointed that the Sky Deck — an outdoor terrace overlooking the ramp — was closed but understand why that would be the case on a chilly day.

After boarding I settled into seat 2A and took a look at some of the changes made since I last flew this product in 2019. An amenity kit and menu were waiting for me at the seat. I observed that both of these items are now being served up in a more eco-friendly manner. The amenity kit claims to be made from natural and recycled materials while the menu was a single page listing only the main meal options.

A QR code was provided on the menu linking to a page with the full menu of snacks and drinks. I like this hybrid approach as it lets me see the important details of the meal options but doesn’t waste paper on telling me what beverages are available. Short of simply providing this information on the entertainment screen this is a clever idea.

Following a lengthy delay due to de-icing after a sudden but quick burst of snow we were on our way and the flight attendants kicked into high gear to serve the main meal. My pre-ordered meal was delivered all on one tray consisting of a salad soup bread main course and ice cream. Ordinarily I would object to this method of serving a meal but on a redeye flight I prefer speed and efficiency over presentation. I opted for one of the two special meals a beef short rib pasta dish with a delicious tomato-based soup.

I noted with interest that the Delta Flight Products entertainment system onboard the A330-900neo offered quite a bit more content than the other Panasonic Avionics IFE-fitted Delta aircraft I had flown in prior weeks on domestic flights.

The home screen boasted that 312 movies 566 television show episodes and 784 audio titles were available. This is down a bit from a 2019 flight on the A330neo but overall it was still a better selection than on other Delta aircraft recently. Moreover the system interface flowed nicely.

The A330neo also features upgraded satellite Wi-Fi compared to the rest of Delta’s widebody fleet — i.e. it is the Gogo-branded Intelsat 2Ku-powered solution rather than the original more traditional Ku-band system but I didn’t partake in connectivity on this overnight flight.

I tried to get as much sleep as I could but I never found myself comfortable enough to do so. The footwell is still a bit too small for my personal taste and while the sliding door is nice I questioned the privacy benefit since I wasn’t able to see any other passengers with the door open.

Overall though this was a very pleasant experience despite the minor inconveniences that presented themselves along the way. The Delta One suite on the A330neo isn’t perfect nor is it my favorite seat but it is leaps and bounds better than what preceded it at Delta. I wouldn’t hesitate to choose it again.

This was stated by AIFA through its Facebook account where it detailed that the airlines that will provide their services will be Delta and Copa Airlines and that they will join Volaris VivaAerobus and Aeromexico which are already in operation at the new airport.

It is worth mentioning that so far AIFA has six national routes: Tijuana Cancun Monterrey Guadalajara Villahermosa and Mérida. The only international route so far is to Caracas with the Venezuelan airline Conviasa. Therefore it is expected that it will be able to expand its offer during the course of the year.

AIFA is controversial because since 2018 it has replaced Mexico's New International Airport (NAIM) a modern work of Enrique Peña Nieto's six-year term (2012-2018) which in turn aroused criticism for building on Lake Texcoco and with contracts questioned for alleged corruption.

López Obrador has assured that the work in Saint Lucia has saved 125 billion pesos (about 6.24 billion dollars) and that AIFA will officially cost almost 75 billion pesos (about 3743 million dollars) although research conducted a few days ago by the newspaper El Universal estimated the price at almost 116000 million pesos (just over $5.79 billion).

In addition the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has expressed doubts about the air and ground connectivity of the new airport which operates simultaneously with the current Mexico City International Airport (AICM)."

Jessica Rinaldi | Reuters

ExxonMobil  the top oil and gas producer in the U.S. is piloting a project to mine bitcoin in North Dakota according to people with knowledge of the matter. For over a year Exxon has been working with Crusoe Energy Systems a company based in Denver said the people who asked not to be named because details of the project are confidential. Crusoe's technology helps oil companies turn wasted energy or flare gas into a useful resource. Similar to ConocoPhillips ' mining scheme in North Dakota's Bakken region Exxon is diverting natural gas that would otherwise be burned off into generators which convert the gas into electricity used to power shipping containers full of thousands of bitcoin miners. Exxon launched the pilot in late January 2021 and expanded its buildout in July. While Exxon hasn't talked publicly about its work in the space Eric Obrock a 10-year veteran at the company said on his LinkedIn profile that from February 2019 to January 2022 he ""proposed and led the first successful commercial and technical demonstration of using Bitcoin Proof-of-Work mining as a viable alternative to natural gas flaring in the oil patch."" Obrock's title on his profile is NGL industry outlook advisor referring to the natural gas liquids market. Obrock told CNBC through a LinkedIn message that he's been advised that he can't speak to the media on this topic. Exxon didn't respond to a request for comment. Exxon's bitcoin project isn't really about making money from the cryptocurrency. Rather the company has pledged to reduce emissions as part of an industrywide effort to meet higher environmental demands. In early March Exxon joined other oil companies in committing to the World Bank's ""Zero Routine Flaring by 2030"" initiative introduced in 2015. The type of crypto mining arrangement it's pursuing with Crusoe reduces CO2-equivalent emissions by about 63% compared with continued flaring. Exxon's bitcoin mining work in North Dakota was first reported by Bloomberg which said the company is also considering similar pilots in Alaska the Qua Iboe Terminal in Nigeria Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale field Guyana and Germany.

Mining bitcoin in the Bakken

The problem Exxon and Conoco are addressing has existed for years: What happens when drillers accidentally hit a natural gas formation? Unlike oil which can be trucked out to a remote destination gas delivery requires a pipeline. If a drilling site is close to a pipeline producers can sell it right away. But if the pipe is full or if the gas is 20 miles away drillers often burn it off. That's why you typically see flames rising from oil fields. In addition to the environmental hazards drillers are also burning cash. Enter bitcoin mining which only requires an internet connection and can be done from anywhere. And because miners' primary variable cost is energy they're incentivized to find the cheapest sources of power. ""This is just a great way to bring that demand to the wasted energy and solve two problems at once"" said Cully Cavness president of Crusoe whose backers include Valor Equity Partners one of Tesla 's largest investors. ""Solve the energy appetite of bitcoin and solve the stranded energy flare gas problem for the energy industry."" Cavness said Crusoe has 150 employees and works with Norway's Equinor ASA  Canadian oil producer Enerplus and Devon Energy  based in Oklahoma City.

Permits from North Dakota's Division of Air Quality show Crusoe can run 20 portable engines with 11 currently in use at well sites across the state. Two of the engines are operational at wells run by XTO Energy Exxon's oil and gas fracking subsidiary at the Jorgenson Deep Creek Site. Cavness said most of Crusoe's 80-plus data centers are deployed in the Bakken. ""We're really moving the needle on flared volumes"" Cavness said. ""More than 10 million cubic feet of gas per day that would be flared is not flared because we've deployed our systems."" The World Bank in its most recent Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership report recognized Crusoe as offering an innovative solution to flaring.

Solving the methane problem

The Bakken formation became an important source of new oil production in the U.S. in the last couple decades with the boom in hydraulic fracturing or fracking. Craig Thorstenson has been working at the permitting program at North Dakota's Division of Air Quality since 1989. He says North Dakota has always been an oil state to some extent but growth in the Bakken lifted the state to second in the country before it slipped to third last year. Thorstenson who was born and raised in Bismarck the state capital said the change ""was quite a shock for us."" Residential housing couldn't keep up with demand. ""We were having a population boom"" Thorstenson said. ""People coming in wanting to get jobs. People living in the Walmart parking lots."" More drilling meant more wasted gas which affected the entire Williston Basin that spreads across part of Montana the Dakotas and into Canada. That's a big reason why Crusoe invested heavily in the area. ""At points in not-that-distant history the basin was flaring almost up to a fifth of the gas that was being produced there"" said Cavness. Thorstenson said the amount of wasted natural gas is finally trending lower. In a March report North Dakota's Department of Natural Resources estimated that currently 93% to 94% of natural gas is being captured. In 2014 the commission had a capture goal of 74%. Drillers have historically chosen flaring as a way to dispose of excess gas because it's less damaging to the environment than venting which releases methane directly into the air and produces greenhouse effects that have proven to be 84 to 86 times as powerful as CO2 over a 20-year period. Even with flaring some methane does escape due to wind and other factors. On-site bitcoin mining can be especially impactful because 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air according to Adam Ortolf who runs business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities. ""Nobody will run it through a generator unless they can make money because generators cost money to acquire and maintain"" Ortolf said. ""So unless it's economically sustainable producers won't internally combust the gas."" Crusoe's systems are built to make the process financially viable for drillers. The company brings its equipment onto the oil pad allowing it to convert otherwise wasted natural gas into electricity which then powers computing at the well site. ""When we put it through our generator we get up to 99.9% combustion of that methane"" Cavness said. ""Not only are we using the otherwise wasted energy we're also significantly reducing methane emissions."" Cavness said his main takeaway from the United Nations' latest global climate summit in Glasgow Scotland was that methane is the low-hanging fruit. ""That's the thing we want to solve as an energy industry"" he said.

Although the village may seem sleepy at first glance it is home to vibrant locals locked in a battle with the Devil dating back thousands of years.

In recent weeks the village has caught the eyes of thousands across the country as March 22 saw the launch of Channel 4 reality show The Simpler Life where contestants must live in an Amish-style community.

While the village may seem trapped in time Shebbear has been impacted by national events with housing demand the energy crisis and access to services all taking its toll. DevonLive went behind the cameras to find out more about the past present and future of Shebbears ""Simpler Life"" and how its residents are keeping its community spirit alive.

""The first time I was asked to turn the stone was very special.""

The village is home to one of the oldest traditions in Northern Europe. Residents from all over Torridge gather in the Village Square every November 5 to turn the which trapped the devil thousands of years ago. The stone is believed to be the resting place of the Devil who was trapped under the ground after a long battle with archangel Michael.

Legend has it that not turning the stone will bring misfortune to the village. with some saying the last time it was left unturned was 1939 - the year World War II began.

For decades the Turning of the Stone was carried out by the Acklands a family of bell-ringers who have called Shebbear their home since 1790. Ron Ackland 88 has lived in Shebbear for most of his life - only a stone's throw away from the legendary stone.

Mr Ackland said: ""The stone turning was very special for me because my whole family used to do it. We used to get big crowds and before video we had it on the radio one year.""

""The first time I was asked to turn the stone was very special because I was the youngest one trusted to do it. I was a kid amongst grown ups.

""When I first started turning the stone it would just be six men and a dog watching it. Now the pub puts on an event and it's become the biggest day in Shebbear's calendar. It pleases me to see young people getting involved and I believe the tradition will carry on long after I'm gone.""

While villages traditions are going from strength to strength Shebbear is far from a village trapped in time. Development of new homes in the area technological advancements and migration of vital services has impacted the landscape of the village as well as how residents interact.

Ron has seen the seemingly timeless village adapt and change over the years. Growing up Shebbear boasted a variety of shops including three grocery shops a bakers butchers and a shoemakers. Today only the village shop remains.

Ron said: ""Because we were kids during the war everyone sort of banded together. I remember six people would raise a pig together. One of them would kill it and they would share the meat around. Of course that doesn't happen anymore but it shows there was a real community spirit in those days.""

He added: ""There was just an openness back in those days. Nobody shut their doors let alone lock them. Everybody knew everybody back then - I used to know every person in Shebbear without exception. I don't know half the people here now. It's just the way the world's gone - I think every village is the same. More houses are being built and you just don't know who is moving in.""

It is not only social interaction that has been effected but also access to services. In September 2021 the Department of Work and Pensions announced that pensions could no longer be collected from Post Office Card Accounts used by 900000 people across the UK at its peak.

With little access to internet banking Ron must now travel to Bideford in order to collect his pension. Ron said he was worried he may have to travel even further in branches continued to close throughout Torridge.

He said: ""They are closing lots of banks at the moment and if my bank closes their branch in Bideford that will be a bit of a disaster. Barnstaple might stay but with how things are going they may close the blimmin' lot.

""I don't need to go very often but you need somewhere to put in or take out money. Saying that these days people don't use real money anymore.""

Despite the wealth of change in the village many residents have committed themselves to preserving the past for future generations.

Ron is a member of the village's history group which recently reconvened after a two year hiatus due to the COVID pandemic. Now the group wishes to work with other villages in Torridge to protect and celebrate the region's rural past.

Ron said: ""I think preserving the history of our area is vital. I have hundreds and hundreds of photographs of the village over the years. It means a lot to me.""

""I see a lot of people whose family moved away from Shebbear who want to find out more about their lives here. I've had people come from America Canada - all over the place the discover their roots. With his children relocating elsewhere to have successful careers Ron said he will be the last of his family to live in the village.

He said: ""I believe Shebbear is very much a part of me and I have had a very good life. The only thing is there used to be two Ackland families in Shebbear and now I'm the last one. That saddens me greatly to think that a family as big as ours was is now gone.""

""To get to the nearest post office from here - if you don't drive - would be a very long bus trip.""

Shebbear lost its post office almost a decade ago with the role now served by a mobile post van. The mobile post office based in Woolsery parks in the village square between 9:10am and 11:20 five days a week.

Mobile postal worker David Logan said Shebbear was the busiest stop on his route. During the week he also visits Merton Meeth Monkleigh Langtree Buckland and Clovelly.

Mr Logan said: ""The service is essential to Shebbear I think. That's not me trying to big up the van but it's the feedback we get from the community. All of the villages we visit used to have post offices but they have since closed. To get to the nearest post office from here - if you don't drive - would be a very long bus trip.

He added: ""It's a lovely little job. After doing this for a while you see people from the area walk over or park up and you know exactly who it is and what they want."" To get to the nearest post office based in Black Torrington a Shebbear resident would have to travel at least 28 minutes by bus.

""Obviously the weather is a challenge in this job. Considering the areas we go to. If it's too wet or too icy then obviously we won't be able to come out. Luckily for us the local community always try their hardest to give us somewhere to go.""

He added: ""There was no change during the pandemic - we were just extremely busy. Of course we had to follow all the guidelines but the days and times were no different and we worked the whole way through the pandemic.""

""Our key aim to create a really strong community feel""

With the village changing with the times the future is kept bright in Shebbear thanks to the families who call it home.

Shebbear boasts two schools - Shebbear Community Primary School and Shebbear College with the Community School currently educating approximately 70 pupils.

Headteacher Nick Alford is working at a fortunate time for his post. Mr Alford has run the school for four years from an office which served as living quarters for the headteachers before him.

Mr Alford said running a rural school presented unique challenges compared to his previous London roles. ""I think the biggest challenge is that because the number of children are so much lower than in the city we have quite tight margins. If one child leaves the school that can potentially have a big impact.""

""Because of the numbers the experience the children get is much more inclusive. Staff get to know the children much better and the children know each other a lot better as well. This means you really gets the best out of the children as they learn to take care of each other.""

Mr Alford said the school gave parents and children the opportunity to regularly socialise and becoming involved in the community. He said: ""Our key aim to create a really strong community feel which is really important in such a rural location.""

""We have seen an influx in people moving to Shebbear since lockdown. Lots of families have moved here looking for a different lifestyle. Those children have really integrated well which helps families contribute to the local community.""

With the COVID pandemic affecting rural areas across the country the school is looking forward to returning to normalcy. The school was unable to hold it's nativity in December but now plan to hold it in the Summer - allowing no efforts to go to waste.

Although Shebbear seems isolated from the rest of the country the school has also driven efforts to provide their children with a wider world view. Since the pandemic guest speakers from a variety of religions and ethnicities have held virtual lessons for pupils.

Shebbear Community School have regularly held fundraisers in aid of international causes. Most recently pupils wore yellow and blue for the Ukrainian Crisis Appeal raising £451.

Mr Alford said he wishes to provide children with the tools to benefit the local community for years to come. He said: ""I would hope that some children would stay in the area. We have many parents and grandparents who grew up here and now bring their children here. It is important to keep the heritage of the school going and for children to remember those who came before them.""

""I'd imagine there's going to be a renewed focus on Shebbear""

At the heart of every great village is its pub with none more iconic than Shebbear's Devil's Stone Inn. The pub has recently come under new owners with Suzy and Lee Cremer holding the reigns since May 2021. In ten months the pub has already hosted a variety of community events - including the stone turning itself.

Since re-opening the doors of the Grade II building the couple have strived to renovate the pub into a vibrant community space. In addition to quiz nights and live music events the Devil's Stone Inn has also hosted special events for residents including a children's Halloween party which attracted families from Bude to South Molton.

The pub also plans to dedicate its space to reflect Shebbear's vibrant history and local talent. Suzy said: ""People are only just getting used to coming back out and socialising again and there a lot of people who are new to the village who haven't had the opportunity to meet others in the community.

""It's easier for those who move here with kids as they can form connections at the school. For older people it can be harder to make friends so it is vital to have the pub as a social space they feel they can call home.""

The pub was occupied by Channel 4 film crews during the summer as part of its new series the Simpler Life where contestants must attempt to live in an Amish-style community. The Devil Stone Inn and the Village Shop have been featured in the series with film crews setting up in the pub during the summer.

Suzy said the series which was mainly filmed in Libbear Barton has made Shebbear a national focus. ""I'd imagine there's going to be a renewed focus on Shebbear with the Simpler Life being filmed in Libbear Barton. It was a great time for us to be involved at such an early stage and we are pleased for the cast and crew that the show seems to be well received.""

Suzy said: ""I'm really trying to diversify the pub to make it more appealing to those who aren't necessarily a pub-goer. On quiet days it actually creates a great social space for people to hold activities.

With COVID-restrictions ending Suzy and Lee are optimistic that patron confidence will recover this year with events planned for Mothers Day Easter and the Queen's Jubilee.

Residents in Shebbear pay some of the highest energy costs in Devon with the average household paying £1206 on energy in 2021. With prices set to increase in April Suzy said she is concerned it will discourage patrons from coming together.

She said: ""The energy prices are what worries me most this year. It's not just our costs that have spiralled - everyone else in the village is affected and that's going to give them less money to spend on enjoying themselves.

""Everyone has their backs against the wall and you keep hearing that businesses have to increase their prices to stay afloat. I can't exactly put mine up - the buck has to stop somewhere.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldm9ubGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy91ay13b3JsZC1uZXdzL2Nvc3QtcGludC1iZWVyLXVwLTQ1cC02ODY0MTIy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cost of a pint of beer 'up 45p' as major pub chain rises prices,"Something went wrong please try again later.

One of the biggest breweries in the UK is reportedly increasing the price of a pint of beer by up to 45p. Marston's which has more than 1500 pubs said it has had to hike prices due to rising costs including energy.

It's a further blow to Brits coping with spiralling food fuel and energy prices. Add in a rise in national insurance and increased bills for some mobile and TV packages and it's looking to be a financially tight summer for millions.

The hospitality sector has also been hit the Mirror reports. It is facing its own costs soaring and the price of bitter has escalated over the past year.

Prices are going to go up between 20p and 45p at Marston’s with the average price in the UK for a pint of beer £3.96 reported The Sun. The cost of beer varies around the country peaking in London where there is an average of £6 and £5.10 in Edinburgh but it is also over £4 in many cities including Liverpool and Birmingham.

A Marston’s spokesman was quoted in the Express & Star saying: “The price increase is a direct impact of the soaring energy prices and operating costs as being experienced by all businesses and households across the country.”

More than 250 business leaders including Marston's had urged the Government to keep VAT at 12.5 per cent to help the recovery of fragile hospitality and leisure firms. In a letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak in February 261 hospitality and leisure business leaders warned that April’s planned rise to 20 per cent will “exacerbate the squeeze on household finances”.

They said customers are feeling the pinch from increasing costs while firms face higher prices for labour energy and food and drink supplies. However the Chancellor stuck with the rise to 20 per cent in his spring statement on Wednesday.

Business leaders also fear that April could be a “cliff edge” for the hospitality industry as the VAT increase was set to happen alongside a rise in the national minimum wage plus changes to business rate relief and an end to the rent moratorium.

A Treasury spokesperson said at the time: “We’ve supported hospitality jobs and businesses throughout the pandemic with our £400 billion package of funding and continue to do so.

“We’ve always been clear that the lower rate of VAT was a temporary measure to support businesses as they recover and thanks to the strength of our fantastic vaccine programme which has enabled restrictions to be lifted and the economy to reopen it’s right that our package of support reflects this.”

Marston's has been approached for a comment.",,,,,,

Reuters had previously reported that EP was exploring a sale of oil-producing acreage in Utah in hopes of averting an FTC challenge to its agreed $1.5 billion takeover by private equity firm EnCap.

The FTC said the deal without the sale of the assets in Utah would have left just three significant producers that sell Uinta Basin crude oil to refiners in Salt Lake City and led to higher prices for consumers.

“Without this divestiture Salt Lake City refiners would likely have faced increased prices for Uinta Basin crude oil whether from EnCap alone or as part of a small group – and would likely try to pass on those costs to consumers” said Bureau of Competition Director Holly Vedova.

Under EnCap’s agreement with the FTC it will sell EP’s assets in Utah to Crescent Energy Company which will be a new competitor in the Uinta Basin the FTC said. That deal was announced in February.

EnCap Energy Capital Fund XI L.P. operates multiple portfolio companies involved in the energy sector particularly dealing with oil and gas operations that include exploration processing and distribution. EP Energy Corp. also headquartered in Texas has oil and natural gas production operations in the Uinta Basin in Utah and in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas.

The FTC has rarely opposed oil and gas producer mergers with the last challenge more than 20 years ago. It took the view that energy prices are driven by supply and demand worldwide rather than regional consolidation. Its opposition to EP Energy’s sale marks a potential change in stance.

Head to the metaverse,"The real estate world is making itself at home in the metaverse that digital kingdom in which thousands of intangible properties are sold for millions of dollars every day and where someone can also become the owner of a stunning mansion for no more than $2400 – provided you can pay in the cryptocurrency the platform requires.

Just as in the physical real estate market the final cost depends on when the deal is done the metaverse in question the size of the property and its location. With great speed a colossal digital real estate market is coming into being above all since last year when Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook’s name to Meta. Since then interest in this parallel universe has taken off and the key factors are speculation major asset volatility and reasonable doubts as to whether all these bricks which can’t even be touched will create a new internet bubble.

Sales in the four principal metaverses – Sandbox Decentraland Cryptovoxels and Somnium – reached $501 million in 2021 according to MetaMetric Solutions. During 2021 268645 virtual properties (digital assets) were sold. Of these 62% belonged to Sandbox and had an average price of $12700 per plot. This metaverse and Decentraland are the most popular although also the most expensive. In fact some sales have exceeded several million dollars. It’s estimated that in 2022 sales will double up to a billion dollars. The cofounder of the digital real estate business Metaverse Group Michael Gord explained the potential to The New York Times: “Imagine if you came to New York when it was farmland and you had the option to get a block of SoHo.”

One of the digital mansions on sale in the Keys metaverse.

That’s why there is a growing number of real estate businesses and luxury real estate agents jumping feet first into this universe where the participants interact using avatars. This week the residential properties of a new metaverse Keys have gone on sale. Up for grabs are 8888 digital mansions realistic and rendered in 3D and available for the holders of the currency key.

The owner of Prestige Realty Group Tony Rodríguez-Tellaheche who operates in Miami has bought 18 of these residences which is the maximum for each virtual wallet. The price per mansion is about $2460 (which corresponds to 0.88 ethereum according to its value last Friday). “It’s like the real world. I want to resell various metamansions in the future but I’d also like to hold onto others for a longer time. Sometime in the future we want to have a meeting like this [referring to the video call] in my mansion in the metaverse” he says. Following the sale of its residential zoning this metaverse will sell properties where one can construct whatever they like. For example “you can open a furniture company for digital mansions or for physical sales with shipments to your real house” he says.

Rodríguez-Tellaheche is convinced of the potential of the revaluation of the mansions that he has just purchased as has already happened in other metaverses. “I sell real estate in Miami where houses are 35% more expensive than two years ago because there’s no stock and a lot of demand. In the Keys metaverse the same thing will happen some will have more value than many real-world houses” says this agent who is convinced that the next bubble is coming.

Another mansion available in Keys.

The virtual real estate development business Everyrealm which was previously known as Republic Realm is present in 13 metaverses. It has the world record so far for the highest such payment: $4.3 million for a virtual plot in Sandbox. The seller was the video game company Atari. Their business strategy as announced is to achieve an attractive cost effectiveness adjusted to risk through the acquisition management development and sale of digital plots. The brand has already created a museum of digital culture for NFTs a mall and the first university – all in the metaverse. In August 2021 it designed Fantasy Islands a luxury residence in Sandbox anchored in 100 islands which sold out within 24 hours. The starting price was $15000 although resales have reached $300000.

Another example is that of Metaverse Group which has bought a property in Decentraland for $2.43 million to host fashion events and retail stores. A host of businesses large brands and investors is beginning to buy properties to build their commercial spaces. No one wants to miss this train although many companies don’t know at the moment if it will arrive to its destination or fly off the rails. Nike Adidas Sotheby’s PwC JP Morgan Samsung – the list is immense – have already spent a fortune. There’s enormous commercial opportunity for these businesses which can advertise themselves and organize events for a younger digital audience.

The Spanish universe

That’s what’s happening in the first Spanish metaverse. Uttopion is the platform selected by Lanzadera the startup accelerator created by Juan Roig the president of Spanish supermarket chain Mercadona. This metaverse has recently put its first thousand properties on presale for a price of between $2200 and $22000. It’s divided into communities. “We have two one focused on music and another on sports. In each there are 500 finite properties. There aren’t going to be any more because they’re created using NFT technology” says Soraya Cadalso the cofounder. In their digital properties which for now can be bought with euros it’s possible to build a virtual replica of a club a concert hall a stadium or a festival. Although there are also plots for other activities: cryptobanks trade... “The buyer can do anything from position their brand to sell products or give exclusive content to clients” Cadalso explains.

Once acquired by the owner each property is an NFT guaranteed by a unique code through a digital contract which can be used sold or rented. “Fewer than 20 days ago we closed the presale registry and we began with the sale of the Terras [as their properties are named]. Since then 30% of the Terras have been sold” Cadalso says. The sizes run from about 4300 square feet for the smallest ($2200) to 42000 square feet for the largest ($22000).

Also in Spain Metrovacesa is the first promoter to immerse itself in the metaverse although still in a limited form. It doesn’t sell digital property rather real property thanks to its alliance with the Spanish start-up Datacasas Proptech. This test of concept begins with the promotion of Málaga Towers in Decentraland with the possibility of accessing other virtual worlds in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taW5ndGlhbmRpLmNvbS9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS9maW5hbmNlL2Vzci1wb3N0cy1yZWNvcmQteWVhci1pbi0yMDIxLXNldC10by1mb2N1cy1vbi1kYXRhLWNlbnRyZXMtcmVpdHMtaW4tMjAyMi1leHBhbnNpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ESR Posts Record Earnings for $377M for 2021,"ESR is planning to set up more real estate investment trusts and grow its data centre business after notching a record year in 2021 according to its chairman Jeffrey Perlman.

The Hong Kong-listed fund management giant saw its assets under management jump 32 percent year on year to an all-time high of $39.4 billion in 2021 and posted record earnings attributable to shareholders of $377 million based on its unaudited annual financial statement released late Thursday.

“2021 was another record year for ESR which was further punctuated by the transformational acquisition of ARA to create APAC’s largest real asset manager powered by the new economy” ESR Group Chairman Jeffrey Perlman said. “As capital partners seek to deploy more and more capital with fewer managers in Asia Pacific the ESR Group strives to deliver a fully integrated one-stop solution which will be fuelled by the leading new economy real estate platform with $59 billion in AUM and a development WIP (work-in-progress) of over $10 billion across Asia Pacific.”

Perlman noted the firm also posted new record highs in other aspects of its business including leasing fundraising and development project launches – which he sees enabling the group to focus on pursuing asset light development expansion of its data centre business and fostering of the REITs it sponsors as it progresses through 2022.

Japan China Bolster Earnings

ESR’s net profit attributable to owners for 2021 was up 31.7 percent from the $286.5 million reported a year earlier with the company linking its improved performance to increased co-investments in funds associated entities and joint ventures as well as reduced borrowing costs.

That increase in profit came despite revenues inching up by just 4.1 percent to $404.4 million in 2021 from $388.3 million the year prior. While the group’s revenues in Japan and China surged by 47 percent and 31 percent respectively Australia saw its revenues fall by 38 percent and in India revenues dipped by 8.4 percent. Revenues from South Korea and Singapore both went up by nine percent year on year.

The firm’s leasing activity in 2021 also hit a record high with over 3.3 million square metres (35.5 million square feet) of total space rented out last year and occupancy climbing to 94 percent from 89 percent a year earlier driven by the huge demand from the e-commerce industry.

With $59 billion in new economy assets – which include logistics and data centres– the segment now accounts for 54 percent of ESR’s total AUM which is by far the biggest new economy portfolio in Asia Pacific.

The Warburg Pincus-backed group completed its $5.2 billion acquisition of Singapore-based ARA Asset Management in January which more than quadrupled the enlarged ESR group’s overall assets under management to $140.2 billion as of end-2021 from just around $30 billion in 2020.

Investor commitments to ESR funds have also helped to boost the company’s business with the firm raising $5.8 billion in fresh capital commitments last year across nine vehicles and partnerships which was up 64 percent from 2020.

Currently the Hong Kong-listed firm’s portfolio spans 25.5 million square metres of combined space both in operation and for development across Asia Pacific. In terms of value it has $7.1 billion worth of projects under construction which is up 51 percent year on year and commenced work on $3.3 billion in projects last year.

In addition to its growing development pipeline ESR also grew via acquisition in 2021 with the group’s Australian unit partnering with Singapore’s GIC to acquire the Milestone logistics portfolio from Blackstone for $2.9 billion.

Data Centres REITs in Focus This Year

As ESR aims to expand its business in 2022 Perlman said the firm will look for opportunities to free up at least $1 billion in capital in part by divesting $800 billion or more of its existing assets with China one of its top targets for disposals.

“If the markets continue to stay constructive and investors obviously continue to have the appetite which we’re still seeing today then we expect to be able to sell down and exceed even what we did in 2021 in terms of a sell down” he said in a briefing on Thursday evening.

Pointing to ESR’s established pool of stabilised assets in China Perlman said that “We will recycle those assets which are obviously of material value. So that comprises a big chunk of that capital recycling and our goal is to exceed $1 billion plus of capital recycling.”

The 38-year-old executive said his company will also continue growing its data centre platform which currently has six assets all still under development across Hong Kong Osaka Sydney Mumbai Jakarta and Singapore which represent a total of 260 megawatts of total power capacity.

The company plans to expand that portfolio this year through a pipeline of digital infrastructure assets it has arranged across Tokyo Osaka Seoul Beijing and Taipei along with plans to launch its complementary inaugural data centre funds this year. Before the merger last year both ESR and Logos had announced separate data centre vehicles.

“Beyond the continued growth of e-commerce digital transformation is well underway with data consumption growing by four times over the past five years alone in Asia. With the build up of the ESR data center efforts we’re looking to play into the critical need for digital infrastructure in a big way going forward” he said.

The logistics specialist launched its first data centre development in April 2021 with a $2.15-billion project in Osaka.

After unitholders overwhelmingly approved the proposed merger of ESR-REIT and ARA Logos Logistics Trust earlier this week ESR is also planning to expand the pool of REITs it sponsors this year and grow the existing ones in scale.

“We believe the REIT sector is set to take off across Asia Pacific. Over the remainder of the decade JLL is projecting growth of up to $1 trillion of incremental market capitalization. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to create REITs in China Japan Australia India and Southeast Asia across both diversified and new economy areas” Perlman added.",,,,,,,,,

This seems to be the keyword for blockchains in 2022. Keeping all transactions exclusive on your very own blockchain is just not doing the trick anymore. But being able to move your assets freely around to other blockchains is not only trending but it is what we need actually.

Nowadays there are a few blockchains like Avalanche Cosmos Polkadot and Wanchain that offer interoperability. And as you can imagine each project has its way of doing this. Also we see a few of our favorite blockchains listed here. One of them is Cosmos. THORchain (RUNE) our topic for today is built with the Cosmos SDK/Tendermint Core.

After some recent hiccups they are coming back stronger than ever. Just today THORchain recorded a monthly volume of $1.25B with 400% growth. Therefore in this article you will discover why THORChain (RUNE) is a hidden gem.

What is THORChain?

THORchain (RUNE) calls itself a decentralized cross-chain liquidity network. In simple words that means If you’re looking into a decentralized solution that allows you to easily swap tokens across chains without the hassles of wrapping or pegging tokens then THORChain might be what you’ve been searching for.

The big news is that the THOR team is launching Terra today and this could send $RUNE its native token to the moon. This is because Terra integration brings the LUNA token along with the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin to the THORChain ecosystem and gives users more trading and staking options.

What sets Thorchain apart from other chains is:

It doesn’t use wrapped tokens for interoperability.

It uses a cross-chain oracle-free bridge called Bifröst.

Until Thorchain only a CEX could trade assets that aren’t wrapped.

Earn yield with your deposit of native assets. Of course in the liquidity pools of the network. This is currently at 37.553%.

Also another aspect that makes Thorchain attractive is that it battles the whales. Let me try to explain how. Large whale transactions incur slippage. So Thorchain increases the transaction fees when slippage increases. This kind of discourages the whales from dumping tokens which leads to price crashes.

When we compare Thorchain to other popular DEXs in the space like Bancor or Uniswap it’s pretty much like them as it uses an AMM (Automated Market Maker) but there is one big difference: One of the pairing assets is always the RUNE token. This makes RUNE the base swap pair but it’s not the destination for any transaction. As a result it concentrates liquidity because each pool always has the RUNE token as a pair. Unlike other DEXs.

How does THORchain Connect to Other Blockchains?

Ok you might tend to skip this section because it could get a bit technical. But you must watch it to build your belief in ThorChain’s revolutionary technology. Let’s dive in:

Bifröst connects the blockchains. It uses smart tokens similar to the Bancor system.

They are the Continuous Liquidity Pools (CLP).

The CLPs facilitate the exchange of assets.

LPs get rewarded CLPs for contributing liquidity in all pools.

Thorchain offers insurance to LPs preventing impermanent loss.

They have a very user-friendly UI

Also one of the reasons RUNE is seeing such a positive price surge is because they launched synthetic asset trading on March 10th. This offers instant settlement low gas and no risk of Impermanent Loss.

Moreover the same day RUNE surged 37%. A week later it’s up 87%. In a nutshell Rune has almost 2.5x in the last 30 days. Another neat trending value proposition they have is the name service THORname. Only larger chains and ecosystems seem to have this. Long strings of blockchain addresses turn into readable names and it allows the use of special characters/emojis.

Another exciting new feature is ThorFi coming soon to your neighborhood. This brings lending and borrowing to the Thorchain ecosystem. Moving ahead let’s have a look at this ecosystem.

THORChain Ecosystem

The current Thorchain (RUNE) ecosystem is completely community-driven and has 10 active sections with over 50 dapps including:

Arbitrageur tools

DAOs

NFT collections

Software & hardware wallets

Swap/pool interfaces

Liquidity provider tools

Insurance

Some projects include

Thorswap – The world’s first cross-chain Aggregator

THORWallet – Mobile3 app with cross-chain wallet & DEX. Allows earning passive income up to 18+% on native BTC. You can read more about it here

Runebalance – shows arbitrage opportunities in the pools

In addition TVL on Thorchain is $826.88 million with $153 million pooled and $963 million as a total reserve. An interesting ecosystem that keeps growing.

Layer0 is a generic cross-chain (EVM) messaging protocol.

Stargate is a stableswap application built on top of that. THORChain is a cross-chain (any) swapping protocol. The two main differences relate to assurances of decentralisation and reliance on external dependencies. https://t.co/qhBUZwM1MP — THORChain (@THORChain) March 27 2022

THORChain Tokenomics & Team

As we just saw Thorchain is a popular project. Looking at the current market cap Thorchain is ranked #52 with a $2.75 billion m cap and a circulating supply of 300m or 66% out of a total supply of 500m. In one month the market cap increased by $1b. The current price is $9.15.

Also you can stake RUNE by adding liquidity into pools. The average APY is around 37.5%. Peaks are up to 140% (BEP-20 on BNB Chain). The RUNE token has 4 key roles:

Liquidity—as a settlement asset

Security—as a Sybil-resistant mechanism it also drives economic behavior

Governance—signaling priority on-chain

Incentives—paying out rewards charging fees subsidizing gas

On the other hand THORChain started as an anonymous group of developers in 2018. Still they made the project as transparent as they possibly could by publishing everything on Github. These are the project custodians.

Now they are moving to a community for governance. This is called the Aesir protocol. Aesir were old Norse Gods that discuss everything and make all decisions. The community is slowly taking over lines between the OG custodians and the community are blurring. This is a unique concept because they are decentralized. They are not a company but they are open source transparent and a fluid team with a flexible community.

TVL broke top 20 for Thorchain on Defillama. 🎉 The total addressable market (TAM) is much higher than even Ethereum itself which is the largest TVL. More chain integrations Thorfi and more will help to bring even more liquidity. Lets keep building.🛠️ pic.twitter.com/zQ5FwS6R0R — Asian | 0xV (@Asian0xV) March 27 2022

Competitors & Risk

Are there any competitors for Thorchain? Other protocols or blockchains that are interoperable can be considered competition besides the major ones some smaller projects may come close:

Anyswap

Kardiachain

Ren (but this is a bridge and not an AMM)

However what Thorchain does is unique. All other DeFi options use wrapped tokens for their interoperability or are single chain. Instead Thorchain uses Bifröst as a cross-chain bridge and doesn’t wrap tokens.

Moreover other exchanges that can move assets around between blockchains without wrapping them are centralized. Now that is not considered competition if you look at a DeFi set-up like Thorchain.

On the other hand so far we have seen that Thorchain has many things going for it. There is no real competition and they are unique. This raises the question is Thorchain all just sweet and rosy? Or are there also any risks for using Thorchain? Well Thorchain seems to have not promised us a rose garden so yes there are some risks:

Risk of Impermanent Loss: Thorchain offers 100-day impermanent loss insurance. Coverage adds 1% of insurance per day until it reaches 100 days.

Market and economical risks.

The potential risk of a bug.

Hack: In July 2021 Thorchain had 3 hacks within a month. Once was a white hacker.

THORChain Roadmap & RUNE Price Prediction

The roadmap promises more action. Cross-chain bridges are just the beginning where synths have just been added. Also a multichain mainnet is about to be launched once the Chaosnet is considered stable.

Moreover a few other features for the future are mentioned but without further details. The next milestone that is mentioned is ThorFi. This will have:

Lending

Composite Assets

Leveraged Trading

THORChain project roadmap: * More chains (LUNA Privacy L2's)

* More wallets (all the big ones)

* More integrations (Dex aggregators)

* More Features: Synths THORFi (lending saving) THORNames Not stopping until decentralised liquidity 10x bigger than centralised. $RUNE — THORChain (@THORChain) March 6 2022

On the other hand the RUNE token has been pumping recently. During the last 30 days the price increased by 2.5X. From $3.87 up to $9. That is a massive recovery from the bloodbath that happened after July 2021 when the hacks occurred.

Also it’s still a far cry from the ATH of $20.78 in May 2021 but a nice comeback nonetheless. But after doing a 2.5x in a fear gripped market is there any heat left in RUNE. Here is what our technical analysis says about RUNE Price.

Bullish Scenario: If RUNE manages to break above the resistance level at $9.9 then it would be bullish. If it gains some momentum and buying pressure builds up then we might test the next resistance level at $11.9 and $14.9. Breaking above the $14.9 price level with significant buying volume will lead to a good chance of crossing above $17.

Bearish Scenario:

RUNE has been in a downtrend channel for the last few weeks. However if the $5.6 support level is not maintained the price will fall to $4 $3 $2.3 and even lower sooner or later.

Thorchain is being the comeback kid. All respect goes out to the project for bouncing back after the hard times last July. They have a unique way of making interoperability happen with the Bifrost bridge. This takes cross-chain to the next level.

Now that they seem to be back on track more new exciting features are in the making. We most certainly are eagerly awaiting these in 2022.

That agreement is one of three proposed on the agenda — and one of two purchases that’d be made with the city’s share of federal COVID stimulus funds as part of a broader pursuit of projects that would address the region’s need for more affordable housing and housing stock.

On Thursday City Manager James Freed said the move was a matter of the city “putting skin in the came and taking bold action” echoing comments made amid other recent efforts to address the local shortage.

“We have been very clear with our intentions and that’s to create generational change and economic opportunity” Freed said in a message. “Words are not enough.”

At $550000 the old grocery store property at 3550 Electric Ave. — a general business parcel where the market burned down in late 2013 — is the biggest of the three buys.

Two residential properties at 1003 Erie St. and 2910 32nd St. are on tap for $60000 each. The Erie property would also be bought with funds through the American Rescue Plan. The 32nd Street site would be bought through the city’s land purchase fund.

While the Erie site zoned multi-family residential is also expected to be saved for a future housing project the 32nd Street property is adjacent to existing sites zoned for light industrial use.

In follow up Freed said that means the latter is “part of a broader strategy for industrial park use.”

The city manager did not answer multiple questions on the latest plans for Electric and Erie referring them to Monday’s meeting.

In an email on Friday however Freed told council members that the Electric Avenue plans meet their goal to expand housing opportunities as well as to install a development that “would also induce further economic growth and expansion along the Conner (Street) Corridor.”

“We have completed numerous developer tours of the site and are now working with two developers for this project” he wrote. “We are aiming for a fall application period for federal tax credits for this project with a possible 2023-24 build if the credits are approved. The key is securing the property to allow the city to negotiate directly with any current or future developers.""

A conceptual rendering also shared with council shows a four-story structure with balconies carved into its exterior in place of the vacant land that’s immediately north of the Dollar General.

The city has previously discussed plans to establish an improvement district around the Conner corridor to help finance a neighborhood revamp.

Any plans for Electric or Erie would also follow two other major efforts pushed within the last year to address housing concerns particularly through partnerships ushered in by officials with private entities.

That includes continuing to usher in the city neighborhood housing corporation’s ongoing effort to sell 11 previously foreclosed homes to contractors for redevelopment and the city’s grant-funded construction of infrastructure to entice buyers in a new single-family subdivision off 10th Avenue and Garfield Street.

City Council members will meet at 7 p.m. on Monday in the meeting chambers of the Municipal Office Center 100 McMorran Blvd. Agenda materials can be viewed online at http://porthuroncitymi.iqm2.com/Citizens/calendar.aspx.

Insider/Brittany Chang

In February FDA inspectors found a rodent infestation at one of Family Dollar's warehouses.

Because of this Family Dollar – and its sister chain Dollar Tree – have come under scrutiny.

Workers at these chains say that pest issues have been going on for years.

It's been six months since Jayson started his job as a cashier at a Family Dollar store in Maine and he's already preparing to quit.

He's tired of working in a store that's understaffed unclean and unsafe because it's so stacked up with boxes of inventory he tells Insider.

Jayson – who did not wish to share his full name through fear of retribution but whose identity is known to Insider – is one of 12 former and current Family Dollar and Dollar Tree workers who shared similar experiences in recent conversations. The Family Dollar chain is owned by Dollar Tree.

These workers described the conditions in the chains' stores as ""unhygienic and disgusting"" where rodents roam in backrooms that are piled high with boxes and around stores that are rarely cleaned.

Their comments which come in the wake of an FDA investigation that unearthed a rodent infestation at one of Family Dollar's distribution centers in Arkansas and led to it temporarily closing 404 stores suggest that the rodent issues are far more widespread than at just one warehouse.

In a statement to Insider Kayleigh Campbell a spokesperson for both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar said that the company is ""committed to providing safe and quality products"" for customers and ""complying with all applicable federal state and local occupational health and safety laws.""

'To call it chaotic is an understatement'

While Jayson hasn't seen a live rodent in the shopping area of his store he has disposed of dead rats caught in traps in the stock room and come across rodent faeces.

""My location is constantly dirty floors not maintained dirt and dust everywhere and completely infested with spiders"" he said.

""There is so much stuff in the back room that you can't move it all to clean even if we had the time or were asked to"" he added.

Jayson said that the company knowingly understaffs its stores to keep costs down which means there aren't enough workers to empty these backrooms. But even if there were the company's chaotic inventory system means that his store is still completely overstocked all the time he said.

""They don't have enough room in the distribution centers so they'll just send us all of their junk so that it can sit in our backroom instead of theirs"" he said.

A spokesperson for Family Dollar did not respond to Insider's request for comment on how its restocking process works.







Scott Mushkin CEO of consultancy firm R5 Capital witnessed these inventory pile-ups first-hand during store visits to more than 60 Dollar Tree stores between the fall of 2021 and February of this year.

In a recent conversation with Insider he said that in his 20-plus year career as a consultant to the retail industry he's never seen anything like what he encountered in these backrooms.

""To call it chaotic is really an understatement their inventory system is completely out of control from our perspective"" he told Insider. ""Rodents are a symptom of the disease not the disease"" he said clarifying that the mountains of boxes in these backrooms were providing cover for rodents.

It paints a similar picture to what Insider found during store visits to two of Dollar Tree's Brooklyn locations in 2022 and 2018 where boxes were stacked up in the middle of the store or left to be unloaded on abandoned crates.

Mushkin told Insider that these inventory pile-ups could be caused by supply chain challenges and stock arriving at the wrong time or staffing issues because of the labor crunch. However conversations with former Dollar Tree and Family Dollar store workers who worked at these chains as far back as 2005 indicated that both piled-up stockrooms and rodent infestations have been an issue at some locations for years.

Richard Kirschke who worked for a third-party logistics company delivering stock to Family Dollar stores across the US between October 2020 and January 2021 described their backrooms as a ""nightmare"" where you could clearly smell rodent activity.

""It's some of the worst retail real estate"" he told Insider. ""They [Family Dollar] just didn't care about anything related to stores the upkeep and maintenance.""

Some communities are now threatening to boycott these discount chains and saying that they're putting shoppers at risk. Dollar store chains are growing at a rapid rate in the US and are often criticized for driving out competitors in local communities by undercutting competitors on price which means that in some areas they are the only places to shop.

One former Family Dollar store worker who quit her job at a store in Freeport New York in February and who wished to remain anonymous but whose identity is known to Insider said that this is the most distressing part of the mismanagement of these stores.

""I live and shop in this community"" she said. ""Only after I began working at this location did I become aware of the conditions.

""When you think of the filth that my family members and neighbors – not to mention myself – have possibly consumed … it makes me sick to my stomach"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvaW4uY29tL2xvY2FsL211bHRub21haC1jb3VudHkvZG9sbGFyLXRyZWUtZ29lcy11cC1pbi1mbGFtZXMtcm9vZi1wYXJ0aWFsbHktY29sbGFwc2VzL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvaW4uY29tL2xvY2FsL211bHRub21haC1jb3VudHkvZG9sbGFyLXRyZWUtZ29lcy11cC1pbi1mbGFtZXMtcm9vZi1wYXJ0aWFsbHktY29sbGFwc2VzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dollar Tree goes up in flames roof partially collapses,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.koin.com/local/multnomah-county/dollar-tree-goes-up-in-flames-roof-partially-collapses/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvaW4uY29tL2xvY2FsL211bHRub21haC1jb3VudHkvZG9sbGFyLXRyZWUtZ29lcy11cC1pbi1mbGFtZXMtcm9vZi1wYXJ0aWFsbHktY29sbGFwc2VzL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvaW4uY29tL2xvY2FsL211bHRub21haC1jb3VudHkvZG9sbGFyLXRyZWUtZ29lcy11cC1pbi1mbGFtZXMtcm9vZi1wYXJ0aWFsbHktY29sbGFwc2VzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0LWdhemV0dGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL21vbmV5LzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvZG9sbGFyLXN0b3JlLWRlYmF0ZS1kby10aGVzZS1kaXNjb3VudC1zdG9yZXMtd2hpY2gtc2VlbS10by1iZS1ldmVyeXdoZXJlLW9mZmVyLXRoZS1iZXN0LWRlYWxzL3N0b3JpZXMvMjAyMjAzMjcwMDM30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dollar store debate: Do these discount stores — which seem to be everywhere — offer the best deals?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlYWNvbmpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMy8yNy9tYXJjcy1zdG9yZS1vcGVuaW5nLWJhcmJlcnRvbi1qdW5lLWZpbGxpbmctdm9pZC1sZWZ0LWttYXJ0LzcwODIyNDIwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marc's opening store in Barberton's Magic City Plaza in June filling void left by Kmart,"A Marc’s store is expected to open in Barberton in mid- to late June helping fill a gaping retail hole left after the departure of Kmart more than two years ago.

The space in the Magic City Plaza on Wooster Road North has been empty since Kmart departed in mid-December 2019. The last Kmart stores in the Akron area — in Tallmadge and North Canton — closed in February 2020.

Barberton Planning Director Trevor Hunt said the Cleveland-based discount grocery and pharmacy company fills a need in the city.

“(After) losing Kmart this really fills the void” he said on Monday.

A Big Lots store currently in the plaza will be relocated in Kmart space not used by Marc’s. Big Lots also operates a furniture store in the same plaza.

The plaza's tenants also include a Save A Lot grocery store and a Dollar Tree store.

Hunt said Marc’s entry into the city is another sign that business activity in Barberton is on the upswing after the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I think we’re seeing more and more business” he said. “The numbers are back up to where they were before.”

Hunt said his department has visited with businesses that are looking to expand and is working to keep them in Barberton.

“We have interest from a 10000-square-foot business needing double what they have” he said. “We’re working with a couple right now.”

At its peak in the 1990s Kmart operated 2400 stores with 350000 employees. Kmart will close a New Jersey store next month leaving only three in the U.S. — one each in New York New Jersey and Florida.

Marc's operates about 60 stores throughout Northeast Ohio and the state. It employees about 3000 people and had revenue of about $1.03 billion in 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2phbWVzLXdpY2hlcnQtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzQwNjAyNjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Wichert Obituary - Davis Funeral Homes & Memorial Park - Eastern Ave. - 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/james-wichert-obituary?id=34060261 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2phbWVzLXdpY2hlcnQtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzQwNjAyNjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

When it came time for hip Brooklyn jewelry company Catbird to move its flagship to a bigger location in its Williamsburg neighborhood Leigh Plessner the brand’s chief creative officer knew exactly what design notes she wanted to hit: “Haberdashery millinery and bizarre museum displays.”

So she collaborated with Spencer Alton and Alex Bechara of design firm Alton Bechara and the team landed on giving the 1400-square-foot space an old-timey bank vintage Italian pharmacy feel. But that doesn’t mean they splurged on Murano glass (though it does appear in one lighting fixture) and expensive marble.

In fact the floors are a practical and price-friendly choice: classic Armstrong vinyl squares arranged in a black-and-white checkerboard pattern a nod to the city’s famous cookies that come in that same palette. “It’s the most basic linoleum tile you can find” Alton says before Bechara chimes in: “At first we thought we’d try to achieve a similar effect with wood but going with vinyl was the best decision we made.”

From there they saved on furniture by sourcing vintage instead of new. Plessner an avid thrifter scours estate sales in Atlantic City New Jersey and shops in Bucks County Pennsylvania. Sometimes her finds appear in the store like in the case of a round metal patio table and a $30 card table with a floral design on top. On the walls an arrangement of found mirrors—most are from Etsy and impressively all but one arrived undamaged (!)—give customers a view of themselves wearing the store’s understated baubles.

And then there’s the vivid green jewelry display which was inspired by cabbage and a dress Gwyneth Paltrow wore in 1998’s Great Expectations but in IRL it’s Benjamin Moore’s Baby Fern.

The worker known as Beth D (@beth_dutton) on TikTok is seen laughing in the video as she prepared the order. The pizza was devoid of toppings although Beth did add a ring of garlic sauce around its edges before cutting it.

“Some times you get strange orders at dominos” Beth wrote in the video’s caption. As of March 27 the video received about 4.4 million views.

The unusual pizza order prompted nearly 1100 comments from viewers. Several commenters referenced “None Pizza with Left Beef” an infamous meme that was born when the owner of a blog called The Sneeze ordered a pizza with no sauce no cheese and no toppings except for beef on the left half.

“where’s the left beef?” one viewer commented on the video referencing the meme.

“I thought it was gonna be none pizza left beef” another viewer commented.

“Needs left beef” another viewer said.

Some viewers said the pizza actually looked good.

“not gonna lie… that still looks good” one TikToker wrote. In response to the comment Beth wrote “It would be just like a giant breadstick.”

Other viewers said the customer may have ordered the plain pizza so they could top it themselves or because they have allergies.

“some people like to use their own sauce and toppings but prefer a better crust” one TikToker said.

Another TikToker commented “I have def ordered this. So many food allergies aversions and lifestyles in my house.”

In a comment on the video Beth explained that the pizza was ordered as a “Hawaiian minus everything” making it a $33 pie. She also wrote that she tried calling the customer to confirm the order before making it but they didn’t respond.

The Daily Dot reached out to the creator via TikTok comment and Domino’s via press email.

Online orders accounted for nearly 80% of Domino's total global sales during the 2022 half-year financial results -- and the company only expects this number to grow further.

Domino's which operates in 10 markets globally has signed a deal with Macquarie Telecom to roll out NBN VoIP and SD-WAN with 4G back-up services to more than 720 Domino's stores across Australia to accommodate for the expected continued growth online.

""We want a telco infrastructure solution that's going to be capable not just for now with a large percentage of online sales … [but] will grow to the future that will be reliable for up and downstream for data and also smarter stores be it technology in-store or out of store that needs to return to base"" Domino's group chief digital and experience officer Michael Gillespie told ZDNet.

The upgrade has been rolled out at 400 sites within five months with the remaining 320 sites expected to be completed in the next four months.

The decision by Domino's to upgrade its network is also ahead of potential plans by the pizza delivery company to bring drone deliveries to Australia.

""We're not just investing for a telco solution now; we're looking at the future. We obviously know with a clearer picture where we're heading … and we're validating that what we're doing is allowing a more convenient store over time"" Gillespie said.

This year the company said it will be relaunching trials in New Zealand in partnership with SkyDrop formerly known as Flirtey. The pair first teamed up in 2016 and completed what they claimed was a world-first pizza drone delivery.

""Working with Flirtey and now SkyDrop we realised we practically could deliver [using drones] but the actual volume we could deliver in size of order compared to what the consumers were ordering and moving to in New Zealand there was a discrepancy"" Gillespie said.

""So we needed to go back and say okay how can we work with them on a drone that can carry more and have a few other advances to get a higher commercial volume.

""We've let SkyDrop do what they do best and now they've returned with us to say we're going to get back into trialling in New Zealand. That's an exciting message and shows that what we're doing in this space really is a focus but we're not going to do it without the opportunity of validating 'Can we get to scale?'.""

Gillespie believes that using drone deliveries would complement the company's existing delivery services.

""Sometimes there is a volume of orders that just surpasses what we can even hire to do at the moment. Also there's a distance for some customers that we can't [get to]; we're all about getting hot fresh pizza so can we go further and reach locations which just don't make sense for the driver to drive to or for the customer because it'll be a diminished product that is not satisfactory so robotic delivery comes into that"" he said.

Improving the company's digital connectivity is also expected to underpin the company's plans to introduce more technologies in-store and upcoming revamp of its online ordering system that Gillespie described will be ""slicker and faster"" featuring service enhancements relating to features such as its e-commerce shopping basket.

Why we chose it: Everhem ticks all the design boxes for customized window coverings.

This site’s detailed setup makes the design process as easy as it comes—even for the most skittish shopper. At the start to your blind and shade selection process Everhem has detailed imagery of every style it offers (choose from pleated relaxed or flat) but to take a closer look IRL the company can send up to five free swatches to your door (you just pay shipping costs). And when it’s time to iron out specifics you can find a library of informational videos and articles that answer questions about how to take accurate measurements blinds’ light-filtering capabilities and more.

Dimensions are fully customizable—you can even choose the cord-lock mechanism placement—and once your shades are ready to ship the packages are labeled to help make installation as clear-cut as possible. There’s also a price-tracking widget that helps you see the cost of your blinds from start to finish.

Relatively inexpensive prices

Will refit blinds for free Worth noting: Limited styles available

Why we chose it: Sustainability meets versatility with Blindster’s window accessories.

While the inexpensive bamboo blind prices on Blindster first caught deMañana’s eye (they start at $90) we’re also huge fans of its color palettes: Shades range from rich-toned ebony to a beautifully speckled tan. After customizing dimensions you can select either a cordless or top-down design. Should you choose the deluxe bamboo you’ll have your choice of three cordless styles and two headrails. And then there’s the fit-for-free safety blanket: If your panels don’t fit for whatever reason—yes that reason could be that your blind measurements were slightly off—customers can contact Blindster within 60 days of receiving the product and they’ll remake them in the correct size for free.

Best Simple Cordless Roller Shades: West Elm

The blinds selection is sustainably sourced with recycled and upcycled materials and custom-made options up for grabs.

For advice that is more tailored to your needs there are designers one button-click away too. We love that the store offers a 30-day return policy but keep in mind that doesn’t apply to custom-made items.

Limited sizes

Why we chose it: Shop your favorite big-brand names at Pottery Barn.

With collaborators like Monique Lhuillier Sherwin-Williams and Disney Pottery Barn is your go-to for all things classic. For deMañana the retailer’s patterned linen selection is a personal favorite. Pottery Barn’s linen shades are on the pricier side but they are sharp. For the minimalist these understated window treatments quietly elevate a space—and they’re easily shoppable. You can opt for custom or off-the-rack picks and next select your fabric preference from Belgian flax to Emery linens. Lastly choose among light-filtering blackout cordless or a customized combination of any of the above.

Tons of cost-friendly linen options Worth noting: Limited high-end options

Why we chose it: A serviceable spot with an array of budget-friendly finds.

If you visit Target and manage to only leave with planned purchases we need you to teach us your ways. Seriously it’s beyond tempting to not fill your cart with everything in sight and shopping the store’s window accessories selection is no exception. DeMañana likes that Target has practical cost-friendly home decor options including these no-frills peel-and-stick light-filtering paper shades. For those who like to dress their windows with a bit more flair there are blinds and shades for that too (see the brand’s collections from Opalhouse designed with Jungalow and Threshold).

Even when you have a strong idea in mind blinds shopping can still be a harrowing experience because of the extensive choices. But Smith & Noble’s Idea Gallery helps customers hone in on their favorites through more creative control and reasonable prices—wood blinds start at $109. Its visual library which shows window treatments styled in a variety of rooms contains a shoppable “get the look” feature for those who don’t quite know where to start or how to accessorize their blinds.

Best Solar Shades Texture: The Shade Store

Shop

Dimensions: Customizable | Color: Cantaloupe | Brand: Chilewich | Material: Mini basket weave | Mounting type: Inside or outside | Design: Solar

What we like: Custom measurements

Broad range of design features

Lots of fabrics Worth noting: Numerous options may be difficult to narrow down

Why we chose it: Design your solar panels down to the smallest detail at the Shade Store.

We took a deep breath before diving into the Shade Store’s inventory because the options are seemingly bottomless making this retailer an awesome source of shopping inspiration for window coverings. For solar shades alone you can choose from more than 150 eco-friendly materials. Consider having a design-minded shopping buddy as your second set of eyes to help narrow down your selection. However we loved how simple it is to find Shade Store’s collaborators on the site—deMañana was particularly thrilled to see Chilewich’s high-performance fabric offerings on the list.

The Shade Store has free measurements available along with step-by-step instructions but you can also schedule a consultation with a professional.

How We Chose These Products

When considering the best places to buy blinds we placed a lot of emphasis on a site’s design: Was it easy to navigate? Were the price points dimensions and other details clear and simple to find? How did interactivity enhance the shopping experience? The best shopper is a well-informed one and these companies clearly devoted extra time and resources to make sure they present their products with ease and essential details to narrow your search. Additionally we focused quite a bit on price—we didn’t want you to feel like high-end window treatments are the only way to beautifully decorate your space; sprucing up a room is possible without depleting your budget. Overall deMañana’s picks are heavily practical customizable and in some cases sustainably sourced too.

Our Shopping Checklist

Privacy and Light

Each of our selected retailers offers light-filtering or blackout blinds and shades. As deMañana points out you really don’t want a gap between the window and the shade if you’re looking to reduce sound heat or both. So it’s ideal to take advantage of a brand that offers customized options with a wide variety of width measurements to help fine-tune your privacy and light filtering to your liking.

Safety

If you’re a parent who is worried about safety pay attention to the cord style. Per WCMA standards custom cords should not be longer than 40 percent of the window height. By customizing length you can easily have blinds with shorter cords or you can go with cordless blinds that can be manually lifted and drawn shut. Electric window blinds (operated by remote) are another option to consider.

Versatility

There are endless possibilities when it comes to materials width and length cord options light filtering and the like—some smart alternatives even auto adjust according to the sun’s position so you don’t have to constantly open or close your blinds. Others connect to Wi-Fi and respond to remote or voice commands.

Cleaning and Maintenance

Before shopping decide how much effort you’re willing to put into the upkeep of your blinds or shades. Those made of cotton and linen are machine washable or can be professionally cleaned since both materials tend to shrink in the wash. For textures that require a little less maintenance consider bamboo or wood that only needs an occasional spot treatment or dusting.

Budget

Obviously custom options are going to cost more than off-the-shelf treatments so plan to spend more if this is the route you choose. We’ve noticed at least a $100 difference in the price between the two alternatives. But as our more practical (but still equally stylish) store selections indicate this doesn’t mean you can’t spruce up your windows with a more modest budget. Most of our options offer free shipping and free design consultations—and in at least one case (hi Blindster) free custom remakes are available.

Ask Domino

Q: Should blinds be lighter or darker than walls?

This depends on your personal style but deMañana weighed in with some expert style tips. “In most cases I’d say go lighter because most common blind colors are lighter due to light-filtering properties” she says. On the other hand there’s nothing stopping you from going darker. “If you have a blue wall with a slightly darker shade of blind in the same color family I think it would look cool.”

Q: Can I get blinds for bay windows?

Short answer: Yes. In fact we’ve seen this done beautifully—look at these displays from the Shade Store for inspiration.

Q: How much should blinds cost per window?

While simpler options like Target’s paper blinds can cost as low as $6 plan to spend at least $50 per window for something more durable. Customized blinds can run upwards of $100 per window.

Q: Which blinds are most popular?

Among fan favorites (and ours too) are roman blinds wood and cordless. Smart blinds and shades are also popular (easy open easy close) as well as roller shades thanks to their simplistic minimalist design.

Q: Can I install blinds myself?

Absolutely. The wonderful thing about mounting blinds yourself is you can choose styles based on your installation preferences. Simple peel-and-stick options are obviously the simplest to “mount.” In the event you prefer blinds that require hardware nearly all of the retailers we mentioned have step-by-step instructions to guide you through the process or can arrange in-home appointments so a professional can take the guesswork out of installation.

Q: Are vertical blinds difficult to fit?

This depends on the user’s experience but the steps are pretty straightforward: You choose between an inside mount (one that fits inside the window frame) or an outside mount which positions the blinds above the window and outside the frame. While taking measurements be sure that the area where your blinds will be hung is clear of obstructions so they can move up and down freely. Also use a stud finder to confirm that the window frame where you plan to mount the blinds can manage the load.

Q: How far should blinds be from the floor?

The general consensus among experts is that vertical and horizontal blinds should hang 2 to 3 inches from the floor. To get this measurement add 2 to 3 inches to the total length between the floor and the molding or top of the window for an inside mount; for an outside mount add 2 to 3 inches above the window.

The Last Word

When it comes to the best places to buy blinds it doesn’t have to be a one-size-fits-all scenario. Figure out your budget your style preferences and which details you can live with (or can’t live without) and enjoy tapping into your inner designer while dressing your windows in top-notch decor."
DOV,Dover Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlbnRvbmxpbmUuY28udWsvZG92ZXIvc3BvcnQvYmVhdW1vbnQtd2VyZS1wZWFraW5nLWF0LXRoZS1yaWdodC10aW1lLTI2NDU3OS_SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5rZW50b25saW5lLmNvLnVrL2RvdmVyL3Nwb3J0L2FtcC9iZWF1bW9udC13ZXJlLXBlYWtpbmctYXQtdGhlLXJpZ2h0LXRpbWUtMjY0NTc5Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beaumont: We're peaking at the right time,"England and Kent batter Tammy Beaumont insists her side are peaking at the right time ahead of their crucial final group stage game against Bangladesh at the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2022.

A fourth straight win will secure England’s passage to the semi-finals and mark an incredible turnaround after a hat-trick of losses looked like ending the defending champions’ title defence at the first hurdle.

Kent and England's Tammy Beaumont. Picture: Keith Heppell

There is no shortage of motivation for Heather Knight’s side who know that a big win against Bangladesh will help improve their net run rate and give them a good chance of finishing third and avoiding table-toppers Australia who won seven from seven in the group stage in the knockout phase.

“I think we obviously started a little bit slow in the comp but our bowlers are certainly peaking at the right time” said opener Beaumont from Dover.

“Katherine Brunt looked in really good rhythm last game Kate Cross throughout has been brilliant Sophie Ecclestone too and everyone's chipping in where they can.

“With the batting we haven't had that solid opening partnership yet. We haven't got past 31 so it was good to see Danni (Wyatt) go on and get some good runs last game.

“And there's been contributions throughout. I do feel like we're starting to get there and play our best cricket as we come into the back end of this tournament.”

Beaumont was the Player of the Tournament at the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2017 as her 410 runs helped fire England to glory on home soil.

This time around she is still averaging 35 despite her last three knocks against Pakistan New Zealand and India totalling just 28 but Beaumont is not the slightest bit concerned about her form.

She explained: “I don't really feel like I'm out of form. I think it was only a few games ago I scored 50 against South Africa.

“So I think when the games come thick and fast you're never far away from a good performance. I felt pretty good in some of the games and got some good balls so I'm not too worried.”

Bangladesh gave Australia a scare after reducing the world No.1 side to 70-5 in pursuit of 136 before Beth Mooney’s unbeaten 66 ensured the 2013 champions topped the group stage with a perfect seven wins.

And Beaumont is wary about what surprises the Bangladesh spin attack could have in store for her side on what will be another windy Wellington day particularly as the sides square off for the first time in ODIs.

She added: “They got a few early wickets against Australia so it's going to be really key to start working against them.

“They don't bowl with that much pace and they've got a lot of spinners. So that's going to be a challenge and particularly here at Wellington.

“It looks like it's going to be really windy one way hitting into the wind. So we have to be very smart with that.”

Bangladesh captain Nigar Sultana revealed her side are not planning to let England sweep their way out of trouble against their slow bowlers with off-spinner Salma Khatun in red-hot form having ripped through Australia’s fabled top three of Alyssa Healy Rachael Haynes and Meg Lanning at the same venue on Friday.

She said: “We plan for each individual team every time. We have a good spin attack so we are going to plan against them and not let them play the kind of shots they are used to playing.

“Obviously our bowling unit so far is doing well so I'm hoping they will do the same thing.”

Nigar admits she is hoping her batters come good against England as Bangladesh who cannot make the semi-finals aim to exit the tournament with a final flourish at the Basin Reserve.

She added: “What we did against Australia was like a bowlers’ show. I am hoping that the top order will also bounce back in tomorrow’s game.

“It’s the last game and we want to take all the positives back home.”

DOW,Dow,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzI3LzMtZG93LXN0b2Nrcy10dXJuLTMwMDAwMC1pbnRvLTEtbWlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Dow Stocks That Can Turn $300000 Into $1 Million by 2030,"These well-known profitable and time-tested Dow components can make you a millionaire by the turn of the decade.

In two months the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 0.46%) will celebrate its 126th ""birthday."" Since its founding in May 1896 it's evolved from a 12-stock industrial-dominated index to one that now houses 30 highly successful and diverse multinational companies.

It's also an index full of stocks that have a rich history of making patient investors money. Over the next eight years three Dow stocks stand out as having a good chance to outperform their peers. If you invest $300000 into these Dow components now they have the tools and intangible needed to potentially make you a millionaire by 2030.

Salesforce

The Dow stock I feel most confident about increasing in value by 233% over the next eight years is cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software solutions provider Salesforce.com (CRM 0.72%). Salesforce has averaged an annual gain of nearly 27% for shareholders since March 2005. In other words it doubles on average every 2.7 years.

CRM software is used by consumer-facing businesses to enhance existing customer relationships and boost sales. Some of the more common tasks businesses utilize CRM software for include overseeing online marketing campaigns handling product and service issues and running predictive sales analyses. The latter can be particularly helpful in determining which clients would be likeliest to purchase a new product or service.

As you might have guessed CRM software is geared toward the service industry. However it's made inroads in the financial healthcare and industrial sectors in recent years. CRM software is fully expected to offer low double-digit annual global growth potential through at least mid-decade if not beyond.

Salesforce slots in as the undisputed No. 1 of global CRM spending. According to a report from IDC Salesforce accounted for almost 24% of global CRM spend in the first-half of 2021. By comparison its four-closest competitors in market share didn't even add up to 20% on a combined basis. Salesforce is the go-to CRM solutions provider and is unlikely to cede significant share anytime soon.

It's also a company that's benefited immensely from inorganic growth. CEO and founder Marc Benioff has made a number of amazing acquisitions including MuleSoft Tableau Software and Slack Technologies. These deals not only expand the company's sales channels but they allow Salesforce to reach a broader audience of small-and-medium-sized businesses with their ecosystem of solutions.

Benioff is forecasting a near-doubling in full-year sales by mid-decade ($50 billion in fiscal 2026) making Salesforce the fast-growing Dow component investors should want to own.

UnitedHealth Group

Another Dow stock that can turn a $300000 investment into $1 million by 2030 is insurance and healthcare solutions giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.39%). Over the past 25 years UnitedHealth has averaged an annual return of around 19%. If we include dividends this average annual return jumps to about 20%. This means the company has been doubling investors' money on average every 3.6 years.

UnitedHealth is probably best known for its insurance segment. Even though health insurance tends to be a relatively slow-growing operating model it's very profitable. Insurance companies are typically able to pass along higher premiums to counteract rising costs.

Aside from strong premium pricing power UnitedHealth can continue to benefit from the existence of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)(sometimes referred to as ""Obamacare""). Despite the ACA requiring insurers to accept people with pre-existing conditions it also encouraged a lot of healthier people to purchase insurance as well.

However the real growth driver for UnitedHealth Group is its healthcare services subsidiary Optum. Optum has three segments of its own which provide everything from pharmacy prescription refills to data analytics and software to healthcare organizations. Optum has consistently grown faster than the insurance segment and it generally produces higher margins too. Thanks mostly to Optum Wall Street's consensus estimate calls for UnitedHealth to grow its full-year sales from $287.6 billion in 2021 to more than $497 billion by 2026. That's incredible sales growth for a megacap company.

At its current growth trajectory I believe UnitedHealth Group has the potential to more than triple its earnings per share by 2030 to north of $60 which in turn should send its shares a lot higher.

Visa

A third and final Dow stock with the ability to turn $300000 into $1 million by 2030 is payment processor Visa (V 1.56%). Over the trailing 14 years Visa has averaged an annual total return including dividends paid of around 21%. This means it's doubled investors' money on average every 3.4 years.

The most logical reason to buy Visa is the company's cyclical ties. In short it does well when the U.S. and global economy are expanding and it struggles a bit during recessions when consumers and businesses don't spend as much. The thing is recessions typically last for a few months or a couple of quarters whereas periods of economic expansion are usually measured in years. Visa is the type of company that allows patient investors to take advantage of the natural long-term expansion of the U.S. and global economy.

But let's be clear it also doesn't hurt that Visa controls a majority of credit card market share by network purchase volume in the U.S. -- the largest market for consumption in the world. Between 2009 and 2018 no payment processor saw a bigger jump in U.S. network purchase volume share than Visa. In fact Visa's 53.1% share in 2018 was 31 percentage points higher than its next-closest competitor.

Additionally Visa has a long runway with which to expand its payment infrastructure. It can do so via acquisition as it did with Visa Europe in 2016 or it can organically push into underbanked markets such as the Middle East Africa and Southeastern Asia. With much of the world still reliant on cash for transactions Visa looks to be sitting on a multidecade opportunity.

Lastly take into consideration that Visa purely acts as a payment processor and not a lender. Although lending would allow the company to reap the rewards of interest income and fees during long periods of economic expansion it would also expose it to loan delinquencies during recessions. Not lending means not having to set aside capital to cover delinquencies.

Paul Todd/Outside Images

Second Wind may be just the perfect name possible for the La Dow family Etchells. Back in his heyday at San Diego YC father Andy was a standout sailor particularly in the local Etchells fleet and always a top finisher in the big fleets of years past including three class wins in the Helly Hansen Sailing World Regatta Series in San Diego. While dad was excelling in the elegant and cranky keelboat his two sons Jake and Will were doing the same in the Sabots and then 420s and onward to college where they too had standout careers.

And while this was happening later in life dad got busy in the real estate business and the Etchells eventually sat idle on its trailer collecting pollen and Santa Ana dust. The pandemic winds would blow Will home from San Francisco to San Diego the young software salesman now able to work remotely. Will says racing with his father was something they’d discussed for a long time but only when he moved back to San Diego did they consider it more seriously. And soon enough the three of them would find themselves together shoulder to shoulder on the side deck of the family Etchells its long and pointy bow rising and falling over humping Pacific swells. The boat had sat for three years and here they were together for the first time a new team who’s chemistry is simply its blood.

Their first event would be the 2021 Etchells Pacific Coast Championship. Will would skipper dad would handle the bow. “It all went well” was dad’s assessment. “The takeaway was that we had some potential here.”

Potential indeed: With an older boat desperate for the latest upgrades and a set of outdated rags they won their second regatta (without Jake however who was off racing J/70s). “My biggest concern was time in the boat” La Dow says “but I quickly realized we were going to be a force to be reckoned with right out of the gates.”

An lo-and-behold they absolutely enjoy sailing with each other.

“I will say it is a privilege to be able to sail with my dad on the boat” says La Dow. “It’s cool that we’ve both had success in sailing separately and can now do it together. Through sailing we are both able to compete at a high level and spend some quality bonding time together. There have been times where we’ve been in a tough spot [on the racecourse] where it may not feel like bonding but we always enjoy it.”

In the three years since the La Dows packed away Second Wind much has changed with the infinitely tunable Etchells—mast setup sail design and especially control systems—so the task at hand is for them to get the boat up to snuff. With so many top-shelf teams operating out of the San Diego YC boat park these days there’s knowledge and sharing aplenty says young La Dow.

“The fleet is really open these days and welcoming to new people that join the fleet. At the last event Chris Busch (fleet captain) hosted a debrief with all the top guys and got them to share what’s working—all these different things that in the past would be very secretive among certain boats. It’s been democratized across the fleet to get the level up so there’s more competition and the racing is more challenging and enjoyable.”

The La Dow’s Second Wind is hull No. 985 is considered an older boat. “But the hull seems fast enough” La Dow says. They’ve been working with local a local boat servicing company run by Chuck Eaton and Patrick Powell which specializes in upgrading Etchells. They’ve add a jib in-hauler system a mainsheet fine tune a mast ram and shims and an above-deck adjustable forestay.

“We’ve had to move quite a bit of hardware” La Dow says. “It was a bit of work but it’s done and ready to go.”

For the 2022 Helly Hansen Sailing World Regatta in March they will sail four-up with La Dow’s longtime mate and multi-national champion Scott Sinks as well as a pickup junior from the club.

Everyone was excited when the La Dows came back to the fleet and Will is doing his best to lure his peers and sailing buddies into the class. “It’s a really fun boat to sail” he says. “It is kind of like a keelboat version of the Club 420 as far as driving it and it’s fun to be able to get out of the small boats and do some open ocean racing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRrZXIuY28vcC9wZXRlci1seW5jaC0xOTk0LXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1lYXJuaW5nc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Legendary stock picker Peter Lynch made a remarkably prescient market observation in 1994,"Peter Lynch (Source: CSPAN )

[ NOTE: There will be no newsletter on Sunday April 3. TKer will be on vacation .]

Peter Lynch the legendary stock picker who ran Fidelity’s market-beating Magellan Fund for 13 years made a prescient observation in a speech he gave to the National Press Club back in October 7 1994.

It comes from the 38-minute mark of this video (via @DividendGrowth):

Some event will come out of left field and the market will go down or the market will go up. Volatility will occur. Markets will continue to have these ups and downs. … Basic corporate profits have grown about 8% a year historically. So corporate profits double about every nine years. The stock market ought to double about every nine years. So I think — the market is about 3800 today or 3700 — I'm pretty convinced the next 3800 points will be up; it won't be down. The next 500 points the next 600 points — I don’t know which way they’ll go. So the market ought to double in the next eight or nine years. They’ll double again in eight or nine years after that. Because profits go up 8% a year and stocks will follow. That's all there is to it.

When he says “the market” Lynch is referring the Dow Jones Industrial Average which closed at 3797 on the day he gave the talk.

If you compound that by an 8% growth rate over 27.5 years which would get you to present day then you get 31520.

The Dow closed Friday at 34861 which is pretty darn close. For context a 7% growth rate would’ve gotten you to 24405 and a 9% rate would’ve gotten you to 40613.

If you did this exercise with the S&P 500 which closed at 455 on the day of Lynch’s talk then you’d get 3778 assuming an 8% compound annual growth rate. The S&P closed Friday at 4543. (A 9% rate would’ve gotten you to 4867.)

According to S&P Dow Jones Indices S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) were $30.11 for the 12 months ending Q3 1994 around the time Lynch gave that speech. If you compounded that by 8% over 27.5 years you’d get $250. S&P Dow Jones Indices estimates EPS for the 12 months ending March 2022 was actually $211 which is close. (They estimate S&P EPS will be $246 in 2023.)

Lynch was not predicting the precise point of the market in March 2022. He was talking about how markets trend over longer-term periods while acknowledging short-term volatility. If you allow him some margin of error to account for unpredictable short-term swings then you may be able to better appreciate how his thoughts speak to some fundamental market truths we often talk about here at TKer.

I think three elements of what Lynch said are critical for investors to understand.

1: ‘Some event will come out of left field and the market will go down or the market will go up. Volatility will occur.‘

This relates to TKer stock market truth No. 8: “The most destabilizing risks are the ones people aren’t talking about.“

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a good example. For investors a conflict between Russia and Ukraine had not been a concern so markets weren’t prepared for it. This would explain why stocks went into a deep correction amid the initial news and buildup.

With these types of unforeseen events prices will swing wildly as markets digest every positive and negative development as the situation unfolds.

This stands in contrast to the risks everyone has been talking about like inflation and tighter monetary policy. These risks had investors concerned for months before those fears were confirmed and the actual news eventually had a limited effect on market volatility.

2: ‘I’m pretty convinced the next 3800 points will be up; it won't be down. The next 500 points the next 600 points — I don’t know which way they’ll go.‘

Over time the stock market’s biggest moves will be to the upside (which relates to TKer stock market truth No. 4) and the long game is undefeated (which is TKer stock market truth No. 1.) But you can certainly get smoked in the short term (TKer stock market truth No. 2).

As we discuss frequently here on TKer big sell-offs are actually pretty normal. The S&P 500 experiences an average max drawdown (i.e. the biggest intra-year sell-off) of 14% a year.

For what it’s worth the current market correction has seen the S&P 500 fall 12% from its high of 2022 which is less bad than average.

Lynch’s comment speaks to the advantage of a long-term investment horizon which is a valuable edge most investors have.

3: ‘Profits go up 8% a year and stocks will follow. That's all there is to it.’

The stock market has historically usually gone up because earnings have usually gone up. That’s because earnings are the most important driver of stock prices which is TKer stock market truth No. 5.

Check out this chart of S&P 500 earnings since 1986 courtesy of Yardeni Research. It’s on a logarithmic scale which smooths out the curve you get when growth is compounding at a steady rate over time.

There’s some short term noise. But over time earnings have been going up and to the right.

Jurrien Timmer director of global macro at Fidelity Investments recently shared a chart showing the tight relationship between earnings and stock prices.

Stock prices are on the y-axis accompanied by earnings on the x-axis. The data goes back all the way to 1871. The r-squared of 0.9686 in this linear regression is very close to 1 which means earnings do an extremely good job of explaining how stock prices behave.

In other words stocks go where profits go.

“That's all there is to it” Lynch said.

The S&P Indices versus Active (SPIVA) scorecard which tracks the performance of actively managed funds against their respective category benchmarks recently showed 79% of fund managers underperformed the S&P last year. It reflects an 86% jump over the past 10 years.

S&P Global CEO Doug Peterson told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" the quarterly report is built on non-public information.

""The only people who have access to it have very strict rules about their own standards of performance and behavior"" Peterson said last week. ""[The S&P Dow Jones Indices committee] is able to look at the economy as a whole or look at different aspects of what they want to have the index perform against.""

The corporation has been releasing its annual SPIVA report since 2002. First it was focused on the U.S. and later was extended to countries across the globe.

The latest report marks 12 consecutive years the average actively managed large-cap fund underperformed the S&P 500 noted Todd Rosenbluth CFRA senior director of ETF and mutual fund research.

""It's hard to outperform"" Rosenbluth said on ""ETF Edge."" ""It costs more for active managers when they're trying to compete with the S&P 500 that is essentially free through the ETF wrapper.""

Pensacola surfer and boat captain Mike Davis has seen the issue first-hand.

On March 18 while driving out to Orange Beach Alabama to surf Davis wound up rescuing two children from the Gulf.

Davis told the News Journal that the two children were visiting from Georgia and swimming in the Gulf close to sunset. Rip currents quickly pulled them from waste-deep water near the shoreline far out to sea.

He heard the youngest child a boy about 8 or 9 years old — the same age as his son — yell out muffled cries of ""help me"" through the waves.

After taking turns helping bring the boy and his sister back to the shore Davis said he felt more exhausted than any marathon he had ever run.

""I was exhausted. I still had to swim against the rip and I was questioning if I was going to make it to the beach myself"" Davis later wrote in a Facebook post about the incident.

Davis said he returned to the coastline only to find out that the two kids were left to swim alone while family members waited back inside the Perdido Beach Resort.

Unfortunately incidents like this are seemingly occurring more frequently as people flock back to the beaches.

2022 shaping up to be one of Pensacola Beach's busiest rescue seasons

The 2021 season was one of the busiest Pensacola Beach lifeguards have seen in the past five years and Escambia County Water Safety Chief Dave Greenwood anticipates the 2022 season to be just as active.

March and April are the prime season for rip currents due to the powerful frontal winds that sweep over the Gulf of Mexico. It's common to start seeing several instances a week in which lifeguards need to either stop beachgoers from entering the water or are called out to make a rescue Greenwood said.

Sometimes other beachgoers step in to try to assist as Davis did but Greenwood cautioned that good-intentioned people can exacerbate the situation if they are also swept into the rip. The best course of action is to call 911 and let lifeguards fulfill their duty.

Greenwood said this exact situation occurred March 16 on Pensacola Beach as two water rescues doubled into four. He said Pensacola Beach lifeguards and Escambia County Fire Rescue rescued four swimmers who were swept into the current two of whom had gone in trying to save the first pair.

The incident required the help of Station No. 13's wave runners to reach the swimmers. Two of the swimmers were ultimately transported to a local hospital.

Pensacola's famous beach ball repainted:What's happening to Pensacola Beach's famous beach ball? It's getting a makeover.

Greenwood said 80% of rescues are rip-current related.From 2017 to 2020 Pensacola Beach lifeguards averaged 250 active rescues each year but in 2021 they had more than double that with 529 rescues.

The number of people Pensacola Beach lifeguards have kept out of the water for safety reasons has also been rising over the past five years. They made contact with about 27000 in 2017 and that number rose to over 173000 last year.

How Pensacola Beach lifeguards are preparing

Greenwood said he plans to have an additional 43 lifeguards hired by the start of the summer season on Memorial Day. After Memorial Day lifeguards will also be allocated to different beaches throughout Gulf Islands National Seashore.

The safety flags put out every morning on the beach and announced on the Pensacola Beach Lifeguards Facebook page give people an indication of the conditions when going out to swim.

But Greenwood cautioned that swimming in the Gulf is much more difficult than swimming in still water due to the unpredictability of waves and marine life. Even the most experienced swimmers can have a difficult time facing the currents.

While there awareness signs plastered all over the beach perimeter it can still be hard to know exactly what to do when you're actually being swept out to sea by the tide. Even if it it’s difficult to see the break in the water indicating a rip current a scalloped shoreline can be an indicator.

“It’s easy to see on a graphic but not as easy when looking out at the water” Escambia County Public Safety Information Officer Davis Wood said. “Always approach a lifeguard and ask to show you where the safe spots are.”

Greenwood said lifeguards spend red-flag days patrolling the beach and keeping swimmers out of the water when currents are too strong. Greenwood said the lifeguards are extensively trained to use the current to their advantage swimming right into the line of danger and pulling victims back to shore.

Most drownings occur when the sun is out the surf is high or it’s a holiday: making the days leading around the Fourth of July holiday and the Blue Angels Air Show this year on July 9 a particularly dangerous time for potential drowning.

Companies with high profits and revenue per employee are presumed to be the most successful. Alphabet Microsoft and Meta Platforms owner of Facebook are such companies. These tech companies are among the largest in the United States based on revenue and they are among the youngest large companies. Several were founded in the past 25 years. However a group of relatively small companies leads the list of highest profit per employee.

Data for the recent “Profit per Employee” research paper from software company Tipalti came from the Fortune 500. The paper examined 914 major companies most of which made a profit per employee in the last year. Only 238 reported a loss per employee. The company that has the most profits per employee is Air Lease. The company reported $516 million in profits or $4.3 million per employee.

Air Lease with an employee count of 120 buys passenger planes and leases them to airlines. The process allows carriers that do not have capital access to planes. Air Lease makes its profit largely off the interest it charges these carriers. The company was hurt by the trouble with the aviation industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic but its financials have started to recover.

When the company announced its 2021 results John L. Plueger chief executive officer and president commented: “We had a strong fourth quarter and second half of 2021 that benefited from continuing airline industry recovery as seen in our cash collections operating metrics fleet expansion and record lease placement.”

Air Lease owns 474 planes that it leases to 118 customers in 60 countries. The company is based in Los Angeles. (See if Air Lease is also among the 50 best companies to work for.)

To find the 50 companies with the most profits per employee 24/7 Wall St. reviewed Tipalti’s “Profit per Employee” research paper. Very few of the companies with the highest profit per employee are large tech companies. Meta is highest among these ranking 11th with a profit of nearly $500000 per employee based on over 58000 workers. Several financial firms are ahead of Meta.

Mortgage giant Fannie Mae has profit of $1.5 million per employee based on 7700 workers. This places it second on the list. The third is private equity firm KKR at $1.3 million per employee based on 1583 workers. (Find out if any of the companies on this list were also among the most innovative companies in 2021.)

DTE,DTE Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbnJvZW5ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMy8yNy9wb3J0LW1vbnJvZS1zYXctc2hhcnAtaW5jcmVhc2UtY2FyZ28tZXhwZWN0cy1idXN5LXllYXIvNzE2MzU1NzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Port of Monroe saw sharp increase in cargo expects busy year,"As the Port of Monroe sails into the next shipping season recent data highlighting last year’s trends shows a significant increase of inter-lake trade.

In 2021 the local port handled nearly 2.8 million tons of cargo through its dock. That’s an increase from 2020’s figure of about 1.5 million tons.

Port Director Paul LaMarre III said the port continues to be shaped by its resilience and adaptability.

“We have undoubtedly had what other ports or institutions would consider insurmountable obstacles to redefine ourselves as not only an active seaport but a public agency that puts its community first” he added. “We try to remain purely positive and unrelenting in our efforts to ensure as much cargo and as many people working across our docks as possible.”

LaMarre said 2020 was marked by components needed for wind energy. Fourteen consecutive ships from Europe delivered wind tower components to the area to supplement wind towers built at Ventower in Monroe.

Last year trends shifted elsewhere as a result of the pandemic regulations and consumer needs. LaMarre said the port was fortunate to see the return of steel coil cargo.

“The steel coil market is one of our most important cargos” he added.

Much of that steel is produced in Canada which is the country’s largest trade partner LaMarre said adding that such trade relations are a testament to the cross-border trade market that exists on Lake Erie.

Much of that cargo was handled by McKeil Marine a Canada-based company. LaMarre said the company was one of the most frequent visitors to the port last year and will likely retain that designation this shipping season.

The port’s largest cargo was coal and petroleum coke which accounted for about 1.6 millions tons of cargo. The material which is handled through the port’s partnership with DTE Energy was an increase from 2020’s metric of about 938000 tons.

Limestone accounted for the second largest cargo type. Another partnership with DTE approximately 285000 tons were handled last year. That’s down from the previous year’s total of about 345000 tons.

Both cargo types are used at the Monroe Power Plant which sits near the port on the city’s Lake Erie shoreline.

LaMarre said there was a definite increase in vessels calling on the port on behalf of cargo resulting from its partnership with DTE.

“On some days you have two simultaneous cargo operations going on at two different docks that had previously sat dormant for decades” he said. “It’s about all of the activity — not just what occurs when the cargo is moving across the docks but also elsewhere in the various supply chains.”

Liquid asphalt had a negligible change year-over-year. A partnership with Michigan Paving and Materials about 137000 tons of the material moved through the port. Other gains came in the port’s bulk product and project cargo categories.

Bulk product climbed to about 117000 tons up from 64000 in 2020. Similarly project cargo — mainly steel coils — accounted for 132000 tons. That’s up from a previous total of 43000.

“(Those cargos) have allowed us to establish our identity of efficiency economics and … working with our vessel one partners — those continue to be at heart of our operation” LaMarre said. “… we always look at way to attract new cargo opportunities and enhance our infrastructure.”

LaMarre said there has been a significant increase in the need for more efficient and viable options for moving containerized cargo into the Midwest.

“It’s never been a more prevalent issue” LaMarre said. “Addressing it fits very well with the Port of Monroe’s mission to establish the first maritime container terminal in the State of Michigan.”

And that’s a goal LaMarre expects to accomplish in 2023. It will be known as the Michigan Maritime Gateway he added. The port has worked for more than seven years to be able to handle containerized cargo.

A regulatory standoff between the port and Customs and Border Patrol persisted for several years as local officials sought to handle containerized cargo.

Deals spearheaded by LaMarre and other port officials were scuttled as CBP barred the port from handling such cargo.

LaMarre had secured a deal with Ford Motor Co. to export Ford Mustangs to Europe via the St. Lawrence Seaway. As the pilot program launched CBP intervened saying it could not regularly dedicate the needed manpower from its Detroit field office for such an endeavor. The agency also told the port it needed to acquire additional security screening equipment.

Another deal with Arauco North America was halted. As the first of several ships approached the Port of Monroe CBP officials in Detroit diverted the vessel to the Port of Cleveland statin no port in the state would be permitted to handle the cargo.

A study conducted by the University of Michigan found that CBP’s policies had cost the Monroe region substantial revenue and jobs.

The issue prompted a bipartisan coalition of federal lawmakers to take up the cause. Democrat Sen. Gary Peters and Republican Rep. Tim Walberg pushed CBP for answers and clarifications.

State lawmakers passed a bipartisan resolution calling for changes highlighting the impact such policies had on the state economy. State Sen. Dale Zorn R-Ida co-sponsored the resolution.

In August LaMarre and Peters hosted a delegation of bureaucrats from the agency touring the port and explaining its positions and desire to be able to engage in handling more cargo. Troy Miller the acting commissioner of CBP and other officials were in attendance.

The port received federal grant funding to increase its security and scanning equipment.

“It is very gratifying to say that (CBP) is now our partner as we aim to establish and open that terminal” LaMarre said. “We have had amazing support from CBP (Peters) (Walberg) and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office.

“We have had amazing support from the city and county that are assisting the port to ensure that we continue to be and grow as one of Monroe County’s most important economic drivers.”

The venture is possible through the combined efforts of Spliethoff Big Lift and the port’s terminal operator DRM Terminal Services LaMarre said.

“We are strategically positioned for so many reasons particularly because of our national cargo challenges to really be that gateway port as the first maritime stop in Michigan.

“…While the port provides guidance infrastructure and leadership it is the efforts of each and every (stakeholders’) employees that keeps cargo moving across our docks with efficiency and pride.”

LaMarre who came to the port 10 years ago said the year ahead is a culmination of all the port team’s efforts. He expects the port will handle a record number of steel coil shipments wind towers and bulk cargos.

The rest of the year will remain busy for the port which is one of the busiest on the Great Lakes. Steel coils began arriving at the port earlier this month.

The St. Lawrence Seaway which has long been a strategic part of the port’s mission and the Soo Locks opened this week. It marks the earliest opening of the seaway since 2008.

A Manitowoc Crawler Crane will set up at the port later this spring as well. The addition increases the port’s ability to handle cargo a port official added.

The Army Corps of Engineers also will see significant dredging occur this year. It’s part of maintaining the navigability of the waterway.

“The port will continue to fight for every ton of cargo that we can handle because of all the people that cargo effects” LaMarre added.",,,,,,,,,,,,

How do we report it?,"Question: How do we go about having one of those purple streetlights replaced? There is one that lights up the entire end of our street with a purple-colored glow. It has been like this for at least a year maybe longer and it makes this part of our neighborhood appear not just eerie but also extremely unattractive.

J.A.

Answer: The streetlights glow a purple color due to a manufacturing flaw. Duke Energy is replacing them as they find them or they are reported.

The manufacturer is covering the cost.

There are several ways to report a light that needs to be replaced according to Jimmy Flythe the central region director of government and community relations for Duke Energy Carolinas.

He recommends customers go to duke-energy.com/outages and click the “Request a light repair” link. Once you choose your location you’ll get a map that can be searched by address. Click on the light in question to request service.

“Customers can also call us at 800-777-9898 to report the problem” said Flythe.

Q: I made some contributions recently in memory of friends who have died. Now I’m getting requests from other charities some of which I don’t support the cause asking for donations. How can I stop these requests?

N.P.

A: Charity Navigator an online charity evaluator recommends that you contact the charity you don’t want to hear from directly either by phone mail or email and ask to be removed from their list. Also you can ask them where they got your contact information. It’s not always another charity. Contact them and ask that they not release your information.

You can also make an anonymous gift. For more information about Charity Navigator go to charitynavigator.org.

You can also register with the Data and Marketing Association’s list of people who do not want various types of unsolicited mail including mail from charities. There is a $2 processing fee to register.

For more information about DMA go to dmachoice.org.

Q: Now that we can travel more I recently flew to visit some friends. Why are they still making the “don’t smoke during the flight” announcement when giving the safety instructions? No one has been able to smoke on commercial flights in more than 30 years.

S.V.

A: Federal law says airline crews have to make the announcement. Also people still try to smoke on planes.

A spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration explained the reasons behind continuing to make the “don’t smoke” announcement.

“Smoking on an aircraft including the use of e-cigarette devices is a violation of federal regulation. Passengers must be advised of that. The passenger briefing is required by federal regulation (§ 121.571(a)(1)(i)).

“Additionally the FAA enforces such violations through civil penalties under its current zero-tolerance policy.”

According to a June 14 news release from the FAA the agency is proposing to fine a passenger $10300 for lighting up an e-cigarette and also for not following a flight attendant’s instructions on an Alaska Airlines flight from Boise Idaho to Los Angeles on Feb. 3 2021.

“The FAA alleges the passenger smoked an e-cigarette in the airplane lavatory which activated the lavatory smoke detector system. The FAA further alleges the passenger walked through the cabin without his facemask over his mouth and nose and repeatedly ignored flight attendants’ instructions to wear his facemask properly.”

Q: My email address has changed since I filed my state income return. Who should I contact to get it sent to this new email address?

B.C.

A: Dia Harris the director of public affairs for the North Carolina Department of Revenue said “The North Carolina Department of Revenue does not require the taxpayer’s updated email address in order to correspond with him/her or for the taxpayer to receive a refund that may be due.

If the NCDOR needs to contact the taxpayer we will send correspondence via the US Postal Service or contact him/her by phone.”

City staff reported signs of progress this week such as the debut of electric buses on city streets. But they also said the city may need to buy carbon offsets to hit its target of eliminating fossil fuel emissions in its buildings and vehicles.

Those were among the messages from the Office of Sustainability & Resilience at meetings this week of the city council environment committee and a citizen advisory group.

Just a reminder: The city's 2018 Strategic Energy Action Plan calls for shifting to 100% zero-carbon energy in municipal buildings and vehicles by 2030. And city leaders are calling on the rest of us to take steps to become a ""low-carbon"" city by 2050. That means cutting per-person carbon emissions to 2 tons per year across the city. In 2019 it was 11 tons.

Here are a few updates reported this week:



E-buses are on the road. The city's first two electric buses began running last week. They're part of a $23 million 12- to 18-month electric bus pilot that will allow Charlotte Area Transit System to test drive models from two different manufacturers. The pilot also will help CATS determine what it will take to convert the entire 300-bus fleet to electric vehicles. ""We are looking forward to learning how this technology is going to work in our community with our topography and our temperatures. With our operators we're hoping to better understand range and energy use"" Catherine Kummer CATS sustainability officer said at a meeting of the Strategic Energy Action Plan External Content Group on Monday.

Those are six corridors stretching west north and east from uptown that have lower average incomes a higher percentage of people of color and poorer air quality.

Solar farm opening pushed to 2023. As the city tries to cut its use of fossil-fuel-powered energy it's planning to buy power from a private solar farm in Iredell County through Duke Energy's Green Source Advantage program. The 35-megawatt solar farm is still going through permitting but it's expected to be finished next year according to Heather Bolick of the city sustainability office. The city says it will provide about 16.8% of the city's electricity by 2030. That's less than a previous estimate of 24%. City officials have said it will save about $2 million over 20 years. City of Charlotte Office of Sustainability & Resilience Officials say this is what the city's energy mix will look like in 2030 based on current projections. There's still an 18% gap that the city needs to fill to become carbon-free by then.

A future gap. Besides the solar farm Charlotte city facilities will still get most of their energy in 2030 from Duke Energy which will have a mix of fossil-powered and renewable energy sources. The city is counting on further de-carbonization by Duke to help meet its goals. It also will have more solar on its own buildings. But there's still an 18% gap Bolick said at a meeting of the city council environment committee earlier Monday. ""That is (the) gap we are trying to close either through offsets or further investments to reach our 2030 goal"" she said. That could mean buying carbon credits which pay for investments elsewhere such as tree planting or renewable energy projects that would make up for continued carbon emissions. (City buildings and facilities exclude the light rail system and traffic signal network.)

(City buildings and facilities exclude the light rail system and traffic signal network.) Charger network expanding. The city now has 105 electric vehicle charging stations with 194 ports. Of those 50 are available to the public. One interesting statistic: The city now manages 41% of all charging stations in Charlotte public or private.

The city's internal goal may be easier to meet than the community-wide goal. A rough estimate is that city governments typically account for no more than 10% of a city's carbon emissions. Reducing the other 90% of emissions will take a community effort Bolick told the SEAP external committee.

""The community is the largest part"" she said. ""And so that's why we will really depend upon our partners all of you to help us get there. What we're tasked with doing is leading by example and hopefully showing how it can be done and instigating. But we definitely are not going to be the major piece of the pie.""

Four NCAA tournament victories later they may be the team to beat.

SAN FRANCISCO — Mike Krzyzewski showed some agility for a septuagenarian with a slight limp dodging workers bringing the podium onto the court for assembly and making a backdoor cut behind Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner Jim Phillips. He was headed to the Duke cheering section to embrace his wife Mickie and the generations of family members who were with her. Retirement was pushed back again; another Final Four needed to be celebrated.

The looks on the faces of the Krzyzewski family Saturday night—and the faces of the Duke players—were diametrically different from exactly three weeks ago. Stricken then beaming now. Coach K’s grandiose send-off from Cameron Indoor Stadium had flopped on March 5 ending with an upset at the hands of North Carolina that left him apologizing to the crowd and declaring the performance “unacceptable.” At that moment his team buckling beneath the weight of trying to make a legend’s final act a success it was hard to envision these Blue Devils transforming into the likely Final Four favorite.

Four NCAA tournament victories later here we are. Duke is fresh and formidable rolling toward a national semifinal that will either be the ultimate rivalry game (vs. North Carolina) or the ultimate David–Goliath matchup (vs. Saint Peter’s). It’s one last juicy stop in a Farewell Tour extending all the way to a final Final Four.

The Blue Devils pose with the West Region trophy. Kyle Terada/USA TODAY Sports

“I’m a grandfather I’ve lived through my daughters and then my granddaughters and now through these guys” K said gesturing to his team after Duke’s authoritative 78–69 victory over Arkansas. A couple moments later Krzyzewski excused himself from an oncourt media scrum saying “I’m going to go cut down the net.”

He knew the drill. This was the 13th time he’d climbed a ladder and snipped a regional championship net surpassing John Wooden for the most men’s Final Fours in history. The first time Krzyzewski did it in 1986 he was 39. The 36-year span between first and last Final Fours ties DePaul’s Ray Meyer (first 1943 last 1979) for the longest in history.

When the West Region net had been snipped Krzyzewski turned and handed it to someone before descending the ladder under the basket. The last thing anyone needed was a mishap now so K used both hands to steady himself. At age 75 with a chance to become the oldest national championship coach by a whopping seven years this was no time to take chances.

The frailty that accompanies aging can soften hard stances in the sporting world. Tiger Woods was loved by plenty but also disliked by plenty—yet when he unexpectedly won the Masters at age 43 there was an accompanying surge of respect and affection. This feels similar for Krzyzewski whose career arc has included a couple of decades as a popular villain.

The roars in the Chase Center Saturday night drowned out the haters by a large margin. They still exist—online especially—but this next week could be a Louisiana love-in.

At this point the daunting task facing this team is largely fulfilled but tantalizingly incomplete. The young Blue Devils with nobody older than 20 playing more than five minutes against the Razorbacks have done enough to send out their legendary leader on a high note. If reaching the Sweet 16 is a benchmark of tournament success reaching the Final Four is “the Promised Land” as Krzyzewski put it Saturday. That’s when good seasons become great seasons.

This team has done what coaches always strive for. It has reached its potential.

“That’s either the biggest good feeling you could have or the biggest bad feeling you have” Krzyzewski said Friday. “If our season ended after Virginia Tech [a loss in the ACC tournament championship game] even though we won the league … it would have been a downer. So we’re very fortunate to have this and for these guys to do so well in their end-of-game situations. I don’t remember records as much as how we ended and so I hope this doesn’t end tomorrow.”

Not only did it not end there wasn’t even much stress involved in extending the season to the final weekend. After white-knuckling through consecutive thrillers against Michigan State and Texas Tech to reach the regional final the last one was a stroll. Duke seized command late in the first half and other than a brief flurry from the Razorbacks near the middle of the second half this game was firmly in control most of the way.

So yeah Final Four mission accomplished. This was how Krzyzewski described it Friday: “I call it crossing the bridge and very few people cross that bridge. I've been able to cross it with my teams 12 times and to cross with this team would be an amazing thing for me. I know what's on the other side of the bridge. They don't. They can only look at it. So it makes me want it more for them.”

Saturday night he issued an update: “They crossed the bridge man.”

But there is still territory to conquer on the other side of the bridge. This Duke team has fulfilled its potential but hasn’t yet achieved all its goals. And in what has been an entertainingly ruinous tournament the Blue Devils can absolutely win it all.

No. 1 seeds Gonzaga Arizona and Baylor have been dismissed. Fellow No. 2 seed Villanova is limping to New Orleans after what looked like a major injury to Justin Moore in the final minute of the South Region championship—a disastrous development for a thin team. Kansas could stake a claim to being the Final Four favorite but first the Jayhawks have to beat Miami. The way Duke played in smoking the Hogs it could well be the team to beat.

The Devils have done enough to make Krzyzewski’s final season a success. But they have a realistic opportunity to do more—with a final chapter that could be epic.

Although it has proven fatal to overlook No. 15 seed Saint Peter’s the matchup looming larger than life would be Duke–North Carolina. The two mega-rivals have played each other 257 times but they’ve never met in the NCAA tournament. If the first matchup is a Final Four game—with K’s career in the balance and revenge in the air for that shocker in Cameron—Tobacco Road may spontaneously combust this week.

When a reporter tried to ask the Duke players their thoughts about another potential shot at the Tar Heels Krzyzewski intercepted the question. Sensing a potential rhetorical land mine he erected a barricade that kept his team from stepping on it. (Intercepting potentially tricky questions is nothing new for Coach K. Ironically it may well be something he learned from old rival Dean Smith at North Carolina. Smith was well-versed in controlling the direction of a press conference.)

“You know what it's going to be an honor for us to go against whoever is the regional champion of that region” Krzyzewski said. “There's no greater day in college basketball than when those four regional champions four champions get under one in one arena and play. It's the greatest day for college basketball and we're honored to be a part of it.”

No bulletin board material for you Carolina and Saint Peter’s.

Two legendary coaches have memorably gone out on top in this sport in different fashions: UCLA’s Wooden in 1975 at the age of 64 and Marquette’s Al McGuire in ’77 at the age of 48. Wooden dropped his bombshell news during that Final Four in San Diego announcing after winning the semifinal game against Louisville that the championship contest against Kentucky would be his last. McGuire made his announcement in mid-December just four games into that season.

Both put pressure on their players to pull off the perfect ending. Krzyzewski did it even earlier calling his shot last June and citing a desire to be ethical in recruiting—he didn’t want anyone to commit to play for him and then pull the rug out by retiring. Fortunately for the Blue Devils they had the talent to send off their coach properly.

Even after it appeared to be going off the rails just three weeks ago.

Former Duke hero Grant Hill who was in the arena here as a CBS TV analyst also was among the nearly 100 former Krzyzewski players present for the letdown in Cameron. After this win he termed the loss to the Tar Heels “an embarrassment” and said the Blue Devils appeared to be worn down by the weight of the occasion. Ultimately though it was a defining moment—regroup or wither.

“It was one of those things you either don’t recover from or it gives you that grit and resolve” Hill said. “It’s done the latter for sure.”

And now with plenty of talent and a fresh infusion of positive energy Duke surges to New Orleans in search of the perfect ending for Mike Krzyzewski. As he headed for Chase Center exit Hill delivered an appropriate walk-off line:

“It smells like destiny.”

After leading France to a first Grand Slam in 12 years Dupont was named Guinness Six Nations Player of the Championship for the second time to add to the World Player of the Year award he picked up last year.

But the biggest individual accolade available for any French player right now is defence coach Shaun Edwards’ prize for the top defender in a match.

In the biggest games the reward is a bottle of Dom Perignon and after racking up 15 tackles in the 25-13 win over England – equalling the record for a French scrum-half held by his coach Fabien Galthié 20 years ago – Dupont is hoping that he will have done enough to get the nod.

He said: “We’ve not had our debrief yet so I’ve not been able to get it but I hope that at our next meet-up I will. He’s not wanted to give me the award for best defender so far since he’s been with us!”

Edwards now has four Grand Slams to his name as a coach having previously won three with Wales and his impact on this French team has been evident.

Despite largely winning the kicking battle at the Stade de France England managed just one try and had very few chances as they struggled to break down their hosts.

And in a country where dazzling with ball in hand was always prioritised over work off the ball Dupont is clearly enjoying his work with Edwards.

Galthié: This Grand Slam is a victory for the 1900 clubs of French rugby

He explained: “Shaun is precise on what he wants and knows exactly what he wants on the pitch. With his experience and his record everyone listens.

“You could see the very start that he gave the scrum-half a relatively free role and they would get a lot of interceptions. That is what I used to do a lot but now he has changed his view on it and I defend a bit wider out maybe in the style of a centre which gives us an extra three-quarter in the defensive line.”

Still only 25 Dupont has taken over the French captaincy from the injured Charles Ollivon and led France to eight successive victories including putting 40 points on the All Blacks and now a Grand Slam.

They are now favourites with the bookies to lift the World Cup on home soil next year and the scary part for everyone else is that Dupont believes they still have room to grow after successive runners-up finishes in the Six Nations prior to this year’s win.

Dupont who also revealed he has been taking English lessons to improve his relationship with referees said: “I think we have gained in maturity and experience. It’s almost the same team as two years ago so we have learned a lot over the last two campaigns.

What the papers said about France Grand Slam

“On the whole we were and still are a young team that is building. Going from there you learn every day and some of those games in the Six Nations we might not have won in previous years or not in the same way.”

And as for the reports that the Six Nations trophy spent some of Saturday night in the River Seine during some over-exuberant post-Slam celebrations Dupont pleaded ignorance.

He said: “I read that story in the media but I wasn’t aware of it. I was the one who brought the trophy home from the night out around 6.30am and it was in a good state. Whether it had a little bath beforehand I don’t know.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR2ZmFuYXRpYy5jb20vc2hvd3MvbmNpcy1sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy9lcGlzb2Rlcy9zZWFzb24tMTMvcGFuZG9yYXMtYm94L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NCIS: Los Angeles Season 13 Episode 14,Robbers rob an art-storage facility and a guard is shot.

Dale Wayne Eaton was re-sentenced to life in prison without parole plus an additional 40-50 years afterwards for the first degree murder kidnapping robbery and 1st degree sexual assault of Kimmell reports Sheridan Media.

Eaton was originally given the death penalty in 2004 but that sentence was struck down by a federal judge in 2014 ruling Eaton didn’t have appropriate representation during the penalty phase of his trial.

In 2015 Natrona County prosecutors filed its intent to seek the death penalty again but recently withdrew that motion after mental evaluators found that Eaton was not competent to withstand a capital sentencing hearing but could proceed with a sentencing hearing that does not include the death penalty.

RELATED: Wyoming's ""Lil' Miss Killer"" ordered to undergo mental evaluation

Eaton was supposed to be re-sentenced this past January but due a communications break-down he was never transported from the medium security in prison near Torrington to the Natrona County Courthouse in Casper.

The Kimmell family had the option of having the sentencing be done via live video but declined.

Investigators and prosecutors say Lisa was kidnapped and murdered in the community of Moneta about 80 miles northwest of Casper.

Her body was found about 8 days later in the North Platte River southwest of Casper.

Eaton wasn’t connected to the incident until 2001.

Sentencing breakdown:

1st Degree Murder: Life in prison without parole

Aggravated Kidnapping: 40-50 years consecutive to the murder sentence.

Aggravated Robbery: 20-25 years concurrent with the kidnapping sentence but consecutive to the murder sentence.

1st Degree Sexual Assault: 20-25 years concurrent with the kidnapping and robbery sentence but consecutive to the murder sentence.

A consecutive sentence is one that will start when another sentence is finished.

Police arrived at the residence in Roswell Ga. on March 13 after social media posts appeared to show a party at the house. Thomas’s mother Katina Smith called the police to say the house “should be abandoned and empty due to her deceased son.”

Police arrested three men after arriving on the scene as Malcom Daniels Vashone Jones and Perfect Robinson were all charged with criminal trespassing. Jones told police he used to be Thomas’s “caretaker” and often returned to the residence on weekends to check in after Thomas’s death.

Daniels was also charged with purchasing possessing or having control of a controlled substance after police found cocaine after searching him. All three men were released on bond and none of the three were charged with anything connected to a robbery.

According to police reports memorabilia ranging from an ESPY award to multiple NFL jerseys including a signed Tom Brady jersey appeared to be stolen. A hyperbaric chamber guns and thousands of dollars in cash were also reportedly missing.

Thomas’s family think the house may have been robbed more than once. According to Simon Lehrer of Denver’s NBC 11 News the family said the robberies happened prior to January 11 when some of Thomas’s memorabilia was being sold on eBay. Lehrer also reported that Smith told police that the locks on the house were changed and Jones shouldn’t have had access.

Thomas was found dead in the Roswell home Dec. 9 at the age of 33 leading many in the NFL world to show their respects.

The lightsaber hilt which is a replica of that belonging to hero Cal Kestis in the game was released in Disney’s Galaxy’s Edge parks in Disneyland and Walt Disney World on March 25 2022 after winning a fan poll held two years earlier.

Now eager fans looking to get their hands on the lightsaber for the first time are being forced to pay around double the retail price as the replicas have begun appearing on Ebay.

At the time of writing the lightsaber which costs $159.99 at the parks has started appearing on Ebay at inflated prices.

Of the listings currently on the site prices range from $266 (from a seller who has three of them listed) up to $449.

The cheapest Buy it Now price is $289 which would be nearly double the retail price when local shipping is taken into account (and likely substantially more if shipped overseas thanks to import charges).

While it’s not uncommon for rare or limited items in Disney parks to appear on eBay a factor that may have added to the popularity of Cal’s lightsaber is that it’s the first time a replica of the blade has been produced.

In 2020 fans voted on which lightsaber they’d like to see added to the park’s selection and from the list which included the weapons of Anakin Skywalker Kanan Jarrus Qui-Gon Jinn Cal Kestis Ezra Bridger and Lord Corvax Cal’s lightsaber won but it took Disney over 500 days from the conclusion of the vote for the lightsaber to be added to the park.

Children as young as six are going online to make money whether it’s as an influencer on social media selling clothes on eBay gaming or playing the markets.

16-year-old Woody Harrison started by buying limited edition trainers to resell online on sites like eBay but also Depop.

Then like many of us bored during lockdown and looking for something new to do he discovered cryptocurrency through YouTube videos and TikTok tutorials where he learned what and how to trade.

He told us: ""I took some of the money I made selling clothes trainers across Depop and other re-selling platforms and then invested that into various coins. That was a £250 investment and over the last two years I’ve watched that grow.""

That is now worth more than £1000 which he wants to invest in his fledgling clothing business.

It's not just teenage entrepreneurs. Much younger children are also looking to make money online.

Naomi Castelo is an influencer. She is paid to feature and review products on her Instagram and YouTube channels from clothes to toys to restaurants and can earn more than £150 a post.

The only difference is she's 10 years old and often appears in videos with her mum Isa.

It started when Naomi saw other children with YouTube channels and wanted to try it too.

Now brands will approach them to collaborate and Isa said they decide together how to showcase the products.

Naomi's favourites are when they do catwalk shows together.

Isa turns down those she doesn't think are suitable. She says her daughter is in a safe environment and enjoys it and it allows her to save for the future.

""I think it’s good that she can earn this money for university. We put it in the savings account"".

Naomi said it is helping her realise her dreams already.

She said: ""My dream is to have my own brand and become a fashion designer for clothes. Yes. I think it's very nice to do"".

And she said her friends think it’s cool.

""They say wow I can't believe you have all these toys. I wish I had them"" she added.

Given that regulators are already struggling to keep up with tech platforms and there are concerns about the impact social media is having on young people's mental health there are bound to be questions about this new frontier and if there are sufficient safeguards to protect children from being exploited.

One “buy-it-now” listing on eBay added today puts the watch at £3206 – plus £12.85 postage! Another customer put their watch on eBay for “auction”. By 4.45 just three bidders had put the price up to just shy of £1370 (with just £12 postage on this occasion).

Carnaby Street chaos: Hundreds queue for £207 Omega X Swatch selling for £3000 on eBay.

At Carnaby Street there are reports of some attempted queue jumping outside the Swatch shop. Photos from PA show some customers even queued overnight to ensure they got their hands on one of the much sought-after watches. But at one stage today on Saturday shop assistants were forced to put a sign up in the shop window telling customers “store is closed” due to the chaos that had broken out. Similar scenes have been reported elsewhere across the world including in Paris and New York where the watch was also on sale. The stores are now closed.

This was worn not by Neil Armstrong the first man on the moon who is understood to have left his Speedmaster inside the lunar module the electric time of which had malfunctioned. It was instead first worn on the moon by Buzz Aldrin. He later said of his decision to wear the watch while walking on the moon: “It was optional to wear while we were walking on the surface of the moon... few things are less necessary when walking around on the moon than knowing what time it is in Houston Texas.

The Ecolab spinoff repairs commercial kitchens most of which were shut down at least temporarily as COVID-19 cases rose in the U.S. The company's revenue had dropped 60% by April.

Management took pay cuts of up to 25%. Nearly 20% of employees were laid off. Those who were left were cut to 32 hours a week. Since Audax a deep-pocket private-equity firm purchased Smart Care in 2018 the company did not qualify for government aid.

Yet the company made it through the debilitating first year of the pandemic with candid communication and an employee ownership program that went into effect Valentine's Day 2020.

""It wasn't transformational money'' said Smart Care Chair Bill Emory. ""But it was something for an $80000 technician with 10 years of service to get stock worth more than $9000. Success is best when shared.""

By fall 2020 Smart Care with kitchens reopening and business on the upswing offered a job to every laid off worker who wanted one. Up to 80% returned. Every hourly employee got a bonus.

""The bonus didn't make up for their sacrifice but it was something"" Emory said.

Smart Care and its people adapted to trying times.

And the stakeholders in Smart Care have done pretty well in the ensuing couple of years.

Earlier this month Audax sold Smart Care for an unspecified amount. Audax has indicated that its Smart Care investment proved an above-average performer and that its fund investors have made up to three times their money overall.

The stock issued to hourly employees in 2020 worth virtually nothing then grew to $2.5 million.

""I was laid off in 2020 and it hurt"" said George Simmons a 10-year master technician.

But he said Emory was candid and accessible. He also got his job back within six weeks.

""Then they told us the same day as we learned about the acquisition about the value of the stock"" Simmons said. ""It was like a big-time bonus. ... Every company should do this. It's the employees that keep companies running.""

The new owner is Wind Point Partners of Chicago which merged its Illinois-based Zone Mechanical a provider of refrigeration and HVAC services into what is now called Smart Care Care Climate Solutions.

Smart Care which spun off from Ecolab in 2017 grew to 1400 employees last year both organically and through acquisitions of smaller players. It is now the institutional kitchen industry's largest maintenance provider. From 2018 to 2021 revenue has more than doubled to $300 million.

The combined firms had combined 2021 revenue of around $400 million.

""We'll be in the range of $500 million in revenue this year"" said Emory CEO until the latest merger and now chair of the consolidated Smart Care operation.

In St. Paul Smart Care has grown from 40 to 120 employees since 2018 and is the flagship tenant of the refurbished downtown entrepreneurial center Osborn370.

Smart Care also exemplifies how a small outfit within a huge company such as Ecolab can prosper with fresh capital from a growth-oriented investor and a new identity.

Audax bought Smart Care with designs to expand it through consolidation in a highly fragmented industry estimated at $7.5 billion in sales. The private-equity firm invested nearly $20 million during its ownership to help Smart Care build the technology infrastructure and people it needed to expand successfully.

""After 14 acquisitions we have more or less a national footprint"" Emory said. ""And we entered adjacent services [through Zone Mechanical] in the grocery business including Walmart Albertsons Kroger and Whole Foods in certain markets.""

The Smart Care model also helped drive the record 2021 mergers and acquisition market in the United States.

Audax picked a good time to sell too.

Sale valuations rose in 2021 for well-performing companies. Overall in the U.S. the aggregate deal value was $2.8 trillion a 40% increase over the previous year according to research by investment banker Baird. That was a rebound from the first year of the pandemic.

""We are seeing corporate spinoffs being a big part of the playbook for private-equity clients as they look for platform opportunities"" or add-on acquisitions for growing portfolio companies said Sean Kearney a veteran M&A lawyer at Fredrikson & Byron who has represented Audax and others. ""They can focus on a particular market segment that may not have been fully exploited when it was a small piece of a much larger entity and possibly didn't get the attention and resources [merited] as a standalone platform.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

That’s according to journalist Jeff Grubb who claimed on his premium Giant Bomb show Grubbsnax that sources had confirmed to him that the long-running sports franchise will indeed be renamed.

“EA Sports Football Club EA Sports FC that’s the name of the game” he said before adding that the move comes after much-documented tension between the football governing body and EA.

“I saw trademarks for it I thought that could be just a feature like an online mode [but] I asked around about it [and] that’s it that’s the name” Grubb said referencing the previously discovered ‘EA FC’ trademarks that have previously surfaced.

He added: “They are ready to move on they have another name lined up.” Grubb speculated that we “should have seen a trailer by now” he went on to say. “We should hear about it here pretty soon”.

Previously FIFA games typically begin their marketing cycle around June.

EA’s current ten-year FIFA naming deal is understood to expire after November’s Qatar World Cup and VGC’s own sources have indicated that EA had been pushing ahead to call this year’s game FIFA 23 – potentially the last to use the brand.

According to documents seen by VGC EA has also been planning to include two FIFA World Cup tournaments in the next game – a first for the series – covering this year’s women’s and men’s events potentially adding credence to the possibility it will use the FIFA name one last time.

It was first revealed in October last year that EA was “exploring the idea” of renaming the blockbuster games franchise due to a naming rights agreement with world football’s governing body FIFA.

According to a New York Times report published the same month negotiations between the pair stalled due to EA’s desire for more rights and FIFA’s alleged demand for EA to double its payment for the licence to $2.5 billion over the next decade.

More recently in comments provided anonymously to VGC EA CEO Andrew Wilson seem to imply in an internal meeting that the company was indeed ready to move on from the FIFA license and could even thrive without it.

In his most revealing comments yet on the status of licence negotiations with the footballing body Wilson told staff that the FIFA license had been “an impediment” to EA’s ambitions for the game series.

Wilson claimed that the football governing body was holding EA back from providing players with long-desired modes going as far as calling FIFA ‘just the name on the box’.

“Our players want us to expand into the digital ecosystem more broadly… our fans are telling us they want us to go and participate in that space” he said.

“Our FIFA licence has actually precluded us from doing a lot of this stuff. Again FIFA is just the name on the box but they’ve precluded our ability to be able to branch into the areas that players want.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmZvYmFlLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIyLzAzLzI2L2ZpZmEtMjItd2FzLXRoZS1sYXN0LW9uZS1lYS1zcG9ydHMtYnJva2UtdXAtd2l0aC10aGUtZm9vdGJhbGwtY29tcGFueS1idXQtaXQtaGFzLWFuLWFjZS11cC1pdHMtc2xlZXZlLTIv0gGiAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9iYWUuY29tL2VuLzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvZmlmYS0yMi13YXMtdGhlLWxhc3Qtb25lLWVhLXNwb3J0cy1icm9rZS11cC13aXRoLXRoZS1mb290YmFsbC1jb21wYW55LWJ1dC1pdC1oYXMtYW4tYWNlLXVwLWl0cy1zbGVldmUtMi8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXAtdHlwZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIFA 22 was the last one: EA Sports broke up with the football company but it has an ace up its sleeve,"The FIFA of EA Sports is over as the football video game saga between these two companies is over and there seems to be no turning back. However fans will not be left empty-handed as EA Sports will develop its own football game.

In this way FIFA 22 would become the last one as it has been known for several years. As noted the new video game in the gaming franchise would be EA Sports Football Club or simply EA Sports FC.

For a few months now EA and FIFA were expected to renew the license agreement to continue the football saga but it never came. Although it has not been confirmed by the parties there is every indication that the agreement will never be concluded.

Of course since there is no official agreement between the two EA Sports can no longer use the name FIFA even so that is no impediment to further development. The journalist Jeff Grub was that he said that the most likely thing is that the next installment will be called EA Sports Football Club.

According to the communicator the trailer for that new installment would be released in March where the new name of the football video game franchise will also be officially announced.

However EA seems to have postponed the presentation of EA Sports Football Club. Supposedly because of the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its effects worldwide.

It has also transpired that part of the break between the two companies was because FIFA was asking EA Sports for one billion US dollars (every four years) for the brand's license. Clearly the developer refused as it would be twice what was initially agreed.

Despite this regular players have nothing to worry about as EA has signed contracts with every league and footballer or club so losing the license will practically only affect the name of the video game since the content will be just what everyone is waiting for it to be.

For example last October they confirmed the renewal of the contract with FIFPro which encompasses 40 leagues and thousands of players from around the world which means that the biggest loss for the study would be the name it has maintained since its origins.

This is the most successful sports franchise in the gaming world and as was demonstrated on other occasions with all sorts of titles changing its name would not present too much of a problem for either the company or the players.

On the other hand it seems that FIFA will not sit idly by as it will manage to develop its own video game and not have losses. The options at least for now are limited with an eFootball that made fans laugh and cry alike and the enigmatic UFL which was announced at Gamescom last August.

For some this is nothing new because since last year when FIFA 22 was launched the possibility of changing the classic FIFA name with the next installment was anticipated. The last contract had come to an end with the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

For some time now Electronic Arts mentioned the possibility of transforming the video game into a platform thinking about the future of the franchise with regular updates and thematic content like the one already seen in modes like FUT. More than one classic video game saga adapted to this latest generation with different monetization models based on Season Passes more elaborate cosmetics and different offers designed for different types of consumers.

You are not alone,"Here’s the crux of the article in video form:

New updates are being added at the bottom of this story…….

Original story (published on March 19 2022) follows:

Released in 2014 The Sims 4 is a social simulation game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. As the number indicates it happens to be the fourth installment in the decades-old series.

Ever since its release developers have added a lot of content to the game. It also improves in key areas such as character creation and a new personality system.

But as is the case with every EA title players are no strangers when it comes to bugs and glitches. A few weeks ago after the release of the My Wedding Stories expansion pack many complained that weddings were not working or broken.

Having said that The Sims 4 players are now reporting (12345) that they are unable to save the game and are getting Error code 0. It looks like the problem surfaced after a recent update.

Many say they have lost hours of progression because of the issue. Players are frustrated and wondering how EA manages to break basic functionality like the ability to save games.

You can see in the image below what The Sims 4 Error code 0 looks like.

game won’t save :/ any suggestions? i’m playing on my macbook air which was constantly freezing and crashing during CAS until i turned graphics down and vertical sync on and it started working fine! i hadn’t played in forever so i was playing for like 6 hours straight and when i tried to save it said i couldn’t (error message 0).i’m playing through origin so even though i went to my finder to move some files around (following googles advice idk) there was nothing there. any tips?

Game not saving Error Code 0 on one save only (SIMS4)

I created a new save a few days ago and it stopped saving yesterday. I’ve been able to save it by using save as but I’m tired of having to do that all the time and don’t want a million copies of the same save piling up. It only happens with that particular save (no matter how many times i save as) the others are all fine. I’ve restarted Origin the Sims and my computer (I’m on a macbook pro) but nothing works. I’ve also tried repairing the game

(Source)

Fortunately EA has commented on the matter and said that the issue is currently under investigation.

@OreoPrince050113 Unfortunately the team is having trouble figuring out how the saves got to that corrupted state. Investigation is ongoing. Were you playing with any wedding cakes before the issue occurred? If so which lot(s) did you have the wedding cake(s) on?

(Source)

We hope the developers soon find out the root cause of the problem and fix it as soon as possible since it is making the game unplayable for those affected. If and when they do we will be updating this space to reflect the same so make sure you stay tuned.

Update 1 (March 21)

01:10 pm (IST): One of the affected players suggested a workaround that may resolve this issue. If you are still facing this problem then you can give it a try.

Workaround:

To save the game just SAVE let it error then delete the original file and save again. For me it works every time. (Source)

Update 2 (March 22)

11:30 am (IST): One player claims that they may have found a potential reason for the ‘Error 0’ issue in the game. Here’s what they have to say:

Hey team! I mighy have found a clue for Error 0 ive been playing trying to figure out where it comes from and ive noticed its everytime or almost everytime i put something from my library or gallery inbmy world! Hey hope it helps you guys have a great day for all if you in the sims team. (Source)

Update 3 (March 23)

12:20 pm (IST): As a reader pointed out in the comments below for those who are unaware of how to get to their saved files simply follow these steps (default path):

Head to the Documents folder on your computer > Open up ‘Electronic Arts’ > ‘Sims 4’ > ‘Saves’. Then look for the most recently modified file which should be the ‘Scratch’ folder and delete it.

Thanks for the heads up Christian Keller!

Update 4 (March 24)

04:32 pm (IST): EA support on Twitter has acknowledged this issue and said that they are working on a fix that should arrive soon.

Update 5 (March 25)

11:01 am (IST): A team member on the EA community said that they are still looking for unmodded saves from the affected players in order to investigate this issue.

We are still looking for affected unmodded saves if you’re willing to share them. (Whether wedding cakes were used or not.) (Source)

Update 6 (March 26)

12:31 pm (IST): Here’s a workaround for this issue suggested by one of the affected users. If you are still having this problem then you can try and see if it helps.

The game’s developers say that they have been unable to reach an agreement with the late footballer’s estate and as a result Maradona will no longer appear in both the console and mobile versions of the game. This marks the first time in FIFA’s history that a major player has been absent from the game due to licensing issues. But the dispute has been going on for a long time.

The legal battle continues over Maradona’s image rights

Argentinian media reported last year that a court ruled EA negotiated Maradona’s likeness rights with Stefano Ceci Maradona’s former manager despite not owning them. Sattvica has filed lawsuits in several courts around the world seeking to enforce the rights to Maradona’s trademark and likeness since Maradona’s death.

In reality it’s only part of an ongoing legal battle involving Maradona’s children and the company Sattvica a company owned by his former lawyer Matias Morla.

EA’s response to the legal issue

On starting the game EA shared the following message to its players over the removal of the late Diego Maradona from FIFA 22 and FIFA Mobile 22. The message says

Due to a third party legal dispute we must suspend Diego Maradona from appearing in FIFA Ultimate Team Packs Ultimate Draft and the Soccer Aid World Xl team. As such Diego Maradona ICON Items will no longer be made available in Packs. SBCs and FUT Draft and their price range has been fixed until further notice. “Due to a third party legal dispute we must suspend Diego Maradona from appearing in FIFA Ultimate Team Packs Ultimate Draft and the Soccer Aid World Xl team. As such Diego Maradona ICON Items will no longer be made available in Packs. SBCs and FUT Draft and their price range has been fixed until further notice. We share our fans’ disappointment and hope to bring one of football’s greatest icons back in the game at some point in the future. FIFA 22 ELECTRONIC ArTs

Maradona’s likeness and image have always been licensed through EA’s games first with Maradona personally and later with companies licensed to use Maradona’s image worldwide. Their fans are disappointed and they hope to bring one of the greats back to football at some point.

It is still unclear whether Maradona will appear in future editions of the game. His absence will be keenly felt by fans of the game who have long celebrated Maradona as one of the game’s greatest ever players.

INDIANAPOLIS  March 26 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- More than 50 percent of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) experienced at least 75 percent reduction in disease severity ( EASI -75*) at 16 weeks when receiving lebrikizumab monotherapy in the ADvocate program Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced today at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting. Lebrikizumab an investigational IL-13 inhibitor also led to clinically meaningful improvements in itch and other important patient-reported outcomes compared to placebo.

""Patients with atopic dermatitis experience persistent itch dry skin severe pain and inflammation which can be unpredictable and affect their work social relationships mental and emotional health"" said Emma Guttman-Yassky  M.D. Ph.D. Waldman professor and system chair of Dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York  and senior author of the ADvocate analyses. ""Lebrikizumab is a novel treatment targeting the IL-13 pathway which is the main cytokine driver of inflammation that is involved in AD. I'm encouraged by today's data showing rapid improvements in skin itch and quality-of-life measures.""

Lebrikizumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the interleukin 13 (IL-13) protein with high affinity to specifically prevent the formation of IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα (Type 2 receptor) which blocks downstream signaling through the IL-13 pathway. 1-5 IL-13 plays the central role in Type 2 inflammation.6 In AD IL-13 underlies the signs and symptoms including skin barrier dysfunction itch infection and hard thickened areas of skin.7

In ADvocate 1 43 percent of patients receiving lebrikizumab achieved clear or almost clear skin (IGA) at 16 weeks compared to 13 percent of patients taking placebo. Among those receiving lebrikizumab 59 percent achieved an EASI -75 response compared to 16 percent with placebo.

In ADvocate 2 33 percent of patients taking lebrikizumab achieved clear or almost clear skin (IGA) at 16 weeks compared to 11 percent of patients on placebo. Among those receiving lebrikizumab 51 percent achieved an EASI -75 response compared to 18 percent taking placebo.

Within four weeks patients receiving lebrikizumab experienced statistically significant improvements in skin clearance and itching as well as improvements in interference of itch on sleep and quality of life as measured by key secondary endpoints.

The safety profile of the 16-week period was consistent with prior lebrikizumab studies in AD. Patients taking lebrikizumab compared to placebo reported a lower frequency of adverse events in ADvocate 1 (lebrikizumab: 45% placebo: 52%) and ADvocate 2 (lebrikizumab: 53% placebo: 66%). Most adverse events across the two studies were mild or moderate in severity and nonserious and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. The most common adverse events in ADvocate 1 and 2 for those on lebrikizumab were conjunctivitis (7% and 8% respectively) common cold (nasopharyngitis) (4% and 5% respectively) and headache (3% and 5% respectively).

""People's experiences and struggles with autoimmune diseases such as atopic dermatitis drive us at Lilly to pursue novel science and meaningful treatments that make life better especially in areas where there is urgent unmet need"" said Lotus Mallbris M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global immunology development and medical affairs at Lilly . ""These data reinforce the positive results in our broader Phase 3 development program and we believe lebrikizumab represents a new generation of biologics for AD.""

Detailed 52-week results from ADvocate 1 and 2 as well as 16-week data from ADhere the Phase 3 AD study of lebrikizumab with topical steroids will be disclosed in coming months. Lilly and Almirall S.A. plan to submit filings to regulatory authorities around the world by the end of 2022 following completion of the ADvocate studies.

""Patients need new treatment options that provide high efficacy and tolerability. These positive data demonstrate that lebrikizumab has the potential to be a leading treatment in AD"" said Karl Ziegelbauer  Ph.D. Almirall's Chief Scientific Officer.

Lilly has exclusive rights for development and commercialization of lebrikizumab in the United States and the rest of the world outside Europe . Almirall has licensed the rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for the treatment of dermatology indications including AD in Europe .

About ADvocate 1 and ADvocate 2 and the Phase 3 Program

ADvocate 1 and ADvocate 2 are ongoing 52-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group global Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate lebrikizumab as monotherapy in adult and adolescent patients (aged 12 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg) with moderate-to-severe AD. During the 16-week treatment period patients received lebrikizumab 500-mg initially and at two weeks followed by lebrikizumab 250-mg or placebo every two weeks. The primary endpoints were measured by an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) skin with a reduction of at least two points from baseline and at least 75 percent change in baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI -75) score at 16 weeks. EASI measures extent and severity of the disease. Key secondary endpoints were measured by IGA EASI  the Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale Sleep-Loss due to Pruritus and the Dermatology Life Quality Index.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted lebrikizumab Fast Track designation in AD in December 2019 . The lebrikizumab Phase 3 program consists of five key global studies including two monotherapy studies a combination study (ADhere) as well as long-term extension (ADjoin) and adolescent open label (ADore) studies.

About Atopic Dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis (AD) or atopic eczema is a chronic relapsing skin disease characterized by intense itching dry skin and inflammation that can be present on any part of the body.8 AD is a heterogeneous disease both biologically and clinically and may be characterized by a highly variable appearance in which flares occur in an unpredictable manner.9

Moderate-to-severe AD is characterized by intense itching which leads to an itch-scratch cycle that further damages the skin.10 Like other chronic inflammatory diseases AD is immune-mediated and involves a complex interplay of immune cells and inflammatory cytokines.8 People living with AD often report symptoms of intense persistent itch which can be so uncomfortable that it can affect sleep daily activities and social relationships.

About Lebrikizumab

Lebrikizumab is a novel investigational monoclonal antibody designed to bind IL-13 with high affinity to specifically prevent the formation of the IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα heterodimer complex and subsequent signaling thereby inhibiting the biological effects of IL-13 in a targeted and efficient fashion. IL-13 is the central pathogenic mediator of AD promoting type 2 inflammation that drives skin barrier dysfunction itch skin thickening and infection.67

INDIANAPOLIS  March 26 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Adults with severe alopecia areata (AA) who took OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) achieved significant scalp eyelash and eyebrow hair regrowth and nearly 75% of those who responded to OLUMIANT 4-mg achieved 90% scalp coverage at 52 weeks Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) announced today at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting. In February 2022  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted priority review for OLUMIANT in severe AA as a potential first-in-disease medicine. Lilly expects regulatory decisions in the U.S.  European Union and Japan in 2022.

In the pooled 52-week analysis patients at baseline had a mean Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score of 85.5 (85.5% scalp hair loss or 14.5% scalp hair coverage); severe AA is defined as having a SALT score ≥50 (≥50% scalp hair loss). At baseline 69.4% and 57.9% had significant eyebrow and eyelash hair loss respectively as defined by Clinician-Reported Outcome (ClinRO) scores ≥2. Patients' average age was 37.6 years with hair loss starting around age 25 and a mean of 12.2 years since symptom onset.

Among patients who took OLUMIANT 4-mg two out of five (39.0% n=201/515) achieved significant scalp hair regrowth defined as a SALT score ≤20 or 80% or more scalp hair coverage and nearly three out of four of those patients (74.1% n=149/201) also achieved a SALT score ≤10 or 90% hair coverage at 52 weeks. Separately more than two out of five patients with ClinRO baseline scores ≥2 (eyebrow: 44.1% n=154/349; eyelash: 45.3% n=139/307) saw full regrowth or regrowth with minimal gaps in eyebrow and eyelash hair.

Among patients who took OLUMIANT 2-mg more than one out of five (22.6% n=77/340) achieved significant scalp hair regrowth and two out of three of those patients (67.5% n=52/77) achieved 90% or more hair coverage at 52 weeks. Separately more than one in five and one in four patients respectively (eyebrow: 22.9% n=55/240; eyelash: 25.5% n=51/200) saw full regrowth or regrowth with minimal gaps in eyebrow and eyelash hair.

These 52-week pooled analyses demonstrate continued improvement in scalp eyebrows and eyelash hair regrowth from 36-week results published today in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the 2021 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress .

""Whether people with alopecia areata suffer loss of all the hair on their body or bald spots and missing eyebrows or eyelashes this autoimmune disease can be devastating. The disease affects people of all ages"" said Brett King  M.D. Ph.D. F.A.A.D. associate professor of dermatology at Yale School of Medicine and lead author of these analyses. ""In 2022 OLUMIANT could become the first medicine ever approved to treat adults with alopecia areata. It's remarkable that nearly 40% of patients on OLUMIANT 4-mg all of whom started out with at least 50% scalp hair loss experienced full or nearly full scalp hair coverage and similar improvements were achieved among those patients with significant eyebrows or eyelashes involvement.""

In an evaluation of OLUMIANT 4-mg and 2-mg long-term safety incidence rates of frequently reported adverse events up to 52 weeks (median 56 weeks exposure) were consistent with the 36-week placebo-controlled period and included upper respiratory tract infection headache acne urinary tract infection and increases in muscle-related blood markers. There were no new safety signals.

""OLUMIANT's long-term efficacy data reveal significant regrowth of scalp eyelash and eyebrow hair and we're delighted by what these results can mean for patients. Our alopecia areata safety data adds further evidence to one of the largest and longest sets of safety data in the JAK inhibitor class including nine years and 19000 patient years across our program"" said Lotus Mallbris M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global immunology development and medical affairs at Lilly . ""We're excited OLUMIANT may be a potential first-in-disease medicine approved this year for adults with severe alopecia areata.""

About BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2

In these double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials 1200 patients with severe AA were randomized to receive once-daily OLUMIANT 4-mg OLUMIANT 2-mg or placebo. Patients randomized to OLUMIANT received the same treatment for 52 weeks while placebo non-responders were rescued to OLUMIANT at 36 weeks. The primary endpoint was SALT score ≤20 (≤20% scalp hair loss). Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients who achieved a SALT score ≤10 (≤10% scalp hair loss) Clinician-Reported Outcome (ClinRO) Measure for Eyebrow Hair Loss™ and ClinRO Measure for Eyelash Hair Loss™ scores of patients achieving eyebrow and eyelash hair loss scores of 0 or 1 (full coverage or minimal gaps) with a ≥2-point improvement from baseline among patients with baselines scores ≥2. In the BRAVE studies 51.7% of patients were white (n=620/1200) 36.3% were Asian (n=435/1200) 8.2% were Black (n=98/1200).

In December 2009  Lilly and Incyte announced an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of OLUMIANT and certain follow-on compounds for patients with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States ) for RA patients

OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2 mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets

WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS MALIGNANCY MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS AND THROMBOSIS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB) which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. If positive start treatment for latent infection prior to Olumiant use.

Invasive fungal infections including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated rather than localized disease.

Bacterial viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.

Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections tuberculosis multidermatomal herpes zoster esophageal candidiasis pneumocystosis acute histoplasmosis cryptococcosis cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.

Avoid use of Olumiant in patients with an active serious infection including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to TB; with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.

Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection.

Viral reactivation including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g. herpes zoster) were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves. The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.

MORTALITY

In a large randomized postmarketing safety study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor comparing another Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers a higher rate of all-cause mortality including sudden cardiovascular death was observed with the JAK inhibitor.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with Olumiant.

MALIGNANCIES

Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant. In RA patients treated with another JAK inhibitor a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. A higher rate of lymphomas was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lung cancers and an additional increased risk of overall malignancies were observed in current or past smokers treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with Olumiant particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than successfully treated NMSC) patients who develop a malignancy and patients who are current or past smokers.

NMSCs have been reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (defined as cardiovascular death myocardial infarction [MI] and stroke) was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Discontinue Olumiant in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with Olumiant particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur.

THROMBOSIS

Thrombosis including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor a higher rate of thrombosis was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Avoid Olumiant in patients at risk. Discontinue Olumiant and promptly evaluate patients with symptoms of thrombosis.

GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS

Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g. patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES

Neutropenia – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Liver Enzyme Elevations – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of ALT ≥5x upper limit of normal (ULN) and increases of AST ≥10x ULN were observed in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.

Lipid Elevations – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters including total cholesterol low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

VACCINATIONS

Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.

HYPERSENSITIVITY

Reactions such as angioedema urticaria and rash that may reflect drug sensitivity have been observed in patients receiving Olumiant including serious reactions. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs promptly discontinue Olumiant while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Most common adverse reactions include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3% 11.7%) nausea (2.7% 1.6%) herpes simplex (0.8% 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0% 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg and placebo respectively.

PREGNANCY AND LACTATION

Limited data on Olumiant use in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.

HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT

Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal impairment.

Now the Indianapolis-based pharma is making another plug for Olumiant’s hair loss potential with four more months of data showing its med aced hair regrowth metrics in nearly half of patients treated with a higher dose.

Among adults with severe AA on Lilly’s Olumiant nearly 75% of patients who responded to a 4-mg dose achieved 90% scalp hair coverage at the 52-week mark Lilly said Saturday. Armed with a win in the underserved autoimmune disease the company expects regulatory decisions on Olumiant before the year is out in the U.S. Europe and Japan Lilly and its partner Incyte said at the American Academy of Dermatology’s 2022 annual meeting.

Taking a closer look at the results from Lilly’s two phase 3 trials BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 39% of patients on Olumiant 4-mg experienced “significant” scalp hair regrowth as measured by the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Lilly said. The company defined significant regrowth as a SALT score of up to 20 which translates to 80% or more scalp hair coverage Lilly explained. Among that same set of patients roughly 74% achieved 90% scalp coverage at the end of one year.

Just 22.6% of alopecia patients on the 2-mg dose of Olumiant saw “significant” scalp hair regrowth. About two thirds of those patients hit 90% hair coverage.

The separate doses performed similarly when it came to eyebrow and eyelash hair regrowth. More than two out of five patients on Olumiant 4 mg who entered the study with “significant” eyebrow and eyelash hair loss “saw full regrowth or regrowth with minimal gaps in eyebrow and eyelash hair” Lilly said.

For those on the 2-mg dose more than 1 in 5 and 1 in 4 patients respectively enjoyed full eyebrow and eyelash regrowth or regrowth with minimal gaps the company added.

The new 52-week readout builds on 36-week data Lilly rolled out between last March and April. Following last year’s top-line win Lilly said it planned to submit Olumiant for FDA approval in AA in the second half of the year. Lilly has since sent off its application to the FDA the company said (PDF) in its 2021 annual report.

Those results are nothing short of “remarkable” Lotus Mallbris M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global immunology development and medical affairs at Eli Lilly said in a recent interview. Armed with a full year’s worth of data from BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 Lilly expects to win approval if not launch in the U.S. Europe and Japan in 2022 Mallbris said.

If cleared in AA Olumiant would bear the distinction of being the first therapy specifically approved to treat the autoimmune disease. Currently patients’ disease is often treated with cosmetic solutions such as wigs or false eyebrows and eyelashes Mallbris explained. Others rely on off-label therapies such as uncomfortable corticosteroid injections in the scalp.

Meanwhile Olumiant would not only be the first bespoke treatment option for AA–it would also be more convenient than injectable treatments thanks to its simple oral dosing she added.

If Olumiant breaks into AA Lilly will have its work cut out convincing doctors and patients that alopecia is a disease that warrants pharmaceutical treatment. Given the current dearth of therapeutic options many AA patients have been “lost in clinical care” Mallbris explained. The current pathway for patients living with AA can be “very challenging” to hear Mallbris tell it with many avoiding treatment altogether because of a sense of “hopelessness.”

Because so many AA patients have fallen through the cracks Lilly’s estimates on the total disease population are “rough” Mallbris admitted. Lilly says approximately 147 million people worldwide have or will have AA with between 700000 to 900000 suffering from severe disease.

Meanwhile safety in Lilly’s two phase 3 studies was on par with Olumiant’s known profile Mallbris said. Baricitinib is a member of the JAK inhibitor class which has come under intense safety scrutiny in recent months following a post-marketing study of Pfizer’s Xeljanz. Nevertheless Lilly believes it has the data to show its med is not only effective but safe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWxlLmVkdS8yMDIyLzAzLzI2L25ldy10cmlhbHMtYWxvcGVjaWEtYXJlYXRhLXRyZWF0bWVudC1hcmUtc3VjY2Vzc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New trials for alopecia areata treatment are a success,"A new study shows that one in three patients with a severe skin disease were able to regrow hair after being treated with a common arthritis drug.

The study is based on Phase 3 clinical trials using baricitinib a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor to treat alopecia areata an often disfiguring skin disease characterized by rapid loss of scalp hair and sometimes eyebrows and eyelashes.

Phase 3 clinical trials are the final testing hurdle before a new treatment can be considered for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.

“This is so exciting because the data clearly show how effective baricitinib is” said Dr. Brett King an associate professor of dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine and lead author of the new study published March 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine. “These large controlled trials tell us that we can alleviate some of the suffering from this awful disease.”

Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks hair follicles. More than 200000 new cases emerge each year in the United States. Although alopecia areata can develop in patients of any age it typically occurs in people under the age of 40.

There is currently no FDA-approved treatment for the disease.

For the new study King and his colleagues conducted two large randomized trials involving a total of 1200 people. The participants were adults with severe alopecia areata who had lost at least half of their scalp hair; many had lost all of their scalp hair.

For 36 weeks participants were given a daily dose of either 4 milligrams of baricitinib 2 milligrams of baricitinib or a placebo. One-third of the patients who received the larger dose grew hair back.

The researchers said baricitinib thwarts the disease by disrupting the communication of immune cells involved in harming hair follicles. Baricitinib and other JAK inhibitors are routinely used to treat autoimmune forms of joint disease.

“Alopecia areata is a crazy journey marked by chaos confusion and profound sadness for many who suffer from it” King said. “It will be incredible to have a medicine to help people emerge on the other side normalcy restored recognizable again to themselves and those around them.”

Co-authors of the study included researchers from the Kyorin University Faculty of Medicine Seoul National University College of Medicine Hebrew University of Jerusalem Stanford University the University of California-Irvine the University of Minnesota Eli Lilly and Company and Sinclair Dermatology.

Eli Lilly and Company funded the research.

The results of the study were made public during the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology. For the past decade King has developed methods for using JAK inhibitors to treat a variety of skin diseases — including eczema vitiligo granuloma annulare sarcoidosis and erosive lichen planus.

King noted that the clinical trials involving baricitinib are ongoing which will enable researchers to assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of the treatment.

Took Stage,"For an awards ceremony trying to be as diverse and socially conscious as possible you’d think somebody would have taken a closer look at music choices being played to introduce presenters at the 2022 Oscars.

The 94th Annual Academy Awards production team played Toto’s “Africa” as British actor Daniel Kaluuya and singer H.E.R. both of whom won Oscars the previous year took the stage early Sunday night to present best supporting actress.

More from The Hollywood Reporter

Some are pointing out that the 1982 song was a rather poor choice to introduce two Black presenters:

Next the show played Madonna’s 1987 Latin-inspired “La Isla Bonita” to introduce Latina actress Stephanie Beatriz (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) who was introducing the best song nominee from Encanto.

That pick some viewers pointed out really wasn’t the best look either.

so far they've introduced Daniel Kaluuya and H.E.R. with Toto's ""Africa"" and Stephanie Beatriz with ""La Isla Bonita"" honestly how the hell is this happening — rob sheffield (@robsheff) March 28 2022

And now La Isla Bonita for Stephanie Beatriz? #Oscars pic.twitter.com/gcatTwh0Q9 — Hilary Banks (@soniamariesays) March 28 2022

After Africa and La Isla Bonita the Oscars are going to play Wang Chung when Youn Yuh-jung walks out aren’t they. — Soo Youn (@lalasoo) March 28 2022

It’s worth pointing out however that the ceremony was produced by Will Packer (Girls Trip) who is leading an all-Black producing team for the first time in the show’s history.

Residents Are Paying a Price. (Published 2022),"GOLDEN Colo. — When Sarah Clement moved to the Golden Hills mobile home park two years ago she felt like she had won the lottery. After years of squeezing into one-bedroom apartments with her her 7-year-old son finally settled into his own bedroom his toys splayed out in the yard and his school just at the edge of the park.

Ms. Clement loved the friendliness of her neighbors and getting to watch the sun rise over the scrubby mesa to her east and set behind the foothills of the Rocky Mountains to the west. And living there was affordable on her salary as an athletic trainer: After purchasing the manufactured home the rent for the plot it sits on was just $625 a month.

But just six months after she moved in the plot of land and all of the stability and comfort that came with it seemed suddenly ripped out from under her.

The Colorado couple that owned the park for years had put it up for sale. Ms. Clement and her neighbors knew that if the park was taken over by one of the big manufactured-housing operators who were buying up parks all over the state the rents would dramatically increase.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vYWR2aXNvci9tb3J0Z2FnZXMvYnV5aW5nLWEtaG91c2UtaW4tYS1mbG9vZC16b25lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What You Should Know When Buying A House In A Flood Zone,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/buying-a-house-in-a-flood-zone/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vYWR2aXNvci9tb3J0Z2FnZXMvYnV5aW5nLWEtaG91c2UtaW4tYS1mbG9vZC16b25lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zb2NpZXR5LzIwMjIvbWFyLzI2L3JldmVhbGVkLXRvcC0xMC1jaGlsZHJlbnMtY2FyZS1wcm92aWRlcnMtbWFkZS0zMDBtLXByb2ZpdHPSAWpodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vc29jaWV0eS8yMDIyL21hci8yNi9yZXZlYWxlZC10b3AtMTAtY2hpbGRyZW5zLWNhcmUtcHJvdmlkZXJzLW1hZGUtMzAwbS1wcm9maXRz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Revealed: top 10 children’s care providers made £300m profits,"The 10 largest providers of children’s social care placements made more than £300m in profits last year according to research that will fuel concerns over profiteering by private providers.

As pressure mounts within government regulators councils and fosterers over the provision of care for the country’s most vulnerable children analysis seen by the Observer reveals the growing role of private equity companies in many of the biggest suppliers of care home and fostering places.

Profits among the top 20 providers of care home and fostering places now amount to 20% of their income. Despite the pandemic last year their overall profits rose by more than 14% from 2020 according to the study commissioned by the Local Government Association (LGA).

The findings follow a series of warnings that marketisation of children’s social care is leading to some damaging outcomes. Several figures within the sector have reported children being placed far from their support networks where homes could be built more cheaply or placed with families who lack the skills to provide the right care.

It comes months after a highly critical Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) warned that the UK had “sleepwalked” into a dysfunctional market for children’s social care with councils struggling to pay for expensive places that often failed to meet the needs of the child.

An official review of children’s social care in England has been commissioned by the government and will report later this spring.

There are hopes that the review will back reforms in England as a result of a growing consensus around the issues within the current system. Councils have reported that spending on residential placements has increased by 84% since 2015 and that they are now diverting funds from areas such as early help for families to meet the spiralling costs.

The LGA’s analysis compiled by Revolution Consulting found that eight of the 10 largest providers of children’s social care which includes fostering children’s homes and other services such as residential school places now have some kind of private equity involvement. Total income of the largest 20 was more than £1.6bn with 60% made by the largest four providers – Outcomes First CareTech Polaris and Priory now called Aspris.

It also confirms many of the concerns over the level of debt taken on by some of the groups which many council figures believe is making child social care provision even more precarious. Nine of the top 20 providers had more debts and liabilities than tangible assets.

“What matters most for children who can’t live at home is that they feel they are safe loved and supported in homes that best suit their need” said Lucy Nethsingha deputy chair of the LGA’s children and young people board.

“While many providers work hard to make sure this is the case it is wrong that some providers are making excessive profit from providing these homes when money should be spent on children.

“Despite increasing their children’s social care budgets most councils are overspending each year as costs continue to soar. Yet the largest privately-run companies which provide many residential and fostering homes for children continue to bring in huge profits. At the same time many carry significant levels of debt.

“Stability for children in care is paramount if we are to help them to thrive. It is therefore vital that there is oversight of the financial health of these providers to help catch providers before they fall and ensure company changes don’t risk the quality of provision.”

Outcomes First CareTech Polaris and Aspris were all asked for comment but either declined to do so or did not respond.

Some recent cases have brought home some of the long-running issues in children’s care. In January Ofsted inspectors suspended the licence of one children’s home in Bolton after finding that a boy had not bathed changed his clothes or been provided with a home-cooked meal for four months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbW9uZXkvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS9pLXBsYW4tdG8tYnV5LWhvdXNlLWJ5LXNlbGxpbmctc2hhcmVzLWNhbi1zb21lLWluY29tZS10YXgtZXhlbXB0aW9uLWJlLWNsYWltZWQtMTE2NDgyNjYxNTk0OTcuaHRtbNIBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbW9uZXkvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS9pLXBsYW4tdG8tYnV5LWhvdXNlLWJ5LXNlbGxpbmctc2hhcmVzLWNhbi1zb21lLWluY29tZS10YXgtZXhlbXB0aW9uLWJlLWNsYWltZWQvYW1wLTExNjQ4MjY2MTU5NDk3Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I plan to buy house by selling shares. Can some income tax exemption be claimed? | Mint,"I have two residential properties in my name bought more than 8 years back. I am planning to purchase another residential property in the next few months. I plan to fund this purchase by the long term gains from the sale of shares in this financial year. Will the gains of share sale in this financial year be taxable or can an exemption be claimed against purchase of a residential property in next financial year in respect of capital gains on sale of the shares?

Answer: In respect of capital gains arising on sale any asset other than a residential house an individual or an HUF can claim exemption from long term capital gains if the net sale consideration in respect of such asset is invested for acquiring a residential house within a period of two years after sale of such asset. Even if a residential house is purchased within one year prior to sale of such assets the exemption is still available. In case you wish to self-construct a house or book an under construction house you get an extended period of three years to complete construction of the house or get possession in case it is booked with a developer.

In case the sale consideration is not fully utilised for acquiring the residential house by the due date of filing of the Income Tax Return the unutilised money has to be deposited with a bank under Capital Gains Account Scheme. The money so deposited can be utilised within the prescribed period for payment of house.

One of the condition for being eligible for claim this exemption under Section 54F is that you should not own more than one residential house property on the date of sale of the asset except the one in respect of which you are claiming the exemption. Since you already own two houses now you are not eligible to claim this exemption available under Section 54F.

Whether it’s about her own fairytale rise to fame — from a South East London council house to a vast global business — or about the magical inspirations behind her perfumes Malone is brimming with anecdotes.

During an interview with Gulf News at a beauty event at City Centre Mirdif on March 17 the warm and friendly Malone didn’t hold back from sharing those stories with us.

She lit up from within as she talked about everything from perfume notes and her love for Dubai to being proud of the brands that she built — Jo Malone London which she founded in 1990 and sold to Estee Lauder in 1999; and Jo Loves which she created in 2011.

“The way I look at it is — because I’m a very visual human being — is I’m the mother of both” she said. “But one has gone off to university and has grown up and doesn’t need me anymore and one is still at home.”

While some might not know that Jo Malone London isn’t her baby anymore it’s not an association she views with any negativity.

“I sold it and it belongs to somebody else... But I’m proud that I’ve done that” Malone said. “I still walk past the shop and have that little word in my head thinking ‘you’ve taught me so much’. And I don’t regret that. Not for a second.”

Her love for Dubai

Malone 58 has been all over the world thanks to her global brand and during her interview she revealed that she’s a bit of a Dubai veteran.

“I’ve been here 14 years in a row and I love it. And I’m actually considering would it be good to come live here for a bit? I’ve been here a week and I feel like I’m my best self” she excitedly said. “Businesses is so [fast] moving here... you know you can feel an energy. And I can be so creative — I don’t know why and I don’t question it either... I feel very entrepreneurial here.”

Small beginnings

Malone was an open book as she talked about having dyslexia and overcoming hardships from a very young age.

“I was a young girl with a whole heap of dreams. I’d come from a family with very little money. So from the age of 11 I had to put food on the table” she said. “I had a tough upbringing but a happy upbringing to say the least But it made me. At the age of 18 I was already starting a first entrepreneurial business. I left school at 15 no qualifications no uni nothing. Just this gut feeling of business and I’ve still got it today.”

The start of her brand

Malone said she never intended to start out in the perfume business as she had been working as an aesthetician prior to that.

“I ran a small skincare clinic and I would make little tiny body lotions and bath oils and give them away to all the people that came for their faces. And one day one lady bought 100 bottles” she said.

“I go around the world telling my story and I can see people come alive with the story because it’s so relatable to people... it hits right there in your heart. And you think ‘if she can do it I can do it’. And I love that” Malone added.

She said that the brand grew into greatness because it all came intuitively to her.

“My husband [Gary Willcox] is my business partner — still my husband still my business partner and my best friend. And we opened up our first shop and then within five years it was so successful” she said. “We were doing things that no one had ever done because we had no protocols we had no strategy — I would feel it create it sell it — it was just such an easy process. And as the business got bigger and bigger our pool of money got smaller and smaller. So within five years we’d sold to the Estee Lauder Corporation. And life changed from that moment.”

No regrets

Asked if there was anything she wishes would have been done differently Malone said no — even when it came to her bout with breast cancer in 2003 which she beat a year later.

“I’m not somebody that looks back. I’ve always got my eyes looking forward. Because if you look back you trip yourself up. Would I have done things differently? Yes of course” she said. “Some of the things I’ve said to people I regret but the things that have happened to me I wouldn’t change... even my brush with breast cancer it changed me — it made me see life differently.”

Starting over

Malone sold her first business to Estee Lauder in 1999 but stayed on as Creative Director until 2006 before starting over with Jo Loves.

“This second business has been much more challenging but much more rewarding” she said. “It’s been a whole different emotional journey in getting there so I don’t regret things. I would have done things a little differently if I’d sold my company again. I still would have sold it to the Estee Lauder Corporation — I think they’re an amazing family — but I probably would have sold it slightly differently with connections with my name.”

What is THE Jo Malone scent?

“This is my fragrance I did for me it’s called Jo by Jo Loves” she said as she generously sprayed this journalist and the photographer with a large red bottle of perfume. “It’s a mezze of grapefruit... this is the fragrance I did for me and was never going to sell it. And then every time I wore it I would make another 10 bottles and give it away until we got to the point where I was giving away a 1000 bottles a month. My husband went ‘we’re putting that on the shelf’.”

She then sprayed another layer of perfume from a beautiful golden bottle — her latest launch — and it too had a wonderful story to it.

“It’s a beautiful gardenia called Golden Gardenia. And basically the story is about looking at yourself and saying I like who I am” she said. “It’s giving an Oscar to yourself saying ‘you know what? Don’t be the best for someone else be the best for yourself’. It’s about positivity creativity... don’t run your life for what you think people want you to be.”

An emotional pandemic

Malone was candid about having struggled through the pandemic on an emotional level.

“The first year I found pretty easy to cope. With the second year I really struggled — I struggled creatively and I struggled mentally” the perfumer said. “I had challenges with anxiety... why? I love people I like being around people. I like conversation. So I need to be inspired to be innovative be creative... but I’ve come out here [to Dubai] and I’m just loving it.

On working with Zara

At one point in our conversation Malone excitedly brought up the fact that she does the perfumes for fashion outlet Zara and told me she’d find me later to show them to me herself — and she did! She walked me over to the store and sprayed me with an array of her more affordable creations.

“We’ve just done one called Magnificently Dubai. I did Fabulously London which is one of my favourites” she said. “I’ve done 42 fragrances for them. And I’ll have the next two collections ready from here. And then an amazing collection we’re doing for Jo Loves for next year. So I’m here to work and whenever I’m by water I can think clearly.”

Celebrity perfumes

Asked about her thoughts on celebrity-led perfumes Malone was all for it.

“There’s room for everything. And you know what celebrity fragrances have done a lot of good. And I know people who are celebrities who have created their own [fragrance] I’ve created them for them. So I think there’s always room for all of us. Fragrance is art” she said. “For me the person wearing the fragrance is the celebrity. That’s how we approach it.”

The future of Jo Loves

Malone shared that there’s an exciting project she’s working on that people won’t be expecting from her.

“We have a very new avenue that we are about to launch in the UK. And then we’ll take it around the globe. And it’s something that no one would anticipate that I would do” she said adding that her creativity knows no bounds.

“I feel there’s one more piece I feel I’m about to do. I don’t know what it is” Malone added. “There’s just something out there for me and I can almost touch it... I want to have enough space with what I’m doing to be able to do whatever it is — that last missing piece.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't know about you but my weekly screen-time hours are embarrassingly excessive. The more attention I pay to my electronic devices the more convinced I am that we all need to surround ourselves at home with items that don't require electricity.

Homes need live plants piles of books original art hand-knitted blankets and artisan quilts.

Alexa can you make a quilt?

No.

I've never made a quilt either but someday I would like to. Meanwhile I am satisfying my curiosity by reading a book on quilting and talking to serious quilters about the importance of quilts in the American home today and throughout history.

""What other craft involves making something with your hands imbuing your style and creating something that keeps your loved ones warm?"" asks quilt designer and teacher Shannon Brinkley of Leesburg Va. ""It's the perfect blend of function and beauty.""

Brinkley 36 started quilting in college. Shortly after graduating she turned her hobby into a business. She started The Meander Quilt Guild an online international forum where quilters gather to share techniques for the centuries-old art.

""Anyone can slap three layers of fabric together but the fact that for centuries women"" (98% of quilters are women according to the Craft Industry Alliance 2020 Survey) ""have taken the time to make these items beautiful is what makes quilting so special.""

“Every quilt tells a story” says Carissa Heckathorn director of the Iowa Quilt Museum and a quilter for more than 30 years. (Courtesy of the Iowa Quilt Museum)

""Every quilt tells a story"" says Carissa Heckathorn director of the Iowa Quilt Museum and a quilter for more than 30 years. ""A quilt from the 1800s can tell you a lot about the woman who made it. The quilt can tell you if the woman was utilitarian making quilts quickly from scraps to keep her family warm repurposing old clothing because she didn't have money to buy fabric or if she was an affluent woman of leisure who could afford to buy matching fabrics and had the time to stitch precisely cut appliques.""

I try to imagine what story my quilt would tell and picture a haphazard patchwork of worn-out yoga pants held together by chewing gum and staples.

As my curiosity and appreciation for this old storytelling craft grow I ask Brinkley and Heckathorn to tell me more:

When did quilts first come to America and how have they evolved?

Heckathorn: The first quilts probably arrived here in the 1500s. For European colonists quilting was a popular pastime and a way for woman to get together. Along the way different quilt block patterns emerged to reflect women's roles in the home as well as their religious and political views. During the Great Depression women commonly made quilts out of feed sacks. In the '60s and '70s we saw lots of polyester in quilts. In the '80s quilting weight cotton became popular and is what most quilters use today.

How do people use quilts in homes today?

Heckathorn: The importance of the quilt in the American home has changed. Pioneer women made bed quilts not because they wanted to sew but because their families needed them for warmth.

Brinkley: Although the art of quilting has been evolving for centuries the pandemic caused the craft to progress much faster because of social media. In many ways quilting is in its infancy.

What are the basic types of quilts?

Brinkley: A quilt by definition is three layers of material ― a top middle and bottom ― sandwiched together stitched and bound around the edges. The top is where the action is. Today the middle layer is often batting. The three main styles of quilting are piecing where you patch together cut scraps to create a whole; applique where you attach cutout fabric shapes to background fabric; and whole cloth where the quilt top like the bottom is a solid piece of fabric.

I've always pictured quilters as a gaggle of gray-haired grannies coming together to gossip and sew. But clearly more young women are embracing the centuries-old craft.

Brinkley: While many women pick up the hobby when they retire many in my generation are getting into quilting when they start families and their nesting instincts are strong. While we still have traditional quilters the modern quilt movement is strong.

Is it considered cheating to use a sewing machine?

Heckathorn: Today it's assumed that if you're a quilter you're using a machine. Most quilters want to make as many quilts as they can and so use all the tools available.

What do you wish more people knew about quilting?

Heckathorn: That quilts are for everyone whether you buy them inherit them or make them.

Brinkley: That when you start it seems like you need to follow lots of rules and be precise. Let go of perfection. You don't have to follow a pattern. Just follow your heart.

Until I have time to try my hand at quilting I think I will follow my heart to the nearest quilt shop and see what's for sale.

On Tuesday the actress appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live to talk about her daughter Ruby Guest's upcoming wedding which has a cosplay theme. And as if that wasn't fun enough Curtis will apparently officiate the entire thing while dressed up as the game's Jaina Proudmoore no less.

""Everybody at the wedding is going to be in costume and I will be in a costume to officiate the wedding"" Curtis revealed adding that the ceremony will take place in their family's backyard and will feature a ""beautiful picnic.""

Curtis then revealed that she got the costume off of Etsy after Ruby — who came out as trans last year — and her fiancé chose her character. However the screen legend added that she was a little worried over whether her robes would come in time for the May event given that the seller is apparently in Russia and could be experiencing supply chain issues.

Despite this Kimmel seemed more concerned over what cosplay even was let alone how a cosplay wedding would work. But jokes about Curtis potentially dressing up as a raccoon aside it was obvious the star was just thrilled to be the one making Ruby's marriage official in such a special spot especially since her older daughter Annie also got married in the same place three years ago.

""Both my children will have been married in my backyard which brings me to tears"" Curtis said to which Kimmel responded ""And it's cheaper right? It's so much cheaper in the yard."" Granted she also went on to explain that ""it's so much more meaningful"" to have an intimate wedding like this especially if you ""forget"" all of the ""show-off business"" that can come with an event like this — and we definitely have to agree.

The new generation stays true to the past but is it the way forward?

There have been plenty of 4×4 nameplates that have gone soft over the years those that were born with big bones but have since traded them for urban-friendly car-like underpinnings. But Isuzu maker of trucks and pick-ups hasn’t given up on the 4×4 SUV with the latest MU-X still true to form. It’s once again based on the D-Max but adds refinement and niceties. However this new generation also comes with a hefty price rise.

What used to be one of the more affordable rigs in the rugged 4×4 market is now one of the more expensive with just one model offered listing at $80990. If you’re wondering the full chassis competition includes the Toyota Fortuner ($57290-$60290) Mitsi Pajero Sport ($68990) and the Ford Everest ($72990-$79990). For the ultimate in value the Rexton is $49990-$76990 and the LDV D90 a bargain at $43990-$53990.

So the competitive set isn’t what it used to be with large three-row SUVs like Sorento or Pathfinder now more in demand. Those nameplates have long since traded live axles and chassis rails for a life less rugged. However the MU-X still offers genuine off-road hardware. Its new stats are more impressive with ground clearance up to 235mm a 23-degree rampover angle and with breathers on the differentials it can also ford rivers up to 800mm deep if you’re keen. Although you’ll likely start floating in that much water if you can’t keep your momentum up. Helping out in that regard is a proper 4×4 transfer case with a low range a locking rear diff and a Rough Terrain mode for the traction control system to keep spinning wheels in check. We didn’t put this to the ultimate test as the 20-inch wheels and Dueler HT (that’s Highway Terrain) rubber would stymie any real adventuring. Serious truckers will need to upgrade those immediately. There’s disc brakes all around but a live axle still lives on the rear. Unlike the ute this has upper and lower trailing arms and a panhard rod for added stability and coil springs to soothe the ride. This makes for a more cultured progress than what the D-Max puts you through; it’s rubbish in the ride department (at least when you don’t have a load on). Progress in the MU-X is generally okay (for a 4×4 on a big chassis) though it jiggles along on a bumpy road never really settling. For city folk it charges over speed humps at pace but if your school run involves 20 kilometres of gravel each way this is more up to the task of being shaken about than those unibody SUVs. The steering is super light and while the connection with the front wheels is vague it’s easy to tool around the burbs in. Even the turning circle is livable MU-X with a shorter wheelbase than the ute.

Motivation is provided by Isuzu’s 3.0-litre workhorse made over for the new generation of D-Max and fronting with 140kW and a stout 450Nm. The auto is a reasonably responsive six-speeder changing gears with an emphasis on the smooth rather than the slick. The torque converter lock-up can go AWOL when you’re off the throttle so you’re in effect coasting along with the engine idling. And when you’re back on the throttle you get that old fashioned ‘auto flare’. You can manipulate the gears manually to circumvent this while it manages to hold in gear on a descent to add engine braking. The 3.0-litre has a decent response (once the auto is hooked up again that is) and isn’t too laggy or loud (for a ute-sourced oiler). With strong midrange pull the average fuel use was registering in the 10.5L/100km range.

When you push things along there’s a fair amount of roll some understeer and then ESP intervention. It chews up gravel trails nicely however with only some minor diff hop over the big corrugations in the bends. It manages to soak up the nasty potholes that would eventually shake a crossover to pieces if you did it every day.

The MU-X gained a five-star crash rating thanks to the full range of active safety kit and eight air bags. However some of the safety widgets need toning down; the lane keeping is always pushing you back into the centre of the lane when you are trying to stay left for instance. And disabling them is a real mission only permissible when stopped. The active cruise takes care of traffic flows though the braking is noisy when it brings you to a halt and it can be slow to restart again. There’s just an ordinary reversing camera and parking sensors front and rear to help with docking duties.

In the cabin the MU-X has a few more upmarket fittings than its D-Max donor. Hard plastics are still in abundance but there are fewer sharp edges and more soft touch points; this even has some ambient lighting and an electric park brake. The infotainment system is pretty basic but includes CarPlay and Android Auto. The seat is accepting of a broader frame and is well padded while the steering column has four-way adjustment.

MU-X is a seven seater and while the second row isn’t set on sliders it’s positioned for optimal interior space. While there’s not an excess of lounging room there it is certainly sufficient and even the centre seat is acceptable for legroom and squab comfort. Accessing the rearmost seats is easy enough as the middle row can tumble forward right out of your way. And it’s not too bad on room back there either; you don’t need to be a hobbit to fit. With seats stowed the boot space is typical of the genre with a high-set floor as this has the big axle underneath and a need for max articulation. The hold is long and wide and the tailgate is powered but slow in operation and the safety alert is percingingly loud.

Adding to the MU-X’s versatility is a 3500kg braked tow rating the best in class by around 400kg and on par with most utes.

So it’s certainly capable and practical but like the ute it’s expensive and soon to be even more so likely to be stung with around $3000 in Clean Car fees from April thanks to its excessive CO2 output. For the same money we’d find it hard to go past the Ford Everest. If you’re not in need of such a capable rig a more road-oriented three-row crossover like a hybrid Highlander or Sorento is cheaper more refined and far less gassy.",,,,,,,,,

The two young women were sitting on a bench in Ukraine waiting to receive their college admissions test results.

""We waited like four hours together on the bench trying to get results"" Ross said. ""And we were not in a digital age because Ukraine was kind of 30 years behind because of the Soviet Union.""

The women ended up attending the same university near Ross' hometown and had the same major.

Now Ross is a leading a task force for the Greater Topeka Partnership that will seek to settle Ukrainian refugees in Topeka. Ross hopes her friend Irina and her family will be among those welcomed to the capital city.

Friend in Ukraine fled to border for safety

Irina — Ross isn't sharing her last name for safety reasons — lived in Kyiv with her husband and two children. Irina and her husband worked at Samsung Ross said and led a good life.

When the bombs began to fall they fled.

""They had a vehicle so my friend's husband took them to the border"" Ross said ""but because he was under the age of 60 he had to stay.""

Irina was able to cross the border into Poland with their two children. Samsung has worked to find them temporary lodging although Ross said they ""live in a (refugee) camp.""

What the Greater Topeka Partnership is doing and how you can help

GTP Chamber president Curtis Sneden said those who want to help can send a note to info@supporttopeka.com. This will help the GTP organize a list of those interested in lending a hand.

""If a person wanted to get involved with the efforts that we're describing here today I would send a note to that email"" Sneden said. ""That way we'll know you're out there.""

Sneden says he has received emails from people demonstrating a willingness to help those in need. In September of last year Kansas welcomed 500 Afghan families fleeing the Taliban takeover of their country. About 68000 Afghans would be relocated in the U.S.

How Ukrainian refugees will be brought to the United States is mostly in the court of policymakers but Sneden doesn't see that as a problem.

""It's not always possible to map out every step of your response to certain types of emergent situations"" he said. ""We're gonna get together and see what's possible.""

More:100000 Ukrainian refugees could come to the US. This task force will figure out how to get them to Topeka.

What makes Ukraine different from Syria and Central American crises?

On Thursday President Joe Biden pledged up to $1 billion in humanitarian aid to Ukraine and opened the country's borders to those fleeing the war. Almost 4 million have fled the country and the U.S. could receive up to 100000 of them.

Sneden explained why the GTP formed the refugee task force for the crisis in Ukraine but not for other refugee crises.

The war in Ukraine has offered a clarifying moment for the world in how it can address future refugee crises he said. Sneden also highlighted steps taken by Biden and the clear language he used in pledging support for Ukraine.

""What catalyzes our action in this moment is the clarity of President Biden's announcement about clearing the way for these refugees"" he said.

Yana Ross welcomed in Topeka

The USSR experienced a period of economic stagnation in the 1970s. Due to the closed nature of the Soviet economy few if any modern goods from western nations flowed across the borders.

This is something Ross has no desire to experience again.

""I don't have good memories about it"" she said.

Ross has lived in Topeka for 16 years. She is also an ambassador to the GTP and an insurance agent at Farm Bureau.

She said she saw the best side of residents in Kansas. The Topeka she found was willing and able to help her as she adjusted to a new culture and city.

""Everybody was friendly and they made me feel welcome"" Ross said. ""It's a community. It's not about a place. It's about community coming around others in this case refugees.""

(WIBW) - A two-vehicle accident caused a power outage in Topeka Sunday afternoon.

Topeka police told 13 NEWS that authorities were called to Southwest 29th Street and Wanamaker Road around 3:45 pm on a report of a two-vehicle accident. One driver was driving recklessly and speeding westbound on 29th St. causing them to hit another vehicle and then ran into a power line pole. Minor injuries were involved in the accident.

At about 7:30 p.m. TPD updated the situation saying SW 29th street from Wanamaker RD to about Arrowhead Road remains closed due to power lines in the roadway.

Drivers are being redirected if they are driving down westbound on 29th St. towards Wanamaker Rd.  while Evergy crews work to restore power.

They say about 3700 customers were without power initially from the accident. Power was restored to about 3000 customers as of 5:15 pm Sunday.

That’s because Apple apparently breached its own terms of service resulting in the company agreeing to pay out a $14.8 million class action settlement per Macworld . The specific violation was that Apple apparently stored some iCloud data on third-party servers instead of its own. Apple continues to deny any wrongdoing but that isn’t stopping it from shelling out cash to make the problem go away.

According to the terms of the settlement  this applies to folks who paid any additional money for extra iCloud storage from Sept. 16 2015 to Jan. 31 2016. You also needed to have a U.S. mailing address attached to your iCloud account during that time so customers outside the States won’t get anything.

Folks who still subscribe to an iCloud storage plan will get the money through their Apple account while anyone who has since cut off the subscription will get a check in the mail.

The monthly fees for iCloud storage back then ranged from 99 cents for 50 GB of cloud space to $10 for 1 TB of space. That part is important because how much money you’ll get back depends on how much you paid during those few months the settlement is zeroing in on.

You probably shouldn’t expect a huge amount of money from this either way though. That $14.8 million sounds like a lot but once it’s dispersed among everyone who paid for iCloud storage a few years ago it could wind up being a check for $2.79.

Do you want to stay near Disney World or Universal? How much are you willing to spend — do you want a budget hotel or something a little more luxurious?

If the answers to those two questions are Universal and luxurious we’re we’ve got a treat for you!

It’s no secret that we’ve already fallen in love with Universal Orlando’s Portofino Bay — we might even pick it over Disney World’s deluxe hotels! We recently stayed there again and enjoyed its restaurants pools amenities and room.

Resort Atmosphere

The hotel’s theme is that it’s set in an Italian seaside village Portofino Bay.

The theme just makes you feel like relaxing with lots of beautiful and open spaces. It’s dedicated to “la dolce vita” aka the sweet life and when you stay here you feel like you’re enjoying just that.

Speaking of the sweet life guests of the hotel also get exclusive Universal benefits including a free Universal Express Unlimited Pass to skip lines at attractions.

It’s also close enough to Universal Orlando Resort that guests can walk to the parks but there are also complimentary water taxis and shuttle buses.

So this is a beautiful resort that is also well-located.

Stores

You’ll also find several stores here including L’Ancora Universal Store and Le Memories de Portofino.

So there are plenty of shopping opportunities.

Pools And Spa

There are three pools The Beach Pool The Hillside Pool and The Villa Pool.

For a little pampering you can visit the Mandara Spa.

Dining

When it comes to dining the hotel offers a little something for everyone. For fine dining there’s Mama Della’s Ristorante and Bice Ristorante.

For a more casual dining experience there’s Trattoria del Porto Splendido Bar & Grill and Sal’s Market Deli.

Fancy a drink? Head on over to The Thirsty Fish. Or if it’s a morning or afternoon pick-me-up you’re after there’s also a Starbucks on-site. You can also enjoy some delicious gelato at the Gelateria.

Room Tour

We stayed in Villa 3531 which is a Standard Bay View Queen Room.

The first thing you see when you walk inside is a short hallway that leads to the main part of the room.

Just to the right is a table with a mirror above it.

This table holds a coffee maker and ice bucket.

The ice bucket also has a tray beneath it.

The coffee station features a Keurig coffee maker K-cups with coffee and tea disposable cups cream sugar and stirrers.

Right next to this table is a closet. You’ll find hangers in here along with…

…an extra blanket…

…a robe…

a luggage rack…

…an iron and ironing board…

…and a safe.

To the right is the bathroom — as you can see it’s quite spacious.

There’s a huge mirror and two sinks with lots of counter space for your stuff.

The sinks have silver faucets and tap.

In the middle are some hotel amenities (soaps and lotions) along with facial tissue and extra washcloths.

The container has extra cotton balls.

Underneath are extra hand and bath towels along with a blowdryer and bath mat.

Here’s a closer look at the blowdryer.

There’s extra space underneath the cabinets for additional storage.

You’ll find the toilet just to the left of the sinks.

The furthest wall has a walk-in shower with bath towels just within reach on a bar beside it.

The shower has a tall showerhead as well as shampoo conditioner and a basket to hold soap.

Amenities here include shampoo and conditioner as well as soap. Extra washcloths were stuffed behind the amenities.

There’s also a separate bathtub if you’re wanting a long soak after a day at the parks.

This room comes with two queen beds. The room’s colors are light and seaside-ish and include carpeting.

The furthest corner of the room — nearest the window — has a chair with a reading lamp as well as a footstool.

Opposite that is a table with a lamp and two chairs. There’s a small trash can next to it.

Beside that and opposite the beds is a large flatscreen TV on top of a dresser with plenty of drawers for your clothes.

The drawers are spacious enough for whatever you might want to put in there.

Between the drawers is a cabinet — this is where you’ll find the mini-fridge.

The table between the beds has an alarm clock on one side USB ports and plugs for your devices in the middle…

…and a phone notepad pen and hand sanitizer on the other side.

Underneath is a cubby hole for storage as well as a drawer.

Above that is a mirror with two lights.

As you can see the room is very well-appointed.

Overall Impression

We’ve stayed here before and we’ve always thought this is more of what we would expect of a hotel in the “deluxe” category. The theming is subtle but the entire property still makes you feel like you’re on vacation in Italy and not in the middle of Orlando Florida. If you’re looking to splurge on your next Orlando trip this is a good place to do it!

Pennycrest Floral in Archbold will soon be moving to a new building. You won’t have to look too far down the street though as their new home will be the previous Rupp Furniture and Carpet Co. building.

Currently the shop is located at 220 North Defiance Street in Archbold. Many different product types are offered at the store in addition to their fresh flower business.

The Mennonite Pantry and the Pop Shop are two examples of what is available with items like bulk candies chocolate covered raisins peanuts pretzels Oreos caramel clusters and more. Original items carried by the Pop Shop years ago are still available in shop.

The store also offers inhouse engravings which can be done on almost anything. Refurbished furniture is also available that the employees themselves work on to fix up by painting and repurposing.

The business started out small in its beginning Tobey Wendorf explained. “When we first started we had one delivery van. Now we are at three. It has gotten to the point where we have no backroom.”

This new building fixes that issue and more with an increase of almost 21000 square feet over their current building according to Tobey. It also includes a much larger back room with a lift to bring materials and items up to the higher floors.

All the new space will allow for the continued expansion of the company with much already being planned for the new building with multiple floors being able to be used.

The basement floor will be used for storage with the first floor continuing to be the main sales floor area. The second floor will be used for a state certified kitchen for the Mennonite Pantry and Pop Shop portion of the business. The third floor will also give access to people for photography sessions and selfies.

All the extra space on the sales floor will give more room for flowers. The hope for the owners is to double the cooler size for the flowers that customers are able to see and purchase.

All of these changes and more will help to give Pennycrest shoppers a great experience. “It’s going to be extremely great. Currently it’s such a cramped space and for us to have all this extra room and to no longer have stuff in the way of customers it’s going to be fantastic” said Tobey Wendorf.

The Rupp building is also the building with the new Archbold Mural on the side. It has continued to bring people to Archbold and to the mural.”

“The mural being on the side of the building was definitely a plus when it came to buying the building. “I like having the mural on the side of the building. It draws in more people and hopefully more people will want to come in and look around. It’s nice to have it on the side of our building” said Tobey Wendorf.

Currently the hope is to move over to the new building within the next six months. Many items like the candies mentioned above are available as well as things such as home décor items candles gift items wind chimes furniture and of course flowers. So head on over to Pennycrest floral and see what you can find.

For over a year Exxon has been working with Crusoe Energy Systems a company based in Denver said the people who asked not to be named because details of the project are confidential. Crusoe's technology helps oil companies turn wasted energy or flare gas into a useful resource. Similar to ConocoPhillips ' mining scheme in North Dakota's Bakken region Exxon is diverting natural gas that would otherwise be burned off into generators which convert the gas into electricity used to power shipping containers full of thousands of bitcoin miners. Exxon launched the pilot in late January 2021 and expanded its buildout in July. While Exxon hasn't talked publicly about its work in the space Eric Obrock a 10-year veteran at the company said on his LinkedIn profile that from February 2019 to January 2022 he ""proposed and led the first successful commercial and technical demonstration of using Bitcoin Proof-of-Work mining as a viable alternative to natural gas flaring in the oil patch."" Obrock's title on his profile is NGL industry outlook advisor referring to the natural gas liquids market. Obrock told CNBC through a LinkedIn message that he's been advised that he can't speak to the media on this topic. Exxon didn't respond to a request for comment. Exxon's bitcoin project isn't really about making money from the cryptocurrency. Rather the company has pledged to reduce emissions as part of an industrywide effort to meet higher environmental demands. In early March Exxon joined other oil companies in committing to the World Bank's ""Zero Routine Flaring by 2030"" initiative introduced in 2015. The type of crypto mining arrangement it's pursuing with Crusoe reduces CO2-equivalent emissions by about 63% compared with continued flaring. Exxon's bitcoin mining work in North Dakota was first reported by Bloomberg which said the company is also considering similar pilots in Alaska the Qua Iboe Terminal in Nigeria Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale field Guyana and Germany.

Mining bitcoin in the Bakken

The problem Exxon and Conoco are addressing has existed for years: What happens when drillers accidentally hit a natural gas formation? Unlike oil which can be trucked out to a remote destination gas delivery requires a pipeline. If a drilling site is close to a pipeline producers can sell it right away. But if the pipe is full or if the gas is 20 miles away drillers often burn it off. That's why you typically see flames rising from oil fields. In addition to the environmental hazards drillers are also burning cash. Enter bitcoin mining which only requires an internet connection and can be done from anywhere. And because miners' primary variable cost is energy they're incentivized to find the cheapest sources of power. ""This is just a great way to bring that demand to the wasted energy and solve two problems at once"" said Cully Cavness president of Crusoe whose backers include Valor Equity Partners one of Tesla 's largest investors. ""Solve the energy appetite of bitcoin and solve the stranded energy flare gas problem for the energy industry."" Cavness said Crusoe has 150 employees and works with Norway's Equinor ASA  Canadian oil producer Enerplus and Devon Energy  based in Oklahoma City.

Permits from North Dakota's Division of Air Quality show Crusoe can run 20 portable engines with 11 currently in use at well sites across the state. Two of the engines are operational at wells run by XTO Energy Exxon's oil and gas fracking subsidiary at the Jorgenson Deep Creek Site. Cavness said most of Crusoe's 80-plus data centers are deployed in the Bakken. ""We're really moving the needle on flared volumes"" Cavness said. ""More than 10 million cubic feet of gas per day that would be flared is not flared because we've deployed our systems."" The World Bank in its most recent Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership report recognized Crusoe as offering an innovative solution to flaring.

Solving the methane problem

The Bakken formation became an important source of new oil production in the U.S. in the last couple decades with the boom in hydraulic fracturing or fracking. Craig Thorstenson has been working at the permitting program at North Dakota's Division of Air Quality since 1989. He says North Dakota has always been an oil state to some extent but growth in the Bakken lifted the state to second in the country before it slipped to third last year. Thorstenson who was born and raised in Bismarck the state capital said the change ""was quite a shock for us."" Residential housing couldn't keep up with demand. ""We were having a population boom"" Thorstenson said. ""People coming in wanting to get jobs. People living in the Walmart parking lots."" More drilling meant more wasted gas which affected the entire Williston Basin that spreads across part of Montana the Dakotas and into Canada. That's a big reason why Crusoe invested heavily in the area. ""At points in not-that-distant history the basin was flaring almost up to a fifth of the gas that was being produced there"" said Cavness. Thorstenson said the amount of wasted natural gas is finally trending lower. In a March report North Dakota's Department of Natural Resources estimated that currently 93% to 94% of natural gas is being captured. In 2014 the commission had a capture goal of 74%. Drillers have historically chosen flaring as a way to dispose of excess gas because it's less damaging to the environment than venting which releases methane directly into the air and produces greenhouse effects that have proven to be 84 to 86 times as powerful as CO2 over a 20-year period. Even with flaring some methane does escape due to wind and other factors. On-site bitcoin mining can be especially impactful because 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air according to Adam Ortolf who runs business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities. ""Nobody will run it through a generator unless they can make money because generators cost money to acquire and maintain"" Ortolf said. ""So unless it's economically sustainable producers won't internally combust the gas."" Crusoe's systems are built to make the process financially viable for drillers. The company brings its equipment onto the oil pad allowing it to convert otherwise wasted natural gas into electricity which then powers computing at the well site. ""When we put it through our generator we get up to 99.9% combustion of that methane"" Cavness said. ""Not only are we using the otherwise wasted energy we're also significantly reducing methane emissions."" Cavness said his main takeaway from the United Nations' latest global climate summit in Glasgow Scotland was that methane is the low-hanging fruit. ""That's the thing we want to solve as an energy industry"" he said.

NICOSIA Cyprus – Exxon Mobil Corp. has confirmed the presence of high-quality gas after completing drilling operations at the Glaucus-2 appraisal well off the coast of Cyprus.

ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum hold the license to operate Cyprus’ offshore Block 10. The two companies received the exploration concession in 2017 with ExxonMobil operating the block with a 60% ownership interest and Qatar Petroleum holding the remaining interest.

Cyprus previously estimated gas resources in the reservoir of 5-8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas when the discovery from the Glaucus-1 well was announced in 2019. Exxon and Qatar Petroleum began drilling the Glaucus-2 well in December 2021.

ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum say they will conduct a detailed examination and evaluation of the collected data to determine the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the reservoir more precisely.

The two companies say they will also evaluate the potential options to develop and commercialize the discovery. Once completed the consortium will notify the ministry about the evaluation results.

The fire burned for more than three hours before it was extinguished at about 1:15 a.m. Sunday morning said the refinery’s public affairs specialist Dan Carter.

“There were no injuries and all employees and contractors were accounted for” Carter said.

The refinery employs more than 270 people and about 100 contractors on a daily basis according to its website.

It isn't yet clear how much damage was done or what the cost of repairs might be. ExxonMobil officials didn't respond to questions about how the fire might affect production. The plant which began operations in 1954 is capable of refining roughly 60000 barrels of crude oil a day and produces about 600 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel annually.

Along with the refinery’s own emergency response team crews from Lockwood and Billings fire departments also responded along with emergency personnel from Phillips 66 and CHS refineries the Yellowstone County Sheriff’s Department and Department of Emergency Services.

The ExxonMobil Billings Refinery spans 720 acres and its products include gasoline diesel asphalt butane and propane. The refinery is in a sparsely populated area and the fire drew some onlookers and a few passing motorists stopped to shoot video. No evacuation of the area was ordered.

“We are sorry this incident has occurred and apologize for any disruption or inconvenience” Carter said.

Bystanders could see a smoke column rising from the refinery in the late evening hours and witnesses described flames erupting from the compound.

Josh Thometz was watching a movie with his family at his home on Lapin Street when they heard a boom echo outside. They went to the street and one of their neighbors told them the refinery was on fire. Thometz captured footage of the flames as first responders battled the blaze.

“A full assessment of any damages and an investigation of the cause will be taking place” Carter said Sunday morning.

As the first quarter wraps up this week we get to review the impact current developments around the world have had on the most important driver of stock prices over the long-term: earnings.

The corporate earnings outlook has been relatively stable despite the backdrop of war in Ukraine. Although the unofficial start of the earnings reporting season is still a couple of weeks away there is the potential for market moving news ahead of these announcements. The weeks around the end of the quarter often see companies who expect to fall short of their earnings targets downwardly revise their guidance. So far the changes in first quarters' earnings estimates have been modest.

Earnings-per-share growth in 2022 for companies around the world (as measured by the MSCI All Country World Index) is now expected by FactSet analysts' consensus to be up 6%. Prior to the invasion the consensus was at 7% a difference of only 1%. Higher post-invasion forecasts in the energy materials and industrials sectors partially offset modest declines across other sectors.

Pre- and post-invasion 2022 EPS estimates

Geographically earnings per share estimates for 2022 show that the rising trends in the U.S. U.K. and Japan have not changed much this year. Despite Europe's proximity to the conflict and dependence upon Russian energy supplies earnings growth is still expected to be higher than it was at the start of the year though lower by about 1.5% from pre-invasion levels.

Percent change in 2022 EPS forecasts since start of year

Source: Charles Schwab FactSet data as of 3/25/2022.

There are a couple notable pre- and post-invasion differences:

Canada a major commodity producer has jumped higher since the start of the conflict bolstered by higher prices.

Emerging markets (EM) when measured in U.S. dollars have dropped—tied to the earnings of Russian oil companies dropping out of the index and weakness due to EM currencies falling versus the U.S. dollar. Notably China and other major emerging market earnings outlooks haven’t changed much.

Reflecting the changes in estimates since the start of the year analysts' forecasts for earnings growth in 2022 are still positive across countries and regions heading into the first quarter earnings reporting season as you can see in the chart below.

2022 earnings growth still seen positive across countries and regions

Source: Charles Schwab FactSet data as of 3/25/2022. Forecasts contained herein are for illustrative purposes only may be based upon proprietary research and are developed through analysis of historical public data.

Although forecasts for the year are usually raised during the earnings season as companies typically exceed quarterly estimates there is greater uncertainty this season given the Ukraine conflict inflation and lingering COVID-19 waves.

One of the best leading indicators of the trend in earnings expectations is the global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI). This survey of business leaders from companies around the world is typically about three months ahead of analysts' forecasts for earnings over the coming 12 months as you can see in the chart below of the past 20 years.

PMI leads earning trends

Source: Charles Schwab Bloomberg (PMI) and Factset (MSCI) data as of 3/25/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The level of 50 on the PMI is the threshold between expansion and contraction in manufacturing and tends to align with the division in the outlook between growth and decline in earnings for all companies over the coming year. We will get March's reading of the global manufacturing PMI on April 1. This month's preliminary PMI readings for major countries like the U.S. Germany France and Japan were resilient despite the war reflecting only a small dip. If this trend is confirmed with the final global PMI reading on April Fools' Day it suggests the outlook for earnings growth is likely to continue.

Of course the future direction of the PMI and the outlook for earnings remains tied to the impact of the war and sanctions among many other factors that include inflation and central bank actions. Further escalation of sanctions may have greater earnings impact; current sanctions have been cautiously implemented to avoid disruption of energy supplies. However investors may take some comfort that the earnings impact so far has remained modest and global companies appear to be on a path for earnings growth this year.

If you get deliveries regularly there are many ways to track what's on the way. Here are the best iPhone iPad and macOS apps for tracking parcels going through major delivery networks.

Not all that long ago sending a package to someone was a set-and-forget task. You would send it off and hope to get an update from the other end that it would appear safely and on time.

This lack of knowledge of what's happening with a delivery was also quite apparent for people who ordered goods and services. You'd get told of a dispatch but updates were few and far between unless you paid for more expensive delivery options that offered updates.

Delivery services have advanced over the last few years with tracking features in apps and websites providing customers with updates on where their package has traveled on its way to the recipient for most customers. Updates about entering and departing regional depots and warehouses have also evolved with some services even offering tracking of the final delivery van as they go along their route.

Even with this advancement in technology there's still the problem for users knowing where to look. With many options available to send a package from A to B you have to monitor multiple delivery apps simultaneously.

This is especially true at peak times such as when you're waiting for holiday shopping orders from multiple retailers to turn up at your door. It's unlikely that they will collectively use just one of USPS FedEx UPS or DHL.

Thankfully instead of constantly checking multiple apps there are options that simplify the process. Apps are available for keeping tabs of packages going through more than one service giving you just one place to monitor.

Here are the apps you should be looking at to take the stress out of waiting for a package to arrive.

What about the delivery company apps?

While this list primarily deals with apps covering multiple delivery companies you should also keep an eye on the apps those delivery firms offer to users:

All four of these apps provide features specific to each service. They all include tracking for packages entered into their systems but they also offer other services.

This can include calculating shipping prices scheduling pick-ups creating shipments printing labels measuring packages and changing delivery dates.

These extra features certainly make the apps indispensable for someone who repeatedly sends out packages such as a small business owner who uses a small number of delivery firms a lot. For people who tend to receive parcels than send them they are not quite as useful as a less specialized app.

Parcel - Delivery Tracking

Parcel is a great example of a delivery tracking app done well. Available in two versions Parcel for macOS and Parcel for iOS enables users to get notifications on practically the entire Apple device ecosystem including the Apple Watch.

The app can acquire tracking information for 300 delivery services around the world. Major US delivery services are included and Amazon Logistics and other firms.

Amazon tracking doesn't stop with logistics. Integration with Amazon lets the app automatically add orders for tracking without needing any intervention from the user.

A Notification Center widget can display expected deliveries for today or tomorrow. Push notifications from the app are also limited to surface between 8 am and 10 pm by default but this can be disabled.

Parcel is free to download but features including push notifications and tracking more than 3 deliveries require a premium subscription. Currently that premium option is $4.99 per year.

Deliveries: a package tracker

In a similar vein to our first pick Deliveries is a cross-platform delivery-tracking tool that does so on macOS iOS iPadOS and Apple Watch. Where it differs is in its use of color between carriers to make the app more visually interesting and easier to understand.

With the support of dozens of services in the U.S. and beyond the app can also monitor orders from Amazon and Apple even before they ship. For services not supported by the app you can enter a delivery date and a website you can visit with it counting down the days to the package's theoretical arrival.

You also don't have to keep the tracking information within the app. It is possible to share the shipment with others over email AirDrop or iMessage.

There's a Notification Center widget for at-a-glance updates. You can even have the estimated delivery dates added to Calendar so you could potentially plan events around package deliveries.

Free to download Deliveries costs $0.99 per month or $4.99 for a yearly subscription.

Route: Package Tracker

Route for iOS and iPadOS provides similar tracking features to the others including live tracking and real-time push notifications but it offers a more shopping-centric experience.

For a start it supports over 600 shipping carriers worldwide but it also benefits from connections to many retailers and online stores. A lot of this is handled by connecting Route to your inbox so that it can detect new orders and deliveries.

This connection also brings order resolution options for over 11000 merchants so that you can claim for missing orders or damaged goods right from the app. There's also a universal order history so you can search multiple stores for products you ordered in the past at the same time.

Being so retailer-centric the app also includes shopping tools including product discovery and being able to follow brands for new products.

Route is free to download with no in-app purchases.

AfterShip Package Tracker

Boasting support for over 700 carriers around the world AfterShip is an iOS and iPadOS package tracker that again offers a considerable number of services it can check at a time. Handily for users it will automatically detect which carrier a package uses based on the tracking number. However it can also do the same for parcel senders with its barcode scanner.

If you have a tracking number list you can also copy and paste them in en masse to save time. There are options to share tracking links easily so others can see the order's progress for themselves.

Like Route AfterShip provides an enhanced retail-based experience with it able to check the delivery status of orders from retailers like Amazon eBay AliExpress and others. Automatic importing of shipments from Amazon Etsy and Walmart is included and monitoring shipment details sent to a Gmail account.

The app is free to normal users wanting to see shipments of packages but this is down to AfterShip offering chargeable services to retailers such as branded tracking pages and shipment analytics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHltZW1waGlhbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yNzg0NS9mZWRleC1tZW1waGlzLWZsaWdodC11a3JhaW5lLWFpZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx flight departs for Europe carrying relief for Ukrainian refugees,"Enter your e-mail address

Jackson Conway scored his first USL Championship hat trick while 16-year-old Jonantan Villal marked his first professional start with two assists.

The Battery struck first as Dylan Castanheira saved a shot from Loganville Ga. native DZ Harmon into the path of Aidan Apodaca. Apodaca fired his shot into the roof of the net from the left side to take the lead for Charleston in the sixth minute.

David Mejía was creating chances for the hosts from the left wing first forcing a save from Joe Kuzminsky on a free kick in the 19th minute before striking the post with a surging shot from the left side of the box two minutes later.

Atlanta came close again in the 26th minute with Noah Cobb flicking on a free kick for Alex De John to volley from the right. The Atlanta United defender’s effort forced a diving save out of Kuzminsky.

Charleston would be down a man for the entire second half as Matt Sheldon earned two consecutive yellow cards and was sent off by the referee in the dying embers of the first half.

Villal who was impressive in the first half did well with the extra space afforded to him in the second half. In the 56th minute Robbie Mertz intercepted a Charleston pass on the right side and drove into the box before sending Villal to the goal line. The midfielder lofted a cross to the far post which Conway leapt to and headed in for the equalizer.

Conway would net his second just seven minutes later this time with the help of left back Mikey Ambrose. Ambrose picked up a half-cleared ball on the left flank before creating some distance with a touch and launching a cross to the edge of the six-yard box. The 20-year-old Academy product would once again get his head on the cross nodding in his second of the night in the 63rd minute.

Conway and Villal paired up again in the 78th minute to finish off an Atlanta breakaway deftly touching down a Darwin Matheus cross before flicking up a short lob for his teammate. Conway took the pass with his right foot and spun to finish with his left securing his first professional hat trick.

After contributing with a secondary assist on Conway’s third goal Matheus knocked in his first goal of the 2022 season. Conway misfired a shot off a cross from the right side by Ajani Fortune which the Venezuelan pounced on and tucked in with his left foot in stoppage time.

ATL UTD 2 (1-3-0 3 points) heads back on the road to face off against Hartford Athletic traveling to Trinity Health Stadium for a Saturday-night match on April 2 (ESPN+ 7 p.m. ET).

Suarez in the No. 99 Camaro posted a time of 132.369 seconds around the 3.4-mile road course but was bested by Ryan Blaney in the No. 12 Ford Mustang whose time was a blistering 132.343.

Cole Custer in the No. 41 Mustang will start third while the No. 8 Camaro of Tyler Reddick will start in fourth on the second row. Alex Bowman in the No. 48 Camaro who won at Las Vegas earlier this year rounds out the top five for this week’s event.

Chase Elliott in the No. 9 Camaro is the only driver in the Hendrick Motorsports stable to be winless so far in the Cup Series this year. Things could very well turn around for him at COTA – he won a dramatic rain-shortened event at the Texas track last year. He will start 12th when the green flag drops today.

It’s also worth noting that five teams overall incurred penalties for failing pre-qualifying inspection multiple times including two Chevy racing teams: the No. 50 Camaro of Kaz Grala and the No. 77 Camaro of Josh Bilicki. The No. 50 team had a chassis specialist ejected and the No. 77 team had a race engineer removed from competition at COTA. Additionally the No. 66 Ford of Boris Said and the No. 78 Ford of Andy Lally failed. Lally was not allowed to qualify and will serve a pass-through penalty during Sunday’s race.

Interestingly the No. 6 Ford Mustang driven by Brad Keselowski was also nabbed for failing inspection multiple times. Earlier this week the No. 6 Mustang team was heavily penalized for modification of a single-source part and it’s certainly interesting that the race car was caught out of tolerance once again.

Nascar did not disclose the infractions that resulted in the aforementioned penalties.

During the close pass called perihelion all ten of Solar Orbiter’s instruments operated simultaneously working together to gather important never-before-seen data. The flyby brought Solar Orbiter less than one-third of the distance from the Sun to the Earth.

Solar Orbiter’s historic perihelion

Solar Orbiter launched on February 9 2020 atop a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket. Since being released by the rocket’s Centaur upper stage Solar Orbiter has been traveling through interplanetary space in a heliocentric orbit.

In order to lower its perihelion — the point in its orbit closest to the Sun — Solar Orbiter needs to perform several gravity assists with Earth and Venus to achieve a targeted perihelion of 0.28 AU. Additionally these gravity assist maneuvers help raise the inclination of Solar Orbiter’s orbit allowing the spacecraft to provide the first views of the Sun’s uncharted polar regions. During its primary mission Solar Orbiter’s orbital inclination will increase from 0° to 24°.

On June 15 2020 Solar Orbiter made its first close pass of the Sun. At the time of this first close pass Solar Orbiter’s perihelion was only 77 million kilometers around the halfway point between the Sun and Earth. During this first perihelion Solar Orbiter teams tested each of the spacecraft’s ten instruments imaging the Sun and collecting a plethora of data on the Sun’s unique processes

The ten instruments aboard Solar Orbiter are the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) Magnetometer (MAG) Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW) Solar Wind Plasma Analyser (SWA) Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) Coronagraph (Metis) Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI) Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) and X-ray Spectrometer/Telescope (STIX).

As Solar Orbiter made its close approach to the Sun all ten of its instruments were operating and collecting valuable data on the Sun’s characteristics. Now that the flyby is complete Solar Orbiter scientists from ESA and NASA will spend weeks scouring over and analyzing these data and images.

During the March 26 flyby Solar Orbiter made its closest approach yet at 48 million kilometers from the Sun’s surface – less than one-third of the distance between the Sun and the Earth. Solar Orbiter crossed the orbit of Mercury on March 14 and will pass back through it on April 6 as it moves farther from the Sun again. The images of the Sun taken by Solar Orbiter will be the closest images of the solar surface ever taken and are expected to be released in a few weeks.

Solar Orbiter takes images at the Earth-Sun line

As Solar Orbiter was making its trek toward perihelion it passed a crucial point in space: the Earth-Sun line. The Earth-Sun line is the point in interplanetary space that marks the halfway point between the Sun and the Earth. As Solar Orbiter crossed this line its instruments were used to take extremely high-definition images of the Sun’s surface.

Taking images at the Earth-Sun line will allow scientists to compare data and images from Solar Orbiter with other space-based and ground-based solar telescopes. One of the mosaic images Solar Orbiter captured is the highest-resolution image of the Sun’s corona and full disk ever taken.

The image was taken in the extreme ultraviolet by Solar Orbiter’s Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument. The EUI takes images in the extreme ultraviolet at a wavelength of 17 nanometers. Imaging the Sun at this wavelength reveals the corona the Sun’s upper atmosphere.

In the image two dark “prominences” which are large bright features extending outward from the Sun’s surface can be seen at the two o’clock and eight o’clock positions on the Sun (relative to the direction of the image). These prominences are often prone to erupting ejecting massive amounts of solar material out into the solar system in events called coronal mass ejections (CME). These CMEs are what typically cause “solar storms” on Earth.

Recently one of these CMEs caused a geomagnetic storm to occur in Earth’s magnetosphere which led to the loss of approximately 40 SpaceX Starlink satellites.

The EUI was not the only instrument taking data and acquiring images of the Sun at the Earth-Sun line. The Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) instrument captured a variety of mosaic images in varying wavelengths of extreme ultraviolet light including an image of the Sun at the Lyman-beta wavelength of ultraviolet light — the first of its kind in nearly 50 years. SPICE is designed to measure the many layers of the Sun’s atmosphere all the way from the upper corona to the lower chromosphere.

SPICE imaged the Sun in wavelengths corresponding to four different temperatures each corresponding to emissions caused by a certain element in the Sun’s atmosphere: 10000°C (hydrogen) 32000°C (carbon) 320000°C (oxygen) and 630000°C (neon). For comparison each element is shown in a different color: hydrogen is shown in purple carbon in blue oxygen in green and neon in yellow.

Using SPICE’s images and other instruments and systems aboard Solar Orbiter solar physicists will be able to pinpoint the exact layers at which solar prominences erupt and trace them to their origin. Additionally SPICE will allow solar physicists to gain a better understanding of how heat rises through the Sun’s atmosphere — one of the most puzzling mysteries in heliophysics.

Generally as you move away from a heated object the amount of heat it emits decreases the farther you get from the source of the heat. In the Sun’s case its core is the source of its heat so it’s easy to assume that the Sun’s outermost atmospheric layer the corona would be cooler than the surface.

However this is not the case.

In reality the corona is around one million degrees Celsius while the surface of the Sun is only 5000°C — a startling and extremely puzzling mystery that solar physicists have been trying to solve for years. Determining the exact cause of this phenomenon is one of the key objectives of Solar Orbiter’s seven-year primary mission.

CNN —

The Solar Orbiter mission will make its closest flyby of the sun Saturday since launching in February 2020.

The spacecraft will come within 31 million miles (50 million kilometers) of the sun less than one-third the distance between the star and Earth. This will take Solar Orbiter inside the orbit of Mercury the closest planet to the sun.

The European Space Agency which jointly manages the mission with NASA will share the first images and data within a few weeks because it will take time to download and analyze everything gathered during the flyby according to ESA.

You can track Solar Orbiter’s progress using a tool developed by ESA to follow the sun explorer’s journey.

Solar Orbiter’s 10 instruments will be running simultaneously ready to measure the solar wind and keep an eye out for mini flares called campfires that researchers spied in the mission’s first images in 2020. The spacecraft also carries high-resolution telescopes.

The data collected during the flyby could help scientists unlock some of the biggest remaining solar mysteries including why and how the temperature rises through the sun’s atmosphere.

Solar Orbiter will also capture high-resolution images of the sun and record the solar wind an energized flow of particles that stream away from the sun.

“From this point onwards we are ‘entering the unknown’ as far as Solar Orbiter’s observations of the Sun are concerned” said Daniel Müller Solar Orbiter project scientist in a statement.

Stunning images

The latest images shared by Solar Orbiter provide a new perspective of the sun that captures unprecedented detail including the highest-resolution image ever taken of the sun’s outer atmosphere. The images were taken on March 7 as the spacecraft crossed directly between Earth and the sun.

The spacecraft was halfway between the two celestial bodies at a distance of about 46 million miles (74 million kilometers) from the sun.

One shot taken using the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment instrument called SPICE is the first full sun image of its kind in 50 years showcased in ultraviolet light.

Different wavelengths of light can help researchers study temperature differences between the solar surface and the sun’s corona or outer atmosphere.

The corona can reach a million degrees Celsius (1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit) while the surface is 5000 degrees Celsius (9000 degrees Fahrenheit). Solar Orbiter could help determine why the temperature seems to rise away from the sun’s core rather than drop.

This is just one of Solar Orbiter’s first close passes of the sun with many more flybys planned to bring it closer and closer to the star in the coming years. Gradually the spacecraft will raise its orientation to study the sun’s never-before-seen polar regions.

Solar Orbiter comes equipped with a multilayer heatshield a special coating called “Solar Black” made using burnt bone sliding doors that protect its instruments solar arrays that can tilt away from the worst of the heat and cooling elements inside the spacecraft. Together these keep the spacecraft from melting as it studies the sun.

Heating up

The sun is getting more active and Solar Orbiter has been watching its solar temper tantrums.

A large solar flare exploded from the sun on March 2. The eruption was rated as M-class the fourth strongest type of the five categories measuring solar flare intensity. A burst of this strength can cause brief radio blackouts at Earth’s poles and minor radiation storms that might endanger astronauts on the International Space Station according to NASA.

The Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on the Solar Orbiter captured a video of the dramatic event.

Solar flare close up

Meanwhile the Parker Solar Probe which became the first spacecraft to “touch the sun” at the end of 2021 recently experienced the extremes of a large solar prominence when the sun released tons of charged particles in Parker’s direction on February 15.

If solar flares and storms – like the impressive flare on February 15 (also captured by Solar Orbiter) or the solar storm that impacted SpaceX’s Starlink satellites in February – seem to be occurring more frequently it’s because the sun is ramping up activity as it heads toward solar maximum.

It’s important to understand the solar cycle because space weather caused by the sun – eruptions like solar flares and coronal mass ejection events – can impact the power grid satellites GPS airlines rockets and astronauts in space.

Every 11 years the sun completes a solar cycle of calm and stormy activity and begins a new one. The current solar cycle Solar Cycle 25 officially began in December 2019 and the next solar maximum when the sun is experiencing peak activity is predicted to occur in July 2025.

Over the course of a solar cycle the sun transitions from a calm period to one that is very intense and active. This activity is tracked by counting sunspots and how many are visible over time. Sunspots or dark spots on the sun are the origin point for the explosive flares and ejection events that release light solar material and energy into space.

This puts Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe in perfect position to watch as we head toward solar maximum.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9zb2xhci1vcmJpdGVyLXRha2VzLWNsb3Nlc3QtbG9vay1hdC1zdW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar Orbiter spacecraft takes its closest look at the sun,"The European Solar Orbiter spacecraft is taking the closest ever image of the sun.

The Solar Orbiter spacecraft will make its closest approach to the sun on Saturday (March 26) passing at about one third of the sun-Earth distance. And we can expect some fabulous new record-breaking images to follow soon!

The daring European mission (with contribution from NASA) will look at the sun from a distance of ""only"" 30 million miles (48.3 million km) on Saturday morning at 7:50 a.m. EDT (1150 GMT). Doing that the probe is set to break its own previous record for the closest images of the sun ever taken.

While NASA's Parker Solar Probe dives even closer toward the star within a few million miles from its surface the environment it faces is so hot that it can't carry a sun-facing camera. The job of the sun's best ever close-up photographer therefore belongs to Solar Orbiter.

On Thursday (March 24) ESA released an image taken by the spacecraft two weeks ago when it was exactly half-way between the sun and our planet (47.8 million miles or 77 million km away) heading toward the closest point in its elliptical orbit around the star the perihelion.

Since Solar Orbiter's launch in February 2020 ground control teams have been gradually tightening the spacecraft's orbit around the sun. The previous closest approaches therefore took place farther away from the sun at about half the sun-Earth distance. Future perihelions will see Solar Orbiter dive even slightly closer up to 26 million miles (42 million km) away from the sun's surface.

Solar Orbiter's ten instruments will use the Saturday close approach to take a new set of detailed images of the sun's atmosphere make measurements of its magnetic field as well as the solar wind emitted by the star as it hits the spacecraft.

Scientists are eager to see the data. Images taken during Solar Orbiter's first close approach to the sun in June 2020 revealed never before observed miniature solar flares nicknamed the campfires.

""The campfires are little relatives of the solar flares that we can observe from Earth million or billion times smaller"" David Berghmans a space physicist at the Royal Observatory of Belgium and principal investigator of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager instrument which took those images said in another ESA statement shortly after the 2020 perihelion.

Berghmans noted that the sun then in a subdued period of its 11-year cycle of activity has a lot more energy than apparent. ""The sun might look quiet at the first glance"" he added ""but when we look in detail we can see those miniature flares everywhere we look.""

The sun has since woken up and its activity has been picking up recently promising an even livelier spectacle than the 2020 photo opportunity.

On this date Solar Orbiter will be less than 1/3 the distance from the sun to Earth. That’s 29.8 million miles (48 million km) or about 1/3 of an astronomical unit (AU). It can survive this distance for an extended period of time. As Solar Orbiter reaches perihelion – its closest point to the sun – it will have all 10 instruments operating in order to provide views and data unlike anything we’ve seen before.

Solar Orbiter’s closest pass of the sun

Solar Orbiter will gather a variety of information from the sun. It will use its Extreme Ultraviolet Imager for high-resolution views. In-situ instruments will measure the solar wind as it flows past the spacecraft. Full-disk telescopes will identify dynamic activity – such as churning sunspots – on the surface. The narrow-angle imager will mark these locations for follow-up observations.

Because the instruments are fixed on the spacecraft Solar Orbiter looks for targets using its wide-angle cameras to identify locations for future observations with its narrow-angle instruments. On the ground teams in Germany and Spain coordinate the observing targets of interest.

Solar Orbiter vs Parker Solar Probe

Another solar instrument the Parker Solar Probe is also orbiting and studying the sun. This spacecraft holds the record for closest approach to the sun. While Solar Orbiter’s perihelion will take it inside the orbit of Mercury Parker Solar Probe will eventually pass within 3.8 million miles (6.2 million kilometers) of the sun’s surface. But Solar Orbiter holds a larger suite of instruments in its mission to understand the sun.

Stay tuned to find out what exciting discoveries Solar Orbiter makes at the sun during its perihelion passage!

In the meantime enjoy this image of the sun that Solar Orbiter took on March 7 2022 when it was at 0.5 AU. See how far you can scroll in on stunning solar features.

Farm Machinery Corporation Limited (FMCL) has converted acres of fallow lands in Nyelsiphu of Dopshari Paro and established it into a biggest mega farm.

Although FMCL proposed cultivating 10 acres of land it demarcated only four acres for cultivation now.

According to FMCL officials the farm is equipped with modern facilities to set a model farming in the country with about seven mega greenhouses with semi-automated irrigation facilities. It will also have mixed fruit orchard and hydroponic technology.

FMCL’s deputy general manager of the service department Jitshen Wangchuk said the mega farm will be a demonstration site for farming enthusiasts and youths to take up agriculture as their enterprise.









He said that although individuals and private entities are taking commercial farms there are not many practising in greenhouses. “FMCL felt the need for megastructures for better crop cultivation and production having ventured into commercial farming for the past five years.”

Apart from hiring services FMCL is mandated to venture into commercial farming to support the transitioning from commercial to subsistence farming and increase food production and productivity to achieve self-sufficiency.

Jitshen Wangchuk said although FMCL’s head office is based in Paro there was no mega farm in the dzongkhag.

Unlike other commercial FMCL farms he said that the mega farm at Paro will operate with smart irrigation system and it has installed FMCL’s design and fabricated greenhouse.









He said that considering the significant crop import from neighbouring countries the farms would grow small chillies and tomatoes in summer and crops such as cauliflower and broccoli during winter as Paro does not grow these vegetables in winter. “The farm will initially try to supplement the two vegetables in Paro.”

Moreover FMCL has also proposed the construction of a 32 mega greenhouse (24m x100m) to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forest to install at Zomlingthang Samdrupjongkhar Gantokha and Lhamoizingkha to grow tomatoes throughout the year.

As of today there are nine commercial farms with 786 acres.









FMCL’s initiatives during the lockdowns

FMCL was engaged in school feeding programmes since the announcement of the lockdown. The corporation had supplied vegetables to four schools in Paro functioning under containment mode for a month.

According to Jitchen Wangchuk FMCL supplied potatoes and tomatoes from its farm in Trongsa and Bajo.

He said that FMCL delivered around 4300 kilogrammes of vegetables to the schools adding that most products were local farm produce.

The team also provided hiring services for ploughing and nursery preparation for paddy cultivation to six upper gewogs of Paro recently during the lockdown. FMCL deployed farm machinery to more than 200 households covering 200 acres during the lockdown.

He said that hiring services were coordinated with approval from the dzongkhag task force committee with a standard operating procedure.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ford is partnering with Argo AI which specializes in the research and development of autonomous vehicles. This partnership helps Ford get head to head with competitors like Tesla & Google’s parent company Alphabet which also has a separate self-driving division called Waymo.

The manufacturer also mentioned that they plan to become the mainstream provider of Electrical Vehicles by 2026.

Can Ford become the mainstream EV & Self-driving Car Company?

Economic car builders like Ford have the resources to build and deliver vehicles in mass quantities compared to companies like Tesla which are behind on orders. Once everything is in place economical car manufacturers can lower the cost of production and deliver cars faster than Tesla.

Is Tesla Really An EV Company or Battery Company?

Currently whenever people think of Electrical vehicles Tesla comes to mind but when other companies like Ford Nissan and Toyota come out with their Electrical vehicles it will be hard for Tesla to compete because it simply doesn’t have the resources to do so however Tesla’s supercharging stations around the country is something marvelous that non-EV drivers underappreciated. Tesla has better chances with focusing on creating a grid of charging stations that can service all Electrical vehicles.

Who Will Win The War Of Becoming Best Self Driving Car Company?

Obviously most people will say Tesla but not really. While tesla is first to market they are not going to win this battle in long term. There will be two sides to this battle. The first side is who are you really going to trust to have the most data in order for the car to self-drive? More than likely the contenders are going to be Google and Apple which have massive data to help AI make better decisions about roads conditions traffic and how people behave. The second side is the manufacturing of cars in mass quantities This is only going to happen with giants like Ford Toyota Nissan who already have logistics in place.

It’s worth remembering that in 1965 most of the cars on the road didn’t have power steering in fact some people had never even driven a car with power steering. With this in mind you can only imagine how futuristic the “Wrist Twist” system must have seemed to the American public.

The car that the experimental controls are fitted to is a 1965 Mercury Park Lane convertible it’s powered by a 400+ cubic inch V8 (~7.0 liters) and it tips the scales at approximately 4211 lbs or 1910 kgs.

The Park Lane convertible is 215 inches (5.4 meters) long and 81.1 inches (2 meters) wide. Given the sheer physical size and weight of the car it’s no surprise that engineers were looking at ways of making the vehicle controls as easy as possible to use.

The “Wrist Twist” system consisted of two small dials essentially small steering wheels with one for each hand. Due to the different ergonomics the driver had arm rests on either side that they rested their arms on while using the dials to control the vehicle.

Ultimately the “Wrist Twist” never caught on and was never put into production. It’s one of many new steering systems that have been experimented with over the years only for the traditional steering wheel to win out in the end.

Perhaps the one exception to this is the Tesla Steering Yoke an aircraft yoke-like steering device being fitted to many modern production Teslas and it’s said to be the only steering system on offer in the upcoming Tesla Cybertruck slated for 2023 production.

Modi with Hinnrichs

The reason why this interested me is in 2011 when I was still in Gandhinagar Narendra Modi as Gujarat chief minister had ensured in his effort of one up-manship that Ford set up a plant in Gujarat. Part of his effort to prove it to one and all that it is he who has made Gujarat No 1 business destination in India Modi shook hands with Joe Hinrichs Ford Asia Pacific and Africa President. An MoU was signed.

Addressing media Hinrichs said the first vehicle and engine were expected to come off the assembly line in early 2014 praising ""the pro-business environment the available infrastructure facilities and access to ports"" in Gujarat. True to his known ways of creating a hype Modi tweeted : ""Gujarat is proud to host the biggest facility of Ford outside America worth $1 billion which will provide a total of 36000 jobs.""

Last car being rolled out of Ford's Sanand plant

The Sanand plant of Ford is all set to finally shut the shop within a few days from now. The giant MNC announced early last year its decision to stop car production by December-end with the engine plant continuing to operate for three more months in order to ""fulfil"" all the order commitments before winding up the plant operations completely.

Ford's Somerville plant

In September 2021 the last car rolled out of the Ford manufacturing unit which produced three models -- Figo Aspire and Freestyle. These cars were created to challenge the dominance of Maruti Swift and Dzire but failed to put up a fight to Maruti in sales. Ford became the second automobile giant to leave Gujarat -- first one was General Motors which closed down its unit near Vadodara in Halol in 2017.

The shutdown has come after Tata Motors stopping the production of the much hyped Nano -- dubbed as the world's cheapest car. The cause first major confrontation between Modi and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee (Ratan Tata on being handed over land in Sanand in 2008 called Modi ""good M"" and Mamata ""bad M"") the car attracted fewer and fewer buyers every year and in a decade stopped producing in altogether in 2019.

It's a different matter that in the US I have found that it is considered absolutely normal for a business to wind up. In fact it is considered a capitalist's right to wind up a unit -- a pattern now sought to be followed in India too without earlier pretensions.

Quite like in Sanand in Somerville too a photograph of the last car rolled off the assembly line at the Ford plant was released -- wherein plant manager EJ Duquette in shaking hands with the driver who took the vehicle a station wagon off the line.

--- *Editor Counterview

Currently ""holidaying"" in Somerville five km from Boston one of the most high profile cities of the United States the other day I decided to take a stroll up and down the busy hillock where I stay. Just next to the main road a two minutes walk crossing the road and reaching in a small open space I found a few round shaped boards in yellow. All of them described about what Somerville was and is -- of course in a nutshell.One of the boards particularly attracted me -- and as a journalist who was based in Gandhinagar the Gujarat capital I could connect with it directly. The round yellow board talked of how Ford one of the largest car manufacturers had an assembly line at Somerville's Assembly Square just two miles away from where I live.Titled ""Assembling Cars at Assembly Square"" this is what is written on the tin board ""One result of the boom times after World War II: for the first time many American families had the cash to own a car. Ford Motor Company responded by converting a plant that had produced 20000 army universal carriers during the war into a huge new auto factory.""It continues: ""In 1948 alone the plant transformed 500000 tons of iron into 75000 cars -- enough to stretch bumper-to-bumper from Somerville to Miami. In 1957 after turning out 400 of the famously unpopular Ford Edsels the plant closed for good.""It was declared that following Tata Motors which shifted its Nano plant from Nandigram I West Bengal on being offered a hefty concession the US MNC Ford Motors would set up a car manufacturing unit at Sanand at a cost of about Rs.4000 crore on 460 acres land -- the second in the country after its Chennai plant with the capacity to roll out 2.40 lakh cars and 2.70 lakh engines annually creating about 5000 jobs.Even before the new Ford factory became fully functional it attracted so much of attention that US Secretary of State John Kerry during his high-profile visit for attending the Vibrant Gujarat business meet went all the way to Sanand to address workers at the plant on January 12 2015. However the Modi-Ford bonhomie lasted for just about a decade when Ford declared it would close its operations in Gujarat.Different reports estimated Ford had invested anywhere between Rs 4000 to 6000 crore at its Sanand plant but its accumulated operating losses of around US$ 2 billion in India in about a decade. The decision to shut down the shop rendered jobless about 3000 workers -- 2000 of them permanent -- in sharp contrast to the Modi tweet which claimed the unit would employ 36000 workers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGV0cm9pdGJ1cmVhdS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy90aGUtcmVhcnZpZXctbWlycm9yLXRoZS0xOTQwcy10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRoYXQtdW5kZXJwaW5zLXlvdXItY2FyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Rearview Mirror: The 1940s Technology That Underpins Your Car,"The Rearview Mirror: The 1940s Technology That Underpins Your Car While Chevrolet never built the Cadet after World War II its suspension is still in use by automakers worldwide.

Earle MacPherson’s U.S. patent drawing for his strut suspension.

Most of the major components in an automobile date back decades or even more than a century. The first internal combustion engine dates to 1860. The manual transmission is nearly as old. The first automatic transmission came to market in 1939.

And given that until the 1970s most cars didn’t have a MacPherson strut suspension you’d expect it to be a relatively recent innovation but you’d be wrong. If fact its genesis dates to World War II and was perfected shortly thereafter.

This week in 1947 Earle Steel MacPherson filed a patent for his new vehicle suspension system now known as the MacPherson strut suspension.

A lifetime auto industry engineer

Earle MacPherson was working for Chalmers Motor Car Corp. when this 1917 Chalmers 6-30 was built. Photo Credit: RM Auctions.

MacPherson’s career in the automotive industry started after graduation from the University of Illinois in 1915 when he joined Detroit-based Chalmers Motor Car Co. one of America’s more popular cars at the time. After serving in the U.S. Army during World War I working on aircraft engines he returned to Detroit. But MacPherson didn’t rejoin Chalmers.

Instead he landed at the Liberty Motor Car Co. founded in 1916 whose vice president James Bourquin came from Chalmers. The Liberty is an assembled car using Continental engines rather than proprietary ones. Despite some success the company begins to falter once they moved to a larger factory. MacPherson left in 1922 just as the company began sliding into receivership.

He joined Huppmobile where he remained until 1934 when struggles among Hupp shareholders led him to General Motors’ central engineering office eventually becoming Chevrolet’s chief design engineer.

A novel postwar sedan

The Chevrolet Cadet’s MacPherson strut suspension handled batter than a contemporary Cadillac above.

During World War II automakers were thinking about the postwar market. Their only guidance came from World War I which saw a sudden deep recession hit severely affecting car sales. Chevrolet managers were concerned an economy car might be needed. GM’s chairman Alfred P. Sloan disagreed saying the postwar economy would bring prosperity. But he let the project proceed.

Known as the Light Car the four-door sedan was targeted to have a weight of 2200 pounds. To reach that goal MacPherson called for a 108-inch wheelbase 8 inches less than contemporary Chevrolets. Since it didn’t weigh much it wouldn’t need a big engine. So a 2.1-liter inline 6 was specified producing 61 horsepower which was more than adequate for the time.

Beyond minimizing unsprung weight MacPherson wanted to make the car as roomy as possible. So MacPherson took a hard look at the car’s suspension.

A radical approach to a traditional problem

Cars initially inherited their leaf spring suspensions from 19th Century horse carriages. While they had advanced from there the MacPherson strut suspension proved novel.

A MacPherson strut supension patent drawing.

The strut itself is a combination of spring and shock absorber. The bottom part of the strut links to the wheel hub while upper part of the strut mounts to the body eliminating the need for an upper control arm. A lower control arm links the bottom of the wheel hub to the body.

By eliminating the upper control arm and mating the shock that rides between the upper and lower control arms to an external spring it frees up space for a front-wheel driveshaft. (This is why so many front-wheel and all-wheel drive cars use them more than seven decades later.) But the strut needed to mount to the body requiring MacPherson to use unibody construction at a time when few if any cars used it.

With fewer parts than traditional suspensions the new suspension weighed and cost less yet proved stable and easy to adjust. It was also narrower and more compact than traditional suspensions which freed up cabin space. For Chevrolet’s Light Car now called the Cadet it was used at all four corners.

When the new car underwent tests at GM’s Milford Proving Grounds its handling wasn’t only better than a Chevrolet it was better than a Cadillac.

What killed the Cadet?

The MacPherson strut would finally be used not by GM but by Ford of Europe in the Consul and Zephyr.

As is often the case great engineering often runs afoul of accounting and so it was with the Chevrolet Cadet.

General Motors wanted to sell the Cadet for $1000 or less. But even at $1000 the company would have to manufacture 300000 units to be profitable. GM engineering vice president James M. Crawford insisted that the Cadet’s engineering be simplified and cheapened and the project was postponed in 1946 before being killed the following year. Alfred Sloan had proven prescient; postwar prosperity and booming vehicle sales negated the need for an economy car.

MacPherson jumped ship and went to Ford Motor Co. and filed a patent application for the new suspension filing a refined version two years later.

In the end his suspension would debut on the 1949 Ford Vedette in France followed by the Ford Consul and Zephyr in England. It wouldn’t appear on a General Motors car until the 1980 Chevrolet Citation when General Motors relearned the lessons it first pioneered then rejected 34 years earlier.

MacPherson would retire from Ford Motor Co. as engineering vice president dying in Detroit in 1960 at the age of 69 years old."

'Chris Wallace's Fox News Sunday was fourth in a four-horse race and never got out of 4th place throughout his entire 18 years of hosting the show. He was the only anchor at Fox not to helm a number one show' one insider said.

‘This story really isn’t surprising. What’s shocking is it took Chris 18 years to leave but I suppose when you’re earning millions upon millions of dollars every year you’re happy to stay and amass great wealth and a personal fortune that his viewers could only ever dream of.’

Wallace 74 jumped ship from the right-wing network last year to host a new show on left-leaning CNN's new streaming service which begins Tuesday.

Fox officials have declined to comment on Wallace's decision to stick the knife into his former employer who are believed to have paid him around $7 million a year.

However a network insider said: ‘Clearly he’s launching a new show so he needs eyeballs and bashing Fox is an easy way to try and get viewers to find him at his new home.'

‘Also what a way to start - let’s announce you’re happy not to throw to Wolf Blitzer. Take note CNN your new hire will only ever by loyal to himself and not the company that is sending a Brinks truck full of cash to his personal bank.’

Veteran news anchor Chris Wallace has revealed he quit Fox News for CNN+ because he felt uncomfortable with the conservative network's coverage of the 2020 election results and Tucker Carlson's blatant attempts to downplay the January 6 riot

Speaking to the New York Times on Sunday Wallace also revealed he'd spent much of last year looking for a new job before being poached by CNN last December.

Wallace said: 'I just no longer felt comfortable with the programming at Fox.

'I’m fine with opinion: conservative opinion liberal opinion.'

'But when people start to question the truth — Who won the 2020 election? Was January 6 an insurrection? — I found that unsustainable.'

Wallace confirmed rumors that he had complained to his former bosses at Fox about Tucker Carlson's documentary about the Capitol riots Patriot Purge.

He and others were upset over Carlson's suggestion that the riots were actually a false-flag attack set-up to make conservatives look bad.

Wallace explained: 'Before I found it was an environment in which I could do my job and feel good about my involvement at Fox.

'And since November of 2020 that just became unsustainable increasingly unsustainable as time went on.'

He continued: 'Some people might have drawn the line earlier or at a different point.

Wallace often seen as a somewhat objective anchor amid Fox's endorsement of claims that the 2020 election was rigged confirmed reports that he had complained to executives about Carlson's Patriot Purge documentary

'I think Fox has changed over the course of the last year and a half. But I can certainly understand where somebody would say ""Gee you were a slow learner Chris.""'

But a Fox News insider has taken issue with Wallace's comments to The Times and highlighted an interview he gave to the Financial Times last November in which he hailed the network.

Wallace will now host a Monday to Thursday interview show on CNN+ which begins streaming on Tuesday. The streaming service costs $6-a-month.

Wallace who has been married to cookbook author Lorraine Martin Smothers since 1997 was long seen as one of Fox News' more objective stars who was equally happy to condemn both conservative and liberal lawmakers.

His new show - 'Who's Talking to Chris Wallace?' - starts Tuesday. Trying to break apart from his decades-old political anchor persona Wallace has welcomed an array of artists and business guests such as singer Judy Collins and Disney's former CEO Bob Iger.

Wallace often seen as a somewhat objective anchor amid Fox's endorsement of claims that the 2020 election was rigged confirmed reports that he had complained to executives about Carlson's Patriot Purge documentary.

According to a report from NPR last year senior FOX News figures Bret Baier and Wallace raised their objections to the three-part documentary series to FOX News Media CEO Suzanne Scott and president of the network's news division Jay Wallace.

Their complaints about the show's dubious claims eventually made their way up to Lachlan Murdoch the chairman and CEO of FOX Corporation.

But network executives still allowed Carlson's series accusing Biden of setting up the January 6 riots in order to 'conduct an ideological purge and persecute conservatives' to air - even as some FOX News hosts debunked its claims.

'I spent a lot of 2021 looking to see if there was a different place for me to do my job' Wallace told the Times.

Wallace announced he was leaving Fox last year during his weekly show Fox News Sunday

Wallace announced he was leaving Fox last year during his weekly show Fox News Sunday.

'After 18 years this is my final Fox News Sunday. It is the last time and I say this with real sadness we will meet like this. Eighteen years ago the bosses here at Fox promised they would never interfere with a guest I booked or a question I asked. And they kept that promise' Wallace said on December 12.

In January Wallace 74 joined CNN+ CNN's new premium streaming service available for $6 a month.

Fox went on to fire an editor who help project Trump's Arizona loss and promote Carlson with that decision also irritating Wallace.

But what made Wallace take the final decision to leave Fox was the opportunity to explore venues other than politics.

'I wanted to get out of politics' Wallace said. 'Doing a Sunday show on the incremental change from week to week in the Build Back Better plan began to lose its attraction.'

On 'Who's talking to Chris Wallace?' Wallace interviews 'Star Trek' actor William Shatner talks with former Disney CEO Bob Iger about meeting the pope and even sings with Judy Collins.

'I don't have to say you know ''Wolf Blitzer starts right now at 6:59:59''' he said.

Wallace said he was eager 'to have the kind of intimate thoughtful conversation where we forget we're on camera in a studio.'

The veteran reporter had been surrounded by journalistic influences from an early age. His parents had divorced when he was young and his mother remarried CBS News President Bill Leonard

The celebrated anchor whose father Mike Wallace had a historic four-decade run with CBS News' 60 Minutes had signed a four-year contract with Fox News in 2017.

That contract expired in 2021.

In 2017 Wallace had revealed Rupert Murdoch personally asked him to stay on through the 2020 election.

'I am honored by his confidence and excited to keep reporting as part of the FOX News team' Wallace said in a press release announcing his last contract.

In December NPR reported that Wallace along with fellow anchor Bret Baier took issue with the network over Tucker Carlson's series on streaming service Fox Nation covering the January 6 Capitol riot.

In his three-part 'false flag' series Carlson tries to paint the hundreds of Trump supporters who descended on the Capitol on January 6 as 'patriots' fighting for their country - while also positing that the riots were set up by the left to provide an excuse for arresting conservatives.

Wallace had also been a target of frequent attacks by Trump himself particularly since the chaotic 2020 presidential debate during which an exasperated Wallace tried desperately to stick to the issues at hand while candidate Joe Biden and Trump were hurling verbal attacks at one another.

In June Trump called in to Sean Hannity's Fox show and accused Wallace of trying to 'protect' Biden from questions about his son Hunter.

'Chris Wallace protected him because he couldn't answer the question. So Chris Wallace protected him good old Chris Wallace. He'll never be Mike' Trump said invoking Wallace's late father.

'We no longer have a free and fair press.'

Wallace defended himself against Trump's many personal and professional attacks in an interview with Deadline in February 2020.

While he maintained he didn't 'do anything wrong' and claimed Trump 'fails to understand what Fox News is all about' the anchor conceded it did affect him.

'On some basic level I suppose it hurts your feelings a little bit to have the president of the United States whoever he or she is attacking you' Wallace said at the time before adding that it began to hurt less because he was growing 'used to it.'

When Trump sat down for an interview with Wallace in July 2020 the journalist pushed back on several of the then-president's claims including the fact that the cognitive test he was given truly gave any indication of intellect and confronted him about the rising number of coronavirus deaths in the country.

The veteran reporter had been surrounded by journalistic influences from an early age. His parents had divorced when he was young and his mother remarried CBS News President Bill Leonard.

Upon graduating university Wallace chose to take a job at the Boston Globe over a seat at Yale Law School.

His national news career began at NBC in 1975 where his 14-year tenure included a joint interview with Ronald and Nancy Reagan at Camp David.

Wallace then spent 14 years at ABC News before joining Fox in 2003.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWVpbWVpZm94LzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvNi1icmFuZHMtZG9taW5hdGluZy10aGUtZXhwbG9zaXZlLWZ1bmN0aW9uYWwtYmV2ZXJhZ2VzLW1hcmtldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Brands Dominating The Explosive Functional Beverages Market,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/meimeifox/2022/03/26/6-brands-dominating-the-explosive-functional-beverages-market/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWVpbWVpZm94LzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvNi1icmFuZHMtZG9taW5hdGluZy10aGUtZXhwbG9zaXZlLWZ1bmN0aW9uYWwtYmV2ZXJhZ2VzLW1hcmtldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZm94Mm5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy90cnVlLWNyaW1lL2EtMjAwMi1zdC1sb3Vpcy1hcmVhLXNsZWVwb3Zlci1lbmRzLXdpdGgta2lkbmFwcGluZy1tdXJkZXIv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3gybm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RydWUtY3JpbWUvYS0yMDAyLXN0LWxvdWlzLWFyZWEtc2xlZXBvdmVyLWVuZHMtd2l0aC1raWRuYXBwaW5nLW11cmRlci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A 2002 St. Louis area sleepover ends with kidnapping murder,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox2now.com/news/true-crime/a-2002-st-louis-area-sleepover-ends-with-kidnapping-murder/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZm94Mm5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy90cnVlLWNyaW1lL2EtMjAwMi1zdC1sb3Vpcy1hcmVhLXNsZWVwb3Zlci1lbmRzLXdpdGgta2lkbmFwcGluZy1tdXJkZXIv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3gybm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RydWUtY3JpbWUvYS0yMDAyLXN0LWxvdWlzLWFyZWEtc2xlZXBvdmVyLWVuZHMtd2l0aC1raWRuYXBwaW5nLW11cmRlci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g0My5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL2ZveDQzLXJldmVhbHMvbG9jYWwtZm9vZC1wcm9jZXNzb3Itd2F0ZXItcG9sbHV0aW9uLXZpb2xhdGlvbnMtZm94NDMtcmV2ZWFscy81MjEtODYyNWRhZjAtYmY0ZC00NTNjLWJhYmItNzQyYTc2NjZjOWE10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Food processing plant accused of polluting local waterways,"Hanover Foods Corporation is accused of discharging unsafe levels of pollutants from its wastewater treatment facility in Hanover York County.

YORK COUNTY Pa. — A York County food processor is under scrutiny by state and federal environmental agencies. Hanover Foods Corporation is accused of discharging unsafe levels of pollutants from its wastewater treatment facility in Hanover York County.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued an Administrative Order on Consent against the company to identify a cause and fix the problem.

Records indicate that the company may have been aware of the alleged violations. FOX43 Reveals how it was reportedly polluting local waterways for years.

Oil Creek in York County is a water source for livestock occasionally used for irrigation by nearby farmers and runs through several communities. However the waterway may have been quietly polluted hundreds of times over the years. Hanover Foods Corporation is accused of dumping wastewater that was not properly treated into the creek.

“It’s affecting water quality in Oil Creek downstream Codorus Creek and ultimately the Susquehanna River” said Ted Evgeniadis executive director of the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association.

Evgeniadis noticed pollution from an outfall into the creek and filed a lawsuit against the company to address the problem. The Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association is represented by the Environmental Integrity Project and the lawsuit contains hundreds of pages of documents outlining potential water pollution violations.

“I was in the creek. You can see algae and scum on the rocks. You can see suspended solids. I actually saw a rainbow trout that seemed to have some discoloration going on so there was presence of pollution there at the site” Evgeniadis said.

FOX43 Reveals that between May 2016 and June 2021 Hanover Foods discharged unsafe levels of contaminants into the creek—at times 1456% higher than what the company's permit allows. Records show the company’s wastewater treatment facility discharged high levels of ammonia-nitrogen total suspended solids and fecal coliform. Evgeniadis said water quality in Oil Creek is degrading downstream.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is taking legal action to require Hanover Foods to conduct a study to determine the cause and identify ways to correct these alleged water pollution violations.

“The number of alleged violations observed during inspections is appalling” said EPA Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Adam Ortiz. “The company needs to identify why this occurred and present a plan to fix this so that the local waters that eventually feed into the Chesapeake Bay are protected.”

During inspections at the wastewater treatment facility the agency noted a digester—which breaks down food waste—had been “operating under less-than optimal conditions.” EPA inspectors also noted several warning lights that would have alerted the company to potentially failing UV lamps.

FOX43 Reveals made repeated calls to Hanover Foods. None of our messages were returned.

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has brought several enforcement actions over the years against Hanover Foods for similar violations. The company has until April 5 to submit an engineering evaluation to the EPA and present a corrective action plan to address the issue.

The Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association and Hanover Foods filed a joint motion to stay the litigation pending the release of the corrective action plan.

“There is in fact a lot of pollution coming out of this plant and we’re going to make sure that they are held accountable to fix it” Evgeniaidis asserted."

YORK COUNTY Pa. — A York County food processor is under scrutiny by state and federal environmental agencies. Hanover Foods Corporation is accused of discharging unsafe levels of pollutants from its wastewater treatment facility in Hanover York County.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued an Administrative Order on Consent against the company to identify a cause and fix the problem.

Records indicate that the company may have been aware of the alleged violations. FOX43 Reveals how it was reportedly polluting local waterways for years.

Oil Creek in York County is a water source for livestock occasionally used for irrigation by nearby farmers and runs through several communities. However the waterway may have been quietly polluted hundreds of times over the years. Hanover Foods Corporation is accused of dumping wastewater that was not properly treated into the creek.

“It’s affecting water quality in Oil Creek downstream Codorus Creek and ultimately the Susquehanna River” said Ted Evgeniadis executive director of the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association.

Evgeniadis noticed pollution from an outfall into the creek and filed a lawsuit against the company to address the problem. The Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association is represented by the Environmental Integrity Project and the lawsuit contains hundreds of pages of documents outlining potential water pollution violations.

“I was in the creek. You can see algae and scum on the rocks. You can see suspended solids. I actually saw a rainbow trout that seemed to have some discoloration going on so there was presence of pollution there at the site” Evgeniadis said.

FOX43 Reveals that between May 2016 and June 2021 Hanover Foods discharged unsafe levels of contaminants into the creek—at times 1456% higher than what the company's permit allows. Records show the company’s wastewater treatment facility discharged high levels of ammonia-nitrogen total suspended solids and fecal coliform. Evgeniadis said water quality in Oil Creek is degrading downstream.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is taking legal action to require Hanover Foods to conduct a study to determine the cause and identify ways to correct these alleged water pollution violations.

“The number of alleged violations observed during inspections is appalling” said EPA Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Adam Ortiz. “The company needs to identify why this occurred and present a plan to fix this so that the local waters that eventually feed into the Chesapeake Bay are protected.”

During inspections at the wastewater treatment facility the agency noted a digester—which breaks down food waste—had been “operating under less-than optimal conditions.” EPA inspectors also noted several warning lights that would have alerted the company to potentially failing UV lamps.

FOX43 Reveals made repeated calls to Hanover Foods. None of our messages were returned.

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has brought several enforcement actions over the years against Hanover Foods for similar violations. The company has until April 5 to submit an engineering evaluation to the EPA and present a corrective action plan to address the issue.

The Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association and Hanover Foods filed a joint motion to stay the litigation pending the release of the corrective action plan.

“There is in fact a lot of pollution coming out of this plant and we’re going to make sure that they are held accountable to fix it” Evgeniaidis asserted."

The BRIC Promise

Bloomberg









When Jim O’Neill devised the BRIC acronym at the turn of the century the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief economist did not intend the catchy phrase to be exploited for marketing investment funds Money managers scrambled to start funds anyway. The likes of Schroders Plc and Franklin Templeton -- along with Goldman Sachs Asset Management -- gobbled up billions of dollars from clients looking to profit by combining investments in Brazil Russia India and China. That marketing ploy has come crashing down and now faces an existential crisis.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made the former uninvestable with MSCI Inc. removing it from benchmarks including the BRIC Index. China which represents a major slice of this benchmark is also slowing and has embarked on an unprecedented crackdown on technology companies that has led to sharp losses.BRIC funds have lost 14.6% this year while their combined assets have slumped by more than 90% from their peak to about $3 billion according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The collapse holds a ruthless lesson for investors on the perils of thematic funds. Combining four diverse complex and risky emerging market countries in a fund was clever wordplay but not a smart bet. While the economies grew rapidly as predicted by O’Neill stocks had mixed fortunes. The MSCI BRIC index now trails the S&P 500 over this century and even lags behind the total returns for individual indexes for the four countries.“Do not confuse the BRIC concepts” O’Neill said in an interview. “My whole purpose of creating the acronym has nothing to do with investment.”Russia’s war has of course wider consequences. The ongoing devastation on the ground in Ukraine has triggered market volatility globally. Commodity prices have surged in response to sanctions imposed by Western countries to isolate the country. That has sparked inflationary fears for big commodity and energy consumers and importers such as India and China.The market turmoil has even hurt hedge funds that are designed to prosper in both rising and falling markets with money managers such as Autonomy Capital Research H2O Asset Management and EDL Global Opportunities facing double-digit slumps. Many have been forced to mark Russian bets to zero.O’Neill’s paper “Building Better Global Economic BRICs” was published on Nov. 30 2001 and focused on how the global economy would be driven by the growth of emerging markets in the following decades. He argued that policymaking forums such as the Group of Seven should be re-organized to incorporate BRIC representatives. Fund managers took notice. Two of the largest surviving funds Schroder International Selection Fund - BRIC and Templeton BRIC Fund  started in 2005 while Goldman Sachs launched its own fund the next year. The Schroder fund grew to more than $4 billion while Templeton’s money pool amassed $3.3 billion by 2010.But the second decade of the century started to take shine off and now they’ve reached a calamity. The Schroder fund which was managing $710 million at the end of February has declined almost 16% this year according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Templeton’s $450 million fund has slipped more than 14% after it marked Russian American depository receipts to zero when Russia’s markets closed according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Goldman Sachs meanwhile closed its money-losing BRIC fund in 2015 and merged it with a broader emerging-market fund joining a string of others to take similar decisions. Bloomberg tracks only 74 surviving BRIC funds now. The same number have shuttered over the years while dozens have been acquired or delisted Bloomberg data shows.BRIC funds’ long-term performance pales in comparison to U.S. stocks which were powered by quantitative easing and the surge in technology stocks over the past decade or so.But to Chetan Sehgal portfolio manager of Templeton BRIC Fund the grouping still offers long-term value even without Russia. Resource- and energy-rich Brazil could benefit from an ex-Russia world he said. “Though China has slowed down its path will very much depend on how it navigates the external environment as many of the internal reforms have already been enacted” he added.To others though the concept has lost its charm. Ed Park the chief investment officer at U.K. wealth manager Brooks Macdonald said Russia is uninvestable Brazil has lots of political risk and his firm can get exposure to China outside BRIC funds. “I don’t see us investing in BRIC as a concept in the medium term” he said. “The economic drivers of the constituents are not as correlated as when the term was coined and some of the countries we would choose to actively avoid.”As for O’Neill he stands by the idea that these economies are growing in size and influence. “Despite the problems that Brazil and Russia have because of the enormous success of China if you look at where they all are together it is still feasible that by the mid 2030s the BRICs could be bigger than the G6” he said.Still he said he’s never invested in a BRIC fund and never will.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9xdWVlbi1vZi1wb3AtYmVjb21lcy1hLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1tYXRlcmlhbC1naXJsLW1hZG9ubmEtYnV5cy1ib3JlZC1hcGUtZm9yLTU2NGsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Queen of Pop Becomes a Metaverse Material Girl — Madonna Buys Bored Ape for $564K – Bitcoin News,,,,,,,,,,

However you might not be a big fan of your watch's standard face. Perhaps you prefer an analog display over digital you want to see more health data at a glance or you think the default face looks too cluttered.

Thankfully changing your watch's face is quite a straightforward process and depending on which watch you own you might have a lot more options to explore than you'd expect.

Pick a different standard face

In most cases you can choose a different look for your Garmin through the watch's own menus without delving into the Garmin Connect app on your phone. If your watch has the typical five-button setup hold the 'Up' button on the left-hand side then select the 'Watch face' option and you'll be able to scroll through a variety of options.

If your watch has two buttons (like the Garmin Venu 2) hold the bottom button to access the menu and if you have a Garmin Lily tap the menu button at the bottom of the touchscreen then select the watch face icon.

If your watch has a color screen – either memory-in-pixel like the Garmin Fenix 7 or OLED like the Garmin Epix (Gen 2) – you'll also be able to pick a color option. In our tests we preferred blue or green digits for watches like the Fenix 7 as the blue backlight tends to make other hues look muddy.

If you have a monochrome watch (like the Garmin Instinct or Instinct 2) you'll be able to pick from standard and inverted watch faces the latter of which have white characters on a black background.

Download a custom face

If you're not a fan of any of the standard faces you can download something different through Garmin Connect IQ. Not all watches support Connect IQ (the first-gen Garmin Instinct and the Garmin Lily aren't compatible for example) but the vast majority of modern ones do.

Install Garmin Connect IQ on your phone (it's a separate app to Garmin Connect) then select the watch you're using. Tap the search icon at the bottom then select the 'Watch Faces' option at the top to see the ones that are compatible with your device.

You'll notice that most faces are free but some developers charge a small fee. If you choose one of these you'll need to make a payment in order to receive an activation code that will unlock the face. The developer's description will explain how to make the payment. It might sound like a strange system if you're used to the effortlessness of Apple's App Store or Google Play but we've used it – it works.

Make your own face

There are two ways to make your own Garmin watch face. The first is somewhat tricky and requires some knowledge of coding using Garmin's proprietary language Monkey C. You can also try the Watch Face Builder app available through Garmin Connect IQ which simplifies things.

Alternatively if you have a watch with a color MiP or OLED screen you can use Garmin's Face It tool to create something personal using a favorite photo as a background. If you have a compatible watch you'll see a Face It link at the bottom of the interface in Garmin Connect IQ.

(Image credit: Future)

First pick a photo. Something simple will work best; if you choose something too detailed your health stats could be hard to read. Next you'll be able to choose which snippets of data are shown on the face and whether you want to see the time in analog or digital format.

Once that's done you can pick a highlight color for the digits or the watch hands depending on what type of face you've chosen. Finally you can tweak the font or the thickness and style of the hands. When you're satisfied tap 'Done' and you'll be able to transfer your custom design to your watch.

Transferring the face can take quite a long time particularly if your watch has a high-res OLED screen but have patience and it'll finish eventually.

Get creative with data fields

Of course all of these options only change the face that you see when you're not actively tracking a workout – if you want to see a different selection of stats while you're training you need to check out custom fields. These are essentially plug-ins for your watch's activity tracking tools which allow you to see different information at a glance. For example if you're into interval training on an indoor bike you might want something that shows your current heart rate zone at a glance.

Again you can find loads of options in Garmin Connect IQ. Just tap the search button then scroll to the right until you see 'Data fields' to view the ones that are available for your watch. Although many developers appreciate a donation if you enjoy using their data fields they are all free to download and use.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyc3BhY2UtYWZyaWNhLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzI4L2dhcm1pbi1hbm5vdW5jZXMtbmV3LWQyLW1hY2gtMS1hdmlhdG9yLXNtYXJ0d2F0Y2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin announces new D2 Mach 1 Aviator Smartwatch,"Garmin today announced the D2™ Mach 1 GPS aviator smartwatch with classic pilot watch styling and a bright AMOLED touchscreen display that offers advanced tools for flying – plus health and fitness features – to help pilots and aviation enthusiasts accelerate their adventures.

Design display and battery life

Design

Both have reinforced resin case

Fenix 7 has brushed metal bezel and lugs

Fenix 7 available in three sizes Instinct 2 in two

Both the Garmin Fenix 7 and Garmin Instinct have tough fiber-reinforced resin cases and come fitted with a soft silicone strap as standard (with a quick-release mechanism so you can easily swap it for something different).

The Fenix 7 however has a smarter look thanks to a brushed metal layer covering the bezel and lugs. The 47mm and 52mm versions also have external screws on the lugs while the 42mm model has a more minimalist look with internal fixings.

As mentioned above the Fenix 7 comes with a choice of three case sizes while the Instinct 2 has two.

Display

Fenix 7 has color memory-in-pixel display

Instinct 2 has monochrome MiP display

Fenix 7 has touchscreen

Both the Garmin Fenix 7 and Instinct 2 have memory-in-pixel displays which aren't as bright as OLED and have a slower refresh rate but use less power which results in longer battery life.

The Fenix 7 has a color touchscreen display which means it works well for displaying graphs charts and maps. If you're looking for a watch that will help you navigate new running cycling or walking routes it's a solid choice. The blue backlight does muddy the colors a little though.

The Instinct 2 has a monochrome screen with a small cutout that can show useful stats like your current calorie burn or step count and displays useful contextual information as you're navigating through menus. It's even more efficient than the Fenix 7's display but it also has a lower resolution. Although you can upload routes to the Instinct 2 following them is difficult due to the lack of detail.

The Instinct 2's display isn't touch-sensitive; instead all watch operations are carried out using the buttons around the edge of the case.

Battery life

Both have very good battery life

Instinct 2 has the edge over Fenix 7

All Fenix and Instinct watches have excellent battery life but the Instinct 2 has the edge – particularly if you opt for one of the solar models. In fact Garmin claims you could get indefinite battery life in smartwatch mode if you give your watch sufficient sunlight (the company gave the example of a lifeguard working at a beach). Even if you're not soaking up the sun all day you can still expect battery life that runs into weeks rather than hours or days.

As with any sports watch using features like GPS music playback and SpO2 tracking will use more power and reduce battery life.

This table shows Garmin's maximum battery life figures for the standard 47mm Fenix 7 and Fenix 7 Solar plus the standard 45mm Instinct 2 and Instinct 2 Solar.

Larger watches have longer battery life due to their biggest batteries (and solar cells) while smaller models have shorter battery life.

Smartwatch and fitness features

Smartwatch features

Both have a good suite of everyday smartwatch tools

Fenix 7 has on-board music storage

Fenix 7 has Garmin Pay for contactless purchases

In terms of everyday smartwatch features the Garmin Fenix 7 has the edge over the Instinct 2. Both watches will display app text and call notifications on your wrist allow you to reject calls with a text message if you're an Android phone user and let you control music playback on your phone. They also let you see your calendar and provide weather forecasts on your wrist.

However the Fenix 7 also has on-board storage for music (the exact amount varies depending on which model you choose) plus Garmin Pay for making contactless purchases. You can also use Garmin Pay on various public transport networks.

It's worth noting that neither watch has a microphone for taking calls or using your phone's voice assistant. For that you'll need the Garmin Venu 2 Plus.

Fitness tracking

Both excellent multi-sports watches

Fenix 7 has more advanced training tools

Fenix 7 has animated yoga and pilates workouts

Both the Instinct 2 and Fenix 7 are excellent sports watches with a huge range of sports tracking profiles (particularly for runners swimmers and cyclists) and multi-sports modes so you don't have to stop tracking during events that include more than one discipline.

The Fenix 7 also has a host of extra training tools to help you monitor your fitness and see the results of your workouts. These include training load focus training effect (aerobic or anaerobic) and training load over the last seven days with guidance on whether you're maintaining your current fitness level improving peaking or detraining. You also get a real-time stamina monitor which shows how much energy you have remaining for the rest of your workout and help you judge whether you can afford to push harder or need to dial back a little to avoid getting over-tired.

Cyclists will benefit from a cycling-specific street map (with popularity ratings for routes) and compatibility with Varia radar systems. Swimmers can log drills get pacing alerts and record their critical swim speed.

The Fenix 7 also has on-screen workout animations to guide you through yoga and pilates sessions

Whichever watch you choose you'll also get Garmin's all-day heart monitoring with abnormal heart rate alerts stress tracking and Body Battery monitor which shows how much energy you have to tackle the day ahead (and how it drops during the day based on activity and stress).

You'll also get sleep monitoring with a sleep score each morning a breakdown of sleep stage and tips on how to sleep better in future. Both watches also have an SpO2 monitor which can track blood oxygen saturation constantly just throughout the night or via spot checks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsbDRzaG9vdGVycy5jb20vZW4vc2hvb3RpbmcvYWNjZXNzb3JpZXMvYW50b25pbmktY2FyLWEtcHJvZmVzc2lvbmFsLXJlc2N1ZS10b29sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Antonini CAR: a professional rescue tool in case of car accidents,"Franco Palamaro © F.PALAMARO At the tool's end there are two bolt wrenches – 10 and 13 mm – and a tungsten carbide glass breaker.

Rescue tools designed for motorists – or rather for rescuers in case of a car accident – come in many different forms. They range from the simple plastic hammer with a steel window breaker to professional tools capable of cutting sheet metal and steel pillars. Between these extremes in reality there isn't much on the market and speaking of individual instruments one of the names that immediately comes to mind is Antonini from Maniago Italy that for some years now has been manufacturing the multi-purpose RESet series of rescue tools that we introduced some time ago. But with the CAR a decisive step forward has been taken in terms of even more demanding uses: the CAR is a multi-purpose tool designed to meet a specific request from the Italian firefighters who complained about the impossibility of finding on the market a tool with all the necessary features to equip operators during interventions following car accidents. This tool which marks a new phase in the now close collaboration between Antonini and designer Tommaso Rumici integrates several tools useful to free the occupants of crashed vehicles.

Antonini CAR: a smart and versatile rescue tool



Franco Palamaro © F.PALAMARO The size of the CAR is an excellent compromise between performance and portability.





The main body of the CAR consists in a lever made of Nitro-B steel hardened to 57 HRC that ends in a powerful chisel tip with a nail remover and belt cutter. This part of the tool is designed to remove plastic panels from the passengers compartment.



On the opposite end of the tool there are two wrenches – 10 and 13 millimeters – suitable for removing the battery clamps of most vehicles. Between the two wrenches is a sturdy tungsten carbide glass-breaking tip to smash windows and windshields without any difficulty.



Under the sturdy bright yellow G10 grip there are two lockable blades: the first has a concave edge and is designed to easily cut through seats and upholstery exposing the airbag system components; the other is a specific saw for laminated safety glass. Both blades feature a button lock which works in both the rest and working positions ensuring maximum safety for operators. At the grip's center and on the opposite side of the tool we find two luminescent stickers that allow you to locate the tool even in complete darkness. Finally on the tool body we find a hole hole that makes it compatible with the “Gear Keeper” retractable retention systems marketed by Antonini itself. The CAR has been carefully sized to fit in the chest pocket of rescuers' service jackets and is equipped with a removable stainless steel clip.



The retail price of the Antonini CAR is 250 euros but there are special conditions in case of purchase by professional rescue operators.

The Kazakhstani rider was training on Mount Teide in Tenerife when he fell due to a gust of wind on a descent. The 29-year-old has been transferred to a local hospital his Astana Qazaqstan team confirmed.

Lutsenko will be transferred to Belgium for surgery on Monday.

""Astana Qazaqstan Team rider Alexey Lutsenko crashed this afternoon during his training in Teide Tenerife Spain"" the team said in a statement issued on Saturday.

""Due to a sudden gust of wind on the descent the rider crashed on his left shoulder. After the crash Alexey has been moved to the local hospital where he was diagnosed with a displaced fracture of the collarbone and the shoulder.

""Tomorrow Alexey Lutsenko will be transferred to Belgium for a surgery.""

Lutsenko hadn't raced since Omloop Het Nieuwsblad in late February but had already taken his first win of the season. He triumphed at the inaugural edition of the part-gravel race the Clásica Jaén Paraiso Interior winning solo ahead of Tim Wellens.

He went on to finish ninth overall at the Vuelta a Andalucía later in February before not completing Omloop.

As a result of his crash and injury Lutsenko is now set to miss the upcoming Ardennes Classics. Later in the season he's set to target the Tour de France where he finished a surprise seventh place last July.

A potential date for Lutsenko's return to racing is unknown."

IRS says select returns may take several weeks,"(Gray News) - The IRS issues most refunds in less than 21 days for taxpayers who filed electronically and select direct deposit but the agency reports some refunds may take longer.

Different factors can affect the timing of a refund after the IRS receives a return. According to the IRS a manual review may be necessary when a return has errors is incomplete or is affected by identity theft or fraud.

Certain returns can also take longer to process including when a return needs a correction to the Child Tax Credit or Recovery Rebate Credit amount or other items that need to be checked. The IRS said these processes could take up to 14 weeks.

The fastest way to get a tax refund is by filing electronically and choosing direct deposit. The agency said taxpayers who don’t have a bank account could find out more about opening an account here

The IRS cautions taxpayers not to rely on receiving a refund by a specific date especially when making major purchases or paying bills. Some returns may require additional review and may take longer.

Also the agency said taxpayers should remember to consider the time it takes for a financial institution to post the refund to an account or to receive it by mail.

To check the status of a refund taxpayers should use the “Where’s My Refund?” online option. Information for the most current tax year filed is generally available within 24 hours after the IRS said it acknowledges receipt of a taxpayer’s e-filed return. If they filed a paper return taxpayers should allow four weeks before checking the status.

The IRS said it would contact taxpayers by mail if more information is needed to process a return.

Before filing a return taxpayers should check online for the latest information and tools available for filing a return.

On Thursday the Food and Drug Administration reported that the pharmaceutical company is recalling three lots of Milk of Magnesia oral suspension one lot of Acetaminophen and six lots of Magnesium Hydroxide due to microbial contamination and failure to properly investigate failed microbial testing.

The products potentially could result in illness due to intestinal distress such as diarrhea or abdominal pain according to the recall. Individuals with a compromised immune system have a higher probability of developing a potentially life-threatening infection when ingesting or otherwise orally exposed to products contaminated by micro-organisms.

Currently Plastikon reports it has not received any customer complaints related to microbial concerns or reports of adverse events related to this recall and said it places the utmost emphasis on patient safety and product quality.

The health care company said it has notified its direct customers through a recall letter to arrange for the return of any recalled products. Anyone with an existing inventory of the products being recalled should stop use and distribution and quarantine immediately.

Plastikon advised returning all quarantined products to the place of purchase. And patients are advised to contact their doctor or health care provider if they have experienced any problems that may be related to the products.

Consumers with questions regarding this recall can contact Plastikon by phone at 785-330-7109 or via email at sdixon@plastikon.com.

Macklin answered as Jared Hillis scored with the assists going to Tyler Gartner and Grant Baker.

The second period saw Wilkie get the only goal of the period as defenseman Ryan Donald got on the board with Roszell and Blake Young getting the assists.

Macklin got an late powerplay in the second on a roughing penalty by Andrew Herle which carried over into the third period and took advantage. Carson Pickett scored just 14 seconds into the third to tie the score at two. Then just 1:42 later the Mohawks took the lead for good as Jared Hillis got his second of the game with the assist going to Lukas Biensch. Macklin got an empty netter by Biensch to ice the game with 1:29 left and Macklin won 4-2 and the SWHL championship three games to one.

Nathan Hargrave was once again superb in this game making 37 saves on 39 shots and was named the Playoff MVP for his efforts throughout the Mohawks playoff run.

This is the first SWHL championship for the Mohawks since the 2011-12 SWHL season which ended in a forfeit against the then Kindersley Red Lions. This ends Wilkie's run of SWHL championships going back to the 2013-14 season. There were no SWHL champions in 2019-20 and 2020-21 due to COVID-19.",,,

For one it's an actual next-gen/current-gen exclusive - it's only available on PlayStation 5 and PC tapping into cutting-edge features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing. Secondly the developer has shifted away from its internal STEM engine based on idTech instead favouring Unreal Engine 4. On balance it's an excellent move - Epic's technology merged with this developer's unique vision delivers a beautiful game. In today's coverage we'll be looking exclusively at PlayStation 5 before moving onto PC in a separate piece - and there's certainly much to cover. While there are six 'official' graphics modes to choose from there are actually an unofficial ten in total.

First up I wanted to share some impressions about the game overall. The shift to Unreal Engine 4 surprised me but not as much as the core design itself which sees the surprisingly evocative and detailed world Tango Gameworks has created focused on a concept that is very much Far Cry-like in nature. Yes there's a main mission path to follow but it's also a game rich in side missions and other explorable elements backed by an Ubi-style icon-packed map that overwhelms. It's not to my tastes but I'm aware that many love this style of experience.

In another shift from the studio's prior The Evil Within titles it's a first-person game with much to commend it in terms of its game mechanics - and I loved its first-person animations enhanced with superb motion blur. However an area I really hope can be improved is in controller response which feels muddy and slow. Ghostwire: Tokyo has received criticism for input lag issues but I'm not sure that's necessarily the case more that the analogue sticks are poorly tuned in terms of their acceleration/deceleration curves. Customisation is available in a feature-rich menu system but it's still not enough to get the interface into a comfortably responsive state.

Ghostwire Tokyo on PlayStation 5: The Digital Foundry Tech Review John Linneman and Alex Battaglia team up to share their thoughts on the technical make-up of Ghostwire: Tokyo.Watch on YouTube

Moving on to the game's visual make-up Ghostwire: Tokyo is built around a rain-soaked cityscape that is tailor-made for hardware RT reflections - and that's exactly what you get in the game's quality mode which provides stunning reflections that aren't just limited to puddles: more diffuse reflections are also present on rougher materials. The only drawback here is that reflections mapped onto transparent surfaces - such as glass - fall back to screen-space reflections or cube-maps. Hardware RT is also deployed on shadows too but very selectively: some objects use RT others do not.

Generally it's the same on PC where the same choice of hardware RT effects is in place albeit at a higher precision. In this sense PS5 is 'lower than low' in terms of quality presets but it still looks excellent to the point where PC users are missing out by not having access to the console solution that would add further scalability. This applies to Unreal Engine's SSGI - a screen-space-based global illumination solution that uses software ray tracing. Again it's present on both versions but PS5 gets a lower precision effect presumably in the service of improved performance.

I talked earlier about the six (!) different rendering modes which actually result in ten different options to choose from once 60Hz and 120Hz display options are factored in. Ultimately it's very straightforward. Ghostwire: Tokyo has quality and performance modes along with HFR (high frame-rate) variants. In the HFR modes the user can choose to engage v-sync or turn it off completely. These extra options are designed for 120Hz screens but here's where the other four 'unofficial' modes kick in: you can turn off 120Hz support on the PS5 dashboard and force the console to run HFR capped at 60fps instead.

The key different between quality and performance modes beyond resolution is the inclusion of hardware-accelerated ray tracing.

Let's break down these modes in more detail. It starts with the 60Hz quality mode which runs at 30fps and delivers the highest resolution along with hardware RT effects. Pixel-counting on this game is challenging to say the least owing to the heavy post-processing but it seems to deliver an 1800p image. It looks stunning but there's a key problem - inconsistent frame-pacing meaning that the locked 33.3ms frame persistence we would want is not present - there's 16.7ms and 50ms frame-times too adding unwanted judder and actually making Ghostwire: Tokyo run slower than it actually does. For this reason I can't recommend this mode unless this sort of thing does not bother you.

Next up is the 60Hz performance mode. Again pixel-counting is challenging but results suggest a static resolution in the circa 1440p area (seemingly using AMD FSR to upscale back to 2160p) with ray tracing effects disabled. Dynamic resolution scaling may be in effect but if it is I would expect better performance than we get - it's very unstable and rarely locks to 60 frames per second. The nature of the dips beneath 60fps makes this a title where PS5's upcoming variable refresh rate (VRR) display support could really make a profound difference to the fluidity of the game.

Two modes down four/eight to go! HFR is primarily designed for 120Hz displays unlocking frame-rate to allow the game to run faster than 60fps. HFR quality mode retains hardware RT support operates at what looks like 1080p resolution and seems to hover around 60-70fps but can dip beneath. HFR performance mode keeps the same resolution but removes RT meaning that frame-rates are typically north of 60fps in all but the most exceptional circumstances. Both HFR modes have the choice of v-sync on or off: the former lowers overall performance the latter increases it at the expense of truly hideous screen-tearing.

HFR modes drop resolution to circa 1080p and unlock frame-rate breaking the 60fps barrier on 120Hz screens. It's worth a look but the v-sync off option is not particularly attractive.

Then there's the unofficial HFR options which you access by disabling 120Hz support on the PS5 dashboard. This caps these modes to 60fps and provides the tightest lock to that performance level you're likely to get. Again ignore the v-sync off option - it's really ugly - and stick to v-sync on. Despite the removal of RT features and the lower resolution HFR performance mode capped to 60fps is the smoothest experience of the lot but for the best balance overall I'd recommend the HFR quality mode but only when your PS5 console is not producing a 120Hz output - which means disabling that on the front-end of the console if you have a 120Hz screen. If the range of resolutions and modes sounds bewildering it is. Tango Gameworks could change it very easily to a much simpler more explanatory set of options.

In summary there's much to commend Ghostwire: Tokyo - but I do feel more work needs to be done. Controller response needs to be looked at while the game's 30fps cap implementation really should be fixed: as we understand it this problem was solved in UE4 years ago so why it presents as it does in Ghostwire: Tokyo is a bit of a mystery. The 60Hz performance mode isn't very stable and seems to be waiting for VRR to happen when perhaps a dynamic resolution scaling system should be introduced (or ranges adjusted if it is in there already). The game isn't quite what I was expecting but it's clearly a quality release - it just needs a little more technical polish to allow the gameplay to shine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9pcGFkLWFpci01LXZzLW1hY2Jvb2stYWlyLW0xL9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9pcGFkLWFpci01LXZzLW1hY2Jvb2stYWlyLW0xLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The M1 iPad Air can’t replace a MacBook but it gets close,"Ah yes — the age-old question of whether an iPad can replace a laptop. It’s an experiment many people attempted and failed last year with the iPad Pro so why try again? Especially with the smaller and cheaper iPad Air 5th-gen?

Well it has the M1 in it now. That’s the same chip found in the MacBook Air a $999 laptop that I have recommended a lot over the past year. Furthermore replacing the MacBook Air doesn’t require as much performance and app support as replacing the MacBook Pro.

So is the M1 iPad Air a cheaper and more versatile alternative to the MacBook Air? Maybe. But it’s not without some concessions.

Mobility and usability

The first issue of usability happens before you even wake up the device. That’s how the iPad Air feels to carry around set up and actually get started on whatever you’re doing. So first the iPad Air is 2.3 pounds with the tablet and keyboard combined. That’s a half pound lighter than the MacBook Air and that’s a half-pound less you have to carry around in your bag — or just from place to place in your home or office. It’s also an overall smaller package though a slightly different shape with its 4:3 aspect ratio but more on that later.

But when you sit down whether in a chair using one of the devices on your lap or at a desk the iPad Air immediately becomes a little cumbersome. The lap situation isn’t great and it’s not because the base of the Magic Keyboard isn’t sturdy. It totally is. It’s really the size of the device that makes it untenable to use on your lap. The palm rest are small enough that your wrists will likely fall over the edge — at least mine did. It’s not really wide enough to fit in your lap either.

Neither of these devices have Face ID.

Also will there ever be any easier way to open a device than a standard clamshell laptop? Maybe not. The only finger open of the MacBook Air is fast and easy and as ingenious as the Magic Keyboard’s hinge is it still requires multiple hands and actions to get this thing open. You definitely get the hang of it though and this certainly feels sturdier than a Surface Pro.

Neither of these devices have Face ID so both require a fingerprint through Touch ID on the corresponding power buttons. Because both of these devices uses the M1 they’re both extremely fast to wake. It doesn’t skip a beat.

Performance

Usability extends far beyond performance but because the M1 is in focus here let’s start with how the M1 in the iPad Air compared to in the MacBook Air. You can certainly run the benchmarks and I did but it won’t tell you much about how this chip actually feels to run on the iPad Air. Because device for device the M1 is handled very similarly in both the MacBook Air and iPad Air. They’re both passively cooled so no fans — just the incredible efficiency of the M1.

Unfortunately there basically aren’t any one-to-one application-based tests I can run. But in case you’re wondering the M1 is 45% faster than the A13 Bionic in the previous iPad Air but those kind of gains are only in multi-core testing in Geekbench. There’s only a 6% difference in single-core so it’ll really depend on what you’re running if you want to see a difference. When Apple jumped from Intel to M1 specifically in the MacBook Air it was much more dramatic. You could feel the difference in just about everything. Going from the A13 Bionic to the M1 isn’t nearly as significant.

Swipes and scrolls feel smoother and switching between apps is virtually seamless. And there are certainly improvements on the graphics side of things. So yeah when it comes to heavier 3D games that can take use of those 8 GPU cores you’ll notice a slight difference. Games like Pokemon Unite Call of Duty Mobile and Asphalt 9 all run a little it smoother and can hit 60 fps (frames per second) without issue. People probably wouldn’t have bought an iPad Pro just for a slightly better gaming experience but the M1 iPad Air doesn’t make you pay extra for it. It’s a nice perk but the vast majority of the games in the App Store were made with typical iPad hardware in mind so there just isn’t much room for the M1 to flex here.

Comparing it with the M1 MacBook Air the iPad Air is certainly a better gaming device. You can do some things on the MacBook Air that you can’t on the iPad such as play Fortnite or Shadow of the Tomb Raider or any of the other AAA Mac games available. There just aren’t a lot of them and the M1 can only go so far on those. I’ll take the huge amount of touch-enabled games for the iPad Air over the MacBook Air any day especially since most of them don’t run well on the Mac anyways.

When it comes down to it many of the applications that would most take use of the M1 still aren’t available for iPad. Yes we’re talking Final Cut Logic and Xcode — but also Premiere Photoshop Lightroom and many more. You can do plenty of fun stuff with the mobile versions of these apps but they’re not full-featured.

But the majority of time spent on a MacBook Air isn’t in creative applications. It’s in web browsing word processing and video conferencing.

Work applications

There are benefits to using the iPad Air as your primary computer. You’ll need the Magic Keyboard of course but once you have that the iPad Air is a joy to use. The keyboard and touchpad are excellent and it’s fun having access to the iPad’s excellent touchscreen gestures. It’s a unique experience that can’t be replicated on a MacBook Air.

However the apps you use every day will dramatically change the experience of using an iPad. Unfortunately most of the ones I use every day provided a disappointing experience. Google Docs is a good example. It’s where I do a lot of my writing in — and it’s a horrible disappointment. You can’t select text with a simple click and drag and opening links is a huge pain.

Then there’s Asana which still doesn’t have the same filtering options in the iPad app and won’t open links properly.

In both cases the web app works better than the iPad app which is a fine substitute especially now that you can have multiple windows of Safari run them side by side in split view. There are still issues with the web apps but it’s vastly superior experience.

The moment I switched back to MacBook I realized how much more productive I felt.

On the positive side of things Outlook for the iPad is awesome as is Microsoft Word. And of course if you can live more in Apple’s software ecosystem you won’t be surprised that many are properly optimized for the iPad.

In most cases I found workarounds for many of the issues I ran into but unfortunately it never felt quite as efficient as on a MacBook Air.

Lastly if your workflow involves switching constantly between multiple apps — like mine — working on a MacBook Air will always feel faster. After a few days I got used to the rhythm of using the iPad Air but the moment I switched back to MacBook I realized how much more productive I felt.

Videoconferencing

Neither the iPad Air or the MacBook Air are an ideal videoconferencing solution. Performance-wise there’s no problem but each have their limitations. The iPad Air has the better camera with a crisp 1080p resolution.

Unfortunately the camera is still in the wrong place. When locked into the Magic Keyboard (or any other keyboard) the iPad Air delivers an awkward off-kilter angle. Being over on the left is a really unflattering angle — not quite nose cam territory but it’s to the point where I’d prefer to use a lower-quality camera that had a better angle for video calls. Center Stage is meant to help a bit where can use the new wide-angle lens to follow you around and keep you centered in the frame. It’s neat especially if you’re trying to fit multiple people in the picture but it can’t fix the angle of the camera.

The other hang-up with videoconferencing on the iPad Air are the apps themselves. It’ll work just fine if you’re only using FaceTime but my daily workflow often involves multiple video calls in Microsoft Teams each day. While the app itself works just fine you have to have the call fullscreen in order to remain on camera. The second you back out to answer a different chat your feed will shut off. In other words everyone will know when they don’t have your full attention.

The MacBook Air is the better videoconferencing device. Obviously every app functions just as you’d expect whether they are desktop or web apps. The only issue is that it still uses a 720p resolution. Unlike the newer MacBook Pros the Air’s camera just isn’t as sharp.

Display usability

The iPad Air and the MacBook Air have comparable screens right around the same pixel density and high P3 color gamut. Seeing them side by side you can tell they have a similar quality.

Of course the MacBook Air has a bigger screen and a more standard 16:10 aspect ratio. Because of the 10.5-inch size of the iPad Air’s screen and the 4:3 aspect ratio a lot of webpages appear squashed from the full width of the page which is true in sites like DigitalTrends.com but also in a lot of web apps which just display sort of wonky.

Meanwhile the iPad Air has a couple of obvious advantages over the MacBook Air — namely that it has a touch screen and all the great gesture support that iPadOS benefits from. Using the iPad Air with the Magic Keyboard for some time makes you realize just how silly it is that MacBooks still don’t support touch. The combination of keyboard touchpad and touch screen — all well implemented — give you so many ways to navigate and accomplish things. The “floating” design of the magic keyboard even prop up the iPad more to make the bottom of the screen perfectly in reach of your fingers.

But the real problem with the iPad Air is display connectivity. It has the thunderbolt port you need and even an extra one thanks to the Magic Keyboard but iPadOS just doesn’t work with external displays. You can mirror and that’s about it. The MacBook Air doesn’t do much better in terms of ports outside of the fact that it has a headphone jack but this is a laptop with MacOS’ full-functioning multiple display support so if an extra monitor is part of your workflow the iPad Air won’t do you much good.

Keyboard and touchpad

The MacBook Air and the iPad Air (with Magic Keyboard) both feature fantastic keyboards and trackpads. But due to size alone the MacBook Air provides the more comfortable typing experience. Having a function row is handy and the layout is more spread out.

The Magic Keyboard for this size of iPad significantly cuts down the size of some keys but maintains larger sizes for the most important keys.

The same is true of the trackpads. Both are excellent but the extra size of the MacBook Air’s make it preferable.

Sidenote: I still feel like there’s a slight delay in the tracking especially for fast movements. There’s a drift right before the cursor comes to rest. It’s hard to describe but noticeable when up against the MacBook Air. Just to be clear this is an iPadOS problem as it is present on the iPad Pro as well as when using different iPad keyboard attachments and mice.

Battery life

Both the MacBook Air and iPad Air feature plenty of battery life. It’s enough to get through multiple days of use. In a local video playback test the MacBook Air manages to squeeze out a couple more hours of battery than the iPad Air but both last leaps and bounds longer than a comparable Windows laptop. The M1 gives the iPad Air around 10% more battery than the previous generation model so it’s not a dramatic difference compared to past iterations.

The MacBook Air still has a place

The iPad Air 5th-gen gives you access to the M1 at the absolute cheapest price. The base configuration costs $599 but that’s only for the iPad itself. When you add on the Magic Keyboard you’re paying $899 and that’s only for 64GB of storage. To match the 256GB of the $999 MacBook Air you’ll have to pay $1049. So yes technically the iPad Air is more expensive.

But if you primarily use cloud storage and web applications 64GB might be enough for you making the iPad Air with the Magic Keyboard a slightly cheaper alternative to the MacBook Air.

If you are eager to live a laptop-less life the iPad has never been closer to getting the job done. Between the M1 the Magic Keyboard and updates to iPadOS the iPad Air 5th-gen is a surprisingly good MacBook Air replacement. But there are a few glaring problems with apps the camera and iPadOS that would make me hesitant to recommend the iPad Air over the MacBook Air to the average student or worker.

Phil Collins and his band Genesis are synonymous with heartfelt rock ballads. Their songs are so visceral they’ll touch your soul. And Collins has the Oscar to prove it. His rendition of “You’ll Be in My Heart” from Disney’s animated Tarzan movie was one of the best songs to come out of a Disney film earning Collins an Academy award.

Like most things Collins’ career was made of equal parts talent and luck. The stars aligned to make Collins the lead singer of Genesis and his voice shot the band to superstardom. According to Rolling Stone it all started when Peter Gabriel decided to leave the band.

Phil Collins was originally the drummer for Genesis

Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins of Genesis | Ellen Poppinga – K&K/Redferns

Genesis the band was born in 1967. The four founders were Gabriel Mike Rutherford Anthony Phillips and Tony Banks. According to The Guardian Collins joined the group in 1971. Three of those people are still members of Genesis today. Gabriel left the band in 1975 to focus on other things. Collins was originally on drums but he ended up taking over vocals.

Although Collins is the singer most associated with Genesis the band first saw success with Gabriel at the mic. In fact this success led Gabriel to eventually quit the band. Genesis had record deals and tours on the horizon. Gabriel and his wife had just welcomed their first child and the new father realized the “rock star” life wasn’t for him.

As Gabriel said in the documentary Genesis: A History according to Ultimate Classic Rock “I felt I was becoming a sort of stereotype sort of ‘rock star’ or falling into wanting that ego gratification. I didn’t like myself I didn’t like the situation and I didn’t feel free.”

Genesis auditioned 400 vocalists including Phil Collins

With Gabriel out Genesis needed a new singer. The band held auditions and Collins himself contributed backup vocals in addition to drumming.

Finding the right vibe for Genesis was no easy feat. The group already had an established sound and they couldn’t hire a sub-par singer or a vocalist with the wrong tone or intonation. The band auditioned more than 400 vocalists to replace Gabriel. In the end they didn’t hire any of them. Genesis had what they needed all along; they convinced Collins to become the lead singer.

The Londoner said he liked singing but he was scared to step into Gabriel’s shoes. Gabriel was known for his theatrical costumes usually related to the themes of the songs. Collins flat out refused to dress up too much. According to the Guardian Collins said “I didn’t think I’d be very good at doing that theatrical stuff anyway. So I said: ‘Look I can sing the songs but anything else will be a bit of a question mark.'”

Eventually Collins got a little bit more theatrical with his performances. He even donned a costume albeit a simple one. “I was on stage running around and talking to the audience … the only [costume] I did was Robbery Assault and Battery” he explained. “I put on a jacket and a hat and became the Artful Dodger.”

Does Phil Collins still drum with Genesis?

Unfortunately Collins is no longer drumming with Genesis. Although the band has at least one more tour left before they retire the 71-year-old is no longer physically able to hold both drum sticks. Collins has suffered several injuries that left him unable to drum.

In 2007 Collins suffered a spinal injury. Then 10 years later in 2017 he experienced a head injury. Now nerve problems make it impossible for Collins to hold a drum stick in his left hand. But he’s more than able to sing and tour. Although Collins is feeling his age he won’t commit to retirement."

Claimants have until July 10 to come forward but so far only 1250 people out of 5000 who are eligible have filed a claim with the firm Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton which is administering the class action.

""We're desperately trying to find them"" said Charles Veilleux a lawyer representing the claimants.

in 2012 a Quebec Superior Court judge ordered the Department of National Defence and two private companies SNC-Lavalin and General Dynamics to compensate residents for contaminating their local groundwater for decades with a carcinogenic degreasing agent known as trichloroethylene (TCE).

More residents became eligible after a 2020 Quebec Court of Appeal ruling.

Veilleux said he is hoping to obtain an extension to give claimants more time to file. He also hopes to put out new colour ads in a larger format to try to catch the attention of people who may not know about the class action.

He said armed forces personnel and veterans who lived in military housing at the Valcartier base may not know they are eligible for between $250 and $1000 for every month they lived there between 1995 and 2006.

Armed forces not helping track down personnel committee says

Jean Bernier vice-president of the Shannon Citizens Committee said many people who lived at the base for a short time have since moved away and others may have passed away making it even more complicated to reach their next of kin.

The Department of National Defence (DND) was not obligated by the Superior Court ruling to help track down former military members who may be eligible according to the citizens group.

""They are not trying to get in touch with the military personnel that were living on the base on the dates that give a right to compensation – they are not doing it"" said Bernier.

Lawyers for the class action have little more to work with than an address and word of mouth because DND does not have to hand over a list of names of people who lived on the base due to confidentiality reasons according to Marie-Paule Spieser president of the citizens committee.

She said the department will only validate claims once they are submitted.

""The army will confirm [the name and the month of residence] but the request for compensation has to come from the military member or ex-military member"" she said.

Public notices were placed in local and national papers including the Globe and Mail and the National Post as well as in military publications when the eligibility period began last July.

In an email to Radio-Canada a spokesperson for the Canadian Armed Forces said most of the eligible members who are still serving in the Armed Forces have received individual notices about the claims process.

""The notice was also published on Canada.ca and was emailed to all CAF members and employees of the Department of National Defence"" the statement said.

The spokesperson said these actions would be repeated at least twice during the eligibility period.

But Spieser said as it's been more than 20 years since some eligible claimants have lived on the base the class action administrators and the Armed Forces should be putting in more effort to help find them.

""I think there's a huge part of that population [of military members] who have not made their claim"" she said.

Bernier believes given the complexity of the case the court should have granted a much longer period for claimants to sign up.

""I wouldn't have given 12 months to make the demands. I would have given 5 years"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdGlnYXRlLWV1cm9wZS5ldS9wb3N0cy9tb25leS1mb3ItZXUtZGVmZW5jZS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC13ZW50LXRvLWEtc21hbGwtZ3JvdXAtb2YtYXJtcy1wcm9kdWNlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Small group of big arms producers profit most of EU defence funding,Europeans have woken up to a threat of war after several decades of peace and progress for most.

US Navy To Replace Snag-Ridden AGS With Hypersonic Missiles For Its Zumwalt-Class Destroyers,"Analysis By Parth Satam

With political and economic stakes possibly riding on a defense project that saw a 17% cost overrun from $12 billion to $14 billion and the number of vessels being dropped from 32 to only three besides a raft of nagging flaws in the overtly advanced system the USS Zumwalt series of warships will not be scrapped.

Ironically its signature – and biggest irritant – Advanced Gun System (AGS) will be replaced by another defining weapon of our times – hypersonic missiles.

The two tubes for the Common-Hypersonic Glide (C-HGB) designed for even the Army and the Air Force were originally planned to be placed on the port and starboard sides of the ship without removing the two 155-mm AGS gun mounts according to a plan outlined by Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Admiral Mike Gilday.

Now the entire section of five platforms – two gun rooms the loading system transfer carts and ammo – will be removed by October 2023 to accommodate the C-HGB that is significantly larger than any missile in the USN inventory.

The C-HGBs will be fired from a variant of the Multiple All-up Round Canisters (MAC) developed when the Navy converted four Ohio-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) into guided-missile boats (SSGN). MAC tubes of the SSGNs held Trident-II D5 nuclear ballistic missiles before being repurposed for seven Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM).

The last in the series USS Lyndon B. Johnson (DDG-1002) reached the Mississippi-based Huntington Ingalls Shipyard in January this year for having their air search radar Vertical Launch Cells (VLS) Combat System outfitted and tested after being launched at General Dynamics Bath Iron Works in Maine.

The two others are the USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) and the USS Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001).

The EurAsian Times had outlined the class’s troubles ranging from its trademark “tumblehome” hull feared to be unstable with the possibility of tipping over if a wave hits the ship under the right sea conditions the right angle and the right speed. The first-of-its-kind Integrated Power System (IPS) has problems with its software causing several operational issues.

The radar-evading structure – stealth no doubt – has been still been found to be vulnerable to ironically lower-frequency S-band radars.

If not an old-school radar system technologically proficient militaries with sufficiently networked assets battlefield management systems sensor fusion and data sharing can eventually find a roundabout complicated tricks to detect stealth.

The AGS meanwhile fired the $800000-a piece rocket-assisted Long Range Land Attack projectile that the navy thankfully found to be a criminal waste and dropped it in 2016. Most astonishingly the ship lacks a Close-In Weapons System (CIWS) that can protect it from salvos of anti-ship missiles.

Even the 57-mm Mark-110 cannons that were originally planned on the Zumwalt had only limited CIWS capability without the reliability of the 20 mm Phalanx Gatling gun or the Rolling Airframe Missile and SeaRAM point Missile Defence Systems.

The cannons were dropped from the Zumwalt’s basic design in 2014 to not add to its radar signature! Since it does not have Aegis radar and fire control systems it can’t offer a “layered air defense” to fire the Anti-Satellite (ASAT) and Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) capable Standard Missile 2/3/6 surface-to-air missiles.

All it has is the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile which can’t fly longer than 30 miles. Worse even it was downgraded with the smaller SPY-3 radar systems in place of the SPY-4 to save costs which impeded its basic air defense capability. This led to SPY-3 merely being updated with new software to perform both surveillance and tracking roles.

The Navy therefore in 2017 finally decided to convert the Zumwalts from littoral and shallow waters capable land-attack amphibious support vessels to blue-water strike platforms.

This is a common story with all the recent glamorous legacy platforms including the F-22 Raptor F-35 Lighting II Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers and the Freedom and Independence-class Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) a result of the American capitalist political economy borne out of its privatized Military-Industrial Complex (MIC).

Glamour Vs Utility

Saddled with unusable weapons that rather erode military capability before Russia and China as pointed out by US’ own military leaders serves as a lesson for India where some quarters have long called for getting rid of the state-run Defence Public Sector Undertaking (PSUs).

The respective government-run arms industry of the two primary adversaries of America has delivered relevant yet revolutionary combat platforms (hypersonics Anti-Access/Area Denial missiles Directed Energy Weapons) ensuring relevance in conventional wars rendering each of the above weapons useless.

They simply took advantage of the US military getting used to bombing and overkilling vastly inferior non-state actors and armies.

China’s YJ-18 and YJ-12 supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles (range 540 km) and the PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missile (300 km) outrange the US’ subsonic 240-km range Harpoons and the 161-km AIM 190D.

Their pride and joy the “carrier killer” DF-21D missile (range 1500 km) follows a ballistic trajectory like a nuclear missile re-entering the atmosphere to release re-entry vehicle/s that would propel down on US flattops.

“We are at a disadvantage with regard to China today in the sense that China has ground-based ballistic missiles that threaten our basing in the Western Pacific and our ships” former US Pacific Command (PACOM now INDOPACOM) commander Admiral Harry Harris said in testimony before the US Senate Armed Services Committee in March 2018.

In mid-August US Strategic Command Chief Admiral Charles Richard agreed in a symposium about current US space and ground-based sensors being incapable of tracking these missiles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGVkYXkvbmFtZS93aWxsaWFtLWNyYW1lci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzg3MTA1ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,William Cramer Obituary (12/7/1934 - 3/18/2022) - Madison CT - The Day,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/theday/name/william-cramer-obituary?id=33871058 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGVkYXkvbmFtZS93aWxsaWFtLWNyYW1lci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzg3MTA1ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vc3ByaW5nbWFnLmNhL29wcG9zaW5nLXRoZS13YXItaW4teWVtZW4tbGFib3VyLWFnYWluc3QtdGhlLWFybXMtdHJhZGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opposing the war in Yemen: Labour Against the Arms Trade,"By Maya Campo

March 26 2022 marks seven years of the war in Yemen. The war has killed over a quarter of a million people. Over 4 million people have been displaced and 70% of the population including 11.3 million children are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. Spring Magazine spoke with Simon Black of Labour Against the Arms Trade about the war in Yemen and Canada’s role in the conflict.

The war in Yemen has been going on for seven years now can you explain what the scale of the conflict has been? And what role has Canada played in the conflict?

The scale of the conflict and the human suffering it has caused is enormous. Almost 400000 Yemenis have died. Over 4 million people have been displaced. 70 percent of the Yemeni population including close to 12 million children are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.

The Saudi-led coalition has routinely bombed Yemeni civilians and civilian infrastructure including markets hospitals mosques and water treatment facilities. In 2018 a Saudi warplane bombed a school bus full of children killing 40 and wounding many more. The Saudi land air and sea blockade has caused massive fuel and food shortages. Saudi Arabia is using starvation as a weapon of war.

Despite all this Canada has exported $8 billion of weapons to Saudi Arabia since 2015 the year Saudi began its military intervention in Yemen. This is part of Canada’s $14 billion contract to provide the Saudis with light armoured vehicles–manufactured by General Dynamics Land Systems in London Ontario–a deal signed by the Harper Conservatives but upheld by the Trudeau Liberals. However it also includes weapons like sniper rifles manufactured in Winnipeg. There is clear evidence that Saudi forces have deployed Canadian-made weapons in the conflict in Yemen.

The UN Human Rights Council’s war crimes probe has twice named Canada as one of the states fuelling war in Yemen with arms sales to the Saudis. The brutality of the Saudi-led coalition is something hidden from Canadian eyes as the mainstream media has largely ignored the suffering of Yemenis and Canada’s complicity in it.

Currently what is the position of the Liberal government towards the war on Yemen and Saudi Arabia?

Two weeks ago the Liberal government announced $62.5 million in humanitarian aid for Yemen a fraction of the worth of arms sales of Saudi. The Liberal government says it supports peace and a political solution to the conflict but has brought zero pressure diplomatic or otherwise on the Saudis and UAE to bring an end to war. If it was serious about peace the Trudeau government would stop arming Saudi Arabia. It’s quite simple.

While the Liberal government calls out Russian war crimes in Ukraine it remains silent on western-backed Saudi war crimes in Yemen. We must say clearly that we reject this international division of humanity into worthy and unworthy victims of war.

The Conservatives Liberals and NDP all support increasing the military budget how does the LAAT view this?

Humanity faces multiple and overlapping crises: war climate capitalism care inequality. The solution to these crises is not to be found in militarization and expanding military budgets. Labour Against the Arms Trade will work with our allies in the labour movement to oppose any increase in Canada’s military budget. This means difficult conversations and organizing with unions whose members may stand to materially benefit from domestic procurement of weapons and equipment for the Canadian armed forces. But these are the conversations and organizing we have been doing for just over two years now.

Can you tell us a little about the scale of Canada’s arms trade in the world? Is it increasing or decreasing? And what does this tell us about our government’s international priorities?

Compared to the United States Russia and countries like France the arms industry in Canada is relatively small. A 2018 study of the defence sector found that it contributed $6.2 billion in GDP and 60000 jobs to the Canadian economy. Between 2016 and 2020 the main recipients of Canadian arms exports were Saudi Arabia accounting for 49 percent of all arms exports and the United Arab Emirates at 17 percent. However arms exports to the USA are not tracked. Canada is very much a subordinate ally in US imperialism and an imperial power it its own right. So Canada’s arms industry is less about job creation and more about Canada maintaining this role vis-à-vis US foreign policy. We are a junior partner in the American empire and our arms industry is a junior partner in the American military industrial complex.

Can you provide some information and details about the Canada-Wide Peace and Justice Network’s Day of Action? How can people get involved?

There are actions online and in cities across the country including Toronto Vancouver and Montreal. But folks can take important action online by emailing their MPs and looking out for further actions that will target businesses complicit in the export of arms to Saudi Arabia. People can find more info and stay up to date here: https://peaceandjusticenetwork.ca/canadastoparmingsaudi/

Can you discuss the promise of repurposing the Canadian arms industry’s resources for socially useful production – and winning a just transition for arms industry workers?

Let’s look at General Dynamics Land Systems in London as an example. The highly skilled workforce at GDLS members of Unifor Local 27 could use their skills and capacities to build the kinds of technologies and infrastructure we need to mitigate the impacts of climate change anything from renewables tech to high-speed rail cars. If you stand at the plant gates as workers finish their shift and ask workers: if you were paid the same wage same benefits were members of the same union and you had the choice between manufacturing weapons destined for Saudi Arabia’s brutal war in Yemen or manufacturing green technologies that are society needs to needs to mitigate the impact of climate change you will not find a single worker who says they would rather manufacture weapons of war. But under capitalism workers don’t have that choice. The boss decides what to produce when and how.

So we have to fight for workers to have that choice to ensure we have green peaceful production that protects workers their communities and the planet. This means demanding governments ensure a just transition for arms industry workers when we demand an end to arms deals like the one with Saudi Arabia. It means pushing governments to invest in the conversion of arms manufacturing plants to green peaceful production. And ultimately it means questioning the logic of production for profit and thinking about production for social need planning and so on. That means challenging capitalism. Arms industry workers and their unions are not the obstacle to realizing this vision the bosses and the economic system they benefit from are.

Emily McCord board president told those gathered that the shelter's mission is to ""provide a safe haven high quality care and hope for the future for children who have been abandoned abused or neglected.""

The 24-hour residential shelter a private nonprofit organization has served more than 12000 children from across Arkansas since its founding in 1993. Residents may stay up to 45 days within a six-month period until returning to their families or being placed in foster care.

In August 2020 the nonprofit organization opened an on-site school for non-residential students. The Hope Academy of Northwest Arkansas is a charter school open to shelter residents as well as ""children throughout Northwest Arkansas who will benefit greatly from a trauma-informed educational setting.""

In 2021 the shelter provided more than 40000 meals more than 30000 snacks 700 medical and dental appointments and 25 birthday parties -- one of which was a first for a 17-year-old.

Last year there were 4854 children in foster care -- an 11 percent increase from the previous year. Benton and Washington counties continue to rank among the highest across the state in substantiated cases of abuse and neglect McCord added.

The theme for the Starlight Gala was ""What Hope Looks Like."" McCord said: ""Hope is the feeling that what is wanted can be had or that things will turn out for the best; to believe to desire to trust -- that is our goal for every child who comes through our doors.""

McCord introduced Rebekah Mitchell new shelter executive director to event guests saying the board of directors had conducted a nationwide search for a leader who would help them fulfill their mission and that with Mitchell ""we knocked it out of the park.""

The evening helped raise nearly $400000 for the shelter which will augment the less than 20 percent of the shelter's operating budget received from the state.

Those championing the children's shelter and hope included Mike Klaas Susan and Miles Eason Molly and Eric Plummer Meredyth and Matt Malone Vanessa and Adam Morris Nicola King Katie and Jason Fremstad Emily and Blake McCord Luisa and Chris Lamson Nancy and Dick Trammel Diana and Kent Eikenberry Lori and Steve Collins and Patrick Bannon and Andrea Albright gala honorary chairwoman.

Ingredients used to make grocery store products are getting more expensive too and it's now being reflected on price tags at your favorite stores.

Several food brands are in charge of quite a few smaller names in lots of aisles and three have recently announced that in March they would be raising prices to combat inflation. Here are some of the specific products that have or will soon get another big price increase.

6 Things You'll See at Costco This Year

Mondelez Snacks like Oreos Chips Ahoy and More

Back when inflation was up by 7% at the beginning of the year Mondelez announced that it would raise the price of its products like Ritz Crackers Sour Patch Kids Chips Ahoy Oreos and more once again. The news came after it said in November 2021 it would raise prices in January 2022 by around 7% to offset inflation.

""[Suppliers] don't have enough for all their customers so they basically say you'll have to pay what I tell you to pay"" Dirk Van de Put Mondelez's CEO told The Wall Street Journal. ""It's all out of whack.""

Oat Milk

The price of oats and other raw materials in addition to devastating harvests means that the oat milk brand Oatly is going to raise the prices of its products. CFO Christian Hanke detailed the plan in the company's recent earnings call saying that while shoppers in the U.S. will have until July to get Oatly products for the same price those in other parts of the world are already paying more.

""We are seeing higher costs raw materials logistics and energy globally as well as labor inflation. We are strategically taking price increases in EMEA and the Americas to help offset a portion of these higher costs"" he said. ""Price increases are already in effect in certain markets in [Europe the Middle East and Africa] and we will begin to see the benefit of price increases in the Americas starting in the second half of 2022.""

Kraft Heinz products like Oscar Mayer Bacon and Velveeta

Kraft Heinz is taking a page from the same book and making the price of some of its staples at the grocery store go up between 5% and 30% in March. That amounts to over $1 more in some cases. Velveeta Fresh packs will go up 6.6% cold cuts and hot dogs by 10% Maxwell coffee by 5% Capri Sun and Kool-Aid options by 20% and Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon by 30%.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

The company announced the hikes in February through a letter to shoppers noting that the reasonings include ""constrained supply logistic bottlenecks and weather-driven crop losses.""

General Mills Products

General Mills manufacturers brands like Annie's Betty Crocker Cheerios Lucky Charm's Trix and more and is raising the price of them. The company began the process in mid-January according to CNN with some of the items being as much as 20% more.

In addition to upping its prices General Mills also says that products that have pizza dough may be hard to find on shelves. CFO Kofi Bruce admitted that the company is seeing ""acute supply shortages"" and is only able to produce enough Pillsbury and Totino's pizza rolls products for shoppers to find around 70% of the time.

Photo: General Motors LLC

Development of this legendary series kicked off in 1955 when engineers realized that the new 265 ci (4.3 liters) small-block V8 was not powerful nor reliable enough (under high-rpm usage) for the division’s future vehicles - specifically its trucks and larger passenger cars. A bigger motor was a must so the brightest engineering minds available in Chevy’s fold teamed up to create one. Many think that it was just a larger block version of the 265 but in fact the W featured a radically different design.Released in 1958 the engine was devised to be enlargeable for increased displacement applications as well as higher compression ratios but remained sufficiently compact (by 1950s standards) to fit inside the engine bays of passenger cars. The iron block’s decks were angled at 74 degrees from the crankshaft centerline while a wedge-shaped  16-degree combustion chamber stood between the top of each piston and the flat head face. This chamber design was inspired by the in-cylinder layout of the revolutionary 283-ci (4.6-liter) small-block introduced a year earlier.The 348-ci (5.7-liter) naturally-aspirated big-block was curiously dubbed Turbo-Trust and was originally conceived for trucks but as I mentioned before engineers were also aiming to use it on several passenger car models. To make it suitable for both applications they came up with a simple trick in the form of a relief groove was cut into the top of the cylinder wall. This feature was present on the blocks that were intended for trucks to help lower the compression ratio whereas those built for cars had conventional cylinder walls which together with various height piston dome configurations favored higher compression ratios.The 348 weighed about 125 pounds (56.7 kg) more than the 283 small-block but the added weight translated into a bombproof block with cylinders that ended up being almost invulnerable to pre-ignition.In terms of dimensions the Turbo-Thrust was 1.7 inches (4.3 cm) longer 3 inches (7.6 cm) wider and 0.80-inch (2 cm) lower than its small-block siblings so it was easy to install in Chevy cars such as the Impala Biscayne or Delray.With a four-barrel 450-cfm carburetor the base engine produced 250 hp. Next in line was the Super Turbo-Thrust that came with three two-barrel 225-cfm carbs. Under usual driving conditions only the center carburetor worked but when the gas pedal was pushed with real purpose a vacuum switch awoke the other two carburetors that improved power to 280 horses. The top 1958 version named Special Turbo-Thrust was equipped with a single four-barrel carb and was capable of 305 hp.For 1959 and 1960 high-output editions of the top two engines were produced with 320 hp and 335 hp respectively. 1960 also saw the introduction of a 315-hp Special Super Turbo-Thrust that was upgraded with mechanical lifters and triple two-barrel carburetors. In 1961 the last year of production for the 348 power was increased again to 340 hp for the single four-barrel and 350 hp for the triple-carb unit.For the 1961 model year Chevy unleashed a larger-displacement variant of the W-series. Bored and stroked to 409 ci (6.7 liters) it debuted in the Impala SS (Super Sport) with a single four-barrel carburetor and could produce 360 hp then 380 hp in 1962.A dual four-barrel version followed spitting out no less than 409 hp thus developing 1 hp per cubic inch. It had a forged steel crankshaft and a beefed-up aluminum intake. In 1963 output for this variant reached 425 hp thanks to a compression ratio of 11:1 and a solid lifter camshaft. The 409 was available through mid-1965 when it was replaced by the 396-ci (6.5-liter) Mark IV.The holy grail of the W-series was a special 427-ci (7.0-liter) version of the 409 that could be ordered with the drag-oriented Chevrolet Regular Production Option (RPO) Z11 for the 1963 Impala Sport Coupe. Conservatively rated at 430 hp this engine was fitted to only fifty Z11 Impalas.Although it was in service for less than a decade the W paved the way for a long line of Chevy big-blocks including the highly successful 427-ci (7.0-liter) Mark IV or its race-bred ZL1 sibling. Today both 348 and 409 versions are still around enjoying legendary status among the hot rod community for their reliability and ease of tuning. The list of aftermarket hardware still available for the W is so extensive that you can build one from scratch without requiring a single OEM component.If you would like to know more about this iconic powerplant we recommend the video below posted on YouTube by OldCarMemories.com.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi90di9uZXdzL2x1Y2lkLW1vdG9ycy1vc2NhcnMtY29tbWVyY2lhbHMtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZXMtMTIzNTIxNTYxNi_SAWJodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjIvdHYvbmV3cy9sdWNpZC1tb3RvcnMtb3NjYXJzLWNvbW1lcmNpYWxzLWVsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGVzLTEyMzUyMTU2MTYvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lucid Motors Drives to Oscars as Many Car Advertisers Stay Away,"One of the automobile sector’s newest players is making a big bet on the Oscars at a time when many other car manufacturers are staying away from the glitzy event.

Lucid Motors a manufacturer of luxury electric vehicles that believes it can compete with traditional auto companies like Mercedes-Benz has typically spent most of its TV-advertising money for around sports and news programming. On Sunday it will sponsor the Oscars an entertainment program for the first time part of a bid to get its name out to a broader audience. Disney’s ABC has been seeking between $1.7 million and $2.2 million for a 30-second ad in the show according to media buyers and executives and announced this week it had sold off all its commercial inventory around the event.

“We just felt there was a moment happening around entertainment and film again” after consumers spent the last two years hunkering down during the coronavirus pandemic says Jeff Curry Lucid’s vice president of marketing in an interview. “There are a lot of people now looking to go back to the movies.”

The company won’t find much traffic in its way. General Motors which has sponsored the Oscars for the past few years isn’t making an appearance on Sunday. And the only other auto advertiser that has disclosed its Oscars affiliation is Stellantis which owns Chrysler Dodge and Peugeot among other brands. Some big car advertisers have pulled back in recent months according to ad-sales executives and media buyers owing to supply-chain issues that are making the prospect of keeping their products coming off the assembly line a difficult one at best.

Popular on Variety

That gives Lucid time to tell its story. In a spot slated to run during the Oscars the company plans to show off its Lucid Air which it says gets 500 miles on a single charge and has been named Motor Trend’s 2022 car of the year. Viewers get to see the car’s dashboard and interior as well as its outer design. “It’s not beginner’s luck” says a female narrator.

“Talking about our product right now is the best single way we can tell people about who we are as a brand” says Curry. “You can see the design and the technology that’s in it.”

Lucid’s challenge notes Curry is that “we’re new.” Advertisers often use events like the Oscars to tell consumers about new products or innovations getting the word out to what is expected to be one of TV’s broadest audiences. Curry is aware the ABC broadcast has suffered in recent years from a significant decline in ratings — “maybe the ratings have not been quite as high as they have in the past” — but believes the decision to have this year’s program led by three female hosts at a moment when the nation hopes to recapture its old way of life will generate consumer interest. “We are hopeful it will be a really nice moment for the industry for entertainment in general for people to tune in.”

The introduction of electric vehicles by many of the industry’s biggest manufacturers has already spurred some bold advertising swings. General Motors took to the Super Bowl with commercials that convened the cast of the “Austin Powers” movie series and reunited members of the HBO drama “The Sopranos.” Ford Volvo and Hyundai are among the familiar names that have pledged to make more of a business in electric vehicles as consumers and governments grow more wary of the effects of climate change.

Lucid will also rely on some tactics that take place off screen. Orlando Bloom is supposed to be driving a Lucid Air around Los Angeles this weekend. And viewers might look for actor Kodi Smit-McPhee nominated for supporting actor for his work in “ Power of the Dog” to arrive at the Oscars on Sunday in a Lucid Air.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9rYW5zYXNjaXR5L25hbWUvYXJ0aHVyLWhlc3Rlci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzg0NDc1ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arthur Hester Obituary (1942 - 2022) - Overland Park KS - Kansas City Star,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/kansascity/name/arthur-hester-obituary?id=33844758 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9rYW5zYXNjaXR5L25hbWUvYXJ0aHVyLWhlc3Rlci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzg0NDc1ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

SUBSCRIBE The Neanderthal in Us Anne-Françoise Pelé When our ancestors Homo sapiens reached Europe between 56800 and 51700 years ago the continent was populated by Neanderthals. After thriving in Eurasia for over 300000 years Neanderthals vanished from the Earth about 40000 years ago. Why did they become extinct? What did humans inherit from Neanderthals? Could archaic genes help us fight diseases? Paleogeneticists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Germany are on a mission to elucidate this prehistoric “cold case.” Image: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural HistoryJohn Gurche/Chip Clark The name Homo neanderthalensis was coined by geologist William King in 1864 after the first specimen of an early human fossil was discovered in the Feldhofer Cave of the Neander Valley in Germany (tal — a modern form of thal — means “valley” in German). Neanderthals are ancient relatives on the hominid family tree. According to Max Planck Institute geneticists modern humans and Neanderthals coexisted in western Europe for up to 5000 years and degrees of genetic traces from such encounters can still be found in the genome of people outside Africa. On average people living today carry between 1% and 2% Neanderthal DNA. Recent research led by Janet Kelso a computational biologist at the Max Planck Institute has shown that Neanderthal DNA influences variation in skin tone hair color sleep patterns (night cavers and bonfire partygoers you are covered!) and smoking behaviors (smokers blame your Ice Age ancestors!). Similarly segments of Neanderthal DNA found in modern humans would be responsible for the degradation of fats. By bringing together fossil skull data brain imaging and genomics an interdisciplinary research team led by the Max Planck Institute found that Neanderthal genes influence the brain development of modern humans. They affect the shape of the skull and the areas of the brain responsible for planning and coordinating movements. Researchers demonstrated the effects of this Neanderthal DNA on gene activity in the putamen a basal ganglion and in the cerebellum. Several genes that humans received from Neanderthals also play an important role in shaping our immune system. In 2020 researchers at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the Max Planck Institute demonstrated that a segment of DNA that causes their carriers to have an up to 3× higher risk of developing severe Covid-19 is inherited from Neanderthals. Six months later the same team showed that Neanderthals also contributed a protective variant and half of all people outside Africa carry a Neanderthal gene variant that reduces the risk of needing intensive care for Covid-19 by 20%. During their research they also found that the same gene variant that increases the risk of falling seriously ill with Covid-19 reduces a person’s risk of contracting HIV by 27%. Whether it is genesis or genetics that underlies our thinking prehistoric legacy is invoked to draw lessons about who we essentially are. Analog Devices × EE Times RF Signal Chain Discourse: Properties and Performance Metrics Substantial understanding of fundamental characteristics for RF technologies that underpin any RF signal chain allows RF engineers to easily translate them into key requirements and specifications of the target application. In this paper we provide guidance on the main properties and metrics used to characterize RF devices and quantify the performance metrics associated with RF systems. READ NOW Let the Memory Live Again Brian Santo At a point in the future that might be nearer than many expect the industry is going to need an entirely new data storage medium to store hundreds of terabytes probably petabytes and maybe even exabytes. At the moment each of the three likeliest possibilities is more exotic than the next. They’re holograms 5D quartz and DNA. The relentlessly growing surge of data that must be transmitted processed and stored is a constant challenge. The industry anticipates that moving from electronics to photonics will be the path to growth in transmission throughputs and processing speeds but storing photons is not an option. So how to move beyond semiconductor memory? Holograms have been around for decades but holographic memory still needs quite a bit more R&D work. The basic concept is to store images in crystals. To read a beam is trained on the crystal and a high-res camera captures the image; the image data gets translated back into digital data. Multiple images can be stored in the same volume; change the angle of the beam to read different images. Lithium niobate crystals are rewriteable. The fundamental concept of 5D storage harks back to compact disks and DVDs. Recording CDs requires making physical pits on a flat medium. To read illuminate the surface with a laser. Is there a pit? Yes-or-no is one-or-zero. That’s 2D. DVDs work the same way but they have multiple layers. That’s 3D. The medium for 5D is a specialty quartz. A laser reader notes not just whether or not there’s a pit but also the optical property of birefringence. As the name suggests birefringence has two states. Now we’re at 5D. Developers say it’s possible to store eight bits in a single pit. If the technology can be perfected a 12-inch crystal platter could hold hundreds of terabytes and the medium would be stable for a thousand years. DNA storage leaves traditional electromechanics behind. DNA consists of strands of the amino acids adenine guanine cytosine and thymine (AGCT) which can be combined in endlessly variable order and can be correlated to binary digits (bits). Strands of AGCT can be assembled stored in liquid and read out. While 5D quartz can be expected to last a thousand years there’s an example of DNA being sequenced from the tooth of a mammoth that died a million years ago. By one estimate 4 grams of DNA could hold all the data the entire world could generate in one year. At the moment DNA storage is a lab curiosity exorbitantly expensive slow

and subject to errors from mutation – a novel consideration in electronics. That said the promise of unlimited storage volume and astonishing longevity of DNA has all of the biggest data center operators monitoring the technology. There are at least 20 organizations who say they can perform DNA storage. DNA storage companies have attracted over $1 billion in funding since 2020. Gene Therapy Isn’t Science Fiction Barbara Jorgensen If you know nothing else about genes you know that they are microscopic and complex and differentiate humans from amoebae. In addition to determining features such as hair and eye color in humans genes can also cause disease. Gene therapy seeks to correct defective genes to manage a variety of health conditions. Science fiction has had a field day with genetic manipulation — think “Jurassic Park” — but adding inhibiting editing or replacing genes are bona-fide medical treatments. Within a gene DNA can be modified to manage blood disorders vision loss cancer heart disease diabetes and cystic fibrosis. CRISPR is perhaps the best-known technology in the field: It’s a tool for editing genomes allowing researchers to easily alter DNA sequences and modify gene function. But in laboratories electronic equipment does a lot of the heavy lifting. Centrifuges incubators and freezers are typical lab instruments. Then there’s process automation which can increase sterility levels in fluid transfer and eliminate manual handling. A sample taken from a patient for example may be returned to that patient after it’s been processed. Sensor technology and analytics increase the scalability of equipment and therapies and reduce time and headcount. The first successful nuclear gene transfer in humans (approved by the National Institutes for Health) was performed in 1980. To date more than 2600 clinical trials in gene therapy have been conducted. China has become the dominant location for gene therapy trials due to the nation’s expanding research ecosystem and significant governmental support for emerging technologies. China is the only country in the top five — U.S. China U.K. Germany France — where non-industry sponsored trials outnumber industry-sponsored trials (73% versus 27%). One therapeutic success story centers around vision loss. Researchers identified a gene — RPE65 — associated with blindness and used a harmless virus to insert a healthy gene underneath a patient’s retina. In 2017 the U.S. FDA approved voretigene neparvovecrzyl (marketed as Luxturna) for the treatment of any heritable retinal dystrophy caused by the mutated RPE65 gene. The cell and gene therapy market was valued at $4.99 billion in 2021 according to research firm Arziton; the segment is forecast to reach $36.92 billion by 2027 with a CAGR of 39.6%. Key players are Gilead Sciences Novartis Smith Nephew Amgen Organogenesis Roche (Spark Therapeutics) Dendreon Vericel and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Why So Blue? Stefani Muñoz When I first adopted my puppy back in 2021 many of those around me inquired whether she was part chow. When I asked why they thought so they would say it was because part of her tongue was blue which is characteristic of the chow chow breed. One Embark DNA test later and lo and behold — my puppy was indeed part Chow. I then began to wonder why exactly chows have blue tongues while many other canine breeds don’t. It’s said that chows originated in China about 2000 years ago first appearing in Chinese artifacts dating as far back as 206 B.C. Many historians believe that chow chows were the inspiration behind the design of the stone lion statues that commonly guarded Buddhist temples and it’s said they were considered “war dogs” often named “man kou” meaning “dog of the Barbarians.” According to Chinese legend when Earth was created and the first stars were placed into the heavens parts of the sky fell to the earth. Chows deemed ever-curious creatures licked the blue pieces of sky from the ground staining their tongues deep blue. Other sources claim the breed’s blue-tinged tongues were inherited from bears. Turns out it comes down to their genetics — more specifically their pigment cells. Similar to humans a canine’s genetic code determines both the type and amount of pigment cells present depending on the genetic makeup of their parents. There are two primary pigments found within canines that determine not only the color of a dog’s tongue but also their eyes nose and so on: eumelanin and phaeomelanin. Eumelanin produces a black color while phaeomelanin produces a red color. It’s important to note however eumelanin determines the color of a canine’s nose tongue lips and eyes whereas phaeomelanin determines the color of fur. The reason behind chow’s blue tongues is the presence of excess eumelanin within the mucous membranes of their tongues. A deeply blue tongue is an indicator that a chow is purebred while only a partially blue tongue could indicate that the chow contains some other time of canine DNA. Chows aren’t the only dog to exhibit blue tongues nor the only mammal: Blue tongues are common in the Chinese Shar Pei Eurasier and Thai Ridgeback as well as polar bears giraffes and blue-tongued lizards.

He is leading author or co-author of more than 50 journal papers or international conference contributions. After his Ph.D. graduation he led projects aiming to develop GaN HEMTs for several applications in RF and power switching before joining the business development team of Imec. In this role he was directly responsible for Imec's partnerships in the field of GaN power electronics as well as development and manufacturing of Si-based devices MEMS sensors and microsystems. Today Denis is general manager of Innoscience Europe (a subsidiary of Innoscience) and is directly responsible for Innoscience’s GaN business and marketing in Europe and the USA. What personal projects will you be working on this weekend Denis? I am currently working on a project with my 11 year-old son that involves building up and programming a mini-robot. Sometimes I actually think I am more into it and excited to see the mini-robot moving under our instructions than my son is. How do you talk about technology with your kids? Together with them I like to disassemble electronic devices and explain to them the components inside and their high level functions (e.g. camera microprocessor power devices and so on). By means of electronic kits for kids I also show them how electronics works. It’s great fun and educational too. Who was (or is) your mentor? I had several leaders and mentors in my career. I was taught how to be an inspirational leader and I was taught the importance of building up true relationships that go beyond business. This mentor taught me not to accept any easy explanation and more importantly to always question results. Who is your favorite musician writer or artist? I like all types of music with a strong preference towards (hard) rock music and particularly [Italian rockstar] Vasco Rossi Queen Iron Maiden Metallica… you could say I like energetic music. What is the biggest threat to society posed by technology today? I think the biggest threat posed by technology today is to lose the human contact and interaction which is increasingly being substituted by virtual interactions. It is something we need to be mindful of. What advice would you give to early-career engineers? Firstly I’d say they need to be curious and passionate about their work… or to ensure they only work on what they are curious and passionate about. It might sound like a cliché yet that is what moves me and that is what makes me go the extra mile… without feeling as though it was a chore. I am fascinated passionate and almost in love with GaN semiconductor technology – and what you can make with it. A second piece of advice is to listen: listen to the market listen to your customers listen to your fellows etc… and adapt accordingly. My third piece of advice would be to make plans of what you want to do and achieve (both at a high level and a low level) get to work and get things done.

The instant payment platform lets merchants make manage and receive secure payments by connecting directly from the payer’s bank to a merchant’s bank.

The Series A funding comes after its 10x year-over-year revenue growth since its launch in 2018. The company which didn’t provide a baseline for that growth or its valuation says it facilitates more than $4 billion AUD in payment volume every month and expects to process more than $50 billion AUD in payments this year.

More than 100 Australian organizations including banks fintech companies and credit unions use NPP (new payments platform) Australia’s open-access infrastructure for fast payment according to the NPP website. NPP’s PayTo is a new digital tool for merchants and businesses to initiate real-time payments from customer bank accounts.

Zepto became the first non-bank approved as an NPP-connected institution in October. That means Zepto will be able to connect its clients directly to the NPP’s PayTo service which is due to roll out in mid-2022.

“Data-rich real-time payments directly between bank accounts are the future of how we transact and Australian policymakers have acknowledged this with the rollout of NPP’s PayTo which will replace direct debit in roughly three to five years” Chris Jewell CEO of Zepto told TechCrunch. “Merchant and consumer payment preferences are shifting away from expensive legacy payments methods like credit cards and slow blind traditional direct debit.”

There’s an entire generation of consumers coming who will never own a credit card or get approval for a buy now pay later product but bank accounts are ubiquitous and payments directly between them are a simple clean and efficient way to pay for things Jewell continued.

The real-time payments through Australia’s NPP accounted for 31% of all account-to-account payments in October 2021 according to Jewell. He added that the total cumulative value of NPP payments since its launch in November 2017 was about 2.6 billion.

Jewell said account-to-account (A2A) which refers to bank account-to-bank account transactions does not require a card or PIN. While debit cards are usually powered by Visa and Mastercard A2A cuts them out as the intermediary.

According to FIS’s global payment report 2020 A2A payments will take up 20% of all e-commerce payments surpassing credit and debit cards by 2023.

Zepto serves hundreds of Australian corporations including lenders trading/crypto platforms third-party processors proptech companies and travel and tourism operators. Binance Australia Superhero Novatti Group Nimble Powerpay Till Payments Bluestone Rentbetter Biz Pay and Get Blys are among its customers.

The startup will use the latest funding to advance its functionalities on top of the NPP’s PayTo framework and accelerate its international expansion starting with New Zealand driven by growing demand for Zepto’s infrastructure in the region Jewell said. After New Zealand Zepto wants to enter the U.S.

“The global payments landscape is in the middle of its biggest upheaval in decades as open banking and real-time bank-to-bank payments are transforming how we pay and get paid” AirTree Ventures partner James Cameron said. “With open banking and the NPP Australia has found itself at the center of this disruption – and Zepto is the leading innovator in this space. With companies like Afterpay Athena and Airwallex Australia has shown that we punch well above our weight in fintech innovation globally.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3MvY3VycmVuY2llcy9kb2xsYXItdnMteXVhbi1jaGluYS1jdXJyZW5jeS1nbG9iYWwtcmVzZXJ2ZXMtY2VudHJhbC1iYW5rcy1ydXNzaWEtMjAyMi0z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dollar Vs.

China's yuan eventually could develop into a reputable global reserve currency but Beijing would have to drastically loosen its grip on the economy according to a Chinese economy expert who also sees some upside to a downgrade in the US dollar's status.

Western sanctions that froze much of Russia's foreign currency holdings since its invasion of Ukraine have underscored the dollar's power while also highlighting the risks of relying on it heavily.

""The use of Chinese currency will inevitably expand and play a much bigger role in the world"" Baizhu Chen professor of clinical finance and business economics at the University of Southern California told Insider. ""Some countries feel their economies could be held hostage to US policies because the dollar is dominant and countries want to diversify their risk.""

Already upwards of 70 central banks hold some yuan as a reserve currency while many African countries and some in the Middle East regularly use it for transactions he noted.

Meanwhile other central banks have diversified their holdings over the last 20 years reducing the dollar's share of global reserves the International Monetary Fund said in a report Thursday.

And in recent weeks more efforts to pull back from the dollar have emerged. Saudi Arabia and China are looking to use yuan in a new oil deal. Russia and India are in talks to revive a ruble-rupee ledger. Moscow has also demanded Europe use rubles to pay for its natural gas and may even turn to bitcoin for payment.

""Were the dollar to lose its status as the world's reserve currency it would raise interest rates for our historically large debt relative to the economy"" warned Tomas Philipson former Acting Chairman for the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

That means American consumers and businesses would face higher borrowing costs. Prices for imports would also likely rise.

For now greenbacks comprise 60% of global reserves versus the yuan's 2.5%. And in global payments volume the dollar accounts for 40% while the yuan has about 3% even though China is the world's second biggest economy trailing closely behind the US Philipson said.

That could change but not without massive reforms.

How China can make the yuan more competitive

China would have to open up its market and loosen government oversight Chen explained noting that historically no currency that's been heavily controlled has become dominant in global reserves.

In the bond market that means China must enact reforms to reach the level of liquidity and efficiency of the US bond market. This requires lifting restrictions on interest rates as well Chen said.

China also needs to refrain from currency manipulation like devaluing the yuan to boost exports he added. Allowing for an independent central bank with transparent decision-making would facilitate this.

In addition the yuan must become as trustworthy as the dollar. ""Countries generally trust that the US isn't going to screw up. But whether the yuan could be perceived as a store of value — a safe haven during uncertainty or war — that is a much more difficult thing"" Chen said.

A lighter touch overall from Beijing would be a steep climb as it has trended toward increasing control. But it could help US investors. Signs that the government will ease up on its recent tech sector crackdown sent Chinese stocks soaring and deregulation in general often unlocks more economic growth.

Chen said also said a more prominent yuan would have another benefit as the emergence of multiple global reserve currencies would provide a hedge against the collapse of any single currency.

The D-backs optioned 24-year-old relief pitcher Edwin Ucenta to Triple-A Reno and reassigned reliever Kevin Ginkel and catcher Grayson Greiner to minor-league camp.

Ucenta was selected off waivers by Arizona in October after pitching for the Los Angeles Dodgers last season. He tossed 20.1 innings and had a 6.64 ERA with a 4.40 FIP for L.A.

Ginkel has had a role in the D-backs’ bullpen since making his debut in 2019.

The former Arizona Wildcat finished the 2021 season with a 6.325 ERA in 28.1 innings. His most effective season thus far has been his first as he worked a 1.48 ERA in 24.1 innings as a rookie.

Arizona signed Greiner to a minor-league deal on March 14. Greiner is 29 years old and played 137 games for the Detroit Tigers over the past four seasons.

The D-backs’ moves leave 47 players remaining in big-league camp including 10 non-roster invitees. There are 26 pitchers four catchers 10 infielders and seven outfielders in camp with Opening Day set for April 7.

Teams can reportedly carry 28 players in April to make up for the shortened spring training caused by MLB’s lockout.

But what about those already facing that dire penalty? They are waiting.

T hey are men who killed nobody but have been condemned to die in prison. Men who never fired a shot or wielded a weapon who may not even have been in the same room as the killing or known anything about it.

And yet they have been convicted in Massachusetts of first-degree murder and sentenced to the most draconian penalty under state law.

They live and may die in a strange corner of the state judicial system convicted of an offense known as felony murder which in rare cases allowed someone who joined in a serious crime but played no direct role in a killing and may never have intended to harm anyone to be punished as severely as the actual murderer.

Stranger still the state Supreme Judicial Court ruled five years ago that the way these men were convicted was unjust and abolished it.

But the high court did not make that ruling retroactive. That means there are men in this state who killed nobody but stand sentenced to die in prison.

How many? It is hard to know.

There is no database that tells us how many of the 1012 people serving sentences of life without the possibility of parole in Massachusetts fit into this category. Most of them in fact are incarcerated for premeditated killings or murders of particular atrociousness. But a Boston Globe Spotlight Team analysis of hundreds of first-degree murder convictions going back to the early 1970s identified at least 23 people — all men — sentenced to life without parole despite not having inflicted physical violence on the victim. There could be others not captured in the Globe’s review.

Some of the people in this subset have died in prison. Of those whose race can be determined all but one are Black or Hispanic.

They were not blameless before their incarceration. They were found to have participated in dangerous felonies such as armed robberies but no court ever said that they physically killed anyone or intended to. They were convicted of murder under a holding of our state’s common law that said if someone died during the commission of certain felonies everyone involved in the venture was on the hook for first-degree murder which carries an automatic penalty of life in prison without hope for parole. It is the death penalty slowly applied.

“Not only did I not take a life I was not even present” said Joseph Jabir Pope a few months shy of 70 years old in an interview at MCI-Norfolk state prison last November 37 years into his life sentence.

When the high court in 2017 addressed the state’s felony-murder rule the justices decided that to secure a murder conviction prosecutors from that date forward would have to prove that defendants like Pope who committed no physical violence in fact shared the intent to kill.

But the court did not apply its historic reforms to those already sentenced under rules the court itself had just abolished. When California rewrote its felony-murder laws in 2018 it went further and made its reforms retroactive. While the court here could reconsider the question and there are other possible legal remedies for those in Massachusetts left behind by the ruling nearly five years have passed with no action.

And so these men remain behind bars waiting either for a legal miracle or their deaths.

Paul Gunter is one of them. Born in Jamaica he arrived in Massachusetts with his family as a teenager around 1980. In the early 1990s he was working as a shelf stocker at Bradlees. He drove an old Toyota junker that he bought for maybe $600.

Then he was recruited as the wheelman.

It was March 21 1991. A small group of alleged Dorchester cocaine dealers operating from an apartment in the Franklin Field housing development concluded they had been robbed. Two of them grabbed guns according to court records and set out to confront the men they believed had ripped them off.

The gunmen enlisted an acquaintance the 25-year-old Gunter to drive them in his car to a triple decker on Kenberma Road in Dorchester about a mile-and-a-half away. Prosecutors later alleged that Gunter was part of the cocaine enterprise which Gunter has denied. He was not convicted of a drug offense in this case.

Gunter waited in the car on the street listening to the radio while the gunmen went to an apartment.

The armed intruders didn’t find the thieves or the drugs at the address. But they did encounter others and disaster swiftly ensued. One of the gunmen held a couple inside the apartment at gunpoint as well as a man who happened to be visiting a disc jockey named Jack Berry Jr. The other armed intruder Corey Selby went off in search of the thieves who were not there. The intruders then retreated out of the apartment but as the door was closing Selby pushed it open said “Give this message” to the thieves and fatally shot Berry who had nothing whatsoever to do with the robbery or any drug dispute.

Police investigated and arrested the men involved. Even though Gunter never left the car he was charged with first-degree murder same as the shooter and the other armed accomplice and faced a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Gunter insisted that he didn’t know Selby would randomly execute a bystander. He says he certainly didn’t want or intend for that to happen. And he says he had no idea at the time of his arrest the extent of his criminal culpability.

“They brought us into jail” Gunter recalled in an interview with the Globe “and we’re sitting there sitting there and next thing I know they say ‘You’re facing natural life’ and I’m crying about leaving my family.”

Criminal intent to kill or do grievous harm is an essential element of murder prosecutions. In criminal cases in Massachusetts before 2017 however there was a notable exception. Under the theory of first-degree felony murder prosecutors did not have to prove that a participant in certain dangerous felonies had any specific intent to kill. It opened the law to some freak possibilities.

Imagine: A lone robber holds up a store. The thief in this hypothetical case the Supreme Judicial Court discussed in a felony-murder ruling trips and drops his gun. The weapon goes off accidentally and a bystander is hit. If the bystander dies that’s felony murder — a death occurring during the commission of a dangerous felony. That’s life without parole.

“But if the victim survives” the SJC noted “the defendant is guilty only of the underlying felony and is not criminally responsible for the shooting.” The shooting was after all an accident. “The defendant’s liability for the shooting rests not on the defendant’s conduct but on whether the victim lives or dies.”

To convict Paul Gunter of murder prosecutors only had to convince the jury that by driving armed men to that apartment Gunter was a willing participant in a dangerous felony in this case armed assault in a dwelling. His intent to commit that crime was substituted legally speaking for the criminal intent required to support a murder conviction.

Gunter is incarcerated today in MCI-Concord having served 31 years of a sentence scheduled to last until his death. He is 56.

One of the actual gunmen in his case testified for the government and was allowed to plead to the lesser crime of manslaughter according to news coverage of the trial. He served about a decade in prison and was paroled more than 20 years ago Department of Correction records say.

The vast majority of people convicted under the felony-murder rule are accused of committing the actual violence that killed the victim and in many cases acted alone. No central database exists to enable one to cull out the exceptions to this and the Department of Correction will not release a list of everyone serving life without parole.

The Spotlight Team learned of some cases by reaching out to defense lawyers who handle such cases and the incarcerated individuals they represent. Many were young men when they committed their crimes.

The roughly two dozen individuals identified in the Spotlight Team analysis were handed automatic life terms without parole due exclusively to the felony-murder rule despite having no role in the physical violence on the victim. In none of these cases did prosecutors have to prove the individual had any intent to kill or do grievous harm to someone as they would if these cases came up now.

Some of these convicted men fought for years along traditional avenues of appeal to have sentences reduced or convictions overturned. In a few cases the accomplice who actually did the killing got a lighter sentence through a plea deal with the opportunity for parole.

Where the punishment doesn’t fit the crime Some people sentenced to life terms under the state’s controversial felony-murder rule have sought options for release — with mixed results. William Allen The latest: Governor Charlie Baker this year commuted Allen’s first-degree felony-murder sentence to second degree opening a door for Allen now in his late 40s to apply for parole. Allen has maintained he never intended anyone to die and apologized for the robbery. The crime: Prosecutors said Allen then 20 and a friend broke into the home of a reputed Brockton drug dealer in 1994 intending to rob him. While Allen was in another room the friend fatally stabbed the drug dealer. The killer pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was paroled more than a decade ago. Frederick Christian The latest: Christian benefited from landmark reforms a decade ago that enabled juveniles — who were tried as adults and convicted of first-degree murder in Massachusetts — to become eligible for parole. In 2014 the parole board approved his release from prison. The crime: Christian was 17 when prosecutors said he and four others drove to a Brockton house in 1994 to rob drug dealers. Afterward one of the men shot the driver and two other passengers without warning. The driver survived. Christian told police he did not know that his friend planned on shooting anyone. Peter Cruz The latest: Cruz died of renal failure in 2019 in his early 60s while serving a life sentence related to felony-murder charges which he contested over the years. He had petitioned for release under the state’s medical parole program. The crime: He was 41 when prosecutors said he and two teenagers plotted an armed robbery of a retail store employee in Holyoke in 1999. Cruz was not present during the holdup. But one of the teenagers fatally shot the employee who had chased the robbers police say. William E. Florentino Jr. The latest: After four decades in prison Florentino now 64 had tried in 2018 to see if a state court would adjust his sentence to give him a chance at parole. But his request occurring a year after the high court’s felony-murder reform was denied. The crime: Florentino was involved in a fatal holdup in an Everett liquor store on Dec. 16 1977. Prosecutors said Florentino stole from the cash register while his co-defendant held up the store’s owner. The co-defendant fatally shot a customer who happened to enter the store.

The rules for criminal sentencing in these extreme cases evolved slowly in the last decade. In 2013 the SJC struck down life without parole sentences for juveniles. In that decision the ruling applied retroactively giving people incarcerated for first-degree murder as teenagers the chance to one day apply for parole.

In 2017 another case with the potential to bring historic change arrived at the SJC. It was called Commonwealth v. Timothy Brown.

The case dated to the early morning hours of Oct. 23 2009. Shortly after midnight a group of friends was hanging around Brown’s one-bedroom apartment in Lowell when one had the ill-fated idea to rob a pair of brothers he knew in a Lowell townhouse according to court records. Four men agreed to commit the robbery that night. Brown did not. He stayed home.

However the robbers asked Brown if they could borrow clothing to hide their faces. Brown loaned them some hoodies. One of the men asked Brown if he had a gun they could take with them. Brown then about age 21 hesitated but the robbers talked him into it according to the SJC’s summary of the case. He loaned them a .380 pistol he kept under his mattress.

The crime went horribly wrong. The brothers targeted for the robbery Hector and Luis Delgado were killed in a brutal chaotic scene. People in the townhouse tried to flee and hide. Hector Delgado was shot three times in his own room and was left on his bed gasping his final breaths. His brother fatally shot in the abdomen staggered a short distance before collapsing.

The assailants were caught and charged with murder. And so was the friend who had loaned them sweat shirts and a handgun — Timothy Brown. A court found that Brown’s assistance made him a participant in the underlying felony of armed robbery. And since two men died during the crime Brown was convicted of first-degree murder under the theory of felony murder. He never went to the murder scene but was sentenced to life without parole.

The justices on the SJC agreed that Brown’s conviction was perfectly legal under the common law of the time yet the outcome troubled them. Should such a peripheral figure in the crime serve life without parole? The court decided in “the interests of justice” to reduce Brown’s conviction to second-degree murder which permits Brown to apply for parole after serving 15 years. It does not guarantee parole.

A faction of the SJC wanted to go further. It was led by Chief Justice Ralph Gants a Harvard-educated former prosecutor appointed a Superior Court judge by Republican Governor Bill Weld and to the SJC by Democratic Governor Deval Patrick.

Gants died suddenly in 2020 after a heart attack at age 65. He is survived by his wife Deborah A. Ramirez a law professor at Northeastern University School of Law. Ramirez in a Globe interview said her late husband believed holding people liable for deaths they did not cause or intend “violated the core principle of individual blameworthiness that anchored our jurisprudence.”

“By that he meant our authority is only legitimate when we are holding you responsible for your own acts and not the acts of others” she said.

The late SJC Chief Justice Ralph Gants ( Pat Greenhouse/Globe Staff )

Gants had foreshadowed this line of thinking two years before the Brown decision in the case of Commonwealth v. Robinson Tejeda which centered on the question of whether a participant in an armed robbery could be convicted of murder if his accomplice died during the crime.

In this case which dates to 2012 Tejeda waited in the car while his two friends entered a house in Dorchester purportedly to buy marijuana from a local pot dealer. When it came time to pay for the drugs one of the buyers Christopher Pichardo pulled out a pistol to rob the dealer according to court documents. The dealer whipped out his own firearm. In an exchange of gunshots Pichardo was fatally hit.

The question facing the SJC was whether Tejeda could be convicted of felony murder. On the one hand someone did die during the commission of a dangerous felony in which Tejeda was found to have participated — an armed robbery. In this case however the victim was one of Tejeda’s associates.

The court’s 2015 opinion written by Gants signaled discomfort with the felony-murder rule as an “exception” to the legal principle that people are held accountable for their own actions. In the end the justices ruled that Tejeda could not be convicted of murder because for technical legal reasons the felony-murder rule did not apply in his circumstance. The court did not see this as an occasion to change the felony-murder rule itself.

Two years later in 2017 the case involving Brown came up for the court’s review; it was much more on point. Reform-minded members of the court shared a sense of urgency that change needed to happen with Brown because Justice Geraldine S. Hines who supported reform was bumping up against the court’s mandatory retirement age of 70 and would soon be leaving.

In the end she was part of a 4-3 majority that brought a historic rethinking of felony murder in Massachusetts.

In writing for the majority Gants said that the felony-murder rule had caused “convictions of murder in the first degree that are not consonant with justice.”

From the date of the ruling forward the court ruled no defendant would be convicted of felony murder unless prosecutors proved he or she acted with intent to kill or cause serious harm sufficient to cause a death. The ruling made Massachusetts one of a handful of states that have reformed felony-murder rules either through the courts or in the case of California in 2018 by statute passed by the legislature.

Justice Frank M. Gaziano wrote for the minority on the SJC who opposed the change. He argued that the profound harm caused by a criminal act even if not intended should affect how severely we judge the crime. Gants’s approach Gaziano wrote “is predicated on an extremely narrow view of moral culpability or blameworthiness” and “diminishes the seriousness of violent felonies that result in the deaths of innocent victims.”

Gaziano’s argument may sound right to Christina Down-Robinson. In 1993 her brother Scott Down was fatally shot during a botched robbery at a Walpole McDonald’s. Two men were convicted for the murder but only one of them shot Scott Down. The other Samuel Michael Caze is serving life without parole after a jury convicted him under the felony-murder rule.

Down-Robinson sees no reason to permit Caze another appeal based on the Brown ruling. Caze was the one who took the initial steps to plan the robbery she said even getting a job at the restaurant briefly allegedly so he could case the place. “There was a lot of thought and premeditation that went into this and that’s not something to be taken lightly” she said.

Felony-murder reform in Massachusetts was specifically aimed at future cases not those from past prosecution. On this the court drew a bright line: The reform would not even apply to the defendant in the case that made history Timothy Brown. He remains incarcerated.

His mother Kristine Brown said it is incomprehensible that the landmark ruling involving her son did not apply to him.

“I’ll be totally honest. I get very bitter at the situation” she said. “I think the punishment should fit the crime.”

The reason it was not retroactive Gants suggested in his ruling was that these were long-settled matters and that perhaps prosecutors would have been able to prove a shared intent to kill in some of these cases if required to do so.

“I recognize that a felony-murder case might have been tried very differently if the prosecutor had known that liability for murder would need to rest on proof of actual malice” Gants explained referring to a legal term malice that describes a defendant’s intention to cause death.

Hines who declined to comment on the specifics of the court’s deliberations said the court was concerned about undermining many cases that had been long decided. “People are going to criticize that — why didn’t you let people who have previously been convicted have the benefit of this?” she said in an interview. “That’s a legitimate question that people can ask about.”

Gunter says he learned about the Brown ruling while listening to the radio. His hopes soared that the ruling might give him a valid avenue for appeal but then he was crushed to hear the ruling did not apply to people already convicted.

Nazgol Ghandnoosh of The Sentencing Project a nonprofit based in Washington D.C. ( Essdras M Suarez for The Boston Globe )

“I cried real tears that night” Gunter said. He could not understand why the ruling did not apply to people like him. “It’s still puzzling to me. Why would they change that law and these guys who are sitting here [in prison] have to stay here?”

Massachusetts’ old felony-murder rule imposed the state’s harshest punishment on some who did not commit the worst crimes said Nazgol Ghandnoosh a senior research analyst for The Sentencing Project who authored a report this month on felony murder laws nationwide.

“The court’s 2017 decision narrows this injustice but turns a blind eye to people languishing under the old law” Ghandnoosh said. “The legitimacy of the criminal legal system suffers when courts deem a law unjust but do nothing to correct the extreme sentences imposed under that law.”

Where felony-murder sentences hit the hardest Prior to 2017 Massachusetts was among 21 states that automatically imposed the most draconian sentences on people convicted of murder who did not intend to kill or participate in a killing. ⬢States where felony murder could mean automatic life without parole for some or all cases ME RI VT OK NC VA WV CA KS KY MD MO NE NM SC TN IA NV NJ SD OH WY DC DE FL NH HI TX AL AZ GA LA MS UT CO AR ID OR IL PA IN NY WA WI MA MI MN MT ND AK CT

There are several potential ways to address prisoners who did not take a life and who were left behind by the Brown ruling said Lisa Newman-Polk a lawyer and prison reform advocate.

“The legislature could enact a law that makes the Brown decision retroactive or the governor could commute sentences” she said. “Another possibility is for the district attorneys and [public defenders] to review these cases and jointly request that the convictions be vacated and replaced with lesser sentences.”

Commutations are very rare and politicians have proven reluctant to use their power to reduce sentences. Governor Charlie Baker in January issued his first two commutations including one for William Allen who was sentenced to life without parole for his participation in a 1994 armed robbery. Allen was convicted of first-degree murder despite not having inflicted any physical violence on the person killed in the robbery.

The SJC also has a case before it now that could change all that perhaps making history again. The man behind the appeal is Joseph Jabir Pope and everyone agrees that he did not shoot anyone on the night that changed his life. But under the felony-murder rule that did not matter.

A jury found Pope a US Marine veteran from a big Boston family guilty of participating in a 1984 armed robbery of brothers Efrain and Bienvenido DeJesus in a Dorchester home. Efrain was killed by a shotgun blast while Pope says he was on another floor of the house with Bienvenido. Under the felony-murder rule Pope was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to die in prison.

Pope has maintained for decades that he was not involved in any armed robbery. He says he and a friend were at the Dorchester house to buy cocaine to resell. To buy he said not steal. It was a complicated case and at trial the defense said that a third unrelated man had done the shooting.

Throughout Pope’s trial his lawyer consistently objected to the felony-murder rule intending to preserve Pope’s rights to challenge his conviction if the common law on felony-murder was ever to change as it eventually would in 2017.

Pope’s case is back now before the SJC. The case is still alive because Pope is too angry to let it die.

“Innocent prisoners generally do time differently than guilty prisoners” he said. “I know that because I’ve been both. Those that are guilty tend to resolve themselves to their fate and on some level even find relief. With innocent prisoners there’s a hunger and rage that accompanies us on a regular basis.”

In 2020 Pope filed a motion for a new trial in part based on witness statements that apparently were not turned over to the defense and in part based on the fact that Pope had specifically challenged the fairness of the felony-murder rule at trial and noted the lack of evidence that he intended to kill anyone.

On that point he was decades ahead of the SJC.

Pope said he essentially laid out Gants’s argument against felony murder in his own appeal back in 1990. “Twenty-seven years later using my argument and my reasoning and the actual cases that I cited the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declared that it would never be all right for this to happen to anyone again” Pope wrote last November. “I have been in prison for nearly 38 years and it is still all right for the Massachusetts Courts that this happened to me.”

In 2021 a single justice of the SJC reviewed Pope’s motion for a new trial and decided it had enough merit for the full court to consider.

With that appeal pending a Superior Court judge approved a temporary stay to Pope’s life-without-parole sentence.

And last Dec. 9 Pope walked out of MCI-Norfolk under sunny skies on a brisk winter day.

As they pulled away leaving the prison behind Harris turned to his emancipated client and deadpanned “Well that was pretty easy.” Getting Pope out of prison even temporarily was anything but easy — it took about four years of legal research and court filings.

When Harris dropped Pope off with family in Boston that evening the men embraced. “There are no words man” Pope whispered in gratitude.

Pope is out of prison but for how much longer?

Whether he goes back inside for the rest of his life is in the hands of the SJC.

Pope says the Brown ruling clearly should apply to his case. That position has drawn support from the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers which said in an amicus filing “For Mr. Pope and other defendants in his shoes nothing is more meaningful than the chance to challenge their permanent imprisonment based on a legal fiction that has since been rejected.”

Oral arguments before the SJC were March 9. Pope sat in the front row of the gallery in a crisp suit his overcoat and fedora on the bench beside him. His lawyer Harris fielded rapid-fire questions from justices. Nearly all the questions were related to Pope’s claims about prosecutors failing to turn over evidence in the 1980s. A few questions touched on the Brown decision. A decision is likely by this summer.

Now Pope waits.

“I’m hoping for the best” Pope said. “But I always have to prepare for the worst and to a large extent expect it. Because that’s always been a part of my journey.”

The court could allow him the new trial he seeks or put him back in prison until the day he dies.

Methodology The Globe Spotlight Team used the following methodology to find people who were convicted of first-degree felony-murder convictions but did not directly play a role in the killing. Reporters constructed their own database because the state does not track those convicted of first-degree murder specifically under the felony-murder theory. Reporters and researchers identified nearly 400 first-degree felony-murder cases reviewed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court going back to the 1970s using different sources including www.findlaw.com. By law all first-degree murder convictions are to get an automatic SJC review. Most of the rulings include a narrative of the crime drawn from trial evidence helping reporters assess if the convicted individual was the actual killer. In many cases news coverage of the crimes and trials was also reviewed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlLWhvdy13YXItYnJvdWdodC1sZW9uYXJkLWNvaGVuLWJhY2stdG8tbGlmZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: How a war brought Leonard Cohen back to life,"Open this photo in gallery: Leonard Cohen during his visit to Israel during the war in 1973.

Matti Friedman’s latest book is Who by Fire: War Atonement and the Resurrection of Leonard Cohen. He lives in Jerusalem.

The reputation of an artist even a great one tends to fade after their death. Leonard Cohen is one of the few exceptions. From the mural towering over Montreal to the half-dozen new books about him just in the past year or two the pull of Mr. Cohen’s words and music are at least as strong as when he was still onstage.

For Canadians Mr. Cohen is primarily a national icon maybe the most significant artist to come out of the country – born in Montreal of course known first as a rebellious and profane Canadian writer living off Canada Council grants before he ever became famous in America and beyond as the “poet of rock.” Much has been written about what made Mr. Cohen tick and about the influences that shaped his songs: the old port of Montreal the electricity of Greenwich Village in the days of Joan Baez and Nico the Greek island of Hydra the Hebrew Bible the Catholic Church the folk music of Quebec. But almost nothing has been written about what may have been one of the key experiences of his life an episode that seems almost completely removed from the ordinary course of that life and thus remains hard to grasp. I mean the time he walked into a war in the Middle East changed the people who saw him and changed himself.

October 1973 was a dark month in different ways. Mr. Cohen was in a crisis or multiple crises. He was 39 a fraught age for anyone stalked by depression and felt trapped in unhappy domesticity. He was a new father; Mr. Cohen and his partner Suzanne had welcomed their son Adam the previous year. He thought his career was stuck and that his songs weren’t working. A few months earlier he’d announced his retirement. “I just feel like I want to shut up” he told a reporter.

Then on Oct. 6 a different kind of crisis erupted this one in Israel. It was Yom Kippur the Day of Atonement the most solemn day of the Jewish calendar when the Egyptian and Syrian armies launched surprise attacks on two fronts. Israel was caught off guard its border defences overrun the country’s vaunted air force crippled by new Soviet missiles and the country plunged into shock and despair. Surprising the people around him and quite possibly surprising himself Mr. Cohen caught a plane to Tel Aviv.

What happened next – one of the strangest concert tours in the annals of rock – has lived on in Israel as a kind of underground history a story that was never quite written down but whose importance to people here continues to grow. Mr. Cohen remains a beloved figure in Israel perhaps the most revered foreign artist. Newspaper articles are published about his visit every fall before the anniversary of the outbreak of fighting on Yom Kippur. I spent years looking into what happened – how he experienced it of course and how it shaped his art but also how this was all remembered by the young Israelis who encountered him at the worst moment of their lives. A 19-year-old radar operator for example who heard him play after the destruction of her base and the death of five friends on the first night of the war. Or an army doctor called out of an overwhelmed field hospital when someone said that Leonard Cohen was outside which was utterly impossible but turned out to be true and who stood in his bloody smock and heard Suzanne. Or an infantryman who after some of the worst battles in the Egyptian desert around the time of the Israeli counter-attack across the Suez Canal found the singer by a remote encampment at night sitting on a helmet and strumming his guitar. “It is” the soldier told me “as if you’re walking in the desert and God comes down to you and starts speaking. I was like Moses hearing the voice and I walked toward it.”

I began looking into the story simply because it seemed like such an unlikely confluence of my parts of my own life in Canada and in Israel – a singer who seemed always to be intoning obscure wisdom in the background of my Toronto childhood and one of the great traumas of the Middle Eastern country where I live and work as a journalist. The story of Mr. Cohen in Sinai seemed like a window into the way we all build our identities from odd and sometimes contradictory pieces of the past.

To the extent that Cohen fans are aware of this episode at all some assume that he played a few Bob Hope-style concerts in the rear. That’s not the case. Mr. Cohen was picked up in a Tel Aviv café by Israeli musicians who were going to sing for troops and who persuaded him to come along. They formed a pickup band. He ended up not only at the front but at its very extremity crossing the Suez Canal just a day or two behind Israeli forces and placing himself in grave danger. He drove in a Jeep between small units scattered in the sands using ammunition crates for a stage and headlights for illumination. The enemy was close the desert strewn with bodies.

After the war Robin Pike of the British music magazine ZigZag asked Mr. Cohen if he’d been scared to die. Yes Mr. Cohen replied once or twice: “But you get caught up in the thing. And the desert is beautiful and you think your life is meaningful for a moment or two.” In his own unpublished writing about the war however – particularly a remarkable manuscript kept at McMaster University – the singer is clearly disturbed by what he’s seeing. At one point he breaks down after watching a helicopter land with a load of wounded soldiers and finds himself relieved to be told that these aren’t Israelis but Egyptians. He’d been driven to come here out of his deep identification with the Jews and even asked the other musicians to call him by his Hebrew name Eliezer. But now he thought his humanity had been undermined by tribal allegiance. “My relief amazes me” he wrote. “I hate this. I hate my relief. This cannot be forgiven. This is blood on your hands.”

One of the songs beloved of Mr. Cohen fans Lover Lover Lover was written during these weeks at an Israeli air force base. It was first performed for air crews just back from running the deadly gauntlet of anti-aircraft missiles over the battlefield and just before taking off again. He played for them knowing it might be the last thing they heard. And there are other echoes of the war in his work like Who By Fire his famous riff on a medieval Yom Kippur prayer that lists the many ways we might die in the coming year. Or Night Comes On which includes a striking memory of “fighting in Egypt” in a list of intimate chapters in his life. But Mr. Cohen was cagey in interviews reluctant to link his work to actual events perhaps fearing that his poetry would be reduced to mere journalism or that he’d be perceived as being on one side. One of the most remarkable aspects of this story considering how deep he went into the war and how strong the impression he made was how seldom he mentioned it afterward. That left me with a challenge and an opportunity – the history here was uncharted and often tricky to navigate but it was virgin territory.

Mr. Cohen went into the war believing that he might be finished. He seems to have been hoping for some kind of renewal referring to Israel in his manuscript as “a place where you may begin again.” Incredibly this seems to have worked. Something happened in Sinai. Had he faded that year we wouldn’t have Hallelujah Anthem Everybody Knows or other masterpieces and music history would be different. But a few months after the cease-fire he released one of his best albums New Skin for the Old Ceremony and continued to one of the most storied careers in popular music. If he’d lost his creative thread at 39 it wouldn’t have come as a surprise – most singers don’t even make it that far. What’s unique is how he refused to burn out the way the singer surrounded by death brought himself back to life.

Pampa - Brian Douglas Cota 44 of Pampa passed away on Wednesday March 23 2022. Funeral services will be 2:00 PM Tuesday at The Church at Bushland with Pastor Merritt Vaughn of Trinity Fellowship Church officiating. Burial will be at Llano Cemetery immediately following. The family will receive friends from 5:00 – 7:00 PM Monday at Cox-Rowley Funeral Home 4180 Canyon Drive. Brian (aka Cota) was born November 26 1977 in Pampa Texas to Bob and Becky Cota. Eight years later his family became complete when his sister Brandi arrived. Brandi was the light of his world he protected her fiercely; there was never sibling rivalry and he was her hero. He attended Amarillo High School and San Jacinto Christian Academy where he found his love for basketball and Michael Jordan. During Cota's adolescence and perhaps even into adulthood he was known as quite the class clown. He could outwit anyone and his shenanigans always received the biggest belly laugh from anybody within earshot. It was Cota's larger-than-life personality that drew people to him. He was an avid reader of the Bible knew God's word and used it to guide his life path and purpose. He was a member of the Pampa United Way Chamber of Commerce Salvation Army of Borger and always helped the less fortunate. Cota was a natural leader; always working to increase his skills. He read numerous leadership books and applied his learnings. Brian was a leader at Gene Messer in Amarillo for 14 years and Country Auto Group for the last five years. He worked hard and had a passion for the car business and loved teaching others this passion. Cota was the CEO and Co-founder of his most recent entrepreneurial endeavor InkIT Live a game changer for virtual customer service. When he met the love of his life Savannah his whole world shifted. When Savannah and her son Rhyder came into Brian's life he was finally whole. He was the happiest he has ever been when they were around. Brian was Rhyder's biggest baseball fan and they loved magic tricks and video games. Brian and Savannah were best friends partners in life and crime and had such a bright future ahead of them. Brian had a big heart and could make anyone smile but it was Savannah's smile that he loved the most. While he will be greatly missed by all who came into contact with him he has higher expectations of us. He wants us to laugh smile dream big pace back and forth create innovate and then live out those dreams. The score has finally been settled Michael Jordan is the greatest of all time. Survivors include his girlfriend Savannah Allen and her son Rhyder Allen of Amarillo; his parents Bob and Becky Cota of Amarillo; his sister Brandi Leach and husband Tanner of Bushland; his nephew Tracer Leach; and several aunts uncles and cousins. The family suggests memorial donations may be made to Rainbow Room of Borger."

The Consortium is comprised of Macquarie Asset Management a global asset manager and the world’s largest infrastructure manager and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) one of Canada’s largest institutional investors. As announced in March 2021 the Transaction forms part of National Grid’s strategic pivot towards electricity and follows last year’s acquisition of Western Power Distribution (WPD) the UK’s largest electricity distribution business and announced sale of The Narragansett Electric Company (NECO) in the US.

The terms of the Transaction imply an enterprise value for NGG of approximately £9.6 billion. On completion National Grid will receive approximately £2.2 billion in cash consideration (subject to customary completion adjustments). Following the Transaction National Grid will own a 40% minority equity interest in NGG via a new holding company called 'GasT TopCo'. In addition National Grid will also receive approximately £2.0 billion from additional debt financing at completion. As at March 2022 NGG’s regulated asset value is estimated to be approximately £6.6 billion and its net debt is estimated to be approximately £3.8 billion.

National Grid has also entered into an option agreement with the Consortium for the potential sale of the remaining 40% of equity in GasT TopCo (the 'Further Interest'). The option may be exercised by the Consortium between 1 January 2023 and 30 June 2023 (subject to change depending on the timing of the closing of the Transaction). If the option is exercised the consideration for the Further Interest is expected to be paid in cash to National Grid on broadly similar terms to the Transaction subject to adjustment for dividends paid in the business at the time of exercise. Further details will be announced if the option is exercised.

Completion of the Transaction will be subject to certain antitrust and regulatory conditions. Subject to these clearances National Grid expects that the Transaction will complete in the second half of calendar year 2022.

On completion the Transaction together with the proposed sale of NECO will:

Increase the balance of National Grid’s portfolio towards electricity with the proportion of the Group’s assets in electricity growing from c.60% to c.70%;

Significantly enhance National Grid’s central role in the delivery of the UK’s net zero targets;

Underpin National Grid’s 6 to 8% asset growth target for longer;

Enable National Grid to maintain a strong balance sheet with its strong investment grade credit rating supporting its sustainable dividend policy.



John Pettigrew Chief Executive of National Grid said: “This transaction further enhances our role in delivering the UK’s energy transition pivots our portfolio towards electricity whilst ensuring the security of the energy supply for the country. Alongside our plans to invest up to £35 billion in energy infrastructure over the next five years the series of transactions announced last March will strengthen our long-term growth prospects and drive long-term value for shareholders.

""Today’s announcement is a strong result for all our stakeholders including employees and customers. The Consortium has a long-term commitment to the UK with significant experience in owning and operating infrastructure assets. I look forward to our partnership and continuing to deliver safe and reliable gas service at the least cost to consumers. I would also like to thank my colleagues in Gas Transmission and Metering for their hard work that has helped us reach this important milestone.”

Martin Bradley Head of Macquarie Asset Management’s Real Assets team in EMEA said: “The national transmission system is a critical enabler of the UK’s energy transition providing the flexibility and reserve energy needed in the electricity system as the deployment of renewable sources of generation accelerates. However if the UK’s net zero by 2050 target is to be met the country must have a next-generation transmission backbone to power homes and businesses with renewable energy.

""Backed by our significant investment the transmission system will play a leading role in making the network ready for this transition. In doing so it will support the expansion of hydrogen’s role in the energy mix to deliver a competitive edge to the UK and its industry while working closely with the Government and Ofgem to maintain security of supply.”

Lincoln Webb Executive Vice President and Global Head of Infrastructure & Renewable Resources at BCI said: “This investment aligns well with our diversified portfolio of regulated utilities that securely deliver critical services to customers. We believe National Grid’s innovative decarbonisation strategy will ensure the business plays a leadership role in supporting the UK to achieve net zero carbon emissions on target by 2050 while meeting consumer demand for reliable networks.”



Following completion of the Transaction National Grid intends to use proceeds of approximately £4.2 billion towards repayment of the bridge financing facility that was drawn as part of the acquisition of WPD. For the purposes of Listing Rule 10.4 NGG’s gross assets as at 30 September 2021 were £6.1 billion. For the period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 NGG group generated profit before tax of £406 million.

The Transaction constitutes a class 2 transaction for the purposes of the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules and as such does not require National Grid shareholders' approval.

Following completion National Grid’s interest in GasT TopCo will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

National Grid was advised by Barclays Goldman Sachs and Robey Warshaw.

The BRIC Promise

Bloomberg









When Jim O’Neill devised the BRIC acronym at the turn of the century the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief economist did not intend the catchy phrase to be exploited for marketing investment funds Money managers scrambled to start funds anyway. The likes of Schroders Plc and Franklin Templeton -- along with Goldman Sachs Asset Management -- gobbled up billions of dollars from clients looking to profit by combining investments in Brazil Russia India and China. That marketing ploy has come crashing down and now faces an existential crisis.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made the former uninvestable with MSCI Inc. removing it from benchmarks including the BRIC Index. China which represents a major slice of this benchmark is also slowing and has embarked on an unprecedented crackdown on technology companies that has led to sharp losses.BRIC funds have lost 14.6% this year while their combined assets have slumped by more than 90% from their peak to about $3 billion according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The collapse holds a ruthless lesson for investors on the perils of thematic funds. Combining four diverse complex and risky emerging market countries in a fund was clever wordplay but not a smart bet. While the economies grew rapidly as predicted by O’Neill stocks had mixed fortunes. The MSCI BRIC index now trails the S&P 500 over this century and even lags behind the total returns for individual indexes for the four countries.“Do not confuse the BRIC concepts” O’Neill said in an interview. “My whole purpose of creating the acronym has nothing to do with investment.”Russia’s war has of course wider consequences. The ongoing devastation on the ground in Ukraine has triggered market volatility globally. Commodity prices have surged in response to sanctions imposed by Western countries to isolate the country. That has sparked inflationary fears for big commodity and energy consumers and importers such as India and China.The market turmoil has even hurt hedge funds that are designed to prosper in both rising and falling markets with money managers such as Autonomy Capital Research H2O Asset Management and EDL Global Opportunities facing double-digit slumps. Many have been forced to mark Russian bets to zero.O’Neill’s paper “Building Better Global Economic BRICs” was published on Nov. 30 2001 and focused on how the global economy would be driven by the growth of emerging markets in the following decades. He argued that policymaking forums such as the Group of Seven should be re-organized to incorporate BRIC representatives. Fund managers took notice. Two of the largest surviving funds Schroder International Selection Fund - BRIC and Templeton BRIC Fund  started in 2005 while Goldman Sachs launched its own fund the next year. The Schroder fund grew to more than $4 billion while Templeton’s money pool amassed $3.3 billion by 2010.But the second decade of the century started to take shine off and now they’ve reached a calamity. The Schroder fund which was managing $710 million at the end of February has declined almost 16% this year according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Templeton’s $450 million fund has slipped more than 14% after it marked Russian American depository receipts to zero when Russia’s markets closed according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Goldman Sachs meanwhile closed its money-losing BRIC fund in 2015 and merged it with a broader emerging-market fund joining a string of others to take similar decisions. Bloomberg tracks only 74 surviving BRIC funds now. The same number have shuttered over the years while dozens have been acquired or delisted Bloomberg data shows.BRIC funds’ long-term performance pales in comparison to U.S. stocks which were powered by quantitative easing and the surge in technology stocks over the past decade or so.But to Chetan Sehgal portfolio manager of Templeton BRIC Fund the grouping still offers long-term value even without Russia. Resource- and energy-rich Brazil could benefit from an ex-Russia world he said. “Though China has slowed down its path will very much depend on how it navigates the external environment as many of the internal reforms have already been enacted” he added.To others though the concept has lost its charm. Ed Park the chief investment officer at U.K. wealth manager Brooks Macdonald said Russia is uninvestable Brazil has lots of political risk and his firm can get exposure to China outside BRIC funds. “I don’t see us investing in BRIC as a concept in the medium term” he said. “The economic drivers of the constituents are not as correlated as when the term was coined and some of the countries we would choose to actively avoid.”As for O’Neill he stands by the idea that these economies are growing in size and influence. “Despite the problems that Brazil and Russia have because of the enormous success of China if you look at where they all are together it is still feasible that by the mid 2030s the BRICs could be bigger than the G6” he said.Still he said he’s never invested in a BRIC fund and never will."

Blair did not comment Friday but last month announced he was resigning from the Foundation for the Advancement of Catholic Schools board because of what he called “senseless quarrels” that distracted the archdiocese from its mission.

But Brian Giantonio president and chairman of the foundation that raises money for scholarships contends the argumentativeness has come from Blair and his advisors.

The archbishop “absolutely has an axe to grind with the FACS officers” Giantonio wrote in a March 22 letter to the Conference of Bishops.

Worse yet the archbishop appears to be trying to get control of about $16 million intended for Catholic school scholarships in Connecticut Giantonio wrote.

Blair has “a desire to convert the FACS’s millions of dollars earmarked for education to other uses” he wrote.

At issue is whether the all-volunteer foundation can continue operating as a nonprofit without the archbishop’s support. If Blair succeeds in having the bishops remove it from the church’s national registry of affiliated organizations it would lose tax-exempt status.

The foundation raises money for annual scholarships for 500 to 1000 students in Catholic schools across the archdiocese’s more than 90 towns and cities. Giantonio and the board’s executive committee argue that Blair is escalating a personal disagreement — and risking those scholarships by doing it.

After a lengthy battle for control of the foundation Giantonio and the executive committee sued Blair in October saying he was violating the organization’s bylaws. The case is pending in Superior Court.

An attempt at mediation this winter failed and Blair last month resigned from the foundation’s board and moved to cut the church’s ties with it. As part of that he called on the U.S. Council of Bishops to delist it.

The executive committee is urging the council to rebuff Blair categorizing his actions as “hostile” and “vindictive.”

The archdiocese does not discuss pending litigation and Blair is not taking questions. But in a Feb. 28 statement Blair signaled that he wants to disassociate the foundation from the Hartford archdiocese.

“FACS’s lawsuit personally naming me and my fellow dedicated clergy seeking to argue about who gets to serve on the FACS board obviously pales in comparison to our duty to nurture and grow Catholic education” Blair wrote.

Then-Archbishop John Whelan established FACS nearly 40 years ago to raise money to support students seeking Catholic school educations in Hartford New Haven and Litchfield counties.

Giantonio has served on its board for more than 20 years the last eight as leader. It currently has an endowment of about $15 million to $17 million and awards between $500000 and $1 million in scholarships each year.

The founders developed bylaws to keep the organization independent from direct control by the archdiocese but several years ago Blair appeared to want more authority over FACS and its money Giantonio said.

“FACS’s relationship with Archbishop Blair began to sour in 2016 when he formed the Hartford Bishops Foundation and threatened though a proxy to crush FACS” Giantonio told the bishops in his letter.

“Archbishop Blair took a number of actions designed to give him unfettered control over FACS including the $15 million it currently holds for the purpose of providing scholarships for Catholic education” Giantonio wrote.

Trying to end FACS’s tax-exempt status would ultimately hurt the children who get scholarships — and the Catholic schools that they attend Giantonio said.

The committee is prepared to seek independent tax-exempt status if the bishops go along with Blair’s request he said. But he’s hoping the bishops will side with FACS.

“How do you ever come to a decision that to get at us you’d do something that would hurt your children?” Giantonio asked. “I can tell you I never thought in my wildest dreams I’d be writing to the U.S Council of Bishops.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vaGFydGZvcmRoYXdrcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzMvMjYvdHJhY2stZmllbGQtdHJhY2stYW5kLWZpZWxkLWNvbXBldGVzLWF0LXRoZS11bWFzcy1sb3dlbGwtaW52aXRhdGlvbmFsLmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Track and Field Competes at the UMass Lowell Invitational,"Thanks for visiting !

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss

(Reuters) - Hasbro Inc has turned down a settlement offer from Alta Fox Capital Management LLC to have only one of its nominees added to the U.S. toy maker's board of directors making a shareholder vote over the dispute likely people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.

The two sides have been discussing how to avert a proxy contest after Alta Fox a hedge fund that holds a 2.5% stake in Hasbro nominated five directors to the company's eleven-member board last month.

Alta Fox has privately indicated to Hasbro the maker of Dungeons & Dragons and Play-Doh that it would settle for two new directors as long as one of them is one of the five Alta Fox nominees and a board committee focused on capital allocation the sources said.

Hasbro however has rejected giving any of the Alta Fox nominees a board seat the sources added. The Pawtucket Rhode Island-based company has indicated to Alta Fox that it believes it can replenish its board with directors of a higher caliber and more relevant experience than the Alta Fox nominees the sources added.

It is still possible that the two sides reach a compromise before Hasbro's annual shareholder meeting where shareholders will vote on the board's composition the sources said. That meeting is expected to take place in the spring.

The sources requested anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations between the two side.

Hasbro said in a statement it is committed to engaging with all shareholders and has held ""multiple conversations"" with Alta Fox to listen to its views and ""attempt to come to a resolution of this campaign.""

""We are disappointed the board refuses to listen to its shareholders and appears more interested in forcing a contest than agreeing to a reasonable settlement that investors would support"" an Alta Fox representative said.

Alta Fox a firm founded four years ago by hedge fund veteran Connor Haley has called on Hasbro to consider spinning off its prominent Wizards of the Coast unit to boost its lagging share price. The unit which publishes Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering saw its revenue grow 42% in 2021 according to Hasbro. The investment firm argued Hasbro's ""ineffective"" Brand Blueprint strategy including ""ill-advised acquisitions"" like the 2019 purchase of Entertainment One for $4.6 billion is holding it back and that its share price could surge to $200 a share in the next three years with ""corrective action.""

Hasbro shares closed at $84.88 on Friday after hitting their lowest level in the last 52 weeks on Thursday and they are down more than 10% over the past five years.Alta Fox has said its supports Chris Cocks who took over as Hasbro's CEO last month after leading the Wizards of the Coast unit but that he should be surrounded by a ""meaningfully refreshed board.""

Hasbro has said it has a ""highly qualified independent experienced and engaged board.""

HCA Won't Say - NC Health News,"By Barbara Durr and Sally Kestin for Asheville Watchdog

Two prominent physician groups quit the Mission Health system in the first two weeks of the year the latest in an exodus from the hospital since its sale three years ago to for-profit HCA Healthcare.

The seven doctors at Asheville Ear Nose & Throat “decided to no longer provide medical or surgical care at Mission Hospital or Asheville Surgery Center” as of Jan. 1 they wrote in a letter to their patients.

Also on Jan. 1 the 10 surgeons at Carolina Spine & Neurosurgery Center parted ways with Mission and joined UNC Health’s Margaret R. Pardee Memorial Hospital in Hendersonville. They retain privileges to practice at Mission.

HCA declined repeated requests for the number of doctors who have left the Mission system since it took over in February 2019 and refuses to say how many doctors are on staff today other than that the number is “relatively the same.”

But Asheville Watchdog identified 223 doctors who appear to be no longer practicing there; their names were on the Mission Find a Doctor website as of August 2019 but had been removed as of February 2022.

Another 57 doctors still on the website are no longer listed as employed or affiliated with Mission.

Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer who was among a group of elected officials signing a scathing public letter in February 2020 over concerns about patient care and staffing at Mission said of Asheville Watchdog’s analysis“It seems unavoidable that Asheville Buncombe County and Western North Carolina will see a deterioration in healthcare as a result of Mission-HCA hemorrhaging doctors.”

“It seems unavoidable that Asheville Buncombe County and Western North Carolina will see a deterioration in healthcare as a result of Mission-HCA hemorrhaging doctors.” Asheville mayor Esther Manheimer

State Sen. Julie Mayfield said“The loss of these doctors represents collectively hundreds of years of experience long-standing relationships within and outside the hospital and consistency of and confidence in care for patients.”

“These physicians were a key part of what made Mission a world-class hospital system that prioritized patient care” Mayfield said “and it is truly unfortunate that HCA chose from the start to prioritize its profit over its people.”

Nancy Lindell director of public and media relations for HCA Healthcare’s North Carolina Division which includes Mission Hospital said in a statement to Asheville Watchdog “Mission Health is grateful to our team members who provide quality care to our community every day … It is expected that the transition to HCA Healthcare life events effects of a global pandemic and the increasing demand for healthcare services etc. would lead to both some additions and departures.”

HCA refuses to give numbers

The 223 doctors no longer on Mission’s Find A Doctor site include 33 family medicine physicians 25 surgeons and 15 pediatricians or pediatric specialists. More than 100 doctors moved out of the state or region; others are listed as affiliated with hospitals in Hendersonville the Charles George VA Medical Center in Asheville or private practices according to the North Carolina Medical Board and Internet searches.

Lindell said many of the doctors still in the region continue to practice at Mission and “are still part of our medical staff and hospital teams making the number of physicians on medical staff relatively the same.”

Lindell said the Find a Doctor site does not include open positions or doctors in the process of being hired and is not meant as a tool “for tracking the medical staff.” Mission has an office dedicated to medical staffing but Lindell declined to provide even basic information about the number of doctors at Mission before and after HCA took over.

Asheville Watchdog sent Lindell the names of the doctors who are no longer on Find A Doctor or listed as employed or affiliated with Mission. She declined to comment beyond her statement and reiterated “We continue to have approximately the same number of providers on the medical staff to serve the needs of our community.”

Providers include others besides doctors including nurse practitioners physician assistants psychologists and dentists.

Doctors Frustrated

In interviews doctors who left Mission cited concerns about declining patient care job burnout and frustrations with HCA’s emphasis on profits. Five of the doctors said some of their patients needing hospitalization were asking to be treated at hospitals other than Mission.

One doctor who remained in the area and spoke to Asheville Watchdog on the condition of anonymity because he said he feared retribution from HCA said “I get asked every day by a patient if I can treat them elsewhere than Mission.”

Dr. Martin Palmeri

Dr. Martin Palmeri an oncologist who left Mission in December 2019 to join Messino Cancer Centers said the hospital system before HCA “was run primarily by doctors and nurses and now it’s being run by businessmen.”

“Bedside care is knowing what patients and families are suffering” Palmeri said. “Patient suffering is off their (HCA management’s) radar.”

He said the hospital needs more doctors in leadership. “We need the right balance between bedside care and corporate benchmarks and revenue” said Palmeri who was recently elected president of the North Carolina Oncology Association.

Dr. Ben Aiken a primary care physician employed by Mission until January 2020 said many patients are skeptical “that HCA has their best interests in mind as a for-profit company.”

Aiken who piloted a subscription fee direct primary care practice under Mission’s former leadership said Mission used to employ more primary care doctors even though that specialty is less profitable. HCA shuttered two primary care practices in 2020 in Biltmore Park and Candler and sold Aiken’s pilot program now called Lantern Health to him.

Dr. Ben Aiken

“Primary care generally is not an emphasis in HCA” Aiken said.

At least 30 primary care or family medicine doctors and 10 internists have left Mission’s employment Asheville Watchdog found in its analysis of the Find A Doctor website.

Aiken said Mission long was able to recruit high-quality physicians to Asheville considered a desirable place to live and practice. But he said “The type of physicians that were attracted to Mission may not be attracted to HCA. The business approach is very different.”

“Exact same doctors” then-CEO pledged

An emergency room doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mission before HCA “could be choosy” about the doctors it brought on staff because so many wanted to work there. “Now they just fill the gaps.”

The doctor said that nurses in the emergency room are caring for more patients while management concentrates on meeting minimum standards and “metrics” such as how long a patient waits to be seen.

“When HCA came in there were so many emails on metrics” he said. “We’ve gone from providing amazing care to mediocre care.”

Aiken said he wants to see a high-quality hospital in Asheville but believes Pardee UNC Health and AdventHealth both in Hendersonville are likely to expand if skepticism about Mission continues.

Lindell said Mission patients “continue to receive outstanding care at our hospitals by our clinical teams and board-certified physicians.” She said Mission recently passed a state inspection with no deficiencies and a national accreditation review measuring 1600 points of care did not produce “a single finding that required corrective action or a repeat visit.”

She said hospitals nationwide are struggling to hire and retain doctors a shortage exacerbated by the pandemic but that the Mission system in western North Carolina “welcomed almost 60 new physicians to our staff in 2021.”

In May 2018 before the sale of the hospital system Dr. Ronald A. Paulus then president and chief executive officer of Mission Health told a local business group that Mission Health under HCA would still have “the exact same people and exact same doctors and exact same nurses” and provide similar or even superior care.

Paulus received a multimillion-dollar payout from Mission and joined HCA as a strategic advisor just days after the sale was concluded.

Staffing is key concern

A common complaint among doctors nurses and patients is that Mission under HCA has skimped on staffing among the largest costs for hospitals. In 2018 the year before the sale Mission Health System reported more than 12000 staff. The website now lists 10500. Lindell said some employees formerly included under Mission such as those working in billing and “our supply chain team” are now counted under different entities.

But doctors and other employees told Asheville Watchdog there are fewer people in direct patient care including certified nursing assistants (CNAs) health unit secretaries and mental health professionals as well as support positions such as housekeeping dietary services and the morgue.

A source of many complaints about care patients told Asheville Watchdog is Mission’s emergency room.

HCA contracts with TeamHealth a national physician staffing company owned by the private equity group Blackstone to staff its emergency rooms.

Dr. Mitchell Li an emergency medical specialist and the founder of Take Back Medicine an organization that raises awareness about the dangers of the corporatization of medicine told Asheville Watchdog that such staffing companies often replace ER physicians with nurse practitioners and physician assistants a practice he observed first-hand while a resident at a Detroit area hospital staffed by TeamHealth. Li did not work at Mission or HCA.

“HCA and corporate ER staffing groups figure [they] can get away with a minimum of physicians” said Li who now operates a private direct primary care practice serving Asheville Black Mountain and nearby communities.

Asked whether emergency room doctors have been replaced with lesser trained staff such as nurse practitioners Lindell said “Most hospitals throughout the nation contract with ER provider groups … We also augment their care with other staff in addition to these ER physicians when further care providers are needed.”

Patients in “excruciating pain”

In interviews doctors said staffing turnover and reductions have affected nurse-to-patient ratios and quality of care at Mission.

Palmeri said he was “horrified” to find on more than one occasion his patients at Mission in “excruciating pain” because nurses responsible for seven to eight patients each could not administer pain medications on time.

Dr. Ken Zamkoff a retired hematologist in Asheville said “When a patient is lying in a bed it’s not just the doctor it’s the whole team that cares for the patient. If you don’t have nurses CNAs and the whole ancillary staff you can’t do it properly. When you decimate the team the patient suffers.”

Another former Mission doctor who still has privileges there said the reduced staffing places a burden on those still practicing at Mission and leads to an “erosion in quality.”

Before HCA he said the staff included many longtime employees who had worked together for years but “now there’s no consistency.”

Vote of no confidence

In their letter to patients the doctors at Asheville Ear Nose & Throat did not specify a reason for their departure from Mission but said “All of our doctors will continue to provide medical and surgical care for our patients at both Pardee Hospital and Park Ridge Hospital (now known as AdventHealth Hendersonville). We also now offer outpatient surgical care at Western Carolina Surgery Center.”

The surgeons at Carolina Spine & Neurosurgery Center declined requests for comment. Phil Bridges spokesman for UNC Health confirmed that the doctors have affiliated with UNC Pardee and said current and new patients can expect a seamless transition.

Some doctors have cited pay and management issues in their decisions to depart Mission including attempts by HCA to cut some physicians’ compensation by as much as 25 percent according to interviews and published reports. Lindell said that Mission Health compensates physicians in accordance with fair market rules.

But HCA’s approach to healthcare has led many to depart.

Palmeri the oncologist said he concluded that HCA’s approach to cancer treatment was in his opinion “focused on return on investment.”

“There’s a lot of aspects of oncology that are not that profitable” Palmeri said such as cancer care in small communities.” He said he saw “HCA pulling away from that.”

Palmeri said he wanted to ensure access to cancer care throughout the region. His practice Messino Cancer Centers has six locations including Asheville. “I grew up here in Western North Carolina. It was critical for me to do that for our community” he said.

Lindell said that Mission Health recently partnered with the Susan Cannon Cancer Institute of HCA Healthcare known for its research to expand its services across Western North Carolina.

The doctor who asked not to be named and who said patients ask every day about alternatives to Mission told Asheville Watchdog he left after being asked to take a salary cut and seeing that “the patient experience was declining.”

“Concern for the community” at Mission he said “turned into care for the shareholder.”

A hematologist who was on the medical staff at Mission and requested anonymity said that the Mission oncologists last year were increasingly hearing from patients that they were “resistant to going to Mission.”

In June the oncology team troubled by quality of care and other concerns took a no confidence vote in HCA management he told Asheville Watchdog. “We brought up the issues again and again” the doctor said but little changed. Shortly after he said he concluded that Mission “was more business oriented not patient oriented” and left.

Asked about the no confidence vote Lindell said “We have full confidence in our management team. We regularly gather feedback from physicians nurses patients and the community … The feedback raised at these meetings has been addressed.”

But two current oncology providers who asked not to be named told Asheville Watchdog that patient care concerns continue. They said nurse-to-patient ratios remain inadequate to provide needed care for the sickest patients including providing pain medications on time; there are too few certified nurses for chemo treatments which forces delays in administering the needed drugs; and there are too few CNAs.

While some patients may be seeking care elsewhere Lindell said “We continue to see patients choosing to come to our hospitals.”

Doctors have also left HCA-owned hospitals in other states for similar reasons. In Rochester N.H. for example 12 of the 14 primary care doctors at Frisbie Memorial left within 15 months after HCA acquired the local nonprofit community hospital in 2020. Some of them cited a lack of support for medical staff and a focus on profits rather than patients.

Top doctor departs

Mission’s highest-ranking doctor Chief Medical Officer Dr. William Hathaway announced on Jan. 6 that he too was leaving to become chief executive at MAHEC the Mountain Area Health Education Center in Asheville where he has been chairman of the board.

Dr. William Hathaway

Hathaway told Asheville Watchdog that “my acceptance of the job was purely in relation to the retirement” of MAHEC’s CEO Dr. Jeff Heck which was announced last summer. Hathaway started as chief medical officer under nonprofit Mission and was the most senior of the previous Mission leaders under HCA.

In an interview with Asheville Watchdog Hathaway acknowledged that his departure created an additional strain on the hospital. At the time the Mission system was experiencing record COVID-19 cases and admissions staffing shortages a pending lawsuit over alleged price gouging and an untold number of patient complaints.

But Hathaway a cardiologist and third-generation physician said he was excited to start at MAHEC an organization he described as having a tremendous reputation. “It’s all about care for the patients” he said.

HCA profits soar

North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein reviewed and approved the sale of Mission to HCA requiring 15 conditions of which the most significant are restrictions on closing or selling facilities continuing to provide certain services and continuing Mission Hospital’s charity care policy. Separately HCA made certain capital expenditure commitments.

Quality of care and staffing levels were not among the 15 stipulations added by Stein.Stein however is “extremely concerned about healthcare in western North Carolina” said Laura Brewer Stein’s deputy chief of staff.

“Healthcare facilities must be adequately staffed to ensure patients get the treatment they need” Brewer said. “While the pandemic has exacerbated healthcare shortages all over the nation reports of acute shortages at HCA are concerning.”

She added that the Attorney General will “continue to ask questions about HCA’s policies and commitments.”

An independent monitor Gibbins Advisors is responsible for ensuring HCA lives up to the Mission asset purchase agreement and the additional 15 conditions.

In April Ronald Winters a principal at Gibbins Advisors said in a virtual public forum that Gibbins would examine the issue of physician departures. “To the extent those departures impact services at hospitals that’s certainly something we’re going to look at and inquire about” Winters said.

Winters told Asheville Watchdog last month that the evaluation is ongoing but declined further comment.

Mission has become a valuable asset in the portfolio of HCA the largest hospital corporation in the nation. In January the company reported a near doubling of profits during the full pandemic year of 2021 from $3.75 billion in 2020 to $6.96 billion in 2021.

Just months after the consummation of the sale of Mission Health HCA raised prices across the Mission system by an average of 10 percent. By the end of the first year net patient revenue increased $548 million compared to the 12-month period before the sale Greg Lowe president of the North Carolina Division of HCA Healthcare wrote in a letter to Attorney General Stein on April 30 2020. The letter was obtained by Asheville Watchdog under a public records request.

With annual net patient revenue exceeding $1 billion Mission Hospital ranked No. 2 among more than 180 HCA hospitals in both 2020 and 2021 according to the consulting firm Definitive Healthcare.

“Healthcare should be the least transactional business in the world” said the doctor who was asked to take a salary cut but HCA’s “approach is very transactional.”

He said the upshot at Mission where he said collegiality and community commitment were once hallmarks is “the pride is gone. It’s just sad.”

Lee’s Summit Medical Center — part of HCA Midwest Health Kansas City’s leading healthcare provider — this week announced that it has been recognized by Healthgrades as a 2022 Patient Safety Excellence Award™ recipient. This distinction places Lee’s Summit Medical Center among the top 5% of all short-term acute care hospitals as evaluated by Healthgrades the leading marketplace connecting patients and providers.

“Patient safety remains our top priority” says Lee’s Summit Medical Center Chief Executive Officer John McDonald FACHE. “Working together to face the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic presented during the past two years has reinforced our commitment to deliver high-quality compassionate healthcare to our patients and the communities we serve. This recognition is an honor and reflects Lee’s Summit Medical Center’s unwavering dedication to patient safety and well-being.”

During the study period (2018 through 2020) 170231 potentially preventable patient safety events occurred among Medicare patients in U.S. hospitals. * Healthgrades found that just four patient safety indicators accounted for 74% of all patient safety events: hip fracture due to an in-hospital fall collapsed lung resulting from a procedure/surgery pressure or bed sores acquired in-hospital and catheter-related bloodstream infections acquired in-hospital. Healthgrades also found that patients treated in hospitals receiving the Healthgrades 2022 Patient Safety Excellence Award™ were on average:

55.8% less likely to experience an in-hospital fall resulting in hip fracture than patients treated at non-recipient hospitals*

52.6% less likely to experience a collapsed lung resulting from a procedure or surgery in or around the chest than patients treated at non-recipient hospitals*

66.2% less likely to experience pressure sores or bed sores acquired in the hospital than patients treated at non-recipient hospitals*

65.8% less likely to experience catheter-related bloodstream infections acquired in the hospital than patients treated at nonrecipient hospitals*

When it comes to choosing healthcare quality saves lives which is why Healthgrades is committed to delivering the most scientifically accurate and comprehensive information about doctors and hospitals — with data insights not available anywhere else. To that end it’s important for consumers to know that if all hospitals as a group performed similarly to the Healthgrades Patient Safety Award Recipients on average 100189 patient safety events could have been avoided. *

“Through our 2022 Patient Safety Excellence Awards we seek to recognize hospitals that excel in providing top-quality care for their patients while preventing serious injuries during hospital stays” says Brad Bowman MD Chief Medical Officer and head of Data Science Healthgrades. “We are proud to name Lee’s Summit Medical Center as a 2022 Patient Safety Excellence Award recipient and look forward to their continued efforts to make patient safety a priority.”

Our Theme Park of the Week this week is Pennsylvania's Hersheypark which opens for its 2022 season on Saturday.

The most popular independent theme park in the United States Hersheypark traces its history back to 1906 when Milton Hershey opened the park as a recreation facility for public in his chocolate factory town. Today Hersheypark offers a line-up of 14 roller coasters tying it for having the fourth-most coasters in the nation.

Among those coasters our readers' top pick is the park's most recent coaster the 2020 Bolliger & Mabillard Hyper Candymonium.

New for this year will be a Jolly Rancher retheme for the former Sidewinder which is becoming Jolly Rancher Remix. The Vekoma Boomerang is getting a a ""flavor tunnel"" and five different randomized ride profiles - each with different music lights and... scents.

Hersheypark also is adding a Zamperla Nebulaz called Mix'd Flavored By Jolly Rancher next to that coaster. Both attractions will open later this summer.

Until then fans can enjoy the rest of the park's coaster line-up including favorites such as Fahrenheit Storm Runner Lightning Racer and Skyrush.

Located in Hershey Hersheypark opened its new Hershey's Chocolatetown entrance plaza in 2020. But chocolate lovers should not overlook the Hershey's Chocolate World indoor attraction next door which is open year-round and features a free dark ride Hershey's Chocolate Tour. Ticketed attractions at Hershey's Chocolate World include a 4D movie a Create Your Own Candy Bar experience the Hershey's Unwrapped: A Chocolate Tasting Journey show and a Hershey Trolley Works tour of the town.

Read more

ORLANDO — Officially the U.S. men’s soccer team hasn’t qualified for the World Cup yet. But all those fans who’ve been full of angst and anxiety over the last four and a half years can breathe now.

Led by Christian Pulisic’s first senior national team hat trick the Americans pounded Panama 5-1 on Sunday night at Exploria Stadium.

It wasn’t enough to clinch a World Cup berth because of Costa Rica’s 2-1 win at El Salvador. But the second-place Americans have now guaranteed at least fourth which goes to an inter-continental playoff in June. And they will play at fourth-place Costa Rica on Wednesday with a lead of three points in the standings and 10 goals in the goal difference margin.

That means the U.S. would have to lose by six goals in San José to miss out on an automatic ticket to Qatar. Even the cynics out there can admit the odds of that are tiny.

“We knew we were in a position where the group needed to respond and when I look at the effort and intensity of the first half and the level that we were playing at it was really impressive” U.S. manager Gregg Berhalter said. “You can see exactly what the guys took on and their motivation to get back to the World Cup. We scored five goals in the game — I think we could have had more.”

In this game the Americans looked sluggish early on not surprising since they spent so much energy in Thursday’s scoreless tie at rival Mexico. It also didn’t help that per a report on Fox’s pregame show eight players and 10 staff members caught a stomach bug some time after the Mexico game. It was unclear whether the bug started while they were still in Mexico or after they arrived in Orlando.

But it soon didn’t matter. A 12th-minute free kick followed by back-to-back corner kicks energized the players and the crowd. As the second corner was served in Walker Zimmerman was shoved in the throat by Panama’s Aníbal Godoy — a teammate on Nashville SC.

Initially the referee crew let the contact go. But the video review booth told referee Iván Barton he should go to the monitor so he did. He didn’t need long to point to the spot.

Pulisic stepped up slammed the ball past Luis Mejía and the roar of catharsis from the sellout crowd of 25022 shook the stands.

Panama threatened in the 20th after a calamitous sequence of U.S. defending left Zack Steffen’s goal open and the Downingtown native banged up. The Americans escaped the play but Steffen went to the turf a moment later and took a while to get up.

While U.S. fans went back to stressing out their team went and scored another goal: a Zimmerman long ball to Pulisic who laid off to Antonee “Jedi” Robinson — while getting crunched by Michael Murrillo — who floated a superb cross that Paul Arriola met with an inch-perfect header to the far post.

Twenty-three minutes into the game it was 2-0.

Four minutes later it was 3-0. Jesús Ferreira got the last touch of a pretty passing buildup and scored the first goal by a U.S. striker in qualifying since Oct. 7 — a stretch of eight games.

Pulisic then made it 4-0 with another penalty kick in first-half stoppage time. And he capped off the half by being at the center of a brief brawl in front of Panama’s bench caused by a shove from Murillo. As they tussled a ball was thrown in the Hershey native’s direction from Panama’s bench that sent him running that way before teammates cooled him down.

In the 65th minute Pulisic put the emphatic finishing touch on his hat trick with a brilliant goal spinning past two Panamanian defenders and depositing the ball to Mejía’s far post. Five minutes later Pulisic was subbed off to a standing ovation.

When Berhalter was asked after the game whether he wanted his team to run up the score he answered without hesitation: “Absolutely. We wanted to be aggressive we wanted to put them on their heels we wanted to play with intensity and we also wanted to score goals. So it’s great to see that output.”

Panama’s goal came from Godoy in the 86th minute a header off a free kick. That soured the mood but only for a moment. The crowd let it out at the final whistle finally as free of its own burdens as the players in front of them.

The rangy Roman Catholic senior ultimately chose Cincinatti giving Bearcats fans a 6-foot-6 prospect to bolster their odds moving into the Big 12. Before that however Skillings and his Cahillities teammates wanted to go out with a title after falling short of their quest to capture a PCL championship last month.

The senior made it happen taking off in a dominant second half as Roman avenged a regular season loss to Archbishop Wood with a 77-65 win over the Vikings to capture the PIAA 6A title Saturday night in Hershey.

“It means a lot to me man. It means a lot” Skillings said. “Going out as a state champion is a great way to end to go to college it’s a great way to end the year with my team the losses we took. It was amazing.”

Skillings hit his last nine shots many of an extremely difficult degree and finished with 31 points 12 rebounds and three assists. Roman which won its fourth state title but just its first since 2018 was in a back-and-forth battle with the Vikings for two-and-a-half quarters until Skillings turned things up as part of an 11-0 run to end the third quarter and flip the script.

In the regular season Wood scratched out a narrow win over Roman and with the PCL powers colliding back in Hershey – the first PCL-vs-PCL title tilt since 2015 – it seemed like another battle was in store.

Once Skillings got going the Vikings just couldn’t seem to stop him although it was certainly not for a lack of effort.

“They’re a good team they’re a very good team. We never got in a rhythm defensively and a couple guys ended up getting in foul trouble so we had a few bad matchups and Skillings when you put up 12 rebounds and 31 points it’s hard to match” Wood coach John Mosco said. “It got harder and harder to stop him. We weren’t where we were supposed to be a couple times in help but he’s quick he’s got that spin move. You’re not going to play in the Big 12 without being any good.”

Saturday was a return to the summit for Roman but also a return of sorts for the Vikings. After graduating all five starters from last year’s finalist squad four of them to Division I programs a new group of players banded together and battled their way back to Hershey.

It wasn’t the ending they wanted but seniors Tyson Allen and Justin Moore who led the team alongside fellow senior co-captain Mike Knouse had plenty to be proud of.

“It hurts pretty bad it stinks with us being seniors and this being our last game it hit me a little bit at the end and will probably hit me tomorrow even harder” Moore who led Wood with 21 said. “It’s been a great ride a great four years and a great experience at all three of my schools so to finish it out here it’s been an amazing year.

“I appreciate Coach Mosco for taking me in taking care of me and putting me in a great situation to compete for a state championship and PCL championship but also for putting me around a bunch of great players.”

Allen who spent all four years in the program and excelled in his first year as a starter added he wants to see his team right back in Hershey next year and hoped the numerous underclassmen coming back use the loss as motivation much like his class did with the questions around them preseason.

“I couldn’t be more proud of all the young guys” Allen who scored 10 points said. “I don’t think anyone really thought we’d be here this year I don’t know if anyone thought we’d be anywhere but we had faith in ourselves we knew we were going to be good this year and we just kept going out and playing.”

One of those young guys is sophomore Jalil Bethea who gave Wood an early spark with 10 of his 15 coming in the first half. Along with Bahsil Laster Carson Howard Josh Reed and several others there’s a solid foundation in place for Wood.

The Vikings were in Hershey for the fourth time since 2017 and among the first to leave the team’s locker room on Saturday were a few prominent recent alumni still vested in Wood’s success a group Allen and Moore now counted themselves as part of.

“What I just told them nine years ago we took over at Wood and we’ve been here four times and won two Catholic League championships and the biggest thing to me was in the locker room Rahsool Diggins came back Daeshon Shepherd came back all through the kids coming back builds a program and now I feel like we have a program here” Mosco said. “We didn’t get our goals of where we thought we’d be with the Palestra winning a championship and here. Our saying all year was ‘these four walls’ because nobody believed in us.”

Skillings was spectacular but also not alone. Xzayvier Brown had 16 for Roman Khalil Farmer had 12 and Shareef Jackson was a huge lift off the bench with nine points and 11 rebounds.

Farmer hit one of the biggest shots of the game a 3-pointer on the left wing after Skillings made an acrobatic play to save a loose ball in off a miss with the make really jump-starting Roman’s 11-0 run. For his part Skillings would accumulate seven points in the run and the senior felt in the first meeting he and his teammates hadn’t quite gotten their chemistry right.

That wasn’t a problem after halftime on Saturday and it makes getting even with Wood feel that much better.

“It makes it a lot more special because you know you’re going to get a good game you know you’re going to get a fight. Other teams down from North or West East wherever they’re from a lot of teams hold balls they don’t know where they’re from and how they play” Skillings said. “And everyone knows that came out to this game everybody knows who Wood is and everybody knows who Roman Catholic is they knew it was going to be a good game and it was good to get our get-back.”

Today’s column brings together the manifest debt deformations of ExxonMobil [its zombification] on the one hand; and other deformations more directly related to the firm’s culture its management performance social and cultural interactions in the wider society and consequently its reputational risk exposure. Adding its classic zombie debt status [as defined in finance business and economics] to its other recognized deformations produces synergies hence my designation of ExxonMobil as a zombie plus corporation. The addition of the two features compounds the negative effects of being a highly leveraged corporation and therefore immediately rules out such standard solutions as bailouts. The question that this now poses is: can Guyana’s petroleum sector sustain a turnaround of this compounded outcome?

At this juncture two observations readily come to mind. One is that the other deformations indicated above seem to focus on reputational risk as applied in business. And second they appear similarly to be heavily centred on ExxonMobil’s response to the global energy transition as a priority. There remain several alarms which are raised at the corporation’s seeming wanton damage to the environment. These arise from the very essence of its operations; namely producing fossil fuels.

Readers will recall that in my column of March 13 I had pointedly observed ExxonMobil has been justifiably in my opinion quite brutally chastised in the social and mainstream media as representing possibly the worst and ugliest of ‘big oil global robber barons” when that grouping of firms constituted the dominant players in the world’s oil and gas [energy] market. This held true whether considered separately or taken collectively as the infamous big oil grouping of oil multinationals.

While that grouping remains today nowhere as commanding as it was decades ago the legacies of big oil excesses continue to haunt ExxonMobil going forward Further the detrimental role ExxonMobil is playing in global efforts to constrain the exponentially rising negative impacts of man-made global warming perhaps best illustrates this negativism. I’ll discuss some of these issues in today’s and next week’s column as I treat with ExxonMobil as a zombie plus corporation.

In what follows today I briefly highlight three reputational episodes I have previously raised in regard to ExxonMobil. I do this to illustrate the range and variety of reputational episodes or risks involving ExxonMobil outside of the main area of focus for its reputational risks; which as noted above is its dealings with the global energy transition. This will be directly addressed in detail in next week’s column.

Reputational episodes

Based on historical experiences there are many excellent reasons why reputational risk is considered the “business risk above all risks.” The reason for this is that such risks can appear literally from anywhere at any time and can destroy any business. ExxonMobil’s business risks while centred on its performance in regard to the global energy transition affects other areas as well. In this section I draw brief attention to four recent reputational episodes which I have previously flagged. The frequency of these episodes signals to my mind an aura of reputational frailty that surrounds the corporation today.

The first episode comes from my February 13 column’s reference to the activist assault on ExxonMobil’s Board of Directors. Writing under the compelling Header: “Exxon in Crisis Angry Shareholders are Rebelling” Matt Egan [CNN] had asserted “for decades ExxonMobil [was] an unstoppable machine and the envy of the oil industry.” By December 2020 “that machine has broken down” Activists [Engine 1 Church of England D E Shaw and the California Teachers Retirement System] fought for changes to the composition of the Board of Directors. This effort raised a hornet’s nest of alarms about the future of ExxonMobil going forward.

The second episode I reference here is the August 2020 removal of ExxonMobil as a component business in the computation of the Dow Jones stock index. This occurred after more than nine decades in that role. Not surprisingly there are investors who would ponder on the question why now? The third episode I reference here is similar; that is the 2021 reporting of the Fortune 500. There it is reported that ExxonMobil fell seven places from Number 3 to Number 10.

ExxonMobil’s Guidance

It would be useful for readers if at this juncture I report on ExxonMobil’s management guidance to its shareholders and stakeholders on the role management of reputational risk performs in the business. For the sake of complete accuracy I reproduce below the firm’s published guidance on February 5 2022.

ExxonMobil: Guidance on Reputation

“Our reputation is an important corporate asset. Factors that could have a negative impact on our reputation include an operating incident or significant cybersecurity disruption; changes in consumer views concerning our products; a perception by investors or others that the Corporation is making insufficient progress with respect to our ambition to lead in the energy transition or that pursuit of this ambition may result in allocation of capital to investments with reduced returns; and other adverse events such as those described in this document. Negative impacts on our reputation could in turn make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities obtain necessary regulatory approvals obtain financing attract talent or could reduce consumer demand for our branded products. ExxonMobil’s reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of our industry as a whole.”

Reuters had previously reported that EP was exploring a sale of oil-producing acreage in Utah in hopes of averting an FTC challenge to its agreed $1.5 billion takeover by private equity firm EnCap.

The FTC said the deal without the sale of the assets in Utah would have left just three significant producers that sell Uinta Basin crude oil to refiners in Salt Lake City and led to higher prices for consumers.

“Without this divestiture Salt Lake City refiners would likely have faced increased prices for Uinta Basin crude oil whether from EnCap alone or as part of a small group – and would likely try to pass on those costs to consumers” said Bureau of Competition Director Holly Vedova.

Under EnCap’s agreement with the FTC it will sell EP’s assets in Utah to Crescent Energy Company which will be a new competitor in the Uinta Basin the FTC said. That deal was announced in February.

EnCap Energy Capital Fund XI L.P. operates multiple portfolio companies involved in the energy sector particularly dealing with oil and gas operations that include exploration processing and distribution. EP Energy Corp. also headquartered in Texas has oil and natural gas production operations in the Uinta Basin in Utah and in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas.

The FTC has rarely opposed oil and gas producer mergers with the last challenge more than 20 years ago. It took the view that energy prices are driven by supply and demand worldwide rather than regional consolidation. Its opposition to EP Energy’s sale marks a potential change in stance.

Simply sign up to the Cyber Security myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Hotels and hospitality businesses are now the third most targeted by cyber attackers of all industry sectors. Despite being bricks-and-mortar enterprises — set up for physical enjoyment of their amenities — they have become a rich mine of data for hackers with nefarious intentions.

Before Covid-19 forced hotels into a two-year period of on-off closures they were the victims of 13 per cent of cyber compromises according to Trustwave’s 2020 Global Security Report — ranking just a little lower than retail and financial services companies.

And with hotels facing a difficult pandemic recovery and acute staff shortages the increased use of technology to replace face-to-face services such as check-in and on-site payments has only raised this risk.

“Historically hospitality has been a personal service but I think they have started to realise that technology can facilitate a lot of that” says Tristan Gadsby chief executive of hospitality consultancy Alliants.

13% Percentage of all cyber compromises suffered by hotels (source: Trustwave 2020 Global Security Report)

What would previously for example have been an in-person chat or phone conversation Gadsby notes is now more often a virtual chat exchange. “We are seeing three times as many messages being sent post-Covid compared to pre-Covid per guest.”

In a sign of the times the US commerce department last year issued its first set of guidelines for how hotels should secure customer data and critical software systems.

Meanwhile authorities monitoring Covid’s spread have also required more data from hotels — including guests’ contact details and health status.

Thomas Magnuson founder of Magnuson Hotels an umbrella company for hundreds of independent establishments says his company tries to take minimal information from guests as “sometimes when you travel you feel like it is the biggest data grab of all time”.

Hackers see international hotel chains which process a huge volume of transactions as easy pickings. Hotel groups also run valuable loyalty schemes with millions of members who give up their data in order to earn points and improve their stays.

One of the most high-profile cyber incidents in recent times was the breach of Starwood’s database in 2014 before the group was bought by Marriott the world’s largest hotel chain. That hack which was only discovered after the deal exposed the data of about half a billion customers Marriott said when it revealed the impact in 2018.

In a test case for Europe’s then relatively new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Marriott was subsequently fined £18.4mn by the UK data regulator acting on behalf of the EU — much less than the £99mn penalty originally threatened.

The volume of data that [hotels] have is legend therefore their data retention procedures need to be really up to scratch

Marriott — which says in its privacy statement that it collects 15 different types of data throughout a guest’s stay from email addresses to passport information and preferred languages — has since “redoubled” its efforts “to detect and respond to threats” according to Arno Van der Walt its chief information security officer.

The company sped up planned investment into data security and improved technology such as software that detects suspicious cyber behaviour in real time Van der Walt adds.

Yet hotels can be vulnerable to a range of cyber attacks from ransomware to more specific intrusions such as DarkHotel a type of hack that targets high-level business guests through a hotel’s WiFi network.

Luxury hotels are a particularly tantalising pool for criminals. In August 2020 scammers hacked into London’s Ritz hotel’s restaurant reservation system in an effort to convince guests to pass over their valuable payment details.

“The volume of data that [hotels] have is legend therefore their data retention procedures need to be really up to scratch” stresses Fedelma Good co-lead of PwC’s data protection practice.

As cloud computing services have expanded hotels have pushed more data storage towards external holders such as Amazon Web Services or Oracle — a move that at least means systems are being overseen by software experts executives say.

Many hoteliers additionally employ third-party agencies to manage credit card details and keep different forms of data separate: “At the press of a button I can tell what time [a guest] checked in what time he left what time he had lunch” says Sean McKeown company secretary of Irish hotel group Dalata. “I have CCTV but it’s not all in one place.”

However staying safe does not come cheap for already cash-strapped hotels. Gadsby says running just one penetration test to find vulnerabilities in computer systems can cost up to $25000.

Training staff is crucial. Several hotel executives point out that it is when staff are handling customer details that information is most likely to slip out.

“You wouldn’t dream of appointing an executive head chef who didn’t understand hygiene so why would I appoint a head of marketing who didn’t have an acute understanding of data protection?” asks McKeown. He says Dalata has spent tens of thousands on upgrading information security systems and training employees.

GDPR has forced companies to adopt much higher standards when it comes to data protection. But Good points out that for hotel groups with large cross-border footprints making sure they comply with regulations in every jurisdiction is “a real challenge”.

Magnuson believes hotels should simply demand less data and not monetise it in vast loyalty programmes as the big global chains do. Hilton for example raised $1bn during the pandemic just by selling advance loyalty points to its credit card partner American Express.

“They talk about their millions of rewards owners and number of associated points and those are specifically valued assets” Magnuson observes.

And with guests demanding an increasingly personalised and individually-tailored service particularly from the well-known hotel brands data is likely to remain a precious commodity in need of protection.

As Marriott expands online services — from phone notifications about when your room is ready to using your mobile to unlock your door — Van der Walt says the company remains “laser focused” on the increasingly complex cyber environment: “This is a race that doesn’t really have a finish line hacks remain a threat.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy53cmFuZ2xlcm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvbGl2aW4tci1yLXItcmlnaHQtbmV3LXctY2hhbmRsZXItYXJlYS1sdXh1cnktZGF5LWNhcmUtcGV0LWhvdGVsLWFpbXMtdG8tcGFtcGVyLXlvdXItcG9vY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Livin' r-r-r-right! New W. Chandler-area luxury day care/pet hotel aims to pamper your pooch,"By Meghann Sepulveda Special for Wrangler News

- Advertisement -

Parents of fur babies rejoice. A new doggie day care and luxury boarding facility will pamper all of your “upscale” pooches from West Chandler and South Tempe.

K9 Resorts Luxury Pet Hotel opened in February for four-legged friends to stay and play featuring spacious suites top-quality meals and an outdoor courtyard. It caters to West Chandler South Tempe and those who work in the vicinity of the Price Corridor. In other words your high-roller pooches.

Dog owners know firsthand that traveling out of town can be challenging. In addition to booking flights and hotels you also need a place for Fido to stay. With so many boarding options available it’s hard to know which to choose.

Dena Miller a West Chandler resident was thrilled to learn a new boarding and day care facility opened near her home. Her 2-year-old dog Toulouse a 13-pound Coton de Tulear had had a bad interaction with a German Shepard that left him frightened of other dogs.

“We tried other boarding and day care facilities in the past but Toulouse would always come back unsettled and wouldn’t eat for days” Miller said. “It would never go well.”

When she called K9 Resorts Luxury Pet Hotel the staff listened to her concerns and were accommodating.

“They were so kind and helpful” she said. “I decided to give it a shot.”

Early this month Toulouse went in for an evaluation. He came home happy.

“It was shocking” Miller said. “I couldn’t believe that we found a place that would actually be a good fit.”

Toulouse will likely be attending day care once a week to release energy and socialize with other dogs. In the summer Miller and her family will be traveling and plan to board Toulouse for several days.

“When you’re gone it’s comforting to know that your baby is safe” she said.

At K9 Resorts Luxury Pet Hotel on the northeastern corner of Dobson and Germann pet owners can select from three boarding options including the top-tier luxury suite for $85 a night that offers an 8-foot-by-8-foot cage-free space glass privacy doors premium bedding in-suite television entertainment high-quality meals and individual or group playtime.

“This option is our best seller” said Keith Nicholson franchise owner. “People consider their dogs members of the family and want them to be comfortable and feel at home.”

Smaller spaces – which also provide an abundant list of amenities – are offered in the executive suites priced less at $65 per night.

Those looking for a more-traditional boarding experience can select a standard ($48 per night) or double ($55 per night) compartment depending on the size of the dog. A 50 percent discount is available for multiple dogs that share a space during their stay.

High-quality HVAC units maintain proper temperatures and keep fresh clean air circulating throughout the facility and dehumidifiers control moisture.

Regardless of the breed all dogs enjoy freedom to frolic in fresh air. K9 Resorts Luxury Pet Hotel boasts a beautiful outdoor courtyard with two climbing structures a shaded area and faux grass.

“We use specially formulated artificial turf that’s not only durable but provides good filtration and is designed to be cooler in the hot summer months” Nicholson said.

Playtime ensures a pet’s physical well-being but also has emotional and behavioral advantages such as increasing mental energy lessening separation anxiety reducing destructive behavior building confidence and lowering digestive issues.

All dogs who are guests at K9 Resorts are carefully screened for temperament and must be current on vaccinations.

As more people are working from home with their canine colleagues many can’t give their precious pups the time and attention they need during the day. That’s also where a doggie day care comes in.

Its Tenants Hope for a Second Chance at Lloyd Center.,"Mark Benthimer can spot a disappearing act.

The owner of All-American Magic has endured no end of developer smoke and misdirection to sustain Portland’s last trick shop and longest-running magic show. He’d brought both to Mall 205 in 2011 after discovering that his store and stage at Jantzen Beach Super Center were scheduled for imminent demolition alongside the rest of the legendary entertainment hub.

At the start of this year Rhino Investment Group purchased the quietly renamed Marketplace 205 for $43 million while explaining that the recent departure of Bed Bath & Beyond lent the larger property “an exciting repositioning opportunity.” Benthimer reached out to one of the owners with questions about the mall’s future.

“The next morning” he laughs “there’s an email saying I had two weeks to leave.”

Benthimer and the handful of small local businesses remaining were eventually given until the end of March to relocate.

Foot traffic had all but died out within the mall after Target and Home Depot closed interior entrances to combat theft. Those two big boxes will continue to operate unchanged while the space inside will be divided between two new tenants—rumored to be Hobby Lobby and Burlington Coat Factory.

Mall 205′s last day as a mall is March 31.

“They ended up giving me till the end of the month but after 11 years you’d like a little more warning” Benthimer says. “I guess this is all legal. It sure is crappy I’ll tell you that.”

Rhino Investment Group did not respond to inquiries from WW.

Mall 205. (Aaron Mesh)

In a sense it’s surprising the place lasted so long. Air conditioning was the only advantage Mall 205 held over Lloyd Center. Once Clackamas Town Center opened it was just a matter of time.

Still unlike so many ’70s-era relics of consumerist folly this mall isn’t quite dead. At some point this week when the last vendor turns out the lights the new Marketplace 205 becomes something else: more retail hybrid than a big-box superstore but no longer fitting what a mall used to mean.

To be fair the history of Mall 205 has been little more than crappy owners making crappy decisions over 51 crappy years—longer even if you include the acreage beneath.

(In 1964 just five years before ground was broken on what would become 430000 square feet of retail space the expansive plot housed the West Coast’s largest private sanitarium—a de facto work farm awarded lavish federal subsidies with negligible oversight to serve as designated treatment facility for some 5000 Alaskan residents deemed mentally ill.)

Taking its name from a planned interchange between the just-completed Banfield Expressway and ill-fated Mount Hood Freeway the climate-controlled Mall 205 forged an identity (and brutalist-Levittown visual aesthetic) catering to the city that probably would have taken shape from a massive artery paving over old Portland to ease suburban commutes.

By the time COVID devastated all aspects of the industry Mall 205 may well have been past saving with only a handful of local storefronts remaining when the new owners pulled the plug.

“It was a dead mall” admits Moustapha Gueye who runs a kiosk called Demba. “Back when Target was opening their doors so people could walk inside we had a little traffic but not anymore. The DMV brings in their 200 people a day and that’s it.”

Best known around town for hawking leather goods and NBA and NFL memorabilia at Saturday Market most every weekend for more than a decade Gueye spends each summer setting up shop at state fairs across the Northwest for what he considers his primary business. Gueye had taken out a kiosk inside Mall 205 six years ago as means of combatting off-season restlessness and seemed to view the enterprise as equal parts storage facility and fraternal lodge.

“For some reason the people that used to own the building sold to another company who told us we have only a month to get the hell out of here” Gueye continued. “I didn’t actually even see the notice until Mark called. And then the nail shop didn’t know until the day after that because I had to tell them to check their email. The shoe guy next door was gone on vacation with his wife and I guess he’s just gone now. Thank God for Lloyd Center.”

For Benthime and Gueye the expulsion is the unwanted start of another journey. Their next destination? Another mall—one that many people have already written off for dead.

Just days after his retail world appeared to be crumbling without repair Benthimer pulled an ideal relocation target out of his hat. All-American Magic & Demba have become the latest tenants of Lloyd Center Mall.

“Every time I tell customers that I will be moving to Lloyd Center they are so surprised to hear it is still open” Gueye says. “When we went to sign our agreement I told the manager that lots of people still don’t know that Lloyd Center is open. And people want to know!”

Mall 205 kiosk. (Aaron Mesh)

While Mall 205′s peaks and valleys rarely registered with the average Portlander—even news of its ongoing demise seems to have come from another planet—the fate of Lloyd Center has been a mainstay of local chatter since back when Bobby Kennedy twirled round the ice rink.

“The media loves to kick Lloyd Center when they’re down” sighs Faith Jennings co-founder of eco-chic boutique Animal. Plant. Mineral. (and new neighbor of the incoming Bentheimer and Gueye).

Jennings was traveling outside the PDX coverage zone last Halloween when news broke of the Lloyd Center landlord’s shaky finances and repossession.

“One publication wrote the mall was being torn down—factually inaccurate complete fiction a sky-is-falling narrative in no way true—and news of the wrecking ball absolutely hurt holiday business” Jennings says. “And ‘Mall to Remain a Mall’ isn’t a great headline. Anyway what people really want to know is what’s going to happen and [new managers] haven’t announced anything.”

Jennings’ shop first came to Lloyd as one of 30 seasonal pop-ups brought inside the mall as part of the 2018 Lloyd Local program—a well-regarded effort to broaden perspectives on the potential of modern shopping centers via food court brewpubs immersive theater and a perhaps too aggressive visual rebranding.

Jennings admits the mall’s subsequent steep decline “felt like the Wild West. A couple key tenants leave the dominoes start to fall—boom boom boom. It was a little unnerving. See’s Candy closed their Lloyd location a week from Valentine’s Day which didn’t bode well.”

For Jennings the arrival of even a handful of local shopkeepers is a welcome change of pace under new ownership.

The idea that All-American Magic could somehow ferret out an acceptable storefront and kiosk and theater in less than two weeks seemed pretty much impossible. As it happened it took little more than two days for Benthimer to agree to terms on leasing former luxe whimsy merchant Brookstone’s showroom and he still had time enough to arrange the neighboring T-Mobile space for longtime mall-mate Gueye.

“It’s a big step up for us” says Benthimer. “There’s room to have the whole collection in one location. People will be able to go into the store and then enter the theater. It’s twice as big as we’ve ever had—4567 square feet even that sounds too good to be true. The new owners really are all about bringing Lloyd Center back. They want this place to thrive. And they understand there should be a place for families to do more than just shop for a blue light special.Malls need magic more than ever.”

Maybe it will work. In the land of nonprofit VHS rentals and booze-subsidized 8-bit arcades never bet against Portland exceptionalism propping up Orange Julius for generations to come.

“There is love for this place within Portland” says Jennings “and I think that does count for something.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmMxMC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FiYzEwLW9yaWdpbmFscy9zYWNyYW1lbnRvLXNxdWF0dGVycy1ib29taW5nLWhvdXNpbmctbWFya2V0LzEwMy04ZTUwYjI1Ni0yZGMyLTQ1ZGQtYjIzMy05YTZkMmYyZmY0NGLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'There's somebody in the house' | Squatters move into empty homes amid Sacramento's booming housing market,"After leaving the house empty for two weeks as they prepared to move from Daly City the Hodge family walked into their new home and found people living there.

SACRAMENTO COUNTY Calif. — Imagine moving into a home and realizing someone is already living there.

That's what happened to the Hodge Family after they battled Sacramento's competitive real estate market and finally got the keys to their newly renovated home in south Sacramento.

Unfortunately their situation with squatters is not uncommon.

""Squatters will find homes that are empty and they will move into it"" tenant and landlord attorney Calvin Clements said.

According to Redfin investment buyers bought 56.3% more homes in Sacramento in 2021 than in 2020 creating a lot of empty residences. Because of that people shopping for a home or looking to rent should be aware of squatters.

""We went after it"" Barry Hodge said. ""Upped our bid and everything... and we got it.""

The Hodge family worked hard to purchase a home in south Sacramento. They pinched their pennies and were outbid a number of times before finally being able to write their name on the dotted line as homeowners.

""Once we bought the house we were so excited"" said Anderson Nascimento Barry's son who plans to live in the home with his girlfriend. ""It was like the first house we ever bought.""

But after leaving the house empty for two weeks as they prepared for their move from Daly City they walked into the new home and found oranges on the floor and smelled burning plastic.

""And then I was like 'Oh... there's somebody in the house'"" Nascimento recalled.

They called the Sacramento police and waited out front. As they stood on the sidewalk they could see a figure standing in the doorway of their new home.

""Just staring at us from the house"" Nascimento said. ""And all he did was just close the door. I'm just like 'What is going on?'""

They estimate there were at least five squatters in the home for around a week. Squatters find empty homes like the Hodge's in a variety of ways.

While he didn't want to provide a ""how-to"" for squatters Clements thought it was important for homeowners and renters alike to know the dangers of them and how they operate.

""They might see a for-rent sign on the house"" Clements said. ""Others simply peruse the ads looking for foreclosure auctions.""

And once they're in the real problems begin.

""At that point the owner has an issue"" Clements said.

An issue Clements is far too familiar with as he has helped homeowners navigate this tricky situation for decades.

""I had one case recently (that) took over a year to get these individuals out of the home"" Clements said.

The Hodge family's case was the best of a worst-case scenario because the squatters were removed by Sacramento police. But not without a fight.

""They started telling the police it was their house"" Hodge said.

""He was like 'I have my own rights! I can stay in the house'"" Nascimento said. ""The cop was just not having it with him.""

It's a common claim squatters make.

""The occupants may claim they live there. They may have a phony lease that they show and at that point it becomes what the officers will call a civil problem"" Clements said. ""Meaning you the landlord need to handle that yourself.""

To handle it you or an attorney have to serve a written notice and evict them through the court often a two-month process. Some crafty squatters file delaying motions with the court to prolong the process.

""And then if the inhabitants know what they're doing they can draw that process out for three months six months or longer"" Clements said.

Realty Roundup Property Manager Jim Miller has 2000-plus properties from Stockton to Roseville. He said with the COVID pandemic they only did virtual tours and took down for-rent signs helping prevent squatters.

""We now just do virtual tours... we don't do signage anymore"" Miller said. ""So you're not seeing if you will an abandoned house.""

But the other thing he has experienced is when a squatter poses as the landlord renting out an empty home and collecting deposits.

""I've experienced a couple myself where the homes were rented illegally"" Miller said. ""Where there had been deposits and rents taken down payments and people show up with the moving van to start moving in... and they can't get in.""

Miller said he's seen some cases where defrauded tenants have gotten into the apartment or home they believe to be theirs which causes an even bigger problem as the property managers like Miller now have to go through a lengthy legal process to get those renters out lawfully.

Either way the fake landlord has vanished.

""I feel sorry for them because normally they can't find who they rented the home from"" Miller said.

For squatters who move into the home themselves it often leads to damage.

""Even when you get the property back you're now faced with tens of thousands of dollars of property damage"" Clements said.

It's something Nascimento and Hodge dealt with. They found a mess of food feces vomit and a huge amount of clothes in multiple rooms including a picked apart bike being burned in the fireplace the cause of the plastic smell the family first encountered when entering the home.

After the squatters were removed by police being charged with trespassing the Hodge family were left to clean and fix everything. They immediately went to Home Depot and spent over 16 hours cleaning the home.

The family also had to repair:

multiple broken windows

a melted down part of their stove as the burner was left on

destroyed shower handles

a flooded dishwasher

The squatters also left behind some alarming items like knives and drugs as well legal paperwork outlining their rights.

""These people are not stupid. They know what they're doing"" Hodge said. ""We have a lot of compassion (for the homeless). But when it's in your face and it's happening to you in the moment it's difficult to handle.""

Long-term returns are determined by a few key traits and investors should focus on them. Stocks with unique potential usually have exceptional growth catalysts and wide economic moats. These three stocks all have clear avenues for rapid growth along with sustainable competitive advantages creating serious long-term upside.

1. Veeva Systems

Veeva Systems (VEEV -0.15%) is the cloud software leader for the life sciences industry. Its list of more than 1200 customers includes pharmaceutical companies biotechs research organizations and device manufacturers. They range from early-stage drug candidates to the largest enterprises in the world -- almost all of the 20 biggest pharmaceutical companies are Veeva customers.

Veeva's suite of products is vital to various stages of the lifecycle of business in its target industries. Customers rely on the software during development and clinical trials for data collection management reporting analysis and regulatory compliance. Veeva is also an important vendor for sales and marketing functions with customer relationship management software and data analytics tools.

The company has a wide economic moat which is key to its long-term investment narrative. Its dominance of the life sciences niche helps protect it from competition from more generalized players such as Salesforce.com or any smaller disruptors with the same industry focus. Veeva has clear evidence that its customers are finding value in its services and expanding their relationship with the company. Its retention rate on subscription revenue is 119% and the average number of products per customer rose from 1.71 to 2.71 over the past five years.

On top of that Veeva has every chance to outpace the market in growth. Its revenue expanded 26% in the most recent fiscal year. The life sciences industry is outpacing global economic growth which should translate to more opportunities for Veeva. The company can build on that by layering in new products for existing customers. There's also the long-term prospect of expanding to adjacent markets though that would come with its own set of new challenges and expenses.

It's not a cheap stock with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio around 50 but that's not expensive enough to stop growth investors who are in it for the long haul.

2. ServiceNow

ServiceNow (NOW 1.38%) offers cloud-based software that automates workflows and other business processes. Its customers can unlock productivity from employees and achieve better efficiency across their entire organizations. That's an obvious value proposition and ServiceNow has an especially strong presence in the IT operations realm -- that's a great space to occupy as the digital transformation trend continues to dominate the business world.

The company has nearly 1400 customers with annual contracts surpassing $1 million -- that's a great sign for long-term stability. The company boasts a net retention rate around 125% proving its ability to keep its customers and build on those relationships with additional services such as HR customer service and other administrative functions. High switching costs and deep relationships are important elements of an economic moat and they're a shield against competition.

ServiceNow has publicly disclosed its goal to surpass $15 billion in annual revenue by 2026 which requires 20% annual compound growth. It certainly seems possible for the company which smashed its own guidance by growing 29% in the most recent quarter. It also reported nearly 30% growth in ""current remaining performance obligations"" which is a strong indicator of short-term sales growth.

The stock is expensive with a forward P/E ratio of 76 and a price-to-sales ratio near 20.

It's no surprise investors have to pay a premium for that upside potential but make sure you're prepared for the risks and volatility inherent in stocks with premium valuations.

3. Home Depot

Home Depot (HD -0.16%) leads the home improvement retail market. The long-term upside proposition here is a bit different from the growth stocks above.

Home building has strong long-term catalysts in the U.S. Since the collapse of the housing market nearly 15 years ago there have been over five million more households created than new homes built.

This problem has been further complicated by mass relocations and urban flight throughout the pandemic. It's an especially acute problem for lower-income people and families who are being priced out of their hometowns.

Rising interest rates input price inflation and overall economic uncertainty are creating some negativity around home-builder stocks right now but these are all temporary issues. That's nothing new for this cyclical industry. Ultimately the massive housing deficit should be a long-term catalyst for both home builders and their suppliers for at least a decade. Home Depot benefits in general from construction and people moving -- that impact should be even greater after the company reacquired contractor supply business HD Supply in Nov. 2020.

This is a chance for value investors to zig where others zag. Home Depot could have a rough few quarters coming up and the stock is taking a beating. However the company won't be going out of business. You can enjoy a 2.4% dividend yield while you wait for long-term cash flows to push Home Depot's market cap higher.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5vbGVtaXNzLmVkdS9pbWMtY29ubmVjdC10by1icmluZy1pbmR1c3RyeS1leHBlcnRzLXRvLWNhbXB1cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IMC Connect! to Bring Industry Experts to Campus,"by

They’re among the top 25 producers of sales tax revenue that pays for the city services residents rely on.

City officials said the improving economy could boost sales tax revenue to record highs projected to reach $16 million for the 2021- 22 fiscal year ending in June.

During the 2019-20 fiscal year which was negatively affected by COVID-19 lockdowns sales tax revenues dipped to $13.3 million down from $14.7 million the year before the pandemic started.

The City Council Economic Development and Land Use Committee heard a report on the latest sales tax figures during a March 16 meeting.

Finance Director Mark Uribe told the Camarillo Acorn after the meeting that the numbers indicate that consumers are in a mood to shop.

“What the trends are showing is in general a strong economic recovery” he said.

Restaurants hit hard by the pandemic are among the businesses showing strong sales growth. Gasoline sales are also up as more people decide it’s safe to travel.

Uribe said the Camarillo Premium Outlets generate about 40% of the city’s sales tax revenue. Stores at the mall included in the city’s top 25 sales tax producers include outlets selling goods by Ralph Lauren Calvin Klein and Michael Kors.

“Historically the outlet mall has been a huge success for the city in terms of generating sales tax dollars” Uribe said.

Retailers are also having an easier time getting products from overseas that were hard for them to obtain last holiday season Uribe said.

“The supply chain issues that were going on are starting to wane. So that’s also helping contribute to the rebound in the economy” he said.

The city’s general fund budget was about $45 million in the last fiscal year with 37% generated by sales tax revenue. The other main sources of general fund revenue include property taxes hotel bed taxes and business taxes.

An area of concern city leaders are watching is the Russian invasion of Ukraine which has sent economic shock waves across the globe.

“ We are monitoring the Ukraine situation and at this point do not have any measurable impacts but we’re keeping an eye on that” the finance director said."
HON,Honeywell,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3JvYm90aWNzYW5kYXV0b21hdGlvbm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvaG9uZXl3ZWxsLXBhcnRuZXJzLXdpdGgtb3R0by1tb3RvcnMtdG8tZGV2ZWxvcC1yb2JvdGljLXNvbHV0aW9ucy1mb3Itc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMvNDk5Njkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Honeywell partners with Otto Motors to develop robotic solutions for supply chain operations – Robotics & Automation ...,"Honeywell has agreed a strategic collaboration with Otto Motors a division of Clearpath Robotics giving warehouses and distribution centers throughout North America an automated option to handle some of the most labor-intensive roles in an increasingly scarce job market.

The collaboration enables Honeywell customers to increase efficiency reduce errors and improve safety by deploying Otto’ autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in their facilities.

These AMRs provide significant productivity benefits by automating the movement of carts used to transport picked orders or returns and can travel over any floor surface smooth enough to handle a traditional cart pushed by a worker.

Instead of spending more than half the day walking workers can simply park carts in designated pickup locations throughout the facility and call robots to retrieve them.

These AMRs also offer a flexible and powerful way to transport pallets typically accomplished primarily with forklifts and conveyor systems.

Keith Fisher president of Honeywell Intelligrated says: “Supply chains continue to be stressed by staffing shortages and consumer demands driving expectations of speedy and accurate fulfillment.

“Tackling the more dynamic unstructured environments of today’s distribution centers calls for more sophisticated robots and Otto’s AMRs have been proven to be deployed and adapted quickly to changing market conditions or peak buying seasons.”

Otto’s easy-to-install AMRs are smart enough to interact safely with human co-workers and other vehicles find a different route if their original path is blocked and respond to rapid changes in orders or logistics needs — all without human intervention.

Otto AMRs can work in conjunction with Honeywell automated solutions including its Smart Flexible Depalletizer and next-gen AS/RS system further increasing efficiency and automation within the warehouse.

Matt Rendall CEO and co-founder of Otto Motors says: “Otto Motors provides autonomous material handling inside manufacturing facilities and warehouses and is the technology behind some of the largest deployments of AMRs in North America.

“Our relationship with Honeywell shows we partner with the very best integrators and tech leaders to provide business with industry expertise to automate a wide range of workflows in their facilities.”

While AMRs handle repetitive and often time-consuming tasks increasingly scarce labor resources can be shifted to higher-value jobs. This alone delivers multiple benefits such as boosting

worker satisfaction while reducing injuries and turnover rates.

The pandemic and its lasting effects on labor shortages is causing companies to reconsider the way they operate. A Honeywell study revealed more than half of companies are more willing to invest in automation because of the pandemic and its lasting effects.

The same study showed companies see increased speed of tasks greater productivity and increased employee utilization and productivity as the top three potential benefits from automation.

Robot sales in North America had the strongest year ever in 2021 as more industries look to automation to increase productivity and alleviate ongoing labor shortages according to the Association for Advancing Automation.

The industry association revealed that while companies are expanding their applications of robotics and automation throughout their facilities many first-time users are increasingly turning to robotics to stay productive and competitive.

The Otto Motors collaboration gives Honeywell customers a complete suite of fixed and mobile robotics solutions backed by expert systems integration solutions development and reliable 24/7 technical support.

Today organizations are judged not just for their use of new technologies but also for how they are working towards reducing their carbon emissions and promoting sustainability.

Most industries today are adopting greener technologies to reduce their carbon emissions. In the oil and gas industry sustainability is becoming increasingly vital with more companies committing to carbon-neutral energy solutions.

In Malaysia Petronas has collaborated with Honeywell on the development of carbon-neutral energy solutions in process technologies industrial automation and plant digitalization of its operations.

The collaboration aims to strengthen operations optimization and support emissions reduction efforts to deliver cleaner energy solutions in support of the companies’ common sustainability goals and line with Petronas’ Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) aspiration.

According to Bacho Pilong Petronas Senior Vice President of Project Delivery & Technology the partnership will be a catalyst for Petronas’ growth agenda.

“We believe it will inspire more collaborations among major industry and technology players to collectively deliver a carbon-neutral future through a flourishing ecosystem of innovation – where solutions can be delivered at a pace to counter the many challenges we face” said Pilong.

For Norman Gilsdorf Honeywell President of ASEAN the solutions will support Petronas in achieving the highest standards of accuracy reliability profitability and security.

The sustainable solutions to be embraced include Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCS) technology digital twin and remote autonomous operations in achieving productivity excellence and strategic growth in a low-carbon manner.

The collaboration also marks one of the first of its kind in harmonizing processes and business analytics into an integrated cutting-edge technology and 5G-enabled secured asset operations for Petronas. It also supports Petronas’ pursuits in the key areas of cybersecurity as well as leadership and capability management.

At the same time Petronas’ technology commercialization arm Petronas Technology Ventures will be jointly developing robotic inspection devices and scale utilization in the oil and gas industry with Waygate Technologies Robotics AG (WTR).

Based on the BIKE robotic system the device enables improved data management and inspection of confined or hard-to-reach spaces in oil and gas facilities – onshore and offshore. The enhanced technology includes a cleaning tool as well as additional ultrasonic and eddy current inspection capabilities. Petronas will deploy the updated BIKE robot in more facilities while WTR will provide comprehensive training and support services.

WTR Executive General Manager of Visual & Robotic Inspection Solutions Michael Domke said “Our R&D teams have been working closely together to tailor our robotic BIKE platform to their specific challenges. The result is a solution that will allow Petronas to minimize safety risks for their personnel as well as the overall downtime of their assets around the globe.”

The companies are also co-developing two new versions of the tool the BIKE I-Beam designed to overcome specific obstacles and sharp edges in confined spaces and a micro crawler version to facilitate inspection of smaller pipes.

The agreement seals another milestone in WTR’s strategy to strengthen its automated data caption capabilities and drive innovations that will enhance its customers’ productivity and competitiveness. Robotic inspection solutions are part of its mission as part of the energy technology ecosystem to make energy operations safer and more efficient for people and the planet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcGxhdGZvcm1vbmxpbmUudWsvcG9zdHMva2VuLWxvYWNoLWZpbG0tdHJpby1jYXRoeS1jb21lLWhvbWUtbGFkeWJpcmQtc29ycnktd2UtbWlzc2VkLXlvddIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ken Loach film trio: Some things never change,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAyMjAzLzI2L1dTNjIzZTdmOThhMzEwZmQyYjI5ZTUzNzVmLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Expert: Black boxes take time to study - Chinadaily.com.cn,"One of two 'black box' recorders discovered from crashed plane in Tengxian Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region on March 23 2022. [Photo/Xinhua]

Black boxes are usually easily found after air crashes because of their colorful exterior and signal but it generally takes months to complete a report of their content according to a civil aviation expert.

When black boxes are recovered in fairly good condition investigators can analyze and produce a report on their content in about three months but it can take much longer when they are damaged said Li Xiaojin a professor from the Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin.

One of the black boxes from the crashed China Eastern Airlines Flight MU5735 was found on Wednesday and sent to Beijing for analysis said Zhu Tao head of aviation safety for the Civil Aviation Administration of China. The other black box has not yet been recovered.

Both were made by Honeywell in the United States.

The black box that was found contained the cockpit voice recorder and the missing one holds the flight data recorder－with information including altitude speed and heading.

A preliminary investigation at the crash site determined the exterior of the black box with the cockpit voice recorder was seriously damaged and the inner storage units were damaged to a lesser degree. But the device seemed to be in relatively good shape according to the CAAC.

""It takes time to decode the flight recorder. If the storage units were damaged it may take longer"" Zhu said at a news conference on Wednesday.

Mao Yanfeng director of the CAAC's disaster investigation agency said at a news conference on Friday that they are unable to offer a timetable at this stage on completing the black box's data download and analysis work.

Li of the Civil Aviation University said that based on the information on damage to the first black box it would likely take longer to analyze and report on the cockpit voice recorder.

""Based on the current technological development there is no technical difficulty in decoding and analyzing data from the flight recorder. In addition to the investigation team from China Boeing－the aircraft's maker－and Honeywell may also participate in the investigation"" he said.

The investigation will also involve information collected at the crash site and experimental verification said Shu Ping director of the China Academy of Civil Aviation Science and Technology's Aviation Safety Institute.

For example he said if at the crash site a tree branch was seen to be pulled inside the engine investigators can determine that the engine was running before hitting the ground. But the flight data recorder would be needed to establish the speed of the engine.

""Many objects at the crash site could be used to analyze the situation such as the condition of the engine system"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJpbnQuaW4vZW52aXJvbm1lbnQveW91ci1hc3RobWEtaW5oYWxlci1oZWxwcy1nbG9iYWwtd2FybWluZy1oZXJlcy1ob3ctYS1ncmVlbi1pbmhhbGVyLWNhbi1oZWxwLzg4OTE4NC_SAXdodHRwczovL3RoZXByaW50LmluL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L3lvdXItYXN0aG1hLWluaGFsZXItaGVscHMtZ2xvYmFsLXdhcm1pbmctaGVyZXMtaG93LWEtZ3JlZW4taW5oYWxlci1jYW4taGVscC84ODkxODQvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Your asthma inhaler helps global warming. Here’s how a ‘green inhaler’ can help,"So leading pharmaceutical companies have come up with alternatives that they say are just as effective at tackling asthma – the most common chronic disease in children – without harming the atmosphere.

UK-based GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) says the carbon footprint from 100 puffs of a traditional aerosol metered-dose inhaler (MDI) is the same as that of a 290-kilometre car drive . It’s all because of the fluorinated gases used as “propellants” in this type of inhaler to help deliver drugs into patients’ lungs.

GSK is instead advocating the use of dry powder inhalers where the patient sucks in the medication. Emissions from this type of inhaler are 18 times lower than from an MDI the company says.

It has been estimated that asthma inhalers account for 3.5% of the carbon emissions of the UK health service. GSK says the UK is over-reliant on MDIs which account for 70% of all inhaler prescriptions. By contrast in Sweden MDIs make up just 10% of inhalers in use.

Choosing the right inhaler

Back in 2019 the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence launched a tool for patients to help them choose an inhaler that’s right for them and the environment."

Despite a slight dip in net income the company maintains a strong balance sheet with increased EBITDAre.

Strategic divestitures and a focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels position Host for competitive advantage.

On May 3 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

Under U.S. GAAP costs to develop units for resale are considered an operating activity on the statement of cash flows and categorized as inventory. This spend is separate from payments for capital expenditures which are considered investing activities.



Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

For a discussion of items that may affect forecast results see the Notes to Financial Information.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

The acquisition price represents a 12.6x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 7.4 percent on the property’s 2024 estimated results. Other terms were not disclosed.

The property is expected to be among Host’s top-25 assets based on estimated full year 2024 results with expected combined RevPAR of $275 total RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $585502 further improving the quality of the company’s portfolio.

“We are excited to add the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown to our portfolio and establish a presence in one of the country’s most exciting cities"" Host Hotels & Resorts President and CEO James Risoleo said in a statement. ""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive RevPAR CAGR of 7.7 percent from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. A major leisure destination and the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States Nashville also has a recently expanded airport and a new stadium that is expected to attract more entertainment and sporting events. With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the Property will generate outsized growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders.”

The newly built LEED Silver property opened in 2022 and is located two blocks from numerous live music and entertainment venues in Nashville’s famed Lower Broadway entertainment district. The Property stands directly across from the Music City Convention Center adjacent to the Bridgestone arena home of the NHL Nashville Predators and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum Vanderbilt University Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. The MCCC has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events and it has promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium home of the NFL Tennessee Titans is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium’s dome will allow for year-round activation beginning with the 2027 season. In addition the Nashville International Airport is the fastest growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33 percent above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added six international gates and eight satellite gates and another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway with completion expected in 2028.

The Property has a combined 721 oversized rooms that average approximately 500 square feet with a 75 percent suite mix. It offers seven separate food and beverage outlets including Harriet’s Rooftop which provides guests with exclusive views of Music City’s skyline in an elevated nightlife setting.

The company expects the Property to stabilize between approximately 10-12x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 time frame.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNjYxMzU0OC9ob3N0LWhvdGVscy1yZWFkeS10by1idXktd2lsbGluZy10by1raWNrLWRlYWxzLWxvb3Nl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Hotels Ready To Buy Willing To 'Kick Deals Loose',"Executives at the largest hospitality-focused public real estate investment trust are itching to spend money this year.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

Development of this legendary series kicked off in 1955 when engineers realized that the new 265 ci (4.3 liters) small-block V8 was not powerful nor reliable enough (under high-rpm usage) for the division’s future vehicles - specifically its trucks and larger passenger cars. A bigger motor was a must so the brightest engineering minds available in Chevy’s fold teamed up to create one. Many think that it was just a larger block version of the 265 but in fact the W featured a radically different design.Released in 1958 the engine was devised to be enlargeable for increased displacement applications as well as higher compression ratios but remained sufficiently compact (by 1950s standards) to fit inside the engine bays of passenger cars. The iron block’s decks were angled at 74 degrees from the crankshaft centerline while a wedge-shaped  16-degree combustion chamber stood between the top of each piston and the flat head face. This chamber design was inspired by the in-cylinder layout of the revolutionary 283-ci (4.6-liter) small-block introduced a year earlier.The 348-ci (5.7-liter) naturally-aspirated big-block was curiously dubbed Turbo-Trust and was originally conceived for trucks but as I mentioned before engineers were also aiming to use it on several passenger car models. To make it suitable for both applications they came up with a simple trick in the form of a relief groove was cut into the top of the cylinder wall. This feature was present on the blocks that were intended for trucks to help lower the compression ratio whereas those built for cars had conventional cylinder walls which together with various height piston dome configurations favored higher compression ratios.The 348 weighed about 125 pounds (56.7 kg) more than the 283 small-block but the added weight translated into a bombproof block with cylinders that ended up being almost invulnerable to pre-ignition.In terms of dimensions the Turbo-Thrust was 1.7 inches (4.3 cm) longer 3 inches (7.6 cm) wider and 0.80-inch (2 cm) lower than its small-block siblings so it was easy to install in Chevy cars such as the Impala Biscayne or Delray.With a four-barrel 450-cfm carburetor the base engine produced 250 hp. Next in line was the Super Turbo-Thrust that came with three two-barrel 225-cfm carbs. Under usual driving conditions only the center carburetor worked but when the gas pedal was pushed with real purpose a vacuum switch awoke the other two carburetors that improved power to 280 horses. The top 1958 version named Special Turbo-Thrust was equipped with a single four-barrel carb and was capable of 305 hp.For 1959 and 1960 high-output editions of the top two engines were produced with 320 hp and 335 hp respectively. 1960 also saw the introduction of a 315-hp Special Super Turbo-Thrust that was upgraded with mechanical lifters and triple two-barrel carburetors. In 1961 the last year of production for the 348 power was increased again to 340 hp for the single four-barrel and 350 hp for the triple-carb unit.For the 1961 model year Chevy unleashed a larger-displacement variant of the W-series. Bored and stroked to 409 ci (6.7 liters) it debuted in the Impala SS (Super Sport) with a single four-barrel carburetor and could produce 360 hp then 380 hp in 1962.A dual four-barrel version followed spitting out no less than 409 hp thus developing 1 hp per cubic inch. It had a forged steel crankshaft and a beefed-up aluminum intake. In 1963 output for this variant reached 425 hp thanks to a compression ratio of 11:1 and a solid lifter camshaft. The 409 was available through mid-1965 when it was replaced by the 396-ci (6.5-liter) Mark IV.The holy grail of the W-series was a special 427-ci (7.0-liter) version of the 409 that could be ordered with the drag-oriented Chevrolet Regular Production Option (RPO) Z11 for the 1963 Impala Sport Coupe. Conservatively rated at 430 hp this engine was fitted to only fifty Z11 Impalas.Although it was in service for less than a decade the W paved the way for a long line of Chevy big-blocks including the highly successful 427-ci (7.0-liter) Mark IV or its race-bred ZL1 sibling. Today both 348 and 409 versions are still around enjoying legendary status among the hot rod community for their reliability and ease of tuning. The list of aftermarket hardware still available for the W is so extensive that you can build one from scratch without requiring a single OEM component.If you would like to know more about this iconic powerplant we recommend the video below posted on YouTube by OldCarMemories.com.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoaXMtaXMtaG93LW11Y2gtYS0yMDE3LXBvcnNjaGUtOTExLXR1cmJvLXMtY29zdHMtdG9kYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Is How Much A 2017 Porsche 911 Turbo S Costs Today,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoaXMtaXMtaG93LW11Y2gtYS0yMDE3LXBvcnNjaGUtOTExLXR1cmJvLXMtY29zdHMtdG9kYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lnaHRuZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9vLXNob3ctdG8tYmUtZmlyc3QtcHVibGljLXNob3dpbmctb2YtYXVzc2llLW1hZGUtaHAtb2N0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,O-Show to be first public showing of Aussie-made HP-OCT,"Cylite has confirmed the first public showing of its Australian-made HP-OCT with Focus software will take place at O-Show in May.

The system uses patented Hyperparallel OCT technology to simultaneously scan 1008 individual beamlets across the eye to produce a scanning speed of greater than 300000 scans per second.

The Melbourne-based company said this enables it to minimise the effect of eye motion artefacts and build highly accurate three-dimensional volumetric scans of the anterior and posterior segments.

The award-winning HP-OCT is scheduled to be launched in the latter half of 2022 and O-Show is the first time the Australian optometry eyecare community will be able to see it in a public forum.

It will be displayed on booth #84 along with its new software platform called Focus which is designed to both drive the HP-OCT as well as manage the patient database.

“Visitors to the Cylite booth will for the first time have the opportunity to take part in a demonstration of the HP-OCT and to experience the capabilities of the device” senior product manager Mr Matthew Wensor said.

“In addition to commonly used OCT applications the three-dimensional volume scans are designed to produce micron-resolution topographical maps of ocular structures including the cornea which notably are not influenced by the quality of the tear film due to the OCT capture method. This capability promises to be a great advantage for contact lens fitting including ortho-K and scleral contact lenses” he said.

In the same scan biometric parameters for the purposes of myopia management are also generated including axial length keratometry central corneal thickness anterior chamber depth lens thickness white-to-white and pupil diameter.

“We are really looking forward to showing off our new technology and giving the Australian eyecare community its first glimpse of what’s to come” Wensor said.

IBM sold its AI-based Watson Health to a private equity firm earlier this year for what analysts describe as salvage value. Could this transaction signal a third AI winter?

Artificial intelligence has been with us longer than most people realize reaching a mass audience with Rosey the Robot in the 1960s TV show “The Jetsons.” This application of AI—the omniscient maid who keeps the household running—is the science fiction version. In a healthcare setting artificial intelligence is limited.

Intended to operate in a task-specific manner the concept is similar to real-world scenarios like when a computerized machine beats a human chess champion. Chess is structured data with predefined rules for where to move how to move and when the game is won. Electronic patient records upon which artificial intelligence is based are not suited to the neat confines of a chess board.

Collecting and reporting accurate patient data is the problem. MedStar Health sees sloppy electronic health records practices harming doctors nurses and patients. The hospital system took initial steps to focus public attention on the issue in 2010 and the effort continues today. MedStar’s awareness campaign usurps the “EHR” acronym turning it into “errors happen regularly” to make the mission clear.

Analyzing software from leading EHR vendors MedStar found entering data is often unintuitive and displays make it confusing for clinicians to interpret information. Patient records software often has no connection to how doctors and nurses actually work prompting yet more errors.

Examples of medical data errors appear in medical journals the media and court cases and they range from faulty code deleting critical information to mysteriously switching patient genders. Since there is no formal reporting system there is no definitive number of data-driven medical errors. The high probability that bad data is dumped into artificial intelligence applications derails its potential.

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

Developing artificial intelligence starts with training an algorithm to detect patterns. Data is entered and when a large enough sample is realized the algorithm is tested to see if it correctly identifies certain patient attributes. Despite the term “machine learning” which implies a constantly evolving process the technology is tested and deployed like traditional software development. If the underlying data is correct then properly trained algorithms will automate functions making doctors more efficient.

Take for example diagnosing medical conditions based on eye images. In one patient the eye is healthy; in another the eye shows signs of diabetic retinopathy. Images of both healthy and “sick” eyes are captured. When enough patient data is fed into the artificial intelligence system the algorithm will learn to identify patients with the disease.

Andrew Beam a professor at Harvard University with private sector experience in machine learning presented a troubling scenario of what could go wrong without anybody even knowing it. Using the eye example above let’s say as more patients are seen more eye images are fed into the system which is now integrated into the clinical workflow as an automated process. So far so good. But let’s say images include treated patients with diabetic retinopathy. Those treated patients have a small scar from a laser incision. Now the algorithm is tricked into looking for small scars.

Adding to the data confusion doctors don’t agree among themselves on what thousands of patient data points actually mean. Human intervention is required to tell the algorithm what data to look for and it is hard coded as labels for machine reading. Other concerns include EHR software updates that can create errors. A hospital may switch software vendors resulting in what is called data shift when information moves elsewhere.

That’s what happened at MD Anderson Cancer Center and was the technical reason why IBM’s first partnership ended. IBM’s then-CEO Ginni Rometty described the arrangement announced in 2013 as the company’s healthcare “moonshot.” MD Anderson’s stated in a press release that it would use Watson Health in its mission to eradicate cancer. Two years later the partnership failed. To go forward both parties would have had to retrain the system to understand data from the new software. It was the beginning of the end for IBM’s Watson Health.

Artificial intelligence in healthcare is only as good as the data. Precision management of patient data is not science fiction or a “moonshot” but it is essential for AI to succeed. The alternative is a promising healthcare technology becoming frozen in time.

In late 2019 Dawn Isabel was on the hunt for glitches and vulnerabilities in a particular mobile application. She was taking part in the app maker’s “bug bounty” programme — the development stage when a business hires hackers to find weaknesses in its systems.

“On TV it looks exciting with lots of bright green text and six screens” Isabel says of the way this work is sometimes portrayed. “In reality it’s me hunched at my laptop for hours straight scrolling.”

But eventually Isabel — who also works full time as the director of research at mobile security company NowSecure — “hit the jackpot”. She discovered a devastating vulnerability in the app and soon collected a tidy five-figure sum as a reward.

It is this work by so-called ethical hackers that helps to protect the companies — from Big Tech giants such as Google Microsoft and Facebook through to bootstrapped start-ups — against nefarious digital actors. And it has proven increasingly lucrative for those taking on the task.

“Companies have been opening up more and more” says Tanner Emek a 32-year-old ethical hacker. Over the past four years he estimates to have made $1mn in bug bounties.

These typically range from the thousands to the hundreds of thousands of dollars. “Not only are more companies running bug bounty programmes the scope seems to be getting wider as well” he adds.

According to Bill Conner chief executive of cyber security group SonicWall ethical hacking which has existed since the 1970s is evolving.

Not only are more companies running bug bounty programmes the scope seems to be getting wider as well

It used to focus on a “single purpose”. This might be for example a penetration test — a simulated cyber attack on a computer system to expose flaws — or vulnerability hunting in products. “But now it’s also gone to [testing] your business network your internal network for vulnerabilities” Conner adds. “It’s gone to phishing and email testing. It’s gone to cloud testing. It’s become a fully fledged business.”

This development comes as cyber crime has continued to grow rapidly during the shift to remote working. In particular ransomware attacks — whereby hackers lock up data or computer systems until they are given a pay off — have become one of the biggest cyber security headaches for the private and public sectors in the past two years.

IT and supply chain industries have been targeted as well as critical infrastructure — such as the Colonial Pipeline which was hacked last year disrupting US fuel supplies for several days. Applications connected to the “Internet of Things” have proved vulnerable too.

Nation state cyber attacks also continue apace with attacks rising particularly amid the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Marten Mickos chief executive of HackerOne — which matches companies with potential ethical hackers — says his business has 1.5mn hackers signed up to its platform.

“There are a lot of young people who are growing up pretty disillusioned with this world” explains Mickos “and they’ve been gamers all their youth.” It turns out that “they are the best experts” he says.

He considers HackerOne one of the biggest bug bounty platforms alongside cyber security group Bugcrowd to be a “conveyor of trust” which vets and then vouches for the skills and reputations of the hackers who sign up.

Mickos believes the sector is becoming “more professional”. Ethical hacking education and certifications are emerging as features of it with governments also encouraging programmes.

On top of individual ethical hackers that sign up with platforms there are also teams within cyber security organisations that do similar work on behalf of clients.

Charles Henderson global head of IBM’s hacking unit X-Force Red

Charles Henderson global head of IBM’s hacking unit X-Force Red says his team recorded a 33 per cent rise in the number of network compromises caused by vulnerability exploitation in 2021 compared with the previous year.

He argues however that the focus should not “just be about keeping attackers out but testing that you can detect hackers once they’re in”.

This is a different art. Hackers may quickly fire out attacks but once they are inside a network they will move slowly and deliberately to avoid being noticed. “When they are in are you going to know they’re there?” Henderson says.

Making it harder for adversaries to move within systems requires strong authentication tools to ensure that employees are who they say they are and are not given unfettered access to systems and data they do not need. This is particularly important as some companies will allow third parties in their sprawling supply chains to access their systems.

“Threat actors in ransomware exploits look at the attack surface and how well things are hidden behind Chinese Walls” says Ondrej Krehel head of digital forensics and incident response at cyber security monitoring platform SecurityScorecard. “And they will also look at how authentication and authorisation will work.”

But offensive cyber security has limits and grey areas warns Maya Horowitz research director of Check Point a cyber security provider. Some advocate “hacking the hackers” — also known as hacking back — but this is against the law in most countries she notes.

It is also possible that ethical hackers could leak information on vulnerabilities to the press or other hackers before a company has time to fix it. The risk of hackers being drawn in by lucrative criminal activity remains real. “Hacking tools are sold on the dark web” Horowitz notes which for hackers can enable activities that are “more profitable than bug bounty programmes”."

At the one-year mark teens and adults with nonsegmental vitiligo who received Opzelura throughout Incyte’s late-stage TRuE-V study saw “clinically meaningful facial and total body repigmentation.” Specifically greater proportions of patients hit facial and body endpoints on a measure of depigmentation severity called the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index Incyte said Saturday at the American Academy of Dermatology’s 2022 annual meeting in Boston.

Vitiligo is a condition in which part of a patient's skin loses its pigmentation.

Among patients who applied 1.5% ruxolitinib cream—the generic name for Opzelura—twice daily for the entire study period roughly 50% saw at least 75% improvement on a scoring index for facial vitiligo compared with roughly 30% improvement from baseline originally seen at Week 24.

By Week 52 75% of that same group of patients hit at least 50% improvement in facial repigmentation while about 30% achieved at least 90% improvement.

A greater proportion of patients at the one-year mark saw at least 50% improvement on the total body Vitiligo Area Scoring Index and more than one-third of patients achieved a Vitiligo Noticeability Scale response Incyte said.

Opzelura’s safety—especially relevant given recent side effect concerns on the JAK inhibitor class at large—tracked with previous data on the med Incyte said.

The yearlong results “add to the robust data showing ruxolitinib cream has the potential to be a meaningful treatment option for those with vitiligo"" Jim Lee M.D. Ph.D. Incyte's group vice president of inflammation and autoimmunity said in a statement.

Opzelura was originally up for an FDA ruling in vitiligo in April but the med hit a snag several weeks back when the FDA delayed its decision by three months pushing its action date out to July 18.

The delay cropped up after the FDA requested additional data from Opzelura’s phase 3 program with Incyte’s submission ultimately constituting a “major amendment” in the regulator’s eyes Incyte said in March.

The move doesn’t seem to spell any “major concern given Opzelura is continuing its launch in atopic dermatitis (AD) and all [chemistry manufacturing and controls] issues should have been addressed during the AD review” SVB Leerink analysts wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.

Given that the regulator simply stalled its decision instead of handing down a complete response letter the delay is likely “temporary and more procedural in nature versus substantive” the analysts said.

Meanwhile the company’s 52-week data help paint a fuller picture of Opzelura’s benefit in vitiligo Incyte’s Lee said in an interview with Fierce Pharma. The results build on a positive six-month readout debuted in October. That said the company “knew going ahead into our clinical studies that 24 weeks was not going to be sufficient.”

That’s because it takes time to see Opzelura’s effect in vitiligo the executive explained.

“From our phase 2 data we knew that longer durations would give us a better idea of how well the drug worked in this disease in these patients” Lee said.

It’s important to recognize that vitiligo is an autoimmune disease with many patients also suffering from other autoimmune diseases he noted.

Patients whose disease affects their face and other cosmetically sensitive areas like the neck and hands “suffer the most” from stigma Lee said. “[W]hen they go out they get stared at and no one likes that.”

“[Y]ou’ll see in the literature that the majority of patients feel that they have the stigma and many of those patients do develop psychological problems and thus have a severe impact on their quality of life” he added.

Current treatment options for vitiligo patients are slim. Opzelura meanwhile could snatch the crown as the first therapy FDA-approved for repigmentation in people suffering from the autoimmune disease.

Given the sparsity of the current therapeutic landscape education efforts for doctors and patients would be essential to Opzelura’s vitiligo launch Lee explained.

“I think there are a lot of patients out there who have been told that there’s nothing for their disease and have essentially stopped seeing their doctors and stopped seeking care for their vitiligo” he said. The company will need to inform patients of the new treatment option and encourage doctors to bring back patients whose options were previously limited.

The FDA is set to make a decision on Opzelura in vitiligo by July 18.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3IubGlsbHkuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbmV3cy1yZWxlYXNlLWRldGFpbHMvbmVhcmx5LTQwLWFkdWx0cy1hbG9wZWNpYS1hcmVhdGEtdGFraW5nLW9sdW1pYW50ci00LW1nLXNhdy1sZWFzdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly 40% of Adults with Alopecia Areata Taking OLUMIANT® 4-mg Saw at Least 80% Scalp Hair Coverage at 52 ...,"New England Journal of Medicine published OLUMIANT 36-week alopecia areata data today

INDIANAPOLIS  March 26 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Adults with severe alopecia areata (AA) who took OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) achieved significant scalp eyelash and eyebrow hair regrowth and nearly 75% of those who responded to OLUMIANT 4-mg achieved 90% scalp coverage at 52 weeks Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) announced today at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting. In February 2022  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted priority review for OLUMIANT in severe AA as a potential first-in-disease medicine. Lilly expects regulatory decisions in the U.S.  European Union and Japan in 2022.

In the pooled 52-week analysis patients at baseline had a mean Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score of 85.5 (85.5% scalp hair loss or 14.5% scalp hair coverage); severe AA is defined as having a SALT score ≥50 (≥50% scalp hair loss). At baseline 69.4% and 57.9% had significant eyebrow and eyelash hair loss respectively as defined by Clinician-Reported Outcome (ClinRO) scores ≥2. Patients' average age was 37.6 years with hair loss starting around age 25 and a mean of 12.2 years since symptom onset.

Among patients who took OLUMIANT 4-mg two out of five (39.0% n=201/515) achieved significant scalp hair regrowth defined as a SALT score ≤20 or 80% or more scalp hair coverage and nearly three out of four of those patients (74.1% n=149/201) also achieved a SALT score ≤10 or 90% hair coverage at 52 weeks. Separately more than two out of five patients with ClinRO baseline scores ≥2 (eyebrow: 44.1% n=154/349; eyelash: 45.3% n=139/307) saw full regrowth or regrowth with minimal gaps in eyebrow and eyelash hair.

Among patients who took OLUMIANT 2-mg more than one out of five (22.6% n=77/340) achieved significant scalp hair regrowth and two out of three of those patients (67.5% n=52/77) achieved 90% or more hair coverage at 52 weeks. Separately more than one in five and one in four patients respectively (eyebrow: 22.9% n=55/240; eyelash: 25.5% n=51/200) saw full regrowth or regrowth with minimal gaps in eyebrow and eyelash hair.

These 52-week pooled analyses demonstrate continued improvement in scalp eyebrows and eyelash hair regrowth from 36-week results published today in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the 2021 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress .

""Whether people with alopecia areata suffer loss of all the hair on their body or bald spots and missing eyebrows or eyelashes this autoimmune disease can be devastating. The disease affects people of all ages"" said Brett King  M.D. Ph.D. F.A.A.D. associate professor of dermatology at Yale School of Medicine and lead author of these analyses. ""In 2022 OLUMIANT could become the first medicine ever approved to treat adults with alopecia areata. It's remarkable that nearly 40% of patients on OLUMIANT 4-mg all of whom started out with at least 50% scalp hair loss experienced full or nearly full scalp hair coverage and similar improvements were achieved among those patients with significant eyebrows or eyelashes involvement.""

In an evaluation of OLUMIANT 4-mg and 2-mg long-term safety incidence rates of frequently reported adverse events up to 52 weeks (median 56 weeks exposure) were consistent with the 36-week placebo-controlled period and included upper respiratory tract infection headache acne urinary tract infection and increases in muscle-related blood markers. There were no new safety signals.

""OLUMIANT's long-term efficacy data reveal significant regrowth of scalp eyelash and eyebrow hair and we're delighted by what these results can mean for patients. Our alopecia areata safety data adds further evidence to one of the largest and longest sets of safety data in the JAK inhibitor class including nine years and 19000 patient years across our program"" said Lotus Mallbris M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global immunology development and medical affairs at Lilly . ""We're excited OLUMIANT may be a potential first-in-disease medicine approved this year for adults with severe alopecia areata.""

About BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2

In these double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials 1200 patients with severe AA were randomized to receive once-daily OLUMIANT 4-mg OLUMIANT 2-mg or placebo. Patients randomized to OLUMIANT received the same treatment for 52 weeks while placebo non-responders were rescued to OLUMIANT at 36 weeks. The primary endpoint was SALT score ≤20 (≤20% scalp hair loss). Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients who achieved a SALT score ≤10 (≤10% scalp hair loss) Clinician-Reported Outcome (ClinRO) Measure for Eyebrow Hair Loss™ and ClinRO Measure for Eyelash Hair Loss™ scores of patients achieving eyebrow and eyelash hair loss scores of 0 or 1 (full coverage or minimal gaps) with a ≥2-point improvement from baseline among patients with baselines scores ≥2. In the BRAVE studies 51.7% of patients were white (n=620/1200) 36.3% were Asian (n=435/1200) 8.2% were Black (n=98/1200).

In December 2009  Lilly and Incyte announced an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of OLUMIANT and certain follow-on compounds for patients with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States ) for RA patients

OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2 mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets

WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS MALIGNANCY MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS AND THROMBOSIS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB) which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. If positive start treatment for latent infection prior to Olumiant use.

Invasive fungal infections including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated rather than localized disease.

Bacterial viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.

Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections tuberculosis multidermatomal herpes zoster esophageal candidiasis pneumocystosis acute histoplasmosis cryptococcosis cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.

Avoid use of Olumiant in patients with an active serious infection including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to TB; with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.

Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection.

Viral reactivation including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g. herpes zoster) were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves. The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.

MORTALITY

In a large randomized postmarketing safety study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor comparing another Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers a higher rate of all-cause mortality including sudden cardiovascular death was observed with the JAK inhibitor.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with Olumiant.

MALIGNANCIES

Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant. In RA patients treated with another JAK inhibitor a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. A higher rate of lymphomas was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lung cancers and an additional increased risk of overall malignancies were observed in current or past smokers treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with Olumiant particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than successfully treated NMSC) patients who develop a malignancy and patients who are current or past smokers.

NMSCs have been reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (defined as cardiovascular death myocardial infarction [MI] and stroke) was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Discontinue Olumiant in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with Olumiant particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur.

THROMBOSIS

Thrombosis including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor a higher rate of thrombosis was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Avoid Olumiant in patients at risk. Discontinue Olumiant and promptly evaluate patients with symptoms of thrombosis.

GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS

Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g. patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES

Neutropenia – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Liver Enzyme Elevations – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of ALT ≥5x upper limit of normal (ULN) and increases of AST ≥10x ULN were observed in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.

Lipid Elevations – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters including total cholesterol low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

VACCINATIONS

Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.

HYPERSENSITIVITY

Reactions such as angioedema urticaria and rash that may reflect drug sensitivity have been observed in patients receiving Olumiant including serious reactions. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs promptly discontinue Olumiant while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Most common adverse reactions include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3% 11.7%) nausea (2.7% 1.6%) herpes simplex (0.8% 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0% 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg and placebo respectively.

PREGNANCY AND LACTATION

Limited data on Olumiant use in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.

HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT

Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal impairment.

Now the Indianapolis-based pharma is making another plug for Olumiant’s hair loss potential with four more months of data showing its med aced hair regrowth metrics in nearly half of patients treated with a higher dose.

Among adults with severe AA on Lilly’s Olumiant nearly 75% of patients who responded to a 4-mg dose achieved 90% scalp hair coverage at the 52-week mark Lilly said Saturday. Armed with a win in the underserved autoimmune disease the company expects regulatory decisions on Olumiant before the year is out in the U.S. Europe and Japan Lilly and its partner Incyte said at the American Academy of Dermatology’s 2022 annual meeting.

Taking a closer look at the results from Lilly’s two phase 3 trials BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 39% of patients on Olumiant 4-mg experienced “significant” scalp hair regrowth as measured by the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Lilly said. The company defined significant regrowth as a SALT score of up to 20 which translates to 80% or more scalp hair coverage Lilly explained. Among that same set of patients roughly 74% achieved 90% scalp coverage at the end of one year.

Just 22.6% of alopecia patients on the 2-mg dose of Olumiant saw “significant” scalp hair regrowth. About two thirds of those patients hit 90% hair coverage.

The separate doses performed similarly when it came to eyebrow and eyelash hair regrowth. More than two out of five patients on Olumiant 4 mg who entered the study with “significant” eyebrow and eyelash hair loss “saw full regrowth or regrowth with minimal gaps in eyebrow and eyelash hair” Lilly said.

For those on the 2-mg dose more than 1 in 5 and 1 in 4 patients respectively enjoyed full eyebrow and eyelash regrowth or regrowth with minimal gaps the company added.

The new 52-week readout builds on 36-week data Lilly rolled out between last March and April. Following last year’s top-line win Lilly said it planned to submit Olumiant for FDA approval in AA in the second half of the year. Lilly has since sent off its application to the FDA the company said (PDF) in its 2021 annual report.

Those results are nothing short of “remarkable” Lotus Mallbris M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global immunology development and medical affairs at Eli Lilly said in a recent interview. Armed with a full year’s worth of data from BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 Lilly expects to win approval if not launch in the U.S. Europe and Japan in 2022 Mallbris said.

If cleared in AA Olumiant would bear the distinction of being the first therapy specifically approved to treat the autoimmune disease. Currently patients’ disease is often treated with cosmetic solutions such as wigs or false eyebrows and eyelashes Mallbris explained. Others rely on off-label therapies such as uncomfortable corticosteroid injections in the scalp.

Meanwhile Olumiant would not only be the first bespoke treatment option for AA–it would also be more convenient than injectable treatments thanks to its simple oral dosing she added.

If Olumiant breaks into AA Lilly will have its work cut out convincing doctors and patients that alopecia is a disease that warrants pharmaceutical treatment. Given the current dearth of therapeutic options many AA patients have been “lost in clinical care” Mallbris explained. The current pathway for patients living with AA can be “very challenging” to hear Mallbris tell it with many avoiding treatment altogether because of a sense of “hopelessness.”

Because so many AA patients have fallen through the cracks Lilly’s estimates on the total disease population are “rough” Mallbris admitted. Lilly says approximately 147 million people worldwide have or will have AA with between 700000 to 900000 suffering from severe disease.

Meanwhile safety in Lilly’s two phase 3 studies was on par with Olumiant’s known profile Mallbris said. Baricitinib is a member of the JAK inhibitor class which has come under intense safety scrutiny in recent months following a post-marketing study of Pfizer’s Xeljanz. Nevertheless Lilly believes it has the data to show its med is not only effective but safe.",,,,,,

We expect these platforms to hit GA in the second half of 2022. What is very interesting then is that Intel has launched its Emmitsburg chipset the successor to the Lewisburg (Skylake/ Cascade Lake)/ Lewisburg Refresh (Cooper Lake/ Ice Lake) PCH’s that we have seen since 2017 this quarter.

Intel C741 Emmitsburg Chipset with PCIe Gen3 for Sapphire Rapids Launched

If you missed the SC21 piece check out Intel Sapphire Rapids CXL with Emmitsburg PCH Shown at SC21. Now we see that the Intel C741 chipset has hit Intel Ark with a Q1 2022 launch date.

Also interesting is that the TDP is 11W. Intel is still using a PCH design in its servers whereas we are seeing Arm vendors and AMD go PCH-less. That means from a platform perspective there is another chip to place and cool.

What we can see is that the Intel C741 has up to 20 PCIe Gen3 lanes. This is notable since PCIe Gen5 is a major Sapphire Rapids feature. Along with up to 14 USB ports there are also up to 20 SATA III ports. The 20 PCIe Gen3 lanes along with the matching number of SATA lanes makes us think that Intel is using its flexible I/O offering here so realistically we will see a mix of both.

There are a number of other features including VT-d RSTe Node Manger at TXT supported. Notable though is that although we have an integrated LAN and HD audio we do not get QAT in this PCH. This is a 22x23mm PCH listed as using FC-BGA15C.

Final Words

The new Intel C741 Emmitsburg PCH is one we expect to see later in 2022 and into 2023 but for now unless you work in the industry and have pre-GA silicon it is unlikely you are going to see this chip for a few months. The ordering code for the B1 stepping is GGNOCPU05016100 and the spec code is SRLGE. For many STH readers this is going to be another step in the long process of launching the new Sapphire Rapids solutions that will have small bits of information come out over time and before GA.

It wasn't until one of her classmates complimented Bryant on her number-crunching skills that she even considered a career in engineering. ""I was sitting in Calculus II my freshman year of college and the guy next to me was chatting me up and asked me what my major was"" she recalls. ""I didn't declare a major yet and he said 'Well you really should be an engineer because it's obvious you've got some math acumen.'"" He also told her that engineering offered one of the highest starting salaries for people with bachelor's degrees which caught Bryant's attention. ""I was so tired of being poor and I knew I was not going to live a future in poverty"" she says. She went straight to her counselor after class declared her major in hardware engineering and never looked back. That impulsive decision set Bryant on a whirlwind career path that would take her from the executive offices at Intel and Google to NovaSignal a Los Angeles-based medical tech start-up where she is now CEO. But Bryant had to fight tooth and nail to get there from experiencing homelessness in high school to confronting sexism at work. CNBC Make It spoke with Bryant now 60 about her career journey and the skills that helped her get from couch-surfing in Sacramento to the C-suite.

Homeless at 18

Four months before she graduated high school Bryant's father told her she had to move out. He had a strict rule that the moment she and her sister turned 18 they were on their own. ""All of my belongings were on the front lawn"" she recalls. ""I had to pack everything into my Volkswagen Beetle and hit the road."" She spent the rest of her senior year bouncing between her sister's apartment friends' houses and sometimes sleeping in her backseat. After high school she enrolled at American River College a local free community college and found an apartment close to campus. ""It was incredibly disruptive but I was committed to survive"" Bryant says of the transition. She had no relatives to rely on for financial support – just her own grit and determination.

Her first big career break

Reflecting on her life however Bryant sees that at each stage of her career there was someone who was rooting for her and investing in her success. Bryant worked three jobs as a waitress at two different restaurants and a hostess at another while she was in college. At one of the restaurants the same couple would come every Sunday after church for brunch. They repeatedly requested Bryant as their waitress sometimes waiting 20 minutes for a table to clear in her section because they thought she was kind and well-mannered. When the husband Bill Baker learned that she was studying to be an engineer he offered to help get her an internship at Aerojet a rocket and missile propulsion manufacturer and one of Sacramento's largest employers at the time. ""The recruiter called me and said 'If Bill Baker is advocating for you you're in the program'"" she says. ""That job helped me become a more competitive applicant for Intel – it was at that moment I realized the true power of what an advocate can do for you when someone is willing to use their reputation and position to help someone less fortunate.""

'You either adapt or you die'

When Bryant first joined Intel in 1985 Silicon Valley was in the thick of its ""rough and tumble era"" she says – a time when women also made up a mere 5.8% of engineers in the U.S. Often Bryant was the only woman in the room and quickly realized that to fit in she had to become ""one of the guys."" During her second week on the job she was in a meeting with all men when one of them cursed – then turned to Bryant and immediately apologized for using foul language in front of a woman. ""All of the focus was on me I turned bright red"" she recalls. ""So I said 'No f—ing problem and everyone looked so at ease like 'Phew we don't have to change our behavior because there's a woman here."" It was then Bryant realized that ""the only way I'm going to get them to collaborate with me and be successful in this team is if I make these men more comfortable by embracing their direct aggressive style"" she says. ""I thought 'You either adapt or you die.'"" That meant swearing more ordering scotch at outings with her co-workers and buying a BMW with manual transmission (""engineers would never drive an automatic""). Before Bryant left Intel in 2017 she had served in numerous roles including product line manager and the group president of Intel's Data Center Group. But throughout her career there she would often have the same debate with herself as she drove home: stay or quit? She loved her job but felt her progress often stalled because of managers who she thought gave her fewer opportunities – and smaller raises – than her male colleagues.



Intel did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC Make It. But she had two young kids and was the main breadwinner for her family. Once again Bryant dug into her grit – and when she was miserable in one of her roles a mentor identified a different job within the company for her put her in the job and ""off my career went again"" she says.

Add support for Intel CET-IBT available since Tigerlake (11th gen) which is a coarse grained hardware based forward edge Control-Flow-Integrity mechanism where any indirect CALL/JMP must target an ENDBR instruction or suffer #CP.



Additionally since Alderlake (12th gen)/Sapphire-Rapids speculation is limited to 2 instructions (and typically fewer) on branch targets not starting with ENDBR. CET-IBT also limits speculation of the next sequential instruction after the indirect CALL/JMP.



CET-IBT is fundamentally incompatible with retpolines but provides as described above speculation limits itself.

Indirect Branch Tracking (IBT) that is part of Intel's Control-Flow Enforcement Technology (CET) found with Tiger Lake CPUs and newer is landing for the Linux 5.18 kernel.Intel's Peter Zijlstra recently wrapped up work on the latest IBT patches for the Linux kernel as this newest CPU security feature. IBT helps protect against JUMP/CALL oriented attacks. IBT is hardware-based course-grain forward-edge Control Flow Integrity (CFI) protection. When enabled for the kernel build it ensures indirect calls land on an ENDBR instruction. Besides all of the Linux kernel patches to make IBT a reality there is compiler-side support necessary that means GCC 9 and newer or LLVM Clang 14 and newer.Zijlstra sums up the CET-IBT functionality for the Linux kernel as:



Intel has been working on both Shadow Stack and Indirect Branch Tracking support for the Linux kernel.

With this pull IBT is ready to go for Linux 5.18 on Intel's latest processors."

Companies with high profits and revenue per employee are presumed to be the most successful. Alphabet Microsoft and Meta Platforms owner of Facebook are such companies. These tech companies are among the largest in the United States based on revenue and they are among the youngest large companies. Several were founded in the past 25 years. However a group of relatively small companies leads the list of highest profit per employee.

Data for the recent “Profit per Employee” research paper from software company Tipalti came from the Fortune 500. The paper examined 914 major companies most of which made a profit per employee in the last year. Only 238 reported a loss per employee. The company that has the most profits per employee is Air Lease. The company reported $516 million in profits or $4.3 million per employee.

Air Lease with an employee count of 120 buys passenger planes and leases them to airlines. The process allows carriers that do not have capital access to planes. Air Lease makes its profit largely off the interest it charges these carriers. The company was hurt by the trouble with the aviation industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic but its financials have started to recover.

When the company announced its 2021 results John L. Plueger chief executive officer and president commented: “We had a strong fourth quarter and second half of 2021 that benefited from continuing airline industry recovery as seen in our cash collections operating metrics fleet expansion and record lease placement.”

Air Lease owns 474 planes that it leases to 118 customers in 60 countries. The company is based in Los Angeles. (See if Air Lease is also among the 50 best companies to work for.)

To find the 50 companies with the most profits per employee 24/7 Wall St. reviewed Tipalti’s “Profit per Employee” research paper. Very few of the companies with the highest profit per employee are large tech companies. Meta is highest among these ranking 11th with a profit of nearly $500000 per employee based on over 58000 workers. Several financial firms are ahead of Meta.

Mortgage giant Fannie Mae has profit of $1.5 million per employee based on 7700 workers. This places it second on the list. The third is private equity firm KKR at $1.3 million per employee based on 1583 workers. (Find out if any of the companies on this list were also among the most innovative companies in 2021.)

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

During the Second World War Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime that had ruled Germany since 1933 had been discovered to have undertaken a programme of exterminating Jews and other unwanted peoples such as homosexuals political opponents and the disabled. In what is now known as the Holocaust an estimated 17 million people were killed by the Nazis through overwork in labour camps undernourishment and various forms of execution – which included gas chambers and firing squads. Of those approximately six million were Jewish – two-thirds of the European Jewish population. Especially with reference to the fate of Jewish people the phrase ‘never again’ became synonymous with these events. Not only was there a desire to prevent mass slaughter of human beings in a third world war – which would likely be nuclear – there was also a pressing desire to establish an international standard of human rights that would protect people from atrocities like the Holocaust and from unnecessary large-scale warfare.

Set up to represent all the earth’s recognised nation-states the United Nations became ground zero for discussion of human rights. Just three years after the organisation was created the ‘Universal Declaration of Human Rights’ (1948 pictured being held by Eleanor Roosevelt in Photo 2.5) had been agreed by virtually all of the United Nations’ member states outlining thirty articles that – in principle – extended to all the earth’s people. As a snapshot the first three articles are as follows:

Article 1. All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.



Article 2. Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration without distinction of any kind such as race colour sex language religion political or other opinion national or social origin property birth or other status. Furthermore no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs whether it be independent trust non-self- governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.



Article 3. Everyone has the right to life liberty and security of person.

Upon reading this three thoughts may cross your mind. The first is that it represents a step change in history. For the first time an international document existed that sets all nation-states a set of benchmarks upon which their behaviour towards individuals will be judged. Secondly the aforementioned comes from an international organisation that is now part of the global system in addition to states. Here it is important to understand the limits of the United Nations and the principles and declarations it may proffer. The United Nations is not sovereign. It does not have a territory or a people. Instead it is an organisation run by and through the voluntary participation of its members. In that sense it appends rather than replaces nation-state power. This leads us to the third thing that may have crossed your mind upon reading the articles above – that even with the most basic understanding they do not reflect today’s global system which remains one scarred by warfare and well- publicised failures to protect human rights. In that sense it is easy to regard human rights as a failure because much like international organisations individuals have not become sovereign the way nation-states are.

Such a conclusion while factually true and the product of our global system’s enduring foregrounding of the nation-state risks betraying the momentum that has gathered around human rights. Firstly if we reverse to the pre-1945 period states often acted with impunity by waging ever-escalating wars for selfish reasons – and also by colonising or enslaving human beings. There may be no international sovereign to impose legal punishment on states in the way a person would be prosecuted by the legal system within a state for a crime. But the normative power of human rights is a growing element within our global system that has made such historical violations a rarity today. We can account for this further by looking at a range of international crimes that have been named and developed – with the bulk highlighting cases where states directly cause (or indirectly allow) unacceptable harm to people including in times of war. Of these perhaps the most well known is genocide which denotes the deliberate killing of a defined group of people (usually defined by nationality religion or ethnicity) – precisely what the Nazis did to Jewish people.

Building on the momentum of establishing a range of legal norms the Responsibility to Protect (2001) sometimes referred to as ‘R2P’ was endorsed by all member states of the United Nations in 2005. It sought to build further on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent documents by establishing higher levels of punishment for the worst violations by states. In principle this involves a reinterpretation of sovereignty (at times) to the level of the individual. To illustrate this under the Responsibility to Protect sovereignty can be imagined as similar to a mortgage given by a bank (the United Nations) to a homeowner (a nation-state). Should states keep up their repayments (by treating their people well) then the bank will never trouble the homeowner. However if the state does not keep up its repayments (by acting in ways that cause its people undue harm and suffering) then that state may be repossessed by the international community under the authority of the United Nations. In practice this could mean that a state comes under an increasing level of actions up to and including a regime being forcibly removed from power through invasion. The caveat is as with any major issue involving international security it has to be agreed by the world’s major powers – again reinforcing where the real bottom line of sovereignty lies.

The Responsibility to Protect has been invoked in well over a hundred resolutions at various levels within the United Nations signifying that it is not just something that exists on paper but that human rights in the decades since the Universal Declaration have come a long way. During the 2021 coup in Myanmar pro-democracy protesters even held up ‘R2P’ signs (Photo 2.6) showing how deeply and widely understandings and expectations of this norm have proliferated. Of course some states still mistreat their people and international action is often insufficient to prevent it or stop it or agreement on an action cannot be reached – as prolonged civil wars in Yemen and Syria demonstrate. Yet understanding how the global system incorporates human rights in ways that go beyond the merely aspirational and the related place of international organisations is to understand that both the aforementioned exist in a position that is gradually challenging the once absolute monopoly on sovereignty held by states. It also adds further weight to the layer cake of reasons why there has not been a third world war – in this case adding a legal and normative architecture that restrains states from endangering human security on the scale that has been evident in history.

This European ""neo-unilateralism"" is certainly based on a logic that is not entirely new - the defence of the Union's interests through trade policy or trade regulation instruments - but it also presents singular features and reflects political choices that prevail more than in the past over strict mercantile considerations. It is a vehicle for promoting the European Union's strategic autonomy in a multilateral system that is in the process of collapsing and an international order that has been hit by crises.

The collapse of the multilateral system the collapse of free trade

To understand European neo-unilateralism it is important to look back at how the EU has conducted its trade policy to date. For a long time the EU has repeatedly insisted on the need for an 'open and rules-based' trading system defined at the WTO or in a complementary way in its free trade agreements. Through schismogenesis[1] it has sought to distance itself from other powers first and foremost the United States which are suspected of wanting to impose decisions on the rest of the world that are in their own interests bypassing common rules if necessary.

European support for multilateralism has even taken on essentialist characteristics in that it reflects the way in which the European Union has built itself internally through the construction of predictable and liberal rules and procedures. The creation of the WTO in 1995 the acme of triumphant multilateralism confirmed this post-Westphalian reading of international relations within which the organisation of trade obeyed a liberal and cosmopolitan order[2]. In a rare move[3] The European Union was recognised as a full member of this international organisation which was built on a vast set of trade agreements covering old and new aspects of trade and whose respect would henceforth be guaranteed by an effective 'jurisdictional' dispute settlement mechanism the jewel in the crown of this new ensemble. The success of the WTO was further reinforced both economically and ideologically by the entry into the organisation of the former communist bloc countries: People's China (2001) and a few years later Vietnam (2007) Ukraine (2008) and Russia (2012). The universalisation of the WTO represented the course of history.

This narrative has failed. In reality the multilateral system has been slowly eroded starting in the late 1990s with the failure of the Seattle conference[4]. Despite the adoption of an ambitious work programme in Doha at the end of 2001 negotiators were unable to agree as they had done in the 1990s on a much-needed adaptation of the trade organisation's rules to the rapidly changing international economic system the nature of trade and value chains. Any ambition to reform the organisation and its governance failed and the WTO's political bodies were quickly trapped by the rule of consensus their division and their inability to think of new common ground[5]. However there is no shortage of topics of interest from the coexistence of liberal economies with state capitalism models in the international trade system to the need to integrate social environmental and climate issues into the development of trade rules.

As the years have passed the original consensus that founded the multilateral pact has continued to crumble. The WTO continues to function as illustrated by the lengthy process of appointing a new Director General after the de facto abandonment of the Doha Round[6]. But despite occasional progress in negotiations the WTO is a club of diplomats whose disagreements have become deep disputes intractable and exchanges acrimonious. The WTO's dispute resolution system is permanently undermined by the paralysis of its Appellate Body[7]. The disappearance of the arbiter of world trade whose primary purpose was to prevent trade disputes from leading to economic wars is now a matter of concern only to a small circle of specialists while the highest political authorities remain indifferent. The WTO simply suffers the shocks of geopolitical rivalries and tensions. For several years now we have seen a proliferation of exceptions justified by emergency and national security imperatives[8]. Multilateral rules are now marginalised in a growing number of inter-state relations due to a rise in conflicts. They are thus regularly abused in the context of the Sino-American trade war. Several countries in the Western camp - including Canada the USA the European Union and the UK - have just announced their decision to suspend the application of most-favoured-nation status[9] with regarding to Russia.

The European Union is not immune to the growing instability that characterises the current system of structuring world trade. The uncertainty generated by Brexit is still far from being resolved despite the conclusion in spring 2021 of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The propensity of the British to effectively respect their commitments - starting with the Northern Ireland protocol - remains very uncertain given the current government's preference for a transactional approach and power struggles. The Covid-19 health crisis has confirmed to Europe which is poor in natural resources the risks of weakening the entire value chain of its companies particularly when export restrictions proliferate. In addition there is now an economic and trade war with Russia which is rich in raw materials and on which it is dependent for energy.

In the course of a few years Europeans have entered a new era typified by the possible sudden emergence of security considerations - linked to military events health and climate crises - which may at any moment challenge the usual rules of international trade. In this more violent more conflictual world where respect for the law is giving way to a rationale of power it is easy to understand the need for the European Union to thoroughly rethink the tools and instruments of its external action in particular those of its trade policy.

The European Union has already acknowledged the need to secure trade through rules defined outside the WTO framework. For more than two decades it has pursued an ambitious strategy of negotiating trade agreements which far from being confined to promoting trade liberalisation constitute objects of European regulation of international trade[10]. Although this method often helps to overcome the limitations of the multilateral system it does have its limits as the European Union does not yet have global trade agreements with major economic and political players such as the United States India Brazil Russia and China. Moreover despite its commercial weight the EU cannot always impose its wishes on its conventional partners in negotiations and must make certain compromises[11].

Unilateralism as a traditional tool to promote the EU's interests on the international scene

The use of unilateral measures as an instrument to regulate trade with the outside world is ancient concomitant with the structuring of states in their modern form[12]. Unilateral measures differ from bi- or multilateral trade agreements because of the way they are formed which does not require the consent of third parties and depends exclusively on domestic political choices. For this reason unilateral measures are seen as both manifestations of sovereignty and protectionism. However it is usual for the adoption of unilateral measures to be accompanied by a prior dialogue with the actors affected by the measure in particular the targeted companies or third states. Moreover unilateral measures are very often part of the implementation of trade agreements which frame their use.

Basing itself on its competence in terms of trade[13] the European Union has since its inception used its capacity to adopt unilateral measures. This is the case with tariffs applied to imports from third countries in accordance with the commitments formulated in the GATT schedules of concessions and later in free trade agreements. These measures may be adopted to defend certain trade interests under the policy space recognised by international trade rules. This is particularly the case for trade defence measures which in this case take the form of additional customs duties in response to dumping practices or illegal subsidies[14]. Similar schemes allow for export restrictions[15] or the use of trade sanctions authorised by the WTO following a dispute settlement procedure.

However certain unilateral European measures have a disruptive purpose intended depending on the case to fill gaps in the agreements or to challenge the rules of trade. This is a long-standing phenomenon. In the early 1970s the European Community chose to create the first system of tariff preferences granted by a GATT member to developing countries[16]. This decision however called into question the logic of non-discrimination underpinned by the most favoured nation status a cardinal rule of the GATT and then of the WTO. This European mechanism was made compatible with the rules of the organisation by means of temporary and then permanent derogations in virtue of a empowerment clause adopted in 1979. The choice of members of the multilateral system to break with legality can also serve a long-term strategy aimed at forcing third countries to negotiate new rules that take into account the concerns of the country that decides initially on its own to transgress the common disciplines. In the 1980s the European Union and the United States unilaterally sanctioned GATT members that refused to respect their own intellectual property standards. This strategy of ""aggressive unilateralism"" paid off as it forced the targeted countries to agree to the inclusion of the future IP agreement[17].

European neo-unilateralism as a response to the increasing challenges to the EU's trade policy

By ""neo-unilateralism"" we mean the proliferation of recent unilateral measures adopted by the European Union that are likely to apply to international trade[18]. This phenomenon is the direct translation of a European discourse which defends the strategic autonomy of the European Union on the international scene. To illustrate this the starting point is the unilateral measures adopted or proposed in December 2019 with the appointment of the current European Commission whose President on taking office described it as 'geopolitical'. In addition to the traditional unilateral measures[19] we have chosen to distinguish two categories of unilateral measures that affect trade between Europe and the rest of the world:

1° Unilateral measures adopted by the European Union in response to a crisis context

The EU's trade policy has faced an increasing number of crises that have required rapid and appropriate responses. This was the case with the case arising from the paralysis of the WTO dispute settlement system due to the American veto on any new designation of an Appellate Body member. In addition to its proposals for reform of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism[20] the European Union deemed it necessary to review its 2014[21] which establishes the Commission's power to adopt trade sanctions against other WTO members. Until now European sanctions could only be imposed after the WTO had given its authorisation following a multilateral procedure. The revised version in force since February 2021 now offers the possibility of introducing sanctions without prior authorisation from the WTO when the European Union is faced with obstruction of the dispute settlement procedure by an opposing country[22]. In other words the text encourages the use of unilateral measures to overcome the possible paralysis of the WTO dispute settlement system[23]. This is a textbook case of the substitution of unilateral logic for multilateral procedures due to their inadequacy.

Mention should also be made of the set of trade policy instruments deployed during the Covid-19 pandemic. In March 2020 the Commission under pressure from the measures taken by its Member States decided to introduce a system of restrictions on exports of products related to the fight against the pandemic[24] at the same time as it temporarily lowered tariffs to facilitate imports. The Commission would encourage Member States to anticipate the entry into force of the new EU legislation on screening foreign investment[25] to prevent non-European companies from taking advantage of the crisis to take over European companies operating in strategic sectors[26]. In January 2021 faced with the emergence of vaccine protectionism the Commission urgently deployed an administrative authorisation regarding a mechanism on exports of products necessary for the manufacture of vaccines[27].

The measures adopted in the context of the invasion of Ukraine confirm this capacity to react quickly. In 2014 shortly after the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of the Donbass the European Union decided to prohibit exports of certain categories of goods to Russia in particular those with dual use (civilian and military) and to exclude all imports from the annexed territories. These trade measures were considerably tightened at the start of the invasion of Ukraine[28]. The European Union has just announced in line with national security exceptions that it wants to bring to terminate Russia's status as most favoured nation which means that it no longer considers this state to be a 'normal' WTO member in practice. It remains to be seen whether on this basis the European Union will in the coming weeks be willing and able to go further by deciding in particular to prohibit imports of hydrocarbons from this aggressor state.

2° New unilateral legislation as part of a project to rewrite the rules of international trade

Six proposals for legislation by the European Commission since 2019 are at issue[29]. It is this last manifestation of unilateralism which is the most instructive in that it translates into action - still under discussion for the most part - the discourse on European autonomy and sovereignty applied to the regulation of international trade[30]. These six draft laws five regulations and one directive[31] are part of an accepted European strategy to use the market and its normative power to regulate trade in a context of legal vacuum within the Union but also internationally.

After years of discussion starting in 2012 on France's request the agreement on the creation of a new international instrument for public procurement supplementing European internal legislation on public procurement is also justified by the fact that the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement does not as it stands allow European companies sufficient access to tenders issued in third countries in terms comparable to the access to European public contracts enjoyed by foreign companies in particular Chinese ones[32]. The Commission also hopes to have at its disposal a tool to counter foreign subsidies from which companies operating in the internal market benefit so as to close the loopholes left by the common market rules on state aid but also by the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.

The carbon border adjustment mechanism which is currently being discussed aims to fill the gaps in the international rules on combating climate change as the Paris Agreement continues to have little binding force on the States Parties. The European proposal extends the logic of the EU's internal emissions trading mechanism by targeting a list of products that are particularly CO2 emitting in their manufacturing and production process (cement steel fertilisers).

The same applies to the draft regulation designed to counter deforestation which closes loopholes in international rules by banning certain imports (coffee cocoa or palm oil). The draft anti-coercion regulations and a directive on corporate due diligence are intended to fill a gap left by multilateral trade rules which do not allow for an effective fight against coercive measures imposed by foreign states on European companies (economic and political pressure restrictions on the right to trade or invest) or conversely are uninterested in the conditions under which multinational companies including European ones organise their production and their value chain without taking into account respect for human rights or social and environmental standards.

The other striking feature of these measures is the attempt to apply the objectives and values of the European Union to international trade. This is particularly the case in the field of the environment and more generally the fight against climate change echoing the objectives assigned to the Union's action on the international scene under the treaties[33] and increasing political pressure on these issues. Trade policy is thus a vehicle for promoting other EU policies including in areas where competences are still shared with the Member States especially when European external action in these areas has had only mixed results (weak international governance in the social field timid progress on climate change rules).

The emphasis on non-market considerations in trade policy is not exclusive of an underlying economic motivation which in practice is of prime importance to the legislator namely the defence of a level playing field i.e. fair conditions of competition between the European Union and its partners and which relates to the competitiveness of European companies at international level.

The European Union cannot continue to impose ambitious regulatory conditions on its own companies whether it be carbon quotas rules governing the use of chemicals and pesticides or the prohibition of subsidies when foreign competition is benefiting at the same time from a much more conciliatory normative and fiscal framework in third countries and from the increasing opening up of access to the European market unless it encourages further relocation and a loss of industrial autonomy. For a long time this tension has contributed to reducing the ambition of European legislation. This is evidenced for example by the free allocations of carbon quotas companies producing in Europe and facing international competition in line with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme[34]. Now the trend is to reverse this approach with the European Commission proposing ambitious texts including at the domestic level but with extraterritorial effects in order to guarantee fair trade[35].

The future of this neo-unilateralism raises questions: is it a passing fad or a profound evolution of the European Union's action on the international scene in line with the affirmation of its strategic autonomy?

The answer will depend primarily on the real will of the institutions in particular the European Parliament and the Council to adopt the legislation proposed by the Commission without altering its content too much or even to strengthen its scope[36]. Lobbying by third countries and economic sectors is likely to influence the choices made. It seems that the political context lends itself to this but economic crises can have the effect of forcing short-term economic choices particularly in a context of security tensions. The other major unknown is obviously the reaction of third countries to this series of unilateral measures which may be perceived as a forced attempt to impose on the rest of the world the environmental health social and even fiscal policy choices made within the Union[37]. The European Union can hope that its initiatives will be taken up and influence other legislators in accordance with the so-called Brussels effect theorised by Anu Bradford[38] and which can already be observed in the data protection sector[39]. But it is also likely that other members of the trading system will seek to challenge these new rules at the WTO and that European legislation will be the source of major trade disputes for several years to come and potentially of European condemnations followed by threats of economic retaliation. The surest way to avoid this worst-case scenario would be for European unilateralism which is based on a series of concerns that are not specific to the European Union to contribute to a revival of multilateralism.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAyNzU1MzE5MjIwMDAzMjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EU-27 bank failure prediction with C5.0 decision trees and deep learning neural networks,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0275531922000320 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAyNzU1MzE5MjIwMDAzMjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

The magic of prosthesis design lies in its ability to bring life experiences to those with arthritis and missing limbs. While prosthetic limbs have made strides in terms of product development since their conception smart technology ushers in yet a new era of prosthesis design to reinvigorate its broad potential within the field of healthcare. Wearable sensors and mobile applications incorporated into prosthetic limbs allow those wearing prosthetic limbs to make more precise movements and monitor the status of their recovery process a bit more closely. 3D conceptual artist and digital sculptor Xander Lihovski designed his own interpretation of AI-controlled prosthesis design called Smart Prosthetic Arm.

Designer: Xander Lihovski

While some prosthetic arms take on the look of an actual limb to create a cohesive look with the user’s body and skin tone Lihovski’s design embraces the tech of it all. The robotic look also helps to normalize the use of prosthetic limbs in common spaces. Conceptualized in optic white and slate black a digital interface wraps around the prosthetic arm’s elbow crease that operates as the prosthetic limb’s smart hub.

There users can use their free hand to scroll through system alerts and settings to optimize their experience using the prosthetic arm. Features like a fitness tracker clock and calorie counter can be found in the digital smart hub that users can access at any time. Elastic components also connect the different parts of the Smart Prosthetic Arm to allow for comfortable movement. The smart digital display is connected to the prosthetic forearm and fingers by an elastic component that also works to minimize the number of materials needed to build the prosthetic limb.

What sets conventional prothetic limbs apart from smart prosthesis designs is the embedded sensors and technology that intuit the user’s movements with regular use. Every day smart technology makes our day-to-day a little easier–facial recognition unlocks our iPhones and Siri registers the slightest change in the tone of our voices to complete tasks. Smart technology in prosthetic limbs depends on a system of sensors that predict the natural body language of the person wearing the prosthetic limb optimizing the experience for them to allow precise handling and movement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFtLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy9jb2x1bW5zLzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvdHJhY2stc3BlbmRpbmctZ29vZ2xlLXBheS1taW50LzcxMjg0ODgwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,On Computers: Track spending with Google Pay Mint,"Joy Schwabach

Sometimes it feels like my money is flying out the window. So I’m using the Google Pay app on my phone which tracks spending. So does Mint.

I ignored Mint when it first came out in 2006. But now that I’m assured that the info is encrypted I decided to give it a whirl. Mint is owned by Intuit the same company that owns QuickBooks. I still prefer Google Pay. Mint has too many ads.

The free Google Pay app nicknamed GPay for iPhone or Android showed me how much I'd spent since the beginning of the month and what I'd spent it on. It discreetly offers discounts from merchants.

Getting a new phone

A reader said she rarely used her cellphone until COVID hit. “Now texting is constant” she said and she wants a new phone. She’d like one with a better camera than the one on her $60 Tru Blue. But she doesn’t want to spend much.

PC magazine gives high marks to the Moto G Pure from Motorola which Tracfone is selling for $60. I love Motorola phones because the battery lasts for days. A reviewer at TheVerge.com gave the PureG good marks too but criticized its camera. He said it got the colors wrong in a pumpkin photo. But I thought it looked great. On the other hand it got a few nasty reviews on the Tracfone site. But I trust the professional reviewers in this case.

The web is good for you

The press is always saying that online activities are bad for our health. Actually the reverse is true.

According to the Journal of Public Health broadband access is a “super determinant” of health. COVID deaths are many times greater in areas with dial-up or spotty connections even if you take age income race education and preexisting conditions into account.

Silencing Google or Siri

If you ask Siri something embarrassing she might blurt out the answer in front of your friends. How about getting a text response instead? All you have to do is turn down the volume on your iPhone if you don’t want to hear her. Unfortunately her text doesn’t show every word of the answer. To get it all go to “Settings” and tap “Siri & Search.” Choose “always show captions.”

Next I tried out Google Assistant. I asked: “Am I pretty?” “Well” she said “I just looked up ‘good looking’ on MerriamWebster.com and all they had was a picture of you. So that’s a definitive yes.” Fortunately I was alone.

To get a text instead of a vocal response on your Android phone tap “Settings” then “Apps” then “Assistant” then “See All Assistant Settings.” Now choose “Assistant Voice & Sounds.” Look for “Speech Output” and tap “Phone.” Then choose “hands-free.” I tried it for a while but missed hearing the Assistant’s voice. I also tried changing her accent to British but she sounded snooty.

It’s a boat it’s a bike it’s a house!

A Chinese company said they’d send me a $2500 eBike for review if I was willing to devote the whole column to it. No way. I don’t like eBikes. I want to use my legs not electricity.

Or so I thought. I just read about an eBike that’s part boat and camper. It would be difficult to peddle that baby without an assist. To see it in action go to mashable.com and look up “It’s a boat it’s a bike it’s a house!” The “Z-Triton 2.0” can fit two people in its cabin. When it’s not in the water it’s an electric bike with 1000 watts of power and a seven-gear internal hub. It has a solar panel roof.

Driverless trends

Until a couple of weeks ago all driverless cars required a steering wheel a brake pedal and a dashboard for a human driver. But the U.S. National Highway Transportation Safety Administration just decided that human controls are unnecessary.

Driverless cars with steering wheels for human drivers are almost old hat. You can hail a driverless car 24 hours a day seven days a week using the Waymo One app in Phoenix or San Francisco. Or try “Cruise” from General Motors (only in San Francisco). Google says its riders get the same clean vehicle every time and a driver with over 20 million miles of experience on public roads. Google has also developed a car without any human driver components. It should be coming soon.

What about those awful Tesla-crash headlines? According to TeslaDeaths.com Tesla’s human drivers have experienced 12 driverless car fatalities. That’s a lot fewer than the 274 deaths caused by Tesla-driving humans.

Google says that traffic collisions in the U.S. kill over 35000 people a year. Around 94% of those involve human error or choice. Their Waymo cars haven’t yet injured anyone.

Avoiding scams

If you do a Google search on “PSA post vaccine survey scam” the U.S. government at ICE.gov will show you exactly what the scammer’s email looks like. Don’t worry if you’ve already opened one.

Today we’re revisiting the record-setting agreement that turned Staples Center into Crypto.com Arena. I had the opportunity to speak with executives from the cryptocurrency exchange as well as the famed venue’s owner and operator and both parties shed new light on the chaotic process that brought the deal to life. Feel free to hit me up at ernest@fos.company if you want to talk more about the naming rights madness that’s changing the landscape of the sports industry right now. Let’s get into it. Behind The Scenes of The Blockbuster Crypto.com Arena Deal AEG/Left to Right: Russell Silvers Nick Baker The news of Staples Center becoming Crypto.com Arena hit the sports world like a tidal wave on the night of Nov. 16 last fall. It’s not often that you see naming rights deals spark such an outpouring of emotion and nationwide conversation — but this isn’t your typical venue. The famous arena on Figueroa Street in downtown Los Angeles occupies the rarified air reserved for places like Madison Square Garden Wrigley Field and Old Trafford. Naturally changing its name after two decades would come at a hefty price. Crypto.com paid $700 million for the rights in a 20-year deal per multiple reports. That figure is actually “under reported” according to Russell Silvers Chief Operating Officer of AEG Global Partnerships a division of the arena’s owner and operator sports and entertainment conglomerate AEG — which owns or hosts more than 50 sports franchises globally. The largest naming rights deal in sports history doesn’t happen overnight and we’ll get into exactly how it all went down but first a little history on the arena that the NBA’s Lakers and Clippers the NHL’s Kings and the WNBA’s Sparks call home: Construction broke ground in 1997.

Staples paid $100 million for naming rights in a 10-year deal.

The $375 million Staples Center opened in October 1999.

The Lakers won three consecutive titles in the venue’s first three years.

Staples acquired the naming rights in perpetuity in 2009.

By the end of 2020 the Sparks had won three championships the Kings had won two Stanley Cups and the Lakers had won six titles as residents of Staples Center. The trick was getting out of the lifetime deal with Staples. “To get zero [dollars] from your naming rights partner for one of the most iconic venues in the world for the rest of your business is not good business” said Nick Baker also Chief Operating Officer of AEG Global Partnerships during a call with Silvers and me earlier in March. “We had to go back to our ownership group our owner and our board and say ‘Here’s our idea.’” The idea was to approach New York-based Sycamore Partners the owner of Staples and buy back the naming rights — an effort AEG saw through in 2019. “The value that we purchased [the naming rights] back for wasn’t insignificant but there was certainly a significant ROI generated on what we sold it for” said Baker. Pandemic Setbacks Around the time AEG hit the market in search of a new partner at the end of summer 2019 Baker’s son was diagnosed with a rare liver cancer. Baker’s attention shifted from naming rights to family then not long after the pandemic shut down live sports in March 2020. Not only did the pandemic require AEG to renegotiate 4000 contracts within its global portfolio but it prevented the company from letting prospective naming rights buyers experience the electrifying atmosphere of the 20000-seat arena in-person. That said the search picked back up eventually — and AEG had a firm criteria. They wanted discussions kept secret and piled up NDAs to ensure that. They didn’t want to explore partnerships in categories where they had incumbent deals like theirs with Toyota American Express and Anheuser-Busch. Beyond that they had eyes on the types of brands that you would consider well “cool.” “We wanted it to be a company that was the best and most innovative partner within their industry” with that industry ideally landing in the realm of tech said Silvers. That’s where Crypto.com comes in. Fortune Favors The Brave Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com has descended upon the sports industry in a manner so aggressive that you literally can’t ignore them. Let’s recap the deals the company which boasts 10 million users has inked since 2021 alone: Exclusive cryptocurrency trading platform of FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022

10-year $175 million sponsorship with UFC

5-year $100 million deal with Formula 1

Multi-year partnership with LeBron James and his nonprofit foundation

First innovation and technology partner of Serie A football

Individual deals with the Philadelphia 76ers Paris Saint-Germain Montreal Canadiens and Aston Martin’s F1 team Those deals along with the Crypto.com Arena one are a crucial element of the company’s mission to “accelerate the world’s transition to cryptocurrency.” “Part of that is by communicating to the world that the industry and the technology is mature and that we actually have a real business and that we are here to stay” said Crypto.com Chief Marketing Officer Steven Kalifowitz on a separate call after I spoke with Silvers and Baker. But the Crypto.com Arena deal almost didn’t happen. “We really got into it with [Crypto.com] in the summer of 2021” said Baker. A third-party industry figure whose identity AEG and Crypto.com declined to reveal attempted to connect both parties — but there was one issue. “Something that hasn’t been reported publicly is that we were very far down the line with another company — well into contract negotiations.” When that deal fell apart for “several reasons” and other offers were turned down Baker and Silvers with the help of dozens of AEG employees at all levels went ahead and engaged Kalifowitz and his colleague Gilad Rodkin SVP of Marketing Strategy at Crypto.com. The rest is history. What’s uncertain is the future. The Next Episode For all of the promise cryptocurrency holds it’s also a space rife with controversy — extremely volatile markets fraud and scandal. Some in the sports industry have already suffered the consequences of this reality. FC Barcelona and Manchester City each canceled sponsorships with crypto-related businesses in the same week that Crypto.com Arena was announced due to the nefarious activities of their partners. I asked the team at AEG how they felt about signing a two-decade deal with a company in a market that we quite frankly don’t know will even be relevant — or exist — in the 2040s. “When you’re doing a deal for 15 to 20 years it doesn’t matter what the category is there’s a level of risk in a long-term relationship on both sides” said Baker. “We did an immense amount of due diligence on cryptocurrency and felt very comfortable with not only the category but more importantly the people and company which we’re doing this deal with.” And if the crypto market suddenly crashes and doesn’t recover? “We have a big enough infrastructure built that [the collapse of] no one deal would have catastrophic penalties to our organization” he continued. For his part Kalifowitz believes crypto gets an unfair rap pointing out how blue chip stocks like Facebook Netflix and Disney have been down anywhere from 20% to 40% over the past six months while Bitcoin is up nearly 3% during the same period despite a precipitous drop from its late 2021 highs. He also welcomes the federal government’s impending regulations on cryptocurrency because “once the rules are clear then it becomes easier for everybody to participate in the market.” He compares the current wave of skepticism to reports that the internet was a fad in the 1990s. “A 20-year deal on an iconic stadium suggests that we intend to be here long-term” Kalifowitz elaborated. “People setting up Ponzi schemes don’t hang out at any one place too long right?” The $700 Million Question To say naming rights deals are having a moment would be an understatement. Just across town in Los Angeles you have SoFi Stadium — home of the Rams and Chargers — and the forthcoming Intuit Dome which will house the Clippers come 2024. SoFi paid $625 million for rights for 20 years.

Intuit shelled out $500 million for 23 years.

Across the pond Spotify acquired naming rights to FC Barcelona’s legendary Camp Nou stadium in a $310 million deal announced less than two weeks ago. But where does the money actually go in these massive deals we keep hearing about? “It essentially creates the economics that fund the rest of our business” said Baker. “Several hundred million dollars of renovations are planned for the next three years at Crypto.com Arena to continue to make it a mecca of live entertainment.” Roughly a decade ago I saw Jay-Z Kanye West and Drake tours at Staples Center. When I attended Lakers and Kings games at Crypto.com Arena this month — my first time at the venue since those concerts — I was surprised to see how well its condition has held up. “We’ve never allowed the building to look anything but state of the art” Silvers said. “At the end of every season there’s a huddle up as to what the building needs every year to get better.” It’s certainly easier to address those needs with a fresh $700 million in the bank.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2Zpb3JyZXBvcnRzLmNvbS90aGlzLXByb3N0aGV0aWMtbGltYi1pbnRlZ3JhdGVzLXNtYXJ0LXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktaW50by1pdHMtYnVpbGQtdG8taW50dWl0LWFuZC10cmFjay1lYWNoLXVzZXJzLW1vdmVtZW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This prosthetic limb integrates smart technology into its build to intuit and track each user's movements,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='fiorreports.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The greenback posted a solid gain for the week which marked its sixth weekly gain in the past seven. The dollar has benefited from its status as a safe haven and the conflict in Ukraine has driven expectations the Fed will hike interest rates.

On Friday June U.S. Dollar Index futures settled at 98.822 up 0.022 or +0.02%. The Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund ETF (UUP) closed at $26.42 up $0.02 or +0.06%.

Helping to fuel a late session rally by the index was a surge in U.S. Treasury yields. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a fresh two-year high Friday as investors anticipate a more aggressive Fed. The 10-year rate at its highs of Friday’s session hit 2.503% its highest level since May 2019. The yield started the week near 2.15%.

Daily June U.S. Dollar Index

Daily Swing Chart Technical Analysis

The main trend is down according to the daily swing chart. A trade through 99.300 will change the main trend to up. A move through 97.715 will signal a resumption of the downtrend.

The minor trend is also down. A trade through 98.965 will change the minor trend to up. This will shift momentum to the upside.

The minor range is 99.470 to 97.715. The index settled on the strong side of its pivot at 98.595 making it support.

The next support is the major Fibonacci level at 98.200. A close below this level will be a sign of weakness.

Short-Term Outlook

Look for an upside bias as long as the index holds above the long-term Fibonacci level at 98.200. A sustained move over 98.595 will indicate the buying is getting stronger. If this creates enough upside momentum then look for momentum to shift to the upside on a move through 98.965.

The main trend will change to up on a trade through 99.300. The trend will be reaffirmed if buyers can take out 99.470. This is also the trigger point for an acceleration to the upside.

A downside bias will develop on a sustained move under 98.200. If this creates enough downside momentum then look for the selling to possibly extend into the main bottom at 97.715.

Taking out 97.715 will reaffirm the downtrend. This could lead to a test of minor pivot at 97.280. A failure at this level will lead to a test of the major 50% level at 96.720.

Case Title: Dr. Sonal Pratapsingh Vahanwala v. Deputy District Collector Dharavi

Citation: 2022 LiveLaw (Bom) 90

Observing that an adopted child becomes a family member of his adoptive parents ""in all respects"" the Bombay High Court directed authorities to issue a caste certificate to an 18-year-old based on his mother's scheduled caste identity.

The Bench thus held that an adopted child would be entitled to take the caste identity of his adoptive mother despite the caste authorities' insistence on making the child's biological father's records available.

""One of the effects would be that the child would not get identity of mother and particularly caste of the mother. He would be without identity throughout his life. Similarly very purpose of adopting child by the petitioner being a single mother would stand frustrated. In our opinion such a situation could not be envisaged by law.""

2.That civil court's jurisdiction to entertain the Suit is in the teeth of Section 430 of the Act matters that fall within the domain of the NCLT.

""initiation of action under Chapter III of the SARFAESI Act by the respondent no.1 being a ""secured creditor"" within the meaning of section 2(zd) thereof for the purpose of enforcing the security interest that was created earlier is legally permissible. That the respondent no. 1 is the successor-in-interest of the respondent no.2 which was not a ""financial institution"" at the material time would make no difference insofar as consequence in law is concerned.""

12. Does Minor's Severance From Hindu Undivided Family Take Place On Mere Filing Of Partition Suit Which Got Dismissed For Default? Bombay High Court To Examine



Case Title: Hriday Niraj Mehta vs. Umesh Jayantilal Mehta and Others



Citation: 2022 LiveLaw (Bom) 101

The Bombay High Court is set to decide a complex position in law – will mere filing of a Partition Suit by a minor family member amount to severing of ties from a Hindu Undivided Family even if the Suit is eventually dismissed for non-prosecution while the plaintiff was still a minor or should that minor be considered a part of HUF.

The question has come up in a case where the concerned minor after attaining majority in March 2020 has now challenged a gift deed executed by his parents as a part of HUF while he was a minor but had sought partition of the property under the HUF. The property was eventually sold by another close relative who purportedly received it as a gift and a third party is in possession of the house in an eastern suburb of Mumbai.",,,

Whereas those crises only involved oil Russia is one of the world’s largest producers of nearly every form of energy—oil natural gas coal and even the fuel used in nuclear power plants. The unfolding energy calamity demands an immediate response to keep cars moving homes powered and heated and to prevent a global recession induced by high energy prices. But as policymakers look for quick fixes there is also the urgency of weaning the world from fossil fuels as a major United Nations report made clear last month. In the long run doing so benefits not just the climate but also energy security for large consumers of fossil fuels. Pragmatic policies are needed that ensure secure and affordable energy today and that help to bring about a lower carbon future.

Even though American and EU policymakers initially designed sanctions to exclude energy the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts nearly half of Russia’s oil exports will be off the market by April as buyers steer clear—although some of that will still flow to market at steep discounts in under-the-radar transactions with countries like China and India. Natural gas continues to flow into Europe but Russian leaders have threatened to cut off those supplies in retaliation for sanctions. Even before the invasion of Ukraine energy markets were tight after years of underinvestment as a result of social pressures to curb fossil-fuel spending the pandemic and the industry’s poor recent returns. As a result energy prices soared before falling slightly.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In Forest Park’s second game last season Rintala then a freshman sank a corner 3-pointer at the buzzer to complete the Trojans’ late-game comeback against rival West Iron County.

While memorable that shot did not add to Rintala’s love of the game. The slightly-built all-Skyline Central Conference first-team guard always had that.

Rintala played football as a freshman and said he might rejoin the team as a junior in the fall. He also has gone out for the Trojan baseball team as the program begins this spring. However …

Q: Is basketball you’re favorite sport?

A: Oh yeah by far.

Q: So you play basketball often during the year?

A: Oh yeah every day. I love basketball always have.

Q: So let’s go back to the West Iron game last year. Relive that experience.

A: I remember we were down 12 at halftime it was kind of like that the whole game. And towards the end we went down hit a shot fouled them they missed their free throws that happened like twice. Then we were down one with a couple of seconds (they) missed a free throw and we got the rebound and I remember I just ran to the corner. Sam McKissack passed me the ball. I thought he was going to go to a senior but he passed it to me. It was crazy.

Q: From the start you’ve shown excellent 3-point shooting prowess. Were you always a good shooter or did you develop that?

A: I always say I was decent at it. I wouldn’t say I was the best player right away but I always played with my dad and my brother. I was always like pretty good.

Q: How much do you work on your game?

A: I have a hoop (at home) and I shoot at home. And then I go to the school park to play basketball there. Then I will go back to my house and play. I play until I can’t play anymore.

Q: Now that you’re known by other teams for your outside shot and are guarding you as such are you working on creating off the dribble now and is it a struggle to learn to adapt that way?

A: I wouldn’t say it’s a struggle. I usually practice it but in games I just don’t look for it.

Q: Was that awareness getting better by the end of the season?

A: I’m working on it.

Q: What do you think of how you played this year?

A: It was definitely different lot more attention towards me because not too many people knew about me last year. It was a little difficult that part but as a team I felt like we played better than last year as a whole.

(The Trojans finished 9-12 this season after finishing 7-9 in the COVID-shortened 2020-21 season)

Q: Now teams are trying to stop you from shooting 3-pointers. Is that frustrating to you?

(Continued on 2-B)

A: If the guy’s just going to stay on me and take me away I don’t really care if they’re going to take me away as long as we can still run the offense and score.

Q: This season North Dickinson used that plan on you face-guarded you the whole game…

A: Oh yeah but we were winning so….

Q: How do you assess your ball-handling skills?

A: Not the best but it’s pretty good getting better. But I need to work at that too.

Q: How about your defensive play?

A: Definitely not the best but it was better this year than last year. That’s my main thing I probably need to work on.

Q: Which part?

A: I need to be a little more physical and quicker on my feet.

Q: Did you think this year’s team as young as it was and with a new coach in Jason Price achieved its potential this season?

A: We definitely could have done better but we could have done worse too. We were pretty young but I wish we could have done a little bit better.

Q: In what aspect do you think the team could have done better?

A: Breaking presses not throwing the ball away as much. We got better at it but there were games where we had too many turnovers.

Q: Who was the best team you played against this season?

A: Definitely Ewen.

Q: What impressed you about them?

A: They just know how to play with each other. They just pass the ball around. If one’s covered they pass the ball around. If one can’t score the other one can score. And they were big too. It was hard to guard them.

Q: What are you going to do in the off-season?

A: Definitely start getting in the weight room a lot more. Shot more practice my drive. Just practicing everything taking it a lot more serious than when I was younger.

Q: More seriously?

A: I just realize I have to get better all-around.

Q: What are your thoughts about next year’s team?

A: We should do a lot better. We’re starting to get to know each other more and in another year I think we’re going to be pretty decent. I would say we’ll be up there at the top part (of the district field).

When I filled out my bracket without a Hog Hat on I picked the Bulldogs to win. It seemed to be the objective thing to do. But then a funny thing happened in the Chase Center late Thursday – the Razorbacks won. No matter how many times people complained about the officials calling bad fouls on Chet Holmgren Arkansas was clearly better than Gonzaga that night. The Hogs outshot them from the field blocked more shots than the fearsome Gonzaga frontcourt and had a nearly 2:1 advantage in turnovers. Since the officials (believe it or not!) called a lot more fouls on Arkansas Gonzaga spent a lot more time in the bonus and had a big free throw advantage but still it wasn’t enough.

That win was maybe the single most exciting win in Arkansas basketball history since 1995. Arkansas didn’t need Bud Walton Arena to knock off the team many picked to win the national title. No other team Arkansas could face in the tournament would be as respected as Gonzaga so the sky was the limit.

For the next two days fans were in a frenzy. We watched the remaining Sweet 16 games thinking about how different teams would match up with the Hogs and some people started considering travel plans to New Orleans for the Final Four (finally a realistic travel option to see the Razorbacks this postseason for many Hog fans). I spent two days dealing with random bursts of adrenaline standing up cheering and flexing in celebration and anticipation.

Duke didn’t have the aura of a superteam the way Baylor did last year. The Blue Devils had already lost twice in March including their home finale with what felt like an entire arena of former players in the house to honor Coach K’s last game in Durham. Considering Arkansas had already beaten then top-ranked Auburn and top overall seed Gonzaga there was no reason to fear any team. Every team should be respected of course but the Razorbacks had given us reasons to be confident against any opponent this year.

Unfortunately for Arkansas the Blue Devils are hot. Until Saturday night Arkansas’ defense had feasted on forcing teams into taking bad shots often from long range but Duke didn’t take the bait. They only attempted 10 threes in the game a season low for Arkansas opponents. Duke was able to get the ball into the paint seemingly at will and the Hogs struggled to slow them down. Duke made several contested shots near the basket and seven times when they missed they got the offensive rebound. Duke finished the game shooting over 58% from inside the arc.

It’s very difficult to beat any team playing that efficiently. Arkansas was still able to largely play even with Duke but a quick 8-0 Blue Devil run to close the first half after the Hogs had cut the lead to four points seemed to keep the game out of reach. The Razorbacks got to within five points in the second half but then Duke went on another run and that was the game and Arkansas’ season.

This Arkansas Basketball Team’s Place in History

For a long time it seemed foolish to compare this team to last year’s Elite Eight team but based on the end result it’s hard not to. While the 2021 team didn’t suffer the embarrassing losses to Hofstra and Vanderbilt early in the season they also didn’t have anything close to the highs of this season. This year’s team:

Beat #1 ranked Auburn

Beat #1 ranked Gonzaga in the NCAA Tournament

Beat the best Kentucky team in a few years

Beat a Tennessee team that could’ve been a 2-seed

Beat LSU and Will Wade three times

Beat Florida in Gainesville for the first time since Corliss Williamson and Scotty Thurman

This was a special run. The Razorbacks did all this without a first round NBA draft pick on the roster (at least for this year’s draft). The last 10 weeks or so have remarkable. The Razorbacks went from being on the wrong side of the bubble to earning a 4-seed and making the Elite Eight. Seasons like this don’t happen very often. These have clearly been the best two Razorback basketball teams in a generation and future Arkansas basketball teams – starting with the most anticipated one in decades this fall – will be compared to them.

JD Notae finished with 660 points for the season – tied for 8th in Razorback history for a single year. The other player to finish with that number was Sidney Moncrief back in 1979. Jaylin Williams finished with 54 charges taken and as a result could cement himself as a longtime fan favorite and biggest heel in the SEC if he comes back next season. It’s exciting to think about the possibilities for Williams’ future if he can add just a bit more polish to his offensive game.

But man even without that polish what a game. Against Duke basketball Arkansas might have lost the war but it won the below mano-a-mano battle with a future top 3 NBA Draft pick in high style:

Who’s Ready for Next Season’s Arkansas Team?

As great as this season was the hype for the 2022-23 season began soaring last fall when 5-star players Nick Smith Jr. and Jordan Walsh joined Arkansas’ recruiting class. They joined a class that is now ranked #2 in the country only behind aggravatingly enough Duke. That part is all well-known. What still remains to be seen who will complement that buffo class in Fayetteville next season.

Last year’s transfers specifically Jalen Tate and Justin Smith chose to leave school instead of taking advantage of a bonus eligibility season due to the pandemic. A few notable Razorbacks specifically Notae and Au’Diese Toney have the option to return for another season. Either of them choosing to return would be a big boost for Arkansas. Notae however would likely need to share the ball more and get significantly fewer attempts. That may be too much for a first team All-SEC super senior to accept.

For a long time in college basketball it’s been possible for any player to leave a team and go pro at any point. It felt like that was almost expected for any college player whenever he had a good season. It will be interesting to see how the new NIL rules impact those decisions. Previously it might have made a lot more sense for a player to test things out overseas to make money since there wasn’t much to be made as an upperclassman in college. But now that players are earning potentially significant money through NIL staying in school may be more appealing for some players than leaving the country. Since NIL deals like the one Notae has with a JB Hunt family-backed collective are largely private it’s hard to say how much of an impact they’ll have but we’ll get a sense of it soon.

The roster will fill out pretty quickly. Arkansas got a huge coup on Monday night with the commitment of blue-chip recruit Anthony Black sending expectations for the 2022-23 team officially through the roof. Plus a number of players throughout the country have already announced they’re entering the transfer portal and it wouldn’t be a surprise if some of the Razorbacks who didn’t play as much this season entered the portal as well. Eric Musselman said he was going to start working on next season as soon as he got out of the Chase Center Saturday night so we know he’s already figuring out how to fill those spots.

After consecutive Elite Eight trips the goal for next year will likely be to move beyond that and return to the Final Four. Final Fours and championships are the only thing Musselman hasn’t yet returned to Razorback basketball but it feels like he’s almost got the pieces to do it. That may not be a fair expectation. Plenty of teams with higher-rated recruits failed to make the Elite Eight this season. Kentucky didn’t even make it out of the first round. The unexpected always happens in the NCAA Tournament but that shouldn’t change the goal and the goals are clear.

Only seven-ish months until tipoff in November! I guess there’s still baseball and football if you’re into that sort of thing.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""

From thousands of stocks 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5 Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand soaring 2022 earnings estimates and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares retail investors could jump in at any time.

This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Eduardo Marques Federal Services Chief Operating Officer relayed to Saa and Jacobs “after vetting alternative submarkets from Reston to Tysons we realized there wasn’t another location that could duplicate what we have in our Clarendon/Courthouse location.

Edward Saa explains “we were able to help CNI by leveraging multiple local landlords in Fairfax and Arlington County. After conducting a comprehensive analysis we found that renewing was not only the most cost-effective option but it also scored the highest in non-economic factors. We were able to secure them great financial lease terms while not sacrificing any of the amenities and convivences that were important to them as an organization.”

Chickasaw Federal serves as the government contracting arm of Chickasaw Nation Industries.

The Q&As will be published daily in order of responses not in numerical order of districts.

Responses for candidates running for District 29 are below.

Tom Jacobs (i)

Age: 69

Education: 3+ years at UW-La Crosse and Winona State

Occupation: Retired after 36 years with the La Crosse Police Department retiring in 2011 holding the rank of Assistant Chief

Political experience: I have served on the Town Board in the town of Greenfield since approximately 2007 and currently serve as chairman. I was appointed to the La Crosse County Board in 2019 to fill the vacancy in District 27. I was elected to that position in the 2020 election. I have served on the Health and Human Services Board since my appointment and served on the Health Ethics Committee while it existed. I also serve on the Criminal Justice Management Council and the Solid Waste Policy Board. The Comprehensive Plan Review Committee I serve on is nearing completing its mission.

Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?

I applied for the vacancy in 2019 because I believe that representing the residents of the district is truly important. I have been able to serve as a conduit for concerns expressed to me. Because of the dual roles of both the Town Board and County Board I have had the opportunity to directly address some of these concerns and on others route them to the people who can address the issues. Additionally having worked for the city I was able to develop good working relationships with individuals and Departments in the County.

My wife Maxine and I have been foster and adoptive parents in and for La Crosse County since the mid 1970s and again have developed strong relationships within Human Services as well as strong advocacy for youth in our community.

I would like to work toward further collaboration and cooperation both locally and regionally. There currently exists a growing sense of collaboration and the importance of that in the future of our region.

La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?

I believe that providing a safety net for the homeless people in our community while also providing opportunities to enable people to move forward with their lives is critical. I also believe that improving the safety of our infrastructure is equally important to people in our county. These are both long-term commitments for the county and both are critical for the safety of our residents and future development within the county.

What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?

I think that relationships between the county and municipalities in the county have been steadily improving. The county has worked diligently on collaborating with the townships on planning for the future and serves as a partner in critical issues. County staff and administration as well as elected officials participate in Wisconsin Towns Association local meetings and events providing information and support to towns within the county.

Ken Schlimgen

Age: 59

Education: Master’s degree in Business Administration (MBA) Bachelor of Science degrees in Education and Agriculture (Animal Sciences)

Occupation: Manager of Market Operations Trading & Wholesale Power for Dairyland Power Cooperative

Political experience: 13 years on the West Salem School Board

Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?

I believe that La Crosse County is much more than the city of La Crosse. I am running to serve as a voice for the rural areas especially the Towns of Barre and Greenfield that I would be representing. For years the rural areas have been under-represented and under-funded. My goal would be to assure that funds are spent wisely in the county as a whole and that rural areas would share in the benefit of the services offered by the county. In particular the rural area needs to be assured that they have adequate assistance from supported law enforcement and that the rural roads are maintained in a safe manner.

La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?

I think that the most important project was not allocated any funding that of repair of our rural highway system. I think that many of the allocations that are currently slated will in fact be a detriment to the county because it is being treated as continuous and not one time funding. Setting programs to be funded over a multi-year period shows a lack of forethought on behalf of the committee allocating these funds. One time funds should be used for one time projects. In addition we should never forget that government funding is our funding. The government does not create money they simply take it from us.

What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWxpc3QuY29tLzgxMjQzNy93aHktamFjb2ItZWxvcmRpcy1hcHBlYXJhbmNlLWF0LXRoZS1vc2NhcnMtaGFzLWV1cGhvcmlhLWZhbnMtZnJlYWtpbmctb3V0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Jacob Elordi's Appearance At The Oscars Has Euphoria Fans Freaking Out,"Why Jacob Elordi's Appearance At The Oscars Has Euphoria Fans Freaking Out

""People constantly discovering that jacob elordi is australian is the funniest thing ever"" someone else tweeted however. And another Twitter user seconded ""There's no way y'all just finding out that Jacob Elordi is australian ???""

House Speaker Mike Johnson continues to oversee one of the narrowest House majorities in history leaving little margin for error as he navigates his conference and faces threats to his leadership.

Republicans control 217 seats while Democrats control 213 after Democratic Rep. Tim Kennedy of New York was sworn in Monday evening. There are currently five vacant seats.

That breakdown leaves Republicans with a one-vote margin which means they can only afford one defection from within their conference to still pass legislation on a party-line when all members are present and voting. A tie vote in the House is a fail.

In addition to the tight margin there is always the possibility that absences can further impact the vote math.

The tight vote margin means that any individual member has the potential to exert outsized influence and Johnson has frequently felt pressure from his right flank.

The extremely narrow margin has forced the speaker to put high-profile bills directly onto the floor under a procedural move known as suspension of the rules in certain instances as his right flank has increasingly taken to tanking rule votes on the floor in a show of protest.

But that strategy compels the need for a two-thirds majority to pass bills requiring significant Democratic support and further alienating Johnson from the right wing of his conference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA2L2pvaG5zb24tcHVsbHMtcGxhbnMtbWlncmFudC1zaGVsdGVyLTExdGgtd2FyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson reverses course on moving migrants from downtown to proposed shelter in 11th Ward after stiff opposition ...,"Mayor Brandon Johnson announced Monday he is pulling his proposal to move migrants from downtown to a new shelter in the South Side 11th Ward before the Democratic National Convention in the face of stiff opposition from the local alderman and the building’s owners the latest setback in the administration’s attempts to house asylum-seekers.

The change came after the owners of the property said Johnson never informed them of his plans to use the building at 3951 S. Canal St. for a shelter. When the Tribune asked the city about that apparent disconnect the Department of Family and Support Services released a Monday statement saying the city is “no longer considering” doing so.

“We were surprised to hear news reports of the City’s plan to possibly use our property as a migrant shelter” Bajaj Medical the pharmaceutical company that owns the building in the New City neighborhood said in a Sunday statement. “Bajaj Medical has not been contacted by City officials and has not approved and does not intend to approve any public use of this property.”

DFSS’ statement acknowledged that was true but clarified that “while City staff had not had conversations with the owner there were conversations held with the owner’s broker of the property and our vendor.”

Representatives with Bajaj Medical which lists Ram Chakroborty as its registered agent in state business records did not respond to a request for further comment on Monday.

Ald. Nicole Lee 11th told the Tribune earlier on Sunday that the “pretty shocking” communication breakdown points to a larger pattern of the Johnson administration’s shaky leadership on the migrant crisis.

“What’s going on? What’s going on that nobody was in touch with the owners?” Lee said. “This shines a big light and calls into question how this is being managed and the people that we have working for the city … That just is mind-blowing to me.”

Reached for comment Monday after the plan was killed Lee said she was “pleased and grateful.” But her blistering critiques from the previous day reflected new levels of frustration from the alderman who represents Chinatown and Bridgeport after being appointed by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and then winning a full term.

Lee had said the proposal to house migrants in an industrial area surrounded by train tracks elicited environmental and safety concerns. But what most disappointed her was the administration’s explanation that the move was because of the planned closure of a downtown migrant shelter before the Democratic National Convention comes to Chicago in August she said.

“I was told that the location would need renovations that they needed to get everything done and ready for a July 1 move-in ahead of the DNC” Lee said Sunday. “It was pretty disturbing. … It seemed that they were down a path and I’m hoping that we’ve as a city learned a lot of lessons from all of the experiences in the last year with opening shelters.”

The fate of the 41000-plus asylum-seekers who have arrived in Chicago since 2022 has been an ongoing quandary for Johnson who has struggled with how to move expeditiously to house them in shelters without angering the city’s 50 aldermen a role that comes with being territorial over ward matters. Attempts to place asylum-seekers in sites from the Far Northwest Side to Roseland have run into a seemingly never-ending cascade of grumbles from council members across the political spectrum.

One of the most high-profile conflicts concerned Ald. Julia Ramirez 12th a freshman progressive who ultimately prevailed in seeing a proposed winterized base camp for 2000 migrants scrapped after Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration yanked funding away due to environmental concerns. Other aldermen have been less successful.

Lee is more of a political moderate within the City Council and endorsed Johnson’s runoff opponent Paul Vallas after her chosen candidate Lightfoot was knocked out of the running. However she has voted with Johnson to give him some slim City Council wins: She backed the Gaza cease-fire resolution that prevailed in a tie-breaker vote cast by the mayor and Johnson’s recent move to allocate another $70 million in city funds to address the migrant crisis.

On Sunday the alderman signaled those days may be over: “The city has been spending an inordinate amount of money in response to this. … I see what we’re getting in return. We’re paying Ritz-Carlton rates for Motel Six service.”

Johnson’s team has been vexed by the aldermanic pushback with his chief of staff Cristina Pacione-Zayas often stressing in reporter briefings that the city is in crisis mode and council members need to step up and meet the administration halfway.

The DFSS statement on the shelved 11th Ward proposal on Monday said “As part of our commitment to foster transparency and inclusivity Ald. Lee was given notice early in the process in an effort to gather feedback and information about this potential site. This site was under preliminary consideration and a site visit by various City departments had not been conducted.”

Bajaj Medical has contributed $1001 to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart and $2800 to the 11th Ward Democrats according to state campaign finance records.

Complicating the matter further still is the mayor’s task to showcase Chicago’s strengths — including its reputation as a pro-immigrant city — on a national stage at the DNC. Johnson has long pointed to the way his own election energized young progressives and reflected the party’s leftward shift as proof Chicago is the perfect place to celebrate President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign.

Republicans though have highlighted past scenes of migrant families sleeping outside Chicago police stations to make the case Biden is weak on immigration and the nation’s eyes will be on the United Center as well as the downtown business district during the affair. The latter area is home to the Standard Club shelter 320 S. Plymouth Court where over 900 migrants live. Johnson wanted to move the Standard Club residents to the Canal Street building according to Lee.

So far a sudden escalation of migrant buses sent north from Texas has not repeated itself but few within Chicago government are counting on that reprieve to last as the Democratic Party event draws near.

Johnson meanwhile dodged questions Monday on the botched 11th Ward shelter plans by blaming Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for sending migrant buses to Chicago.

“We have to be prepared for things that we don’t have control of one of which is the behavior of the governor of Texas” the mayor told reporters before making a reference to the recent rap beef between artists Kendrick Lamar and Drake. “Now I’m not quite sure if he’s auditioning to come up with a diss track for the state of Illinois or the city of Chicago but the fact of the matter is his behavior has caused chaos around this country.”

Morgan Partner to Invest in Diverse Entrepreneurs,"An $80 million investment powered by J.P. Morgan will support more than 400 companies through 37+ programs in 9 cities to create opportunities for wealth creation often constrained by institutional structural and systemic barriers

Open to founders of all backgrounds this program has been designed to provide equitable access to funding and support for entrepreneurs who are Black Hispanic and Latino Indigenous American and Pacific Islander

Techstars today announced a new accelerator program powered by J.P. Morgan that will invest more than $80 million in diverse entrepreneurs and founders across the country. Techstars and J.P. Morgan began partnering in 2021 to develop this program focused on advancing equitable access to funding in major economic centers.

In the first half of 2021 Black entrepreneurs received just 1.2 percent of U.S. venture capital funding. Additional data show that Latino founders raised only 2 percent of U.S. venture capital investments in 2021. This partnership seeks to help bridge the racial and ethnic wealth divide through Techstars’ unique startup accelerators that provide access to capital one-on-one mentorship and customized programming for early-stage entrepreneurs.

“The data and experience show founders from diverse communities and backgrounds represent an untapped market with tremendous financial upside for investors the entrepreneurs and the communities they operate in. With J.P. Morgan our goal is to be more intentional in the way our programs attract support and invest in Black Latino and other underrepresented founders” says Mäelle Gavet CEO of Techstars.

“Together with Techstars our goal is to improve access to the capital and other resources needed by underrepresented entrepreneurs to start fund and then scale their businesses” said Kristin Kallergis Rowland global head of alternative investments at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.

With 27% of Techstars’ existing portfolio company CEOs identifying as Black Hispanic and Latino Indigenous American American Indian or Alaska Native Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Middle East/North African this partnership is designed to create further support for diverse founders of high-growth early-stage startups to generate greater income stronger influence and wealth creation.

“The multi-year program will focus on entrepreneurs and founders that have been overlooked by traditional venture capital sources” said Tiffany Lewis head of diverse manager strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “This new commitment will advance the shift toward more equitable economic opportunities through access to financial services mentorship quality education and training and promoting inclusive business practices.”

Over the next three years the investment will be distributed to more than 400 companies through 37 Techstars programs in 9 U.S. cities. The first five cities Atlanta Chicago Detroit Miami and Washington D.C. launch today with a call for applications from entrepreneurs of all backgrounds. The Los Angeles New Orleans New York and Oakland programs will launch in 2023. All nine of these high-growth technology ecosystems were selected for several strategic reasons including the prominence of the diverse make-up of their populations which each program seeks to reflect.

Each of the three-month programs will support founders like Jasmine Jones who went through Techstars’ Kansas City Accelerator in 2020.

Co-founder of Techstars portfolio company Cherry Blossom Intimates  Jasmine describes her Techstars experience as opening doors of possibilities with no limit to success. “I met more than 90 mentors who helped me to refine my business model build my cap table and raise $1.25 million in 30 days.”

“What made me excited to be a part of the Techstars program is that it opens doors to new possibilities and business potential” Jones said. “The network is invaluable.”

Cherry Blossom Intimates is an online accredited medical facility and brick and mortar boutique. During Techstars Jasmine also launched Myya the first direct to consumer post-mastectomy brand that also accepts insurance and connects patients to certified fitters for post-mastectomy bra and prosthesis fittings from home.

Measuring impact and ensuring accountability within this multi-city U.S. program is paramount as these small steps forward can help narrow the gap in the racial wealth divide and growing economic inequality. While the programs are open to founders of all backgrounds their recruitment efforts will have a focus on Black Latino and Hispanic entrepreneurs and those who identify with being racially and ethnically diverse. Progress will be tracked regularly and shared with senior leadership across both organizations. These efforts will further allow for maximum program impact and aim to bring an enhanced equity and inclusion lens to the wider investment community.

McDonalds and other American businesses have closed in Russia amid its invasion into Ukraine.

One expert estimates more than 200000 Russians have left the country since the start of the war.

To counter economic turmoil Putin has demand “unfriendly'' countries pay for natural gas exports in rubles.

The once bustling corner of Moscow’s central Tverskaya Street looked deserted on Wednesday as Russia’s first-ever McDonald’s franchise – opened in 1990 in a move that symbolized the Soviet Union's opening to the West – shut its doors.

A large mural depicting a giant Soviet-era medal – the Order of Victory the highest military decoration awarded in World War II -- loomed over over the empty sidewalk.

“We are proud"" reads a sign on the mural.

Less than a month after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered more than 150000 Russian soldiers to invade neighboring Ukraine Western sanctions leveled against Moscow have sent the economy into free fall. McDonalds and other American businesses have closed operations in the country amid outrage over Putin's decision to invade Russia's sovereign democratic neighbor.

(AP) — Standing in a parking lot at the corner of Beatties Ford Road and LaSalle Street in West Charlotte 82-year-old Elloree Erwin paints a picture of the thriving neighborhood over the decades.

There were the lifelong friends she met on frequent walks from the Double Oaks neighborhood to Johnson C. Smith University in the late 1950s and early ’60s. In between classes Erwin picked up shifts at the box office of the Ritz Theater on Beatties Ford Road built exclusively for the Black community.

Along the way she met folks across the neighborhood from business owners to truck delivery workers. People she said were proud to say they lived on that side of town. “This was the life of the Black community” Erwin said.

And sitting in one of the more prominent corners of the neighborhood was McDonald’s Cafeteria. Not to be confused with the fast food restaurant the cafeteria was a staple in the community for decades.

Christopher Dennis a local developer purchased the 1970s-era building at 2023 Beatties Ford Road a couple years ago with an eye towards redevelopment.

Dennis was initially considering tearing the building down due to its age and other factors. Dennis’ company E-Fix Development Corp. bought it for $1.25 million in early 2020 according to county property records.

But during one planning meeting shortly after he purchased the building Dennis was on his phone when he came across an old Charlotte Observer story referencing the building. He learned how John McDonald a Black entrepreneur born in Charlotte started his well-known cafeteria in 1970 at that same site.

Dennis knew he couldn’t tear it down.

UNDERSTANDING CHARLOTTE’S HISTORY

So instead of knocking it down Dennis moved forward with welcoming a JP Morgan Chase branch that opened last September.

The interior is mostly unfamiliar to the cafeteria’s heyday as a meeting place for the Black community. But the exterior of the building still shares many of the same qualities.

That’s why Erwin was eager to meet Dennis on a recent sunny March day. She had heard of his work along Beatties Ford Road and was hopeful the landmark designation would get approved.

“I’m glad people like you are doing things to revitalize bring it back to the original standards and the goals that we all wanted for our neighborhood” Erwin told Dennis cars whizzing by them at the busy intersection.

Dennis wants that too.

His company is redeveloping a commercial site across the street from the former cafeteria. He’s seeking the historic designation to help educate the wider community about the people who helped pave the way.

“I want people to drive through Beatties Ford Road and not only live the future but understand the history” Dennis said.

WHO WAS JOHN MCDONALD?

McDonald’s Cafeteria is not to be confused with the fast-food restaurant.

John McDonald’s small business was “one of the most important spaces for the African American community in Charlotte” the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmarks Commission wrote in a designation report completed last August.

At its March 14 meeting the commission held a public hearing the first step in an approval process that eventually will head to the City Council.

When he was in his early 20s McDonald moved his family to Brooklyn New York where he worked as a cook in a hotel seafood house and steak restaurant according to the commission’s report. In 1949 he opened his own restaurant called McDonald’s Dining Room.

McDonald later felt called by God to return to Charlotte. Once home he noticed the popularity of buffet-style cafeterias.

By 1970 he had purchased the building at Beatties Ford Road and LaSalle Street. He also opened a “mini center” with a seafood store beauty and barber shop an insurance and real estate office and a small grocery store the report notes.

McDonald leased the spaces to young managers for a relatively low rate and employed local college students.

The cafeteria grew in popularity known for both a family atmosphere and a place where politicians and other city officials gathered. McDonald served breakfast lunch and dinner with dishes including short ribs fried fish mac and cheese and sweet potato pie.

At the time few businesses in the area were Black-owned.

This was despite the fact that the neighborhoods surrounding Beatties Ford Road were predominantly African American. McDonald worked to change that by using his own capital to provide commercial space at reasonable rates to Black managers the report states.

MCDONALD’S MOVES UP THE STREET

In 1982 McDonald moved the cafeteria to a bigger space on Beatties Ford Road. The new location was closer to Interstate 85 at 2812 Beatties Ford Road.

The new spot could seat around 250 people. Churches held meetings there. So did civic organizations.

“That cafeteria was the heart of our community” Erwin recalled. “Everybody met there.”

That included Erwin’s sister Sarah Stevenson.

Stevenson started the Tuesday Morning Breakfast Forum which met to discuss issues important to the Black community. The group gathered around hot coffee at McDonald’s. The forum is still around today.

Whenever the Rev. Jesse Jackson came to town people would meet him at the cafeteria Erwin recalled.

The Black political caucus would also meet at the cafeteria. Together members pushed for better representation in government as well as equal access to things like bank funding. “Everything that we are still pushing for now” Erwin said.

Stevenson’s forum would grow from its roots at the cafeteria to a prominent group that would eventually help people like Dennis the developer.

“If you were looking to do something or be something in Charlotte” Dennis said “and you didn’t go to that forum it might not have gotten done.”

At the new location further up Beatties Ford Road McDonald expanded to include other business ventures. He opened a hotel and amusement park known as Fun City in 1992.

Along the way his cafeteria became a “must see and visit” place in Charlotte widely regarded as the most popular non-chain restaurant in the city the commission’s report states.

A LOSS FOR REGULARS

By June 2003 McDonald’s Cafeteria closed. By then it was owned by a firm whose investors included former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt. Both Gantt and Rep. Mel Watt a former congressman cited a tough business climate.

The eatery hotel and amusement park ran into hard times after McDonald died in 1995 and the restaurant faced foreclosure according to Observer files.

Stevenson was saddened by the loss to the community. In a transplant-heavy boomtown the cafeteria was a place for regulars to see each other Stevenson told an Observer reporter at the time.

KEEPING MCDONALD’S ‘VISION’ ALIVE

The Landmarks Commission makes recommendations to the City Council on designating historic landmarks. A public hearing is scheduled for McDonald’s Cafeteria at the City Council meeting on March 28. Council members are also expected to vote on the designation then according to a city spokesman.

If approved the building would join 358 other landmark buildings across the county. Other nearby designations include the Excelsior Club at 921 Beatties Ford Road. The Grand Theater 333 Beatties Ford Road is also a landmark along with buildings on JCSU’s campus.

The designation of the McDonald’s building would give design review authority over the property to the landmarks commission. Any material alterations made to the property must first get approved by the commission.

It does not however prevent demolition. A property owner can decide to tear the building down and by law the commission can’t deny that application. But it has the power to delay the decision for up to a year to find an alternative.

For Erwin the building still carries important memories. She can remember McDonald as a father figure.

Dennis she said is among a group of people working to keep that legacy alive.

“(McDonald) was a man that I feel had an open heart to do something in his community that his people could come to and have a nice place to sit down and eat” Erwin said. “He had a vision for this area.”

After the United States refused to budge on technical requirements and “sovereign operational restrictions” according to one Emirati official the deal for up to fifty F-35s was canceled in December 2021.

The UAE’s position reveals the tough choices for smaller powers caught between the United States and China. As they shop for the prized jewels of the twenty-first century including top military communications and health technologies countries like the UAE will be forced to choose between state-of-the-art equipment sold by two very different countries.

As the outcome of the F-35 deal demonstrates the United States is very particular about its data. “Even if the F-35 itself is not using this 5G network if the UAE is embracing Huawei 5G technology and using it for ground stations communications towers on bases then that is an opportunity for China to draw a lot of intelligence about the way the F-35 operates” said Emily Harding a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in comments to C4ISRNET.

The risk then? “This is concerning because it is giving an adversary [China] a lot of insight into our highest-functioning airplane.” As Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters back in December “These end-user requirements and protection of US defense equipment are universal non-negotiable and nonspecific to the UAE.”

Having tossed the F-35 deal for now the UAE has set out to demonstrate that it has more partners than the United States. In February the country purchased twelve L15 stealth fighters from China. The UAE is also expecting a delivery of eighty Rafale F4 fighter jets from France later this decade. Of course neither fighter is as good as the F-35 but the point was made: the UAE has other options including China.

Cooperation between the UAE telecommunications industry and Huawei is deep. Emirati telecom company du inked a deal with Huawei to provide 5G network services back in October 2019 according to du’s chief technology officer Saleem Alblooshi. Huawei showed off its capabilities last year in cooperation with du when it broadcast the UAE’s President’s Cycling Cup using 5G. Just a few weeks ago at the Mobile World Congress in Spain Huawei signed an agreement with both du and Emirati telecom firm Etisalat to jointly provide 5G edge computing services which involves moving “traffic and services from a centralised cloud to the edge of the network and closer to the customer” Juniper networks reported. Etisalat and Huawei also successfully tested fiber-to-the-room a fiber optic-based networking solution for hotels and businesses in a multi-story building in February.

The technological partnership doesn’t end there. The two countries established joint laboratories for researching telecommunications and artificial intelligence including the 5G and Internet of Things Joint Open Lab and the China-Emirates Science and Technology Innovation Laboratory (CSET). The CSET lab recently showed off China’s Golden Eagle CR500 helicopter drones and MR40 unmanned aircraft. The UAE plans to add at least ten CR500s and twenty MR40s to its current fleet of Wing Loong I and II drones which were originally based on the American MQ-1 Predator drone.

The UAE is using Huawei to build its own high-tech indigenous telecommunications services not replace them. Referring to a test after the 5G edge computing agreement was signed Khalid Murshed chief technology and information officer at Etisalat said “The success of this testing activity will support UAE industries and the government sector in achieving their digital transformational objectives.”

Other countries have long been involved in the UAE’s communications sector. Etisalat also “is extending its partnership with Amazon Web Services to address the growing demand for digitalisation in key economic industries including oil and gas manufacturing and logistics.” France’s Thales Group which recently created “a 100% Emirati company whose objective is to support the country’s aspirations to develop national industrial autonomy” describes itself as “a long-term partner of the UAE armed forces.” Thales Group also has several educational partnerships with Emirati universities.

The UAE’s cooperation with Huawei like its relationship with other international firms is a means to an end. That doesn’t mean concerns about data security aren’t substantive: in a highly globalized world data security is never guaranteed. At some point the United States will either decide the F-35’s data is too valuable to fall into Chinese hands and decide to limit the Emiratis to lower-tier products or it will reach a compromise. Andreas Kreig a senior lecturer at King’s College London said “It is more likely that the Biden administration will come out with a meaningless concession for the Emiratis to be able to publicly say why they allow the deal to go through. This may include creating the U.S.’s own little hub of data companies in the UAE to compete with Chinese companies.”

Alternatively the alleged concern over Chinese-Emirati ties is a distraction from the real issue: the Biden administration’s disagreement with Emirati foreign and domestic policies. Under the Trump administration the United States was willing to sell F-35s to the UAE even as it waged a determined campaign across the globe to convince countries not to use Huawei. What’s changed is the party in control of the United States and if the Emiratis are unable to convince the Biden administration to sell them the F-35s they will have to wait for another chance in 2024.

Most UAE-China cooperation is economic but increased military intelligence or political ties are worth watching for. The UAE is unlikely to pursue abrupt increases in institutional and operational military ties with the Chinese because of its longstanding participation in U.S.-led exercises and shared security interests with countries such as Greece Egypt and Israel. However that history may not prevent it from cooperating with the Chinese behind the scenes. According to the Wall Street Journal sources the F-35 deal may have ended due to the Emiratis’ willingness to permit the Chinese to operate a military facility near Abu Dhabi likely for intelligence-gathering purposes or to set the foundation for military access. The UAE hosts approximately 3500 U.S. soldiers and according to a Congressional Research Service report UAE ports host more U.S. Navy ships than any other foreign port in the world.

The UAE is a good target for foreign military and intelligence services. In fact if any intelligence relationship is growing quickly it’s the relationship between the UAE and Israel. In the wake of the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords the two countries are sharing Iranian-related intelligence including information related to Hezbollah cyberattacks. It would not be surprising if Israel and the UAE were also sharing intelligence on how to win over the Americans.

Because the UAE doesn’t have the military power to significantly alter foreign policy outcomes alone it relies on its status as a high-tech international economic hub to gain diplomatic leverage. Yet while the United States provides most of the UAE’s fighter jets and air defenses the UAE also knows the United States is not the only game in town.

The top three companies on the list are AO Kaspersky Lab China Mobile and China Telecom. There are currently eight companies on the list. In addition to the three companies there are also Huawei ZTE Hytera Hikvision and Dahua shares. The latter companies were listed in March last year.

According to reports the FCC law in 2019 is to protect the security of the US communication network. The FCC claims that all the companies on the list pose a serious security threat to the United States. Last June the FCC voted to pass a ban on the use of equipment from companies on the list on U.S. telecommunications networks. Last October the U.S. Senate asked the FCC not to issue new equipment licenses to companies already on the list.

He still looks the same with his Hollywood smile and muscular physique even minus the cape.

The News Journal sat down with actor Dean Cain Friday night at Crossroads Church.

Cain played the role of Clark Kent/Superman in the TV series ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" and was in Mansfield Friday to play a pastor in a new JCFilms' movie ""APOCALYPSE: The Key to the Realms"" at the Ontario campus of Crossroads Church on Lexington-Springmill Road.

He's also playing a pastor in ""Drop the Beat"" another JCFilms' production being made in Mansfield.

Friday night award-winning actor Cain was on hand to launch the nonprofit Ohio Helping Hands' program that benefits foster families.

Making his first trip to Mansfield this past week Cain said he's been to Columbus and Cleveland a number of times and loves both cities.

""I'm pretty excited for Cleveland getting a new quarterback and they're going to be immediate Super Bowl contenders which is pretty exciting"" Cain said in an interview. ""I like Baker (Mayfield) too. He's was a lot of fun but that's the nature of this game. I played this game. My buddy (actor) Eddie (McClintock of North Canton) is from nearby. I'd like to visit Canton. I'd love to see the Football Hall of Fame.""

Cain who was born in Michigan joked that some Ohio State fans give him a hard time.

""Ohio's been wonderful and fantastic and every time I've been here I've had a great time"" he said.

Cain who is adopted handed out the first set of ""Foster Family Fun Packs"" to Richland County Children Services prior to the film premiere of ""Joey & Rex Save the Church."" The film made in Mansfield last November stars among others Pastor Dave Vance of Crossroads Church.

Cain said he keeps busy with filming with his friend Jason Campbell who founded JCFilms.

""My roles are smaller. I don't star in the films"" he said. ""It's wonderful. I can come in and play a part and do something and be in the film and help give it some notoriety without having it be my job.""

The ball cap he wore adorned with an ""A"" and angel wings has special meaning for Cain.

""I have a big huge movie coming out for me that I wrote produced directed and starred in a multi-million-dollar film. It's called 'Little Angels'"" he said.

""It's the story of a college football coach who gets in trouble for being politically incorrect then gets suspended for the year and has to coach and do community service and having to coach a 13-and-under girls' soccer team which he doesn't like doing"" Cain said.

""It's a baby for me it's a living breathing thing"" he said. ""I actually screen it for distributors next week.""

Cain said he will be talking about the Hollywood picture coming out a picture he made off the beaten path with a single financier.

Always busy Cain said work is not the problem — ""time to do all the work is.""

Ingredients used to make grocery store products are getting more expensive too and it's now being reflected on price tags at your favorite stores.

Several food brands are in charge of quite a few smaller names in lots of aisles and three have recently announced that in March they would be raising prices to combat inflation. Here are some of the specific products that have or will soon get another big price increase.

6 Things You'll See at Costco This Year

Mondelez Snacks like Oreos Chips Ahoy and More

Back when inflation was up by 7% at the beginning of the year Mondelez announced that it would raise the price of its products like Ritz Crackers Sour Patch Kids Chips Ahoy Oreos and more once again. The news came after it said in November 2021 it would raise prices in January 2022 by around 7% to offset inflation.

""[Suppliers] don't have enough for all their customers so they basically say you'll have to pay what I tell you to pay"" Dirk Van de Put Mondelez's CEO told The Wall Street Journal. ""It's all out of whack.""

Oat Milk

The price of oats and other raw materials in addition to devastating harvests means that the oat milk brand Oatly is going to raise the prices of its products. CFO Christian Hanke detailed the plan in the company's recent earnings call saying that while shoppers in the U.S. will have until July to get Oatly products for the same price those in other parts of the world are already paying more.

""We are seeing higher costs raw materials logistics and energy globally as well as labor inflation. We are strategically taking price increases in EMEA and the Americas to help offset a portion of these higher costs"" he said. ""Price increases are already in effect in certain markets in [Europe the Middle East and Africa] and we will begin to see the benefit of price increases in the Americas starting in the second half of 2022.""

Kraft Heinz products like Oscar Mayer Bacon and Velveeta

Kraft Heinz is taking a page from the same book and making the price of some of its staples at the grocery store go up between 5% and 30% in March. That amounts to over $1 more in some cases. Velveeta Fresh packs will go up 6.6% cold cuts and hot dogs by 10% Maxwell coffee by 5% Capri Sun and Kool-Aid options by 20% and Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon by 30%.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

The company announced the hikes in February through a letter to shoppers noting that the reasonings include ""constrained supply logistic bottlenecks and weather-driven crop losses.""

General Mills Products

General Mills manufacturers brands like Annie's Betty Crocker Cheerios Lucky Charm's Trix and more and is raising the price of them. The company began the process in mid-January according to CNN with some of the items being as much as 20% more.

In addition to upping its prices General Mills also says that products that have pizza dough may be hard to find on shelves. CFO Kofi Bruce admitted that the company is seeing ""acute supply shortages"" and is only able to produce enough Pillsbury and Totino's pizza rolls products for shoppers to find around 70% of the time.

LOS ANGELES — Thousands of central and Southern California grocery workers have voted to authorize their union to call a strike against several major supermarket chains — including one owned by Cincinnati-based Kroger — as contract negotiations are set to resume this week.

About 47000 workers at hundreds of Ralphs Albertsons Vons and Pavilions voted starting last week and the results were announced Sunday.

The possible walkout would involve grocery clerks meat cutters pharmacists and pharmacy technicians represented by seven locals of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.

No strike was immediately set. The union said talks would resume Wednesday and if bargaining breaks down again it would decide what steps to take next.

Negotiations with Ralphs owned by Kroger and Albertsons owner of Albertsons Vons and Pavilions stores ended without agreement before the latest three-year contracts expired March 6.

The union said the next day that the companies’ wage proposal amounted to a 60-cent increase that was “shockingly low” and well below workers’ cost-of-living needs. Employees were asking for a $5-an-hour raise among other proposals.

“Both companies have refused to agree to expand safety committees in the stores and have yet to negotiate meaningful health and welfare benefits” a United Food and Commercial Workers statement said.

The union said that during the final day of negotiations it emphasized the essential role grocery workers played during the coronavirus pandemic.

The union said bargaining committee member Erlene Molina a Ralphs employee told company negotiators: “We saw how people were acting like the world was ending but we could not stay home. We knew that we had an obligation to our community so we showed up every day.”

The grocery chains didn't immediately comment Sunday on the strike authorization.

The Los Angeles Times reported that a Ralphs statement last Monday said the vote creates “unnecessary concern for our associates and communities at a time when we should be coming together in good faith bargaining to find solutions and compromise. At Ralphs we remain focused on settling a deal with the UFCW.”

Albertsons Companies said in a statement last week that the goal of the negotiation is “to provide our employees with a competitive total compensation package of wages health welfare and pension benefits.”

“We are committed to working collaboratively to ensure that we reach an agreement that is fair to our employees good for our customers and allows Albertsons Vons and Pavilions to remain competitive in the Southern California market” the statement said.

The union has not yet reached agreements with other supermarket chains including Gelson’s Stater Bros. Markets and Super A.

Employees of Ralphs Vons Pavilions and Albertsons in 2019 voted to authorize a strike but contracts ultimately were reached without a walkout.

A 2003-04 strike and lockout put nearly 70000 Southern California grocery workers on picket lines for more than four months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3Mta3JvZ2VyLWFkZC1uZXctc25hY2tzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Healthiest New Snacks At America's Largest Grocery Chain,"Are you looking for healthy snacks to keep on hand for those afternoon cravings?

""It is tricky to find good shelf-stable proteins that kids (or adults for that matter) will eat at room temperature for lunches after-school activities sports or snacks on the go"" says Gustashaw. ""While this product does have 200 mg of sodium per ounce of protein typical deli meat has about the same. They have a minimal amount of added sugar fat or other ingredients.""

Ellis agrees citing the 8 grams of protein just one gram of sugar and containing a small amount of iron and potassium. In addition Turkey Snack Mates for Kids is a great on-the-go snack.

Crackers are a basic snack food and one of the newest additions to Kroger's assortment has some raving reviews praising the taste. Ellis thinks these are a win with little saturated fat no added sugar 3 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber. These are made with a nut and seed blend with many spices for flavor. Simple Mills has a wide variety of other flavors to choose from like sun-dried tomato basil cheddar and cracked black pepper to name a few.

Another new snack from New Primal Ellis chose these for the 13 grams of protein low sugar and because it's great for anyone on a gluten-free diet. ""It's like a protein-rich chip"" says Ellis.

Gustashaw agrees ""Like these for the same reasons as the Snack Mates. 1 serving per package makes it easier to monitor intake and potentially feel more satisfied.""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Fruit Fast Unsweetened Dried Cherries

1/3 CUP : 130 calories 0 g total fat 0 mg cholesterol 5 mg sodium 30 g carbs (3 g fiber 19 g sugar) 2 g protein

Here's another nutritious one-ingredient snack debuting at Kroger. Fruit Fast Dried Cherries contain cherries and nothing else. Ellis notes the fiber content no added sugar and small amount of calcium and potassium for the reasons she chose this one.

Gustashaw chose this one too. ""Cherries are an amazing food loaded with nutrients. They are known to be high in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds are cardio protective and have even been shown to improve exercise recovery time. These have no added sugar and have 3 gm of fiber in just 1/3 of a cup"" she says.

Gustashaw recommends enjoying dried cherries alone or in a homemade trail mix baked goods or hot or cold cereals.

Siete Grain-Free Mexican Wedding Cookies

5 COOKIES : 150 calories 9 g total fat 0 mg cholesterol 105 mg sodium 17 g carbs (1 g fiber 8 g sugar) 1 g protein

Sometimes you need some good and tasty cookies and this new option at Kroger has a decent serving size. No need to wait for a wedding to munch on this snack.

""Alternative flours are becoming more popular but it is hard to sell someone on trying to adapt a recipe they have used for years so I often look for 'foods done right' using these new ingredients and suggest people try them first"" says Gustashaw.

She also cites the grain-free flours that can be excellent alternatives for food allergies or those who want more nutrient-dense foods. Plus there are no added sugars.

Newman's Own Organics Butter Popcorn

1/3 BAG : 130 calories 4.5 g total fat 0 mg cholesterol 250 mg sodium 21 g carbs (5 g fiber 0.5 g sugar) 3 g protein

Nothing goes better with movie night than a buttery popcorn. Gustashaw chose Newman's Own Organics Butter Popcorn noting the 5 grams of fiber 130 calories and 1 gram of sugar per serving.

Gustashaw recommends choosing this popcorn over chips. ""I often hear people say they avoid microwave popcorn because it lacks taste and just grab a bag of chips instead not realizing if they chose a popcorn with a bit more flavor they would not be scarifying health in relation to what they would have picked instead and still be gaining a ton of fiber"" she says.

BL Grocery founded by couple Ursula Martin 44 and Jerrell Spencer 45 is located at 1464 Valse Road in the Hamilton neighborhood. They aim to bring fresh produce and hot meals to the neighborhood.

""We wanted to provide access to food in a food desert"" Martin said. ""We're not at all saying that we won't provide traditionally what you will see in a corner store. We will but you will also be able to come in and buy an apple buy a bell pepper an onion one pound of ground beef. That kind of old-school grocery store feel is what our vision is.""

In February 2018 Kroger closed two of its locations in South Memphis. Martin noted the impact the grocer's absence has had on the community and hopes BL Grocery can help mend that gap.

""South Memphis lost their Kroger right before COVID and it was a big blow"" Martin said. It was a big blow because now you have people having to travel. If you live in South Memphis and you want to go to Kroger you can either go to Whitehaven or Midtown.""

Spencer who lives in the area was driving by the location of their store on the corner of Valse and Cincinnati and found that the Bunker Hill Grocery that was once there had been closed. A few months later they found the 1512-square-foot building up for sale through the Shelby County Land Bank and they won the auction to acquire the deed to the lot.

Having bought the building completely boarded up they hadn't seen the inside of the store. They had to pay for all the necessary renovations and rehabilitation out-of-pocket. The store is completely self-funded and independently owned. But this isn't the entrepreneurial pair's first experience with ownership: They own multiple plots of land throughout South Memphis including the development of a rental home.

""Ownership is important to both of us"" she said. ""We believe South Memphis is a next on the list for gentrification. And we didn't want to owe a soul for what we purchased in South Memphis. We've purchased from the [land] bank with the knowledge that once we buy it it's ours and know that nobody can ever take it from us.""

Spencer and Martin have deep connections to South Memphis. Spencer was born and raised there. While Martin grew up in Southern California her parents and grandparents are from South Memphis. Both grew up in the Riverside community.

""We live in the same community just blocks over but we live in South Memphis. We are South Memphis"" she said.

During the second day of a week of action in support of Trans people across the country #IStandWithDonCheadle trended on Twitter. To counter posts showing solidarity with “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling Twitter user @SisyphusRedemed tweeted a viral picture of actor Don Cheadle.

Three years ago actor Don Cheadle made headlines after wearing a Black shirt with white lettering that read “Protect Trans kids” while hosting “Saturday Night Live.” A simple yet powerful message the picture of Cheadle has surfaced from time to time.

According to the Trans Week of Visibility and Action site the week began on Friday March 25 and runs through Thursday March 31. The Trans Week of Visibility and Action allows people to support digital campaigns launched in seven states to build power and support trans young people.

On the second day of the week of action groups were calling attention to legislation introduced in Alabama that aims to make “lifesaving” healthcare for trans youth illegal. The bill has been condemned by various groups including the Human Rights Campaign calling it an “outrageous violation of privacy.”

Several advocates have pushed for more than just visibility given the attacks on Trans children and their parents in states like Texas. Efforts to prevent students from discussing sexual orientation or gender identity persist. The week of action will highlight organizing in Texas Alabama Florida Arizona Missouri Kansas and South Carolina.

During an Instagram Live on Saturday attorney Chase Strangio and writer and activist Raquel Willis were joined by actor Angelica Ross in conversation “about the systems of violence and discrimination our communities face and how we can mobilize and organize.”

Far beyond bathroom bans current efforts are attacking the rights and humanity of trans youth and children. The fixation on the most vulnerable members of our communities should raise broad outrage and concern.

In its second year the Trans Week of Visibility and Action Is also an opportunity for political education and raising awareness about “the more precarious material conditions for the most vulnerable members of our community.” The website includes a social media toolkit for those looking to support the week-long action and reading material for people looking to understand the issue better.

As reported by them the week of action kicked off with attention on anti-trans legislation in Texas and groups to support it.

“We don’t just want to be seen” Willis said in an interview with them. “We want to be heard and considered as well.”

The two companies will compete for each order of the $6.1 billion hybrid contract that will see the SINCGARS radios to align them with the National Security Agency crypto modernization requirements.

According to a US Army contract announcement the effort is expected to be completed by March 2032.

SINCGARS has been in service for over three decades and has provided US soldiers with a secure method for voice and data communication.

The service announced the radio modernization contraction after releasing a request for information in 2020 to evaluate new radio solution or upgrades to SINCGARS. The RFI noted that upgrades to SINCGARS would have to include new frequency hopping capabilities and cryptographic enhancements for secure communications.

SINCGARS is integrated in ground and aviation platforms and the new waveform will include frequency hopping capabilities for use in mounted vehicle radios and the portable manpack radio to securely transmit data within contested environments.

The SINCGARS upgrade is part of the service’s efforts to get all of the radios within a tactical network to be “as effective as smartphones.” This is one of the Army’s six modernization priorities along with long-range precision fires next generation combat vehicle future vertical lift air and missile defense and soldier lethality.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Nothing makes a young child smile like the sight of a cute cuddly baby animal they can pet. Even the hardest of hearts melt when they see lambs frolicking in the fields at this time of year or fluffy chicks following their mum.

Spring is the perfect time to get out and about to see lambs and other animals at farms and animal attractions. Luckily Somerset has a few to choose from.

From Bath to Ilminster here's our list of the places you can go to see nature at its very best.

Bath City Farm Bath

Visit this 37-acre city farm and you might see rare Dexter cows pigs sheep goats ponies rabbits chickens and ducks. At this time of year look out for the meet and greet weekend sessions with the lambs and chicks.

While there why not take the nature trail through the woods and fields to try and spot baby birds and insects. Entry to the farm at Bath is free but you can only feed the animals with specialist food sold on site. Open Tuesday to Saturday 10am - 4pm.

Animal Farm Adventure Park Burnham-on-Sea

Furry friends are the main attraction at this farm which also boasts a soft play centre amusement park rides and adventure castle as well as lambs llamas and snakes. Regular ‘cuddle club’ sessions give visitors a chance to pet the babies that might include a snake lizard or tarantula.

Court Farm Country Park Banwell

Bottle-feeding shows are a big hit at this 108-acre family-run working farm in Banwell near Weston-super-Mare. It has a flock of pedigree Texel sheep and lambing season runs right up to Easter.

You can also see a pedigree herd of Ruby Red Devon cattle piglets Shire horses and Shetland ponies. Open every day from 10am on March 31 to October 31 but closed on Mondays in the winter.

Ferne Animal Sanctuary Chard

""Ferne is a place that people come when they want peace and quiet"" says the website. ""Unlike many visitor attractions we cherish the opportunity to allow people to escape from the day-to-day noise and bustle and to enjoy the wonderful Somerset countryside.""

This 52-acre site at Chard is where around 300 animals have found sanctuary. You can expect to see everything from chickens to chinchillas and tortoises to horses.

If you can tear yourself away from the animals you can follow a nature trail with pretty ponds let the kids run wild in the children’s play areas or drop into the cafe for some tea and cake.

Puxton Park Hewish

It would be safer to say what four-legged friends does this farm not have than to ask for a list of animals. Daily activities allow visitors to meet the team and the wide range of animals in their care.

Rabbits guinea pigs tortoises parrots and Belgian hare are in the Animal Discovery Barn but there are also dairy cows sheep pigs goats donkeys alpacas ducks and geese. You might not want to meet the Madagascan Hissing Cockroach but it's worth going to see if you can bottle feed a lamb pet a baby chick or even see a calf being born in the maternity paddock.

Open every day from 10am till 4pm.

Wytch Wood Camping Ilminster

This farm has been in the family for decades but has only recently opened up its land for campers. With a flock of over 500 breeding ewes it would be surprising if you didn't see a lot of baby lambs during any stay this spring.

There are also a number of equestrian businesses operating from the yard so don't be surprised to see horses too. It's pretty pared back so don't expect a play park but it is authentic.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Water Club an upscale restaurant and event venue moored on 30th Street and the East River in Kips Bay is rolling the dice to become the Big Apple’s first casino with live gaming — but some locals aren’t all in.

“There should not be a casino there and I’m not even happy that the Water Club is there” Community Board 6 member Anton Mallner said at a meeting Thursday night. Others called the idea for a 24000 square foot casino with 450 feet of “open deep water pier” for more gaming space a “horrible” idea citing concerns of traffic and rowdy high rollers.

But board member Daniel Devine said casinos are the economic engine needed to compete with major cities like Hong Kong Madrid and Singapore.

“I would love for it to be in our district” he said. “We really have to think about the long term viability of the tax base in New York.”

“There already is a casino in New York and it’s on Rockaway Boulevard (Queens) so I encourage you to go and enjoy” cracked board member Sandra McKee.

New York currently has a moratorium on adding new casinos till the end of 2023 but Gov. Hochul wants to speed up the process and award three downstate licenses this year if it gets approved in the state budget.

In addition to the Water Club 30 groups including major players such as Hard Rock International Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts submitted requests for information to the state Gaming Commission last fall.

Though an avid gambler herself Diane Liotta said doesn’t want to place her bets on a casino near her home on 39th Street for fear of it attracting unseemly characters.

“I was playing the slots at the Borgata one time and someone just came up and snatched my purse right out of my lap” she told The Post.

“Rowdy people have never been allowed into any of my establishments in my career” Water Club owner Micahel “Buzzy” O’Keeffe said in a phone interview. “We set a tone that proper behavior is expected.”

The state has only four commercial casinos — with live table games like blackjack craps and roulette — not operated by Native American tribes and none are in the city. The Empire City Casino in Yonkers Resorts World Casino in Queens and Jake’s 58 on Long Island are considered “video lottery terminals” because they offer only slot machines electronic poker and off-track betting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvbWlhLWZhcnJvdy1nYXZlLWZyYW5rLXNpbmF0cmEtdG91Y2hpbmctZmluYWwtZ2lmdC1kaWVkLmh0bWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mia Farrow Gave Frank Sinatra a Touching Final Gift When He Died,"Mia Farrow and Frank Sinatra remained close even after their divorce. She placed meaningful items into his coffin at his funeral.

Mia Farrow and Frank Sinatra’s marriage was fleeting but the connection between them never faded away. Farrow and Sinatra remained close until his death in 1998 and she said that she considered him the love of her life. After his death Farrow slipped two items into his coffin as a final gift to her former husband.

Mia Farrow and Frank Sinatra were married for a brief time

When Sinatra and Farrow first met the singer felt an immediate connection to her.

“I was hers instantly” Sinatra said per the book Frank Sinatra: Behind the Legend by J. Randy Taraborrelli (via the New York Post). “I loved that hair man. I think the hair’s what got me.”

Farrow felt the same way albeit after a moment of embarrassment when she spilled the belongings of her purse on the floor.

“I thought the only thing I could do was to get out of there with any shred of dignity that might remain” she said. “And as I stood up to leave his eyes met mine and my heart stopped you know? Everything came together. I was just so alive in that moment.”

She left two items in his coffin with him

The couple married in 1966 but divorced by 1968. Still they remained close for years to come. Farrow told Vanity Fair that Sinatra was the “great love of [her] life.”

“She never stopped loving him” Sinatra’s biographer Darwin Porter told Express. “Sinatra was the love of her life. It was a love affair that continued even after their divorce and they remained close till the end. She told friends that she was still very much in love with him.”

When Sinatra died Farrow said that she and Sinatra’s daughter and first wife both named Nancy placed several items into his coffin with him including “a small bottle of Jack Daniel’s and a dime because he always told us never to go anywhere without a dime. ‘You never know who you’ll have to call.’”

Farrow also placed her wedding ring and a note for Sinatra in the coffin with him as a passing gift.

Frank Sinatra’s family have accepted Mia Farrow and her son into their ranks

Though the marriage was short-lived Farrow’s connection to the Sinatra family was not. Farrow’s son Ronan Farrow shared that Nancy Barbato Sinatra’s first wife doted on him and cooked for him as a grandmother would. He also visited Nancy Sinatra which as gossip columnist Liz Smith wrote gave “heft to the ongoing theory that Ronan is not the son from [Mia’s] relationship with Woody [Allen] but from her post-divorce romantics with the late Sinatra himself.”

Nancy Sinatra spoke about her relationship with the Farrows.

“He is a big part of us and we are blessed to have him in our lives” she said adding that she is also close with her father’s ex-wife. “From the early days until now we have been like sisters.

Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow divorced while she was filming ‘Rosemary’s Baby’

Sinatra and Farrow married in 1966 after a whirlwind romance that surprised many around them given their 30 year age gap. Though they loved each other they had differing opinions about Farrow’s career that eventually led to the end of their marriage. Sinatra wanted Farrow to quit acting or at least focus solely on movies that he was also in.

“Sinatra divorced Farrow because he demanded that she drop out of filming Rosemary’s Baby after three-quarters of the movie had been filmed to co-star with him in a forgettable movie The Detective” Sinatra’s biographer Darwin Porter told Express. “That was Sinatra being crazy he’d do things like that. Mia loved him but his demands were unreasonable. She couldn’t do it.”

He even served her with divorce papers on the set of Rosemary’s Baby.

She refused to take money from him

Farrow said that when Sinatra’s lawyers served her with divorce papers in 1968 it was the first time she’d heard anything about the possibility of ending her marriage. He reportedly offered her over $600000 which she refused.

“Frank’s lawyer entered the [Rosemary’s Baby] set carrying a brown envelope containing divorce papers” she said per the LA Times. “This was the first mention of divorce. I held myself together to sign on the spot all the papers without reading them. I didn’t accept one penny from Frank Sinatra. What I wanted was his respect and friendship.”

According to Farrow’s friend Maria Roach “Some wine glasses was all she got from Frank”

Though the relationship was legally over Farrow did hold on to Sinatra’s love. He offered to help her when she found out about Woody Allen’s affair with her daughter Soon-Yi Previn and the allegations of his abusive behavior toward her daughter Dylan.

“Frank wanted him f***ing clipped” Sinatra’s friend Len Triola told Allen’s biographer David Evanier per the Daily Mail. “Taken out. That’s what he wanted. Frank loved Mia. He spoke to three people every day [his wife Barbara his daughter Nancy and Farrow].”

She also said that their relationship never fully ended.

“He came back over and over and over and over” she told Vanity Fair. “I mean we never really split up.”

Mia Farrow considered Frank Sinatra the love of her life

Farrow and Sinatra’s ongoing friendship and romantic relationship stretched until his death in 1998. Though she would go on to marry again she considered him the great love of her life.

During the three-hour meeting of a Cape Cod Commission subcommittee comments ranged from staunch support to outright opposition.

Critics contend the developer Lennar Multifamily Communities has proposed a project that is too big too dense too challenging for a fragile environment and will create too much traffic in an already congested corridor.

Proponents say the project will bring needed housing to a region desperate for it and that it’s in an area that can be tied into water and sewer lines and is walkable to downtown.

The hearing was the first in a series of meetings the subcommittee will hold before sending it to the full commission for a vote. The session marked the first chance the public had to weigh in.

The apartment complex that LMC is proposing called Emblem Hyannis would be located at 35 Scudder Ave. on land now occupied by the Twin Brooks Golf Course.

'We've got to stem the bleeding':Addressing the Outer Cape’s housing crisis

LMC has proposed building 13 three-story residential buildings that would hold 312 units composed of studio one- two- and three-bedroom apartments. A clubhouse fitness center pool 493 parking spots and residential buildings would be surrounded by nearly 20 acres of conservation-restricted land on the 40-acre parcel.

Rents at the LMC project are expected to range from the mid-$1000s to the upper-$2000s according to the developer. The complex would also by law include 32 units of affordable housing.

Apartment project: Twin Brooks owner says other proposals are ""non-starters""

The project passes muster under the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act. A citizens' request for a fail-safe review was filed but determined to require no review by the state.

Developer Lenmar says Hyannis project has environmental protections

Representatives of LMC highlighted the conservation restriction on 20 acres a stormwater management plan designed for a 100-year storm flood plain restrictions a reduction in nitrogen loading and a reduction in irrigation demand because there will no longer be a golf course on the site.

The process:312-unit Hyannis apartment complex undergoing state environmental review

Ed Pesce a civil engineer with LMC said the developer wants to purchase a power agreement through a renewable energy provider in lieu of building solar arrays. Pesce also said the developer is committed to contributing a fair share to pay for upgrades to a nearby pumping station because it is getting close to capacity.

Alisa Magnotta CEO of the Housing Assistance Corporation was one of the first to voice her support. She called the project unique because of its size and its consideration of the environment. She said projects that have access to sewer infrastructure are walkable to main streets and involve the redevelopment of underused land are ideal.

“Leveraging land and dollars to help conserve land and house people is a win/win for Cape Cod” she said.

A complex issue: Planned Hyannis development stirs worry about housing wetland protection

But representatives of Save Twin Brooks an organization committed to preserving the land as open space and the Barnstable Land Trust found fault with the project plans.

Critics of Scudder Avenue project say developer's facts fall short

Hired by Save Twin Brooks Laura Krause a scientist at the BETA Group said conservation efforts lauded by the developer don't meet certain performance standards under the Wetlands Protection Act and the Barnstable wetlands protection bylaw.

Krause said that impacts to the wetlands have not been quantified in the application or the environmental notification form submitted to Massachusetts Environmental Protection Agency. She said that of 19 acres proposed for conservation restrictions eight acres contain water wetlands and streams and three additional acres are in a portion of the flood plain that would prohibit construction anyway.

Gary James a BETA Group engineer hired by Save Twin Brooks said developers had overstated the volume of nitrogen that would be reduced with the planned development. He called the developer's nitrogen-loading calculations into question.

Studies also understated traffic congestion around the rotary and in the immediate neighborhood said Brian Hughes vice president of Save Twin Brooks.

Explained:State's Chapter 40B law was designed to spur affordable housing growth. It didn't on Cape Cod

Janet Milkman executive director of the Barnstable Land Trust said it is possible to build housing and save open space at the same time but she objected to the size and scale of the Emblem Hyannis proposal. The Trust has proposed its own plan for housing on the property.

“We recognize the need for housing” she said. “Other sizes could work.”

But Magnotta says her nonprofit sees people every day who are looking for places to live. They are longtime Cape residents and renters full-time workers who have been crucial members of the communities in which they live.

“We’ve spent two years working with the Association to Preserve Cape Cod to find areas like this to build housing” she said.

Real Estate:Double-digit declines in home sales predicted for 2022. Low Cape inventory to blame

Hundreds of units are needed to address the housing crisis said former Barnstable Town Councilor Britt Beedenbender calling into the meeting. She said open space was not on the table because the parcel had been a golf course not an undeveloped parcel of land.

Cape Codders' challenge: Finding an affordable place to live

Year-round resident Christina Bologna agreed. The 38-year-old said she’s moved six times in six years and wants to live in the town.

“I don’t want to buy; it’s out of reach” she said.

Esin Sozer supports the project saying there were few options for her when she was looking to rent a place with a $3000 per month budget.

“You can’t live on the Cape” she said. “If you want your kids and grandkids living on the Cape support this project.”

Karolyn McClelland who calls herself an affordable housing advocate is also concerned about the environment. She urged the parties to come to the table to solve any problems.

“Why not control the ways we impact the environment?” she said.

She suggested maintaining golf courses organically have plantings consistent with the environment designating areas for pollinators and paying attention to the fertilizing and water requirements for individual yards. Conservation is a responsibility shared by all she said.

Many of the 37 people who spoke had also sent in letters to the subcommittee expanding on what they had to say in a three-minute comment period.

The center had just reopened following the first wave of COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns.

LITTLETON Colo. — O'Toole's Garden Center in Littleton a beloved family-run business for more than 30 years announced it will be closing Aug. 31 after selling its property to a developer.

Adele O'Toole whose late husband Jim founded the garden center said the decision was not an easy one.

“I did not go looking to sell"" said O'Toole who owns the center. “It was out of my hands.”

O'Toole said the sale was spurred by new development plans that would encroach on the vast majority of parking space used by the garden center located at West Belleview Avenue and South Federal Boulevard. Much of the parking is on land not owned by O'Toole.

If the development goes through O'Toole said the garden center would only be left with 30 parking spaces that it owns far less than it needs to maintain business.

""We know that in a weekend in May we’ll have 9000 customers"" O'Toole said. ""And with 30 parking spaces that’s not going to work”

Lennar Multifamily Communities a North Carolina-based developer that bought the O'Toole property had been eyeing the neighboring site at Columbine Square for its proposal to build 359 apartment homes along with new commercial spaces which it outlined to the City of Littleton in a letter of intent on Aug. 27 2021.

But O'Toole said she was not made aware of the current plans from Lennar until January. Still O'Toole said the writing had been on the wall for years.

Since the garden center fended off a previous developer who sought to buy it in 2012 O'Toole said a sale of the center was imminent.

“We knew we were on borrowed time"" O'Toole said.

O'Toole said she broke the news to the center's roughly 25 full-time employees Tuesday and said they will be financially compensated with a bonus severance.

With two other garden stores in Lakewood and Westminster O'Toole said there is potential for some staff to relocate to either store.

With three decades of history in Littleton O'Toole's has grown to be more than just a refuge for those with a green thumb. The center led by its manager Chris Ibsen has partnered with a host of charities and nonprofits to grow its community support.

“This was a place where people could gather where people could meet old friends friends you haven't seen in a while” Ibsen said. “There are families that shopped here with their kids many years ago and now a lot of their kids are bringing their kids to shop here”

Ibsen said he remembered the center's founder Jim O'Toole who died from cancer in 2006 as someone who treated him ""more like a partner than an employee.”

Adele O'Toole said shortly before Jim died he asked that the center continue to uphold its legacy of character.

“One of the last things he said to me was ‘take care of the managers and take care of the community’” O'Toole said. “To say goodbye to Littleton is not easy.""

O'Toole said the center will remain in operation in full force until its closure Aug. 31. And discussions are already underway to see if a new space can be secured to reopen the store though it may not be in Littleton.

“We’d like to find somewhere in Littleton in Englewood we’re very open"" O'Toole said. “It’s very sad to say goodbye to good friends. But we are looking forward to you know spring always coming. We’re extremely hopeful.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL2NvbW11bml0eWltcGFjdC5jb20vaG91c3Rvbi9rYXR5L2RldmVsb3BtZW50LzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvY3Jvc3MtY3JlZWstcmFuY2gtaW4tZnVsc2hlYXItYmVnaW5zLXRvLWZ1bGZpbGwtaXRzLWxhc3QtMzAwLWFjcmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cross Creek Ranch in Fulshear begins to fulfill its last 300 acres,"Cross Creek Ranch in Fulshear begins to fulfill its last 300 acres

In the short term the pipelines tanks and terminals could expand the use of liquefied natural gas and encourage more production in the U.S. drawing the ire of environmentalists who want to wean the world from fossil fuels. But under the vision outlined by the U.S. and the European Union the equipment could eventually be re-purposed to transport hydrogen.

They are putting on its biggest event ever at the Wells Fargo Center in April that will feature Lil Baby Lil Durk G-Herbo and Gunna. Read more

Jamir Shaw has ideas for headlines that could tell the story of Dope Shows the Philadelphia hip-hop concert company he founded with his partner Stephen Piner five years ago

“From West Philly to the Wells Fargo” Shaw suggests his eyes lighting up. “Or maybe From 52nd Street to Broad Street. That would be a good one too.”

That journey across the Schuylkill to the city’s largest indoor entertainment showplace in South Philly does neatly sum up where Dope Shows came from as well as where the duo — who have grown to become Philadelphia’s largest independent hip-hop promoters — are headed.

The pair — whose fifth anniversary Birthday Bash show is coming up on April 3 at the Wells Fargo Center — were raised within blocks of one another in West Philadelphia the former at 49th and Locust the latter at 52nd and Cedar.

Piner 40 and Shaw 34 didn’t know each other growing up but became fast friends upon meeting in 2015 when Piner was working in real estate and Shaw was putting on hip-hop DJ nights at clubs around town while holding down a position as dean of students at Mastery Charter School’s Harrity Elementary in West Philly.

“We built a friendship and then we ended up going into business together and started doing shows” says Piner. “We just had a vision. The city really wasn’t getting the kind of shows that we wanted.”

“We saw the void” Shaw says speaking of Dope Shows’ beginnings. “When we were trying to figure out what the business is going to be looking at Philly it wasn’t a lot of hip-hop and R&B.”

The duo decided “we wanted to be a global boutique-style concert company” says Shaw. They got started by booking New York rappers Fabolous and Jadakiss into the Fillmore in March 2017.

Five years later Shaw and Piner who have done shows in Boston Washington and Baltimore as well as Philly will put on their biggest Dope Show yet with the anniversary soiree at the Wells Fargo Center.

The Birthday Bash features four headliners sharing top billing starting with Lil Baby the Atlanta rapper who topped the bill at Jay-Z’s Made in America festival along with Justin Bieber last September.

He’ll be joined by Lil Durk the Chicago rapper who teamed with Lil Baby on the chart-topping The Voice of the Heroes and who headlined a date at the Mann Center last July that was Shaw and Piner’s first show back after the pandemic.

Lil Durk’s new album 7220 currently sits atop the Billboard album chart having unseated the soundtrack to the Disney movie Encanto.

The album features appearances by R&B star Summer Walker country singer Morgan Wallen and Gunna the Chicago rapper who along with fellow Windy City emcee G-Herbo is also among the Birthday Bash headliners

Those four marquee acts will be augmented by a pair of up-and-comers: Delaware vocalist 1Oak and Philly sibling duo Blud Bravaz who were winners of a Dope Shows talent showcase at the Foundry at the Fillmore in January.

Shaw and Piner have their eye on fresh talent. They’ll use the occasion of the Birthday Bash to announce that they’re forming a label called Dope Records.

“Philly is bubbling but there’s no industry here” says Piner. “We want to be that conduit to say ‘This is what’s hot in Philly.’ ”

Shaw threw his first party in his mother’s West Philly basement when he was 12. He charged a $1 cover and took in $70. “People from my neighborhood and people from other neighborhoods came” he remembers. “That was the attraction. Bringing people together.”

Breaking into the concert business required patience and hard work and lessons were learned along the way Shaw and Piner said. Shaw had built up extensive industry contacts and an email list of thousands of Philly hip-hop fans while throwing parties at local clubs that held as many as 1500 so “it wasn’t that big of a leap” to book a 2500-capacity room like the Fillmore he says.

It took months of unreturned phone calls before the Fabolous and Jadakiss show at the Fillmore. But once they sold the date out it led to booking the same bill in Boston and bringing Rick Ross to the Fillmore.

Dope Shows boasts of a 90% sell-out rate but not every show has been a success. A 2018 outdoor show in Baltimore turned into a washout. “Baltimore is a walk-up city they don’t buy tickets in advance” Shaw says. It rained “and they didn’t walk up.”

Piner says the duo have studied the career of Al Haymon the legendary Black music and boxing promoter who booked national tours for Janet Jackson and Boy II Men and consulted with Shawn Gee the Roots manager who heads up the Live Nation Urban concert division. Piner calls Geoff Gordon the regional president of Live Nation Northeast “a great mentor.”

“Our role as promoters is to help artists achieve their dreams” Gordon said. “I have tremendous respect for Jamir and Stephen for sharing that same vision and passion for their artists.”

Shaw and Piner also aim to focus their passion on the Black community in the city they grew up in with ticket giveaways at local schools and anti-violence messaging at all their events.

Last September at the Fillmore Dope Shows held their third annual Back 2 School Book Bag Extravaganza giving away backpacks filled with supplies to students. At last summer’s Lil Durk show at the Mann inspirational content was provided by Instagram influencer Wallo267 and Pastor Carl Day of North Philly’s Culture Changing Christians Worship Center

“I am very impressed with these guys” says Day. “I’ve watched party and show promoters make a ton of money off the backs of the urban Black people and literally have no sense of obligation or responsibility to the community. But when I see Jamir and Steph these guys have made financial contributions to our work they’re come down to our neighborhood and spent time with our youth on our basketball courts. They could just be making their money and running around with these entertainers and not care. But they’re trying to find ways to give back on so many different levels.”

Dope Shows hope to help “change the culture of violence” says Shaw who lost a cousin “murdered in the streets of Philadelphia” in 2019.

With the Dope Records label Piner says the duo aims to give exposure “to people who might not have the opportunity to get their music pushed out there and marketed. It might be artists from the city it might be artists from the suburbs.”

And the concerts the duo put on under their slogan “Ain’t No Shows Like Dope Shows” can have a positive impact Shaw hopes “by making people dance have fun get excited. Just removing the idea that you’ve got to be tough and have this persona that you’re from the streets. Just allowing kids to be kids.”

Earlier this week on Friday 25th March 2022 Elton John turned 75-years-old. The British singer has been in the music industry since 1967 when he was just 20-years-old. In his 50+ year career Elton has formed some close friendships with a number of music icons. Included in this roster of famous friends was none other than John Lennon of The Beatles. Elton and John worked together on a song in 1974 titled Whatever Gets You Thru the Night but John didn't completely believe in it. He even wagered Elton it would be a flop.

John told Elton that he didn't think Whatever Gets You Thru the Night would be a big hit. So to prove himself right he bet Elton that if it reached number one he would get on stage and perform it live with him. This was a big promise considering John had not performed in nearly ten years at that point. And surprise surprise Whatever Gets You Thru the Night went straight to number one in the USA. What's more this was the first time John had reached number one with a single outside of The Beatles. So he had to keep his promise to Elton.

Elton John and John Lennon were great friends

Elton was playing Madison Square Garden at the time. The Rocket Man had just released his eighth studio album Caribou and was working on a tour of the USA so he was well used to playing in front of thousands of people every night. But when John arrived at the venue on November 28 1974 to play their song (and a few others) he did not look so great. Elton remembered: ""I don’t think he’d played since the Peace Concert in Toronto [in 1969] to be honest with you and certainly not in New York I don’t think since The Beatles. He was terrified."" Eventually the nerves got the better of him and he was sick. READ MORE: Elton John raged over 'f***ing cheek' of Rod Stewart at music 'lecture

Elton recalled that John became so nervous he could not keep himself together. He said: ""I can tell you that he was physically sick before the show – absolutely physically sick."" Thankfully things turned around for him once the crowd realised they had a member of the Fab Four on stage. ""When he came on stage he was fine"" Elton said. ""Because [of] the reception that he got. I’ve never heard a noise a roar like it."" John's arrival on stage not only had an effect on the audience however but also the people behind the scenes as well. DON'T MISS...

A lot of us cried and there were tears running down our faces because here was one of the four people that were the biggest band ever."" John remembered the live show very differently however.

This weekend it was announced by The Foo Fighters that their drummer Hawkins died aged 50. The American musician was found ""unresponsive"" in his hotel room in Bogota Colombia where they were due to play a festival (Via Daily Mail). A toxicology report on the American musician showed traces of ""ten substances in his body"" including anti-depressants. The official cause of death remains unknown but the investigators did not reveal if the mix of drugs was a factor (Via BBC). The star had previously revealed he had struggled with drug use in the past and often thought he was going to ""live fast and die young"".

The Foo Fighters released a documentary Back and Forth in 2011 which showed some tense moments between the band throughout the years. Hawkins was asked in 2021 how he dealt with these tougher moments. He laughed: ""I used to do a lot of f****ng drugs."" Getting more serious he added: ""You get the work done. Foo Fighters live and breathe on stage. In the studio the albums are very much Dave [Grohl's] vision. A lot of the time he does demos and you listen close to it and try and get some of your own licks in there. For the most part we’re trying to get Dave’s vision down on tape or on a computer."" When pressed further on his own journey into drug use he was not shy about his journey.

Hawkins revealed that he took one instance of drug use ""too far"". After that incident he changed how he lived his life. Hawkins explained: ""Everyone has their own path and I took it too far. I was partying in London one night and I mistakenly did something and it changed everything."" He added: ""I believed the bulls**t myth of: 'Live hard and fast die young.'"" But he was quick to add: ""I’m not here to preach about not doing drugs because I loved doing drugs but I just got out of control for a while and it almost got me. I was heading down a road that was going to lead to even worse paths."" Hawkins then expressed gratitude for being able to get over his demons.

Hawkins said: ""Whether someone’s sober or they like a glass of wine with dinner or they want a bottle of Jägermeister before they go on stage or they like to smoke doobies all day long everyone has their own path and I took it too far. I’m glad it got knocked on the head at that point. I wouldn’t take anything away that I’ve done or been through either because it’s all part of the trip and the journey. I’m trying to be as candid as I can be."" In a hard gear change he added: ""I go mountain biking now."" He explained how mountain biking gives him ideas for songs and how it allowed him to problem solve and get into ""deep thinking"". He added: ""Sometimes I write songs in my head and then jump in my studio to put it down straight away. I like to go by myself. I like listening to old Aerosmith and Van Halen records to kind of pump me up. It’s my time and I love it. It’s a chance to clear your head out."" The desire to be on the road as a musician came when he was just a boy after seeing Freddie Mercury tear it up in Queen in 1982.

Hawkins saw the legendary British band at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on September 11 1982. ""After that concert I don’t think I slept for three days” Hawkins revealed. ""It changed everything and I was never the same because of it. It was the beginning of my obsession with rock and roll and I knew that I wanted to be in a huge rock band after seeing Queen. I was just starting to get into the drums and [Queen's drummer] Roger Taylor became my hero. I remember telling my mom that I’d play there one day."" (Via Kerrang) Hawkins' death was announced on The Foo Fighters' social media account overnight.

That meant making space for artists and musicians—including the likes of George Strait and Willie Nelson—in rapidly expanding cities like Austin through state-of-the-art music venues that house thousands of people and use advanced sound technology for an unforgettable experience. Finally the Live Music Capital of the World will have the entertainment arena it deserves when the Moody Center concert venue opens in Austin this April with all of those features and more.

On April 29 – 30 the King of Country Music George Strait with special guests Willie Nelson & Family and Randy Rogers Band will grace the new stage at the ‘Strait from Moody Center’ Grand Opening Celebration presented by Bud Light. According to the Moody Center announcement “This Texas-sized Celebration will offer a rare opportunity for fans to see icons George Strait and Willie Nelson share a stage for only the second time in their storied careers. In addition to being a part of the new 15000 – seat music venue debut the crowd will also be tipping their hat to Nelson who turns 89 years old the night of the show.” Tickets start at $49.50 for standard admission but you can purchase VIP packages like Amarillo By Morning or All My Exes for an elevated experience.

The Moody Center is not just any new concert venue: this larger-than-life $338 million entertainment arena is a University of Texas project backed by Minister of Culture himself Matthew McConaughey as well as Oak View Group Live Nation Entertainment/C3 Presents and Dell Technologies. The 530000-square-foot layout will double as a music venue and a sports arena for the university with over 15000 seats 44 premium and porch suites and 2000 club seats spaced out in four distinct areas of the upper level perfect for grabbing food and drinks and meeting fellow music and sports lovers. And yep that will make the Moody Center the largest music venue in Austin by a long shot.

Austin is getting a much-needed and long-deserving upgrade in its music scene with the addition of the Moody Center. Though we still hold dear our current prime music venues—we missed Emo’s—the thought of thousands of fans flocking to a state-of-the-art concert venue and sports arena in the heart of Austin gets us excited for a post-pandemic world.

The Moody Center concert venue has filled its calendar with legendary acts: John Mayor takes over the Moody Center on April 20 – 21 2022 followed by Bon Jovi Justin Bieber George Strait Willie Nelson & Family and Randy Rogers Band The Who iHeartCountry Festival Dave Matthews Band Eagles Jack White Machine Gun Kelly Jimmy Buffett Leon Bridges Kevin Hart The Lumineers Swedish House Mafia and so many more for a powerhouse of a spring lineup.

Jae C. Hong/AP

Elon Musk discussed how ""great"" Russian engines are following Russia's decision to stop US sales.

Boeing and Lockheed Martin's joint ULA venture uses the Russian-made RD-180 engine.

Musk suggested SpaceX wouldn't be impacted as it designs its own rocket engines.

Elon Musk recently addressed the quality of Russian engines amid Russia's decision to halt sales of rocket engines to the US.

In an interview with Mathias Döpfner the CEO of Insider's parent company Axel Springer which took place at Tesla's factory in Fremont California Musk said the Russian-made RD-180 engine is ""a great engine.""

He also acknowledged US aerospace companies including Boeing and Lockheed Martin's use of Russian engines.

ULA a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin relies on the RD-180 engine to power its Atlas V rocket per The Verge. The plan is for the engine of ULA's new Vulcan rocket to be produced by Blue Origin although delays have reportedly caused frustration.

Musk's comments come as Russia stopped supplying rocket engines to the US in retaliation for sweeping sanctions over the country's invasion of Ukraine.

""In a situation like this we can't supply the United States with our world's best rocket engines. Let them fly on something else their broomsticks I don't know what"" Dmitry Rogozin the head of the Russian space agency said previously.

""Is it dangerous for the United States of America?"" Döpfner asked Musk.

In response Musk said: ""Boeing and Lockheed have strongly relied on the Russian RD-180 Engine. Which I should say to be fair is a great engine.""

He added: ""They are hoping to move away from that in the future with engines from Blue Origin. There is also the Antares which uses the RD-180 I believe. They will not be able to fly as a result.""

Antares is a two-stage vehicle rocket manufactured by Northrop Grumman that provides low-earth orbit capability for payloads weighing up to 8000 kg. It is primarily used for NASA's commercial resupply missions as part of the company's contract with the space agency.

Musk's remarks echo a concern by record-breaking astronaut Peggy Whitson in a recent interview with Insider about international cooperation within the space industry.

Whitson discussed the use of Russian engines by the US saying it depends on Russian rocket engines more than she thinks it should.







""We do rely on Russian engines a bit more than I think we should more than is ideal"" Whitson said. ""I'd like to see us stimulating more rocket engine development in the US. I think that'd be good for us.""

In regards to whether SpaceX faced risk or opportunity from halted sales of Russian engines Musk said: ""At SpaceX we design and manufacture our own rocket engines. So we did not really own any Russian components at all.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYnVsZ2FyaWFubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvaXRhbHktd2lsbC1hc3NlbWJsZS0yNC1vZi10aGUtMzYtc3dpc3MtZi0zNS1saWdodG5pbmctaWktc3RlYWx0aC1maWdodGVycy_SAXNodHRwczovL2J1bGdhcmlhbm1pbGl0YXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzI2L2l0YWx5LXdpbGwtYXNzZW1ibGUtMjQtb2YtdGhlLTM2LXN3aXNzLWYtMzUtbGlnaHRuaW5nLWlpLXN0ZWFsdGgtZmlnaHRlcnMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Italy will assemble 24 of the 36 Swiss F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters,"ROME ($1=0.91 Euros) — The Swiss Federal Office for Defense Procurement [Armasuisse] announced on March 24 that Switzerland will have at least 24 of the 36 F-35A stealth fighters produced in Cameri [Italy] although Bern has not given up hope to assemble the aircraft at RUAG’s Swiss plants. The news was announced by the Italian online portal AnalisiDifesa.

Clarifications and talks are underway to determine whether it will be possible to finalize four other aircraft in Switzerland as part of a compensation project. The first eight will be manufactured in the United States using on-site initial training of Swiss pilots. The agreed price and delivery schedule remain unchanged so the aircraft will be delivered from 2027.

In recent weeks Armasuisse has praised the decision of the US government and Leonardo the Italian company active in the defense aerospace and security sectors to assemble most of the future Swiss Air Force F-35A fleet in Cameri. Italy. Armasuisse reached an agreement with the US government and found that up to 28 of the 36 aircraft would be manufactured in Italy by Leonardo. This means that at least 24 aircraft will be built in Italy.

However an inspection is underway with the manufacturer of the F-35A Lockheed Martin to see if the final installation work will be carried out in RUAG Switzerland as part of a compensation project [industrial cooperation]. Otherwise they will also be produced at Cameri. Lockheed Martin will build the first 8 aircraft at its manufacturing plant in Fort Worth Texas USA so that they can be used to train Swiss pilots who will be sent to the United States.

Why Cameri?

Cameri is a comune [municipality] in the Province of Novara in the Italian region Piedmont located about 90 kilometers northeast of Turin and about 6 kilometers northeast of Novara. Cameri is home to a military airfield Cameri Air Base [ICAO code: LIMN] now used for maintenance of the Panavia Tornado and Eurofighter Typhoon of the Aeronautica Militare as well as final assembly of Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.

The Cameri is home to one of two F-35 production lines outside the United States and the only one in Europe. Italy has been involved in the F-35 program from the very beginning. Both the Italian Air Force and the Italian Navy use F-35A and F-35B aircraft. Leonardo also produced the F-35A of the Dutch Air Force in Cameri.

As reported by Yonhap news agency the Defense Projects Promotion Committee approved a budget of about US$580 million for the acquisition of new military transport aircraft.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus’ A400M Brazilian Embraer’s C390 and U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin’s C130J are expected to compete for the project.

The aforementioned contenders could be required to make significant technology transfers to assist in the development of the future national transport aircraft proposed by KAI.

Korean transport aircraft

In mid-2021 Korean aerospace giant Korean Aircraft Industires (KAI) submitted a project to develop its own medium-weight twin-engine multi-role military transport plane.

The proposed design has a configuration similar to that of a KC-390 or An-178 but has the special feature that its wings incorporate hardpoints to accommodate different types of guided munitions.

According to the material made public KAI’s project should not only fulfill the tasks of a millitary transport but should also assume other roles such as tanker aircraft maritime exploration and anti-submarine warfare platform intelligence drone deployment and even long-range missile ground attack aircraft.

So far no new information has emerged about this project nor is it known if it has awakened serious interest from the Government.",,,

Robe Lowe's on-stage musical performance with Snow White in 1989 was part of what has become known as one of the biggest fails in the Academy Awards' history.

The opening number saw a young Lowe perform a parody version of 'Proud Mary' alongside actress Eileen Bowman dressed as the Disney princess. (Watch a snippet in the video above.)

Rob Lowe's 1989 Oscars performance ended in disaster (Academy Awards)

Producer Allan Carr is credited with the now-infamous musical number. His reputation was permanently damaged and he never worked as a Hollywood producer again after it aired.

The performance drew swift backlash especially from production giant Disney which realised the Oscars hadn't licensed Snow White and subsequently sued for copyright infringement and dilution of business reputation.

A group of Hollywood icons including Gregory Peck Paul Newman and Julie Andrews also decried the performance in an open letter saying it had been ""an embarrassment to both the Academy and the entire motion picture industry.""

IN PICTURES: The most groundbreaking Oscars looks of all time

Three decades on Lowe has managed to live the debacle down and has seen the humour in the performance.

In an interview with The New York Times the actor looked back on the disaster saying that he knew things were going south when he looked at acclaimed director Barry Levinson in the crowd.

""I could see him very clearly pop-eyed and mouthing 'What the [expletive]?'"" Lowe recalled. ""But to be a successful actor you have to have a big dollop of self-denial so I managed to convince myself that I'd killed it.""

While Lowe has been able to humorously reminisce on the experience Bowman wasn't so lucky. Following the incident she was forced to sign a gagging order about her experience and essentially vanished — with her very new acting career never taking off.

With racing in the MOTUL FIM Superbike World Championship getting underway in just a couple of weeks all five manufacturers gathered at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya for the penultimate test before the season begins. Each factory had new items on display throughout the test from the back of the bike to the front as they go in search of their ultimate performance.

YAMAHA: new exhausts and material under the seat

A new exhaust featured on the Yamaha YZF-R1 machines at the Pata Yamaha with Brixx WorldSBK squad as the Japanese manufacturer aim to retain the three titles they won in 2021. The angle of the exhaust is steeper while the spring is now situated under the bike to help improve top speed. Another new component on the Yamaha is the material under the seat. While it had previously been a mix of carbon and aluminium the 2022 version is all carbon. Yamaha have also been looking at making steps with their electronics package in 2022 with the Catalunya test including more testing of this to refine it ahead of racing while three accelerometers were fitted to the bike for additional data. Yamaha have been trying a short and long swingarm throughout the test as part of their development.

KAWASAKI: fins for Rea forks for Lowes

Kawasaki Racing Team WorldSBK duo Jonathan Rea and Alex Lowes continued their off-season testing programme with more new components during the test. Six-time Champion Rea tried the fins on the fuel tank that teammate Lowes has used although he wasn’t a fan of them. Rea also tried some small components including with the clutch while teammate Lowes had a similar programme. On his ZX-10RR was a slightly different front fork as he goes in search of mechanical grip.

HONDA: new exhaust and a double brake duct

Team HRC spent a bit of time looking at cooling their brakes in the hotter conditions for the summer. Iker Lecuona and Xavi Vierge on day one had a double brake duct design to assist cooling on a hard-braking circuit; with the same venue hosting the Catalunya Round in September. The team also tried out a slightly modified exhaust system on their CBR1000RR-R looking for ultimate performance ahead of the season starting. The team have gone under something a revolution over the winter with all-rookie line-up Iker Lecuona and Xavi Vierge switching to Nissin brakes from Brembo and to Showa suspension from Öhlins.

BMW: new brake callipers and working on the electronics

At German manufacturer BMW the team were able to try out new brake callipers from suppliers Nissin looking for their best setup for the 2022 season. Eugene Laverty (Bonovo Action BMW) also revealed that he had worked on some traction control strategies on day one of the test with BMW constantly evolving their in-house electronics system.

DUCATI: refining the new swingarm items inside the front fork

At previous tests the Aruba.it Racing – Ducati squad have used a new swingarm on their Ducati Panigale V4 R. In Barcelona a new variant of the swingarm was seen after Alvaro Bautista opted to work with the new design. The swingarms have different rigidity impacting on the bike. Bautista was also trying new items inside the front fork as he looks to get back to winning ways for the first time since 2019. At Independent Ducati outfit Team GoEleven a new exhaust supplier came in over the winter with Spark now their supplier. Throughout testing the team have been trialling Spark’s exhaust and continued this in Barcelona.

Lowe will be returning to the ISSA/GraceKennedy Boys and Girls’ Championships (Champs) this year making her Class One debut in the long jump. While she is focused on getting on the podium Lowe says that she just wants to get back into action after she contracted COVID-19 last year and was forced to end her season early..

“Catching COVID was really disappointing because I had to quarantine for two weeks and those two weeks were very close to Champs” Lowe told The Gleaner. “Coming back I’m really glad. I wanted to give up but my coaches and my teammates have been pushing me and telling me that ‘you can do it you just have to give yourself time’ but I’m not really a patient person. But I’m really glad to be able to come back to training and to come this far.”

What is also important for her is being recognised on her own merit outside of her father former national player Onandi and her brother current national defender Damion. While proud of her family’s sporting line she says it is important for her to make her own mark her way.

‘I AM ONANDA’

“I would definitely like to build my own name. It’s not a bad thing but I am tired of people saying Onandi Lowe’s daughter. No I am Onanda. So I definitely want to build my own name so that people can say ‘Oh this is Onanda’. They don’t have to start off with ‘this is Onandi Lowe’s daughter’.” Lowe said. “That is one of the main reasons why I haven’t stopped track and field. The training is hard but I am always here and I love it.”

Lowe finished second at the Corporate Champs earlier this month and has been relying on the counsel of coach Franz Forde in getting ready to compete at a higher level. With only one more year left of eligibility Lowe says she is determined to make her final years at school count.

“Mostly he (Forde) has been telling me to trust the process trust my training go out there and have fun. So transitioning into Class One being one of the elder girls going into Champs is kind of sad because I will soon be leaving high school. So these two years are very important and I have to make the best of it” Lowe said. “So I am really glad to be back just to get a feel of what it feels like because I really missed it.”

Parks Foundation $14.5 million to protect local ecosystems.

The donation from Age of Union Alliance led by Lightspeed Commerce founder Dax Dasilva is the largest single donation in the history of the foundation which aims to enhance and expand the province's parks system.

Part of the money will go toward buying land in Vancouver Island's French Creek Estuary a critical eagle habitat.

""It's a migratory stopping point as the eagles migrate and of course there are resident eagles and it's surrounded by subdivisions"" Dasilva said.

""If we didn't protect it I think we would be really endangering the future generations of eagles.""

Money will also go to the Pitt River Watershed in Metro Vancouver and other projects.

Dasilva 45 was born and raised in B.C. and made his fortune with Lightspeed a payment processing company. He says he wants to use some of that wealth to buy land in B.C and keep it from being developed.

""There's a specialness to what we have here that can't be replicated and I think that we never want to ever be at the point where we feel like oh wow we let it slip through our fingers and we let it be lost"" he said.

Dasilva also says he hopes his gift will inspire other successful business leaders to make donations.

Last year a donation from the family foundation of Lululemon Athletica founder Chip Wilson and his wife Shannon allowed the foundation to purchase threatened Coastal Douglas fir ecosystems in the Strait of Georgia.

Christie Stephenson executive director of the Peter P. Dhillon Centre for Business Ethics at the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business said large donations can inspire others to share their wealth.

""I think it's really positive when you do see someone stepping forward and making a really meaningful contribution and then others take note and feel excited about contributing themselves or seeing that maybe they have an obligation to contribute as well.""

B.C. Parks CEO Andy Day says the foundation has received donations — both big and small — from British Columbians looking to preserve the region's biodiversity.

""We have this kind of global responsibility to protect and uphold our natural legacy"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Officers booked Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati Saturday afternoon for allegedly firing a gun out of a moving vehicle in Kaneohe.

Officials say no one was hurt.

Police say Perkins-Sinapati is the same man who was driving a sedan being chased by HPD in Makaha in 2021.

That pursuit led to a crash leaving the 38-year-old in a coma for weeks.

A civil lawsuit from Sinapati blamed HPD for the wreck that also injured five others.

In February - Honolulu’s city council approved the settlement.

The criminal trial for the four HPD officers accused in the case is scheduled to start in June.

All have pleaded not guilty and are on restricted duty.

Perkins Sinapati has not yet been charged for the latest gun offenses.

After missing the past two-plus seasons with a knee injury Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball has exercised the $21.4 million option on his contract for the 2024-25 season sources told ESPN on Saturday.

Ball has undergone three surgeries on his left knee the most recent a cartilage transplant in 2023. There remains some guarded hope that he could return next season but there are no assurances that the damaged knee will allow for him to play again.

Ball 26 signed an original four-year $80 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade with New Orleans in the summer of 2021. After a fantastic start that had the Bulls leading the Eastern Conference in 2021-22 Ball averaged 13.0 points 5.4 rebounds 5.1 assists and 1.8 steals before a knee injury 35 games into the season.

Ron DeSantis barred the sale of lab-grown meat in the Sunshine State.

DeSantis signed the legislation called SB 1084 into effect on May 1 casting it as a bid to stop the World Economic Forum’s goal of forcing the world to eat lab-grown meat and insects “an overlooked source of protein” according to a news release.

Rather “Florida is increasing meat production and encouraging residents to continue to consume and enjoy 100% real Florida beef” the governor’s office added.

DeSantis previously has blasted “the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.”

4 Jeff Bezos and his fiancée Lauren Sanchez moved to Florida mere months before announcing a $60 million investment into lab-grown meats via the Amazon founder’s Bezos Earth Fund. Bezos Earth Fund

The move comes about a month after the Bezos Earth Fund chaired by the Amazon founder and Sanchez announced a hefty investment into sustainable protein including plant-based fermented and cultivated meats — part of the organization’s larger $1 billion commitment to expanding food production Fortune earlier reported.

“We need to feed 10 billion people with healthy sustainable food throughout this century while protecting our planet. We can do it and it will require a ton of innovation” Sanchez wrote in a statement announcing the $60 million investment.

Lab-grown meats differ from its slaughter-free counterparts like Impossible Foods in that they are grown from real animal cells that are replicated scientifically eliminating the need to farm animals.

Impossible burgers and other vegan proteins such as Beyond Meat meanwhile are made using alternative protein sources like tempeh tofu seitan and beans among other products.

According to science magazine Scientific American the US Department of Agriculture granted its first-ever approval of cell-cultured meat produced by two companies GOOD Meat and UPSIDE Foods last June — less than a year after the Food and Drug Administration declared the companies’ products safe to eat.

Florida for reference ranks 13th in the US in overall cattle numbers with a total herd size of 886000 among 15000 beef producers with total sales of $546 million according to Fortune citing the Florida Beef Council.

Before garnering US approval GOOD Meat had already been selling its cultivated chicken in Singapore. It made its debut in America in a dish curated by well-known chef José Andrés at his Washington DC restaurant China Chilcano.

The nonprofit Good Food Institute reports that the cultivated meat industry has grown to include more than 150 companies backed by $2.6 billion in investments Fortune cited — with Bezos among those funding the sector.

Bezos and DeSantis’s clashing opinions on the lab-grown meat industry are coming to light shortly after the 60-year-old tech billionaire moved from Seattle near Amazon’s headquarters to Miami closer to his space exploration firm Blue Origin’s home base.

In October 2023 it was revealed that Bezos had purchased two mansions on Florida’s exclusive “Billionaire Bunker” the man-made island formally known as Indian Creek Island.

Last month he added a third multimillion-dollar estate to his sprawling Miami portfolio in an off-market transaction reportedly worth $90 million.

Sources privy to the matter revealed to The Post that Bezos intends to take up residence in this new acquisition while orchestrating the demolition of his two previous island properties — which includes a $79 million abode and its neighboring $68 million property.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tdXNpYy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzA1L2ZyZWUtbWFkb25uYS1jb25jZXJ0LWRyYXdzLWNyb3dkLW9mLTE2bS10by1icmF6aWxzLWNvcGFjYWJhbmEtYmVhY2jSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbXVzaWMvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8wNS9mcmVlLW1hZG9ubmEtY29uY2VydC1kcmF3cy1jcm93ZC1vZi0xNm0tdG8tYnJhemlscy1jb3BhY2FiYW5hLWJlYWNo?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Free Madonna concert draws crowd of 1.6m to Brazil’s Copacabana beach,"With the world-famous statue towering over it from Corcovado mountain Rio de Janeiro is well used to Christ the Redeemer. For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

Pipelines are the primary method of transporting crude oil around the world delivering oil and its derivative products swiftly to refineries and empowering reliant businesses.

And North America is a major oil hub. The U.S. and Canada alone are home to more than 90000 miles of crude oil and petroleum product pipelines along with more than 140 refineries that can process around 20 million barrels of oil every day.

This interactive graphic uses data from Rextag to map out crude oil pipelines and refineries across the U.S. and Canada showcasing individual pipeline diameter and daily refinery throughput.

The Longest Crude Oil Pipeline Networks in North America

Since 2010 U.S. crude oil production has more than doubled from 5.4 million barrels a day to more than 11.5 million. Meanwhile the pipeline networks needed to transport this newly produced oil have only expanded by roughly 56%.

Today the largest pipeline network across the U.S. and Canada (with a diameter of at least 10 inches) is the 14919 mile network managed by Plains which spans from the northwestern tip of Alberta all the way down to the southern coasts of Texas and Louisiana.

Enbridge owns the next largest crude oil pipeline network with 12974 miles of crude oil pipelines that are at least 10 inches in diameter. The Canadian company one of the world’s largest oil companies transports about 30% of the crude oil produced in North America.

Following the networks of Plains and Enbridge there’s a steep drop off in the length of pipeline networks with Sunoco’s crude oil pipeline network spanning about half the length of Enbridge’s at 6409 miles.

The Largest Crude Oil Refineries in North America

These various sprawling pipeline networks initially carry crude oil to refineries where it is processed into gasoline diesel fuel and other petroleum products.

The refineries with the largest throughput in North America are all located in the Gulf Coast (PADD 3) with the five refineries that process more than 500000 barrels per day all located in the states of Louisiana and Texas.

While Texas and Louisiana have six refineries that process more than 400000 barrels per day there are only two other facilities outside of these states with the same kind of throughput located in Whiting Indiana (435000 barrels per day) and Fort McMurray Alberta (465000 barrels per day).

Fort McMurray’s facility is an upgrader which differs from refineries as it upgrades heavy oils like bitumen into lighter synthetic crude oil which flows through pipelines more easily. Many oil refineries aren’t able to directly convert bitumen which is extracted from oil sands like those found in Alberta making upgraders a necessary part in the production and processing of crude oil from oil sands.

The Uncertain Future of New Pipelines in North America

The development of new pipelines remains a contentious issue in Canada and the U.S. with the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline emblematic of growing anti-pipeline sentiment. In 2021 only 14 petroleum liquids pipeline projects were completed in the U.S. which was the lowest amount of new pipelines and expansions since 2013.

But domestic energy production is once again in the spotlight due to the U.S. ban on Russian oil imports and Russia’s impending export ban on raw materials. North American consumers are now facing surging gasoline and energy prices as foreign oil is proving to be far less reliable in times of geopolitical turmoil.

It’s important to note that pipelines are not a perfect solution as leaks and spills in just the last decade have resulted in billions of dollars of damages. From 2010 to 2020 the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration recorded 983 incidents that resulted in 149000 spilled and unrecovered barrels of oil five fatalities 27 injuries and more than $2.5B in damages.

But over the past five years liquid pipeline incidents have fallen by 21% while pipeline mileage and barrels delivered have increased by more than 27%. Along with these infrastructure improvements pipeline developers and operators emphasize the lack of better alternatives as freight and seaborne transportation are both far less efficient and result in more carbon emissions.

Currently pipelines remain key components of energy consumption across the U.S. and Canada and as global energy markets face supply squeezes international sanctions and geopolitical turbulence the focus on them has grown.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9vc2NhcnMtMjAyMi1iZXN0LWRyZXNzZWQtY2VsZWJyaXR5LTIyNTE0MDYyNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oscars 2022: The best-dressed celebrity couples,"After two years of let’s face it rather sub-par red carpets the 2022 awards season has brought red carpet fashion back with a vengeance.

Former Open Door School is considered as location



A proposed location for a new Lawrence County Jail drew criticism from some neighborhood residents at Tuesday’s meeting of the county commission.

Last year Gov. Mike DeWine’s office announced that $16.8 million in state funds had been allotted to the county for building a new jail a long-sought goal from local officials.

The county commission has voted to place a half percent sales tax on the May primary ballot to make up the difference in the $32 million cost of building and operating a new jail.

The commissioners have selected the site of the former Lombard Elementary School and Open Door School at 421 Lorain St. in Ironton as the site for the project.

At Tuesday’s meeting of commission Mary Williams a lifetime Ironton resident who lives on South Fifth Street in the area voiced her objection to the site.

Williams said she was “speaking on behalf of myself and the neighborhood” when she said a new jail was supported but that they opposed the site in “the middle of a neighborhood.”

Williams proposed two alternative sites — South Third Street between Vine and Ashtabula streets and across from the Ohio Department of Transportation garage on Commerce Drive both in Ironton.

“And I feel certain that the three of you know of others available” Williams said to the commissioners.

Williams said that if the Lombard/Open Door site was not removed from consideration shortly she and neighbors would “launch a campaign vehemently against the sales tax.”

Williams said she was not seeking to debate the matter and understood the commission had chosen the site as they already owned the property.

“It makes sense because of the investment” she said. “But it doesn’t make sense to place it into a neighborhood. We ask for your consideration.”

Commission president DeAnna Holliday thanked Williams for making an appointment to speak and voicing her concerns in the “appropriate way to commissioners.”

She said Williams correctly understood the commissioners’ “thought process” regarding the former school site and it already being owned by the county.

“Your county commissioners worked tirelessly on a grant application that we submitted last year to the state” Holliday said adding that they “firmly believe” the county received the funds because the project was “shovel ready.”

Holliday noted that the majority of counties in the state had applied for the $50 million in available funds and that Lawrence County had been allotted the highest amount.

“We were the most successful” she said.

Holliday said there would likely be some opposition no matter where in the county a site was chosen.

“We’re not opposed to looking at another site” she said noting they had considered the option Williams mentioned and there were issues with those and other sites including restrictive covenance on deeds.

“The hard part of the job is representing you as well as all of the county” Commissioner Colton Copley said said noting that the county would continue looking at other options.

“We will continue to work toward finding a solution that works for everyone” he said. “But we are still charged with protecting the county as a whole as well.”

But Copley said the property chosen is the one the county has to continue working with for now.

“And we don’t want to give you false hope on other options” he said.

Holliday also stressed that the proposed sales tax is not a property tax.

“It is a tax on goods” she said. “It does not tax groceries or gas. It was the least invasive way to ask the citizens of Lawrence County to fund a new jail and its operation.”

Commissioner Freddie Hayes Jr. said he appreciated that Williams saw the need for a new jail for the county.

“I’m like the other two” he said of his fellow commissioners. “If we can find another place we would do it. But it’s really hard with restrictions that are placed on property. We will continue to look but give us a little time. I think we can come to a resolution.”

Williams responded by asking “So what you are saying without coming out and saying it is that you will not remove it as a possible site?”

Copley said that “without a viable second option” it would “put damage on the entire county to take away the grant.”

Holliday said it was “premature for us to say anything today.”

“But we will continue to have this conversation” she pledged.

The sale reportedly will be completed by May 18.

Speculation was that all employees would be laid off and have to re-interview for jobs with the current general manager and executive chef leaving the Inn.

No further details about the sale or future plans were immediately available.

Located at 5951 Linea Del Cielo at the culmination of downtown Rancho Santa Fe’s Paseo Delicias business corridor the building dates to the beginnings of the community where it was the first structure built and served as the real estate office for the burgeoning town.

Marriott’s Tribute Portfolio Resort & Spa division operates the four-star 21-acre property constructed in Spanish-California architectural style. One- and two-bedroom suites and cottages generally cost around $300 nightly with some cottages rented on a long-term basis.

“The Inn began as ‘Morada’ in 1923 with just a few guest rooms and grew cottage-by-cottage over nearly 100 years” according to Marriott promotional literature. “Today our historic hotel boasts 80 guest rooms including six suites and one 2-bedroom cottage spread over 17 cottages.”

The Inn also features Morada restaurant — the original Lilian Rice designed building was referred to as La Morada a Spanish word roughly translated as “meetinghouse.”

“Helmed by Executive Chef Jessie Lee Williams Jr.” Marriott said “this San Diego north county restaurant boasts a fiercely seasonal menu of creative coastal ranch cuisine paired with a handpicked wine list craft cocktails local San Diego beers and the laidback elegance of California ranch lifestyle.”

Special events and weddings are a popular feature at the Inn that serves as a kind of upscale community focal point. Cable TV’s reality show “Married at First Sight” even taped parts of several episodes at the resort last month.

Originally built by the Santa Fe Land Improvement Co. — the developers of Rancho Santa Fe — as a guesthouse for clients the inn was named La Morada when it first opened in 1923.

The name later changed to the Inn at Rancho Santa Fe in the early 1940s when it was acquired by its third owner. The hotel was sold in 1958 when Stephen Royce who had been a pitcher for the New York Giants for just one year purchased it. The Royce family put the property on the real estate market in late 2011.

JMI Realty the real estate investment firm of San Diego Padres owner John Moores and his partner Ranch Santa Fe resident John Kratzer purchased the property for $28 million in April 2012 according to county property records. JMI spent $12 million renovating more than half of The Inn’s 107 guest rooms and the historic hotel spa according to sources at the time. This also included included a complete renovation of the restaurant main lobby entrance area and pool deck and addition of a day spa.

The Inn became part of the Tribute Portfolio brand of Marriott International in May 2017 the third California hotel in the Tribute Portfolio. The Inn General Manager Jerome Strack said at the time “The Inn is thrilled to join the Tribute Portfolio and sees ‘tremendous value’ in the opportunity to introduce Rancho Santa Fe to Marriott International’s guests without compromising the history of the hotel.”

The Inn also owned a total of 35 buildings in the Rancho Santa Fe village collectively known as The Residences at The Inn.

It is Marriott International which has signed an agreement to open its first safari lodge in the Maasai Mara.

Under its most prestigious brand ""JW Marriott"" the Masai Mara Lodge in Kenya is expected to open in 2023 and will be Marriott's first luxury safari property in Africa.

The U.S. hotel brand in a statement announced that the new property to open next year in the Maasai Mara National Reserve will mark its entry into the safari segment in Africa.

""This landmark project is in response to travelers' growing desire for experiential offerings that allow them to build a deeper connection with their chosen destination"" said Marriott International's director of projects for Europe Asia and Africa Jerome Briet.

The lodge will overlook the famous banks of the Talek River and the edge of the reserve. The property will join other luxury brands in the reserve including British billionaire Richard Branson's Mahali Mzuri Keekorok Lodge owned by Sun Africa Hotels Olare Mara Kempinski and Ol Seki Hemingways Mara Camp among others.

""JW Marriott Masai Mara Lodge's prime location will offer guests a distinctly elevated camp from which to discover the Masai Mara National Reserve its breathtaking views abundant wildlife and endless plains"" the company announced in a statement.

And some may solicit the human-resources consulting firm Mercer.

Consultants at Mercer advise companies on workplace-related challenges such as how to support employee health and well-being making investments and retirement plans workforce strategies and mergers and acquisitions.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""We really need problem solvers. We need people that can collaborate. We need people that can innovate"" said Mark Ashton the global talent acquisition leader of Mercer's parent company Marsh McLennan.

The firm has just under 1250 open roles in consulting and other services across various levels and in locations around the globe such as in the UK and Mexico Ashton said.

Consulting firms are seeing an explosion of demand for their services Namaan Mian the chief operating officer at Management Consulted previously told Insider. Although some boutique firms such as Mercer are seeing competition with the rise of in-house strategy groups at large corporations consulting firms are continuing to hire more candidates.

Interviewers want to see candidates who understand that Mercer is there ""to partner with the company that we're supporting we're there to problem solve but at the same time we're there to deliver on a solution"" Ashton said.

Ashton shared his insight into Mercer's interview process and what the firm looks for in early-career candidates.

Show off your problem-solving skills

The first step after a candidate applies to Mercer is a résumé-screening process that reviews a candidate's skills against a set of behavioral competencies including communication and interpersonal skills.

Candidates then go through a video interview with a recruiter where they have to demonstrate their behavioral skills and business acumen through a set of interview questions.

Candidates are then invited to an assessment which Ashton said the firm now holds in person at Mercer offices. The assessment is a set of group-led discussions with multiple candidates.

""We're really not asking our candidates to prep in advance"" Ashton said. ""What we're really trying to get is that the interview experience for them feels relaxed so they can bring their true self to that interview as much as possible.""

In the assessment Ashton said interviewers ask candidates to give examples of where they've been involved in teamwork. They want to make sure candidates are comfortable with gaining knowledge from a broader network of peers.

Among early-career candidates interviewers want to know more about their academic journey internships the projects they worked on and how they manage timelines.

""What we're hoping is that the candidates we're attracting have gone through that type of process within their degree programs and that they'll bring examples and are able to articulate how they solve problems"" Ashton said.

The assessment is for Mercer to make sure it's fitting a candidate in the right role with the right focus.

""The journey for us is really looking at the acumen and the excitement that somebody will have"" Ashton said. ""We very much hire for the attitude then we'll be training for the skill.""

In the interview stage interviewers are focused on finding candidates who have the excitement for the work Mercer's doing and who are passionate about Mercer's clients Ashton said.

Show how you can add value to the firm

Ideal candidates come to their interview prepared with a vision of where they think they can add to the value of Mercer's business Ashton said.

""We're a people business so if the person can come and really talk to us the way they would talk to a client selling themselves in the same way they sell a service it's exciting to us"" he said.

Interviewers also like candidates who ask questions about Mercer's work and how the firm hopes to innovate the world of work within the next decade Ashton said because it shows that the candidate understands the business and can join the firm's journey.

Through talking about previous academic experiences and internships interviewers can understand how a candidate can build further knowledge and excitement for Mercer's business.

Ashton said that what Mercer really looks at is helping candidates experience what it means to have an amazing career. He added ""We'll guide you through that.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition you'll automatically receive a 10% points rebate on all awards booked out of the primary cardholder's TrueBlue account. There's no limit to the number of points you get back and this even holds true when the cardholder is the head of a family pool — which is a key way TPG's Nick Ewen makes the most of his JetBlue Plus card every year.

Then you get a $100 statement credit every year with your purchase of a JetBlue Vacations package of $100 or more with your card. You also receive 50% off inflight purchases including alcoholic drinks and snack boxes and you'll pay no foreign transaction fees outside the U.S. Other notable perks include:

Sign-up bonus: Earn 45000 bonus points enough for up to four free nights at participating properties after spending $1000 on purchases in the first 90 days. That's worth $495 based on TPG's valuations.

Earning rate: Earn 6 points per dollar on eligible hotels by Wyndham purchases and gas station purchases 4 points per dollar on dining and grocery store purchases (excluding Target and Walmart) 4 points per dollar on eligible purchases made at Wyndham Timeshare properties (including maintenance fees and loan payments) and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.

Benefits: Wyndham Rewards Platinum status is an automatic perk on the card which includes all the same perks of Gold status plus early check-in car rental upgrades with Avis and Budget and a Caesars Rewards status match. Cardholders receive 7500 bonus points each anniversary year with no spending requirement.

If you routinely stay at Wyndham hotel brands such as Wyndham Hawthorn Suites Days Inn and La Quinta the Wyndham Rewards Earner Plus Card may be a valuable addition to your stays. The automatic Platinum status alone can be valuable and the 7500 points on your anniversary can more than offset the $75 annual fee.

Miles & More World Elite Mastercard

Sign-up bonus: Earn 50000 award miles after spending $3000 in purchases within the first 90 days and payment of the annual fee. That's worth $700 based on TPG's valuations.

Rewards: You'll get 2 award miles per dollar on ticket purchases with Miles & More ""integrated airline partners."" This includes AirDolomiti Austrian Airlines Group Brussels Airlines Croatia Airlines Eurowings LOT Polish Airlines Lufthansa Luxair and SWISS. Unfortunately there are no other bonus categories so you'll earn 1 award miles per dollar on everything else.

Annual fee: $89.

Benefits: The Miles & More card is an intriguing option for those that are invested in any of the airlines that comprise the Lufthansa Group. You can redeem miles for Star Alliance flights at favorable rates. You'll also receive two complimentary Lufthansa Business Lounge Vouchers after each account anniversary a companion ticket and the ability to convert award miles into status miles once each calendar year.

Bottom line

Barclays has several solid options when it comes to potential credit cards to add to your wallet. Since the issuer no longer offers its own cards to new applicants and instead works with brand partners it's important to select a card that aligns with your lifestyle.

If you care about any of Barclays' cobranded partners then go for one of these cards. But if you're looking for something a bit more versatile look beyond Barclays to card options that allow you to transfer points or to receive straight cash back.

“Apple has informed NSPK [Russia’s National Payment Card System] that it is suspending support of ‘Mir’ cards in the payment service Apple Pay” a translated announcement on Mir’s site reads. “Since March 24 uploading new ‘Mir’ cards to the service has been unavailable.” The company also notes any Mir cards previously added to Apple Pay will stop working over “the next few days.” Apple Pay first added support for Mir cards last year.

Many Russian users have already been cut off from Apple Pay and Google Pay

According to The Guardian Mir is owned by the Central Bank of Russia and was established in response to the economic sanctions put on Russia after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Statistics from the Central Bank say Mir cards make up around 32 percent of all new cards issued in the country.

Google is also taking steps to cut ties with Mir the WSJ reports. The company reportedly paused a pilot program — which began last October — that let users connect their Mir cards to Google Pay. “Google Pay is pausing payments-related services in Russia as a result of payment services disruption out of our control” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to the WSJ.

The Verge reached out to Google and Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYXBwbGUtcGF5LXJ1c3NpYW4tY2FyZC1taXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple Pay closes a loophole to end support for the Russian payment service Mir,"The Russian payment card system called Mir will no longer be hosted on Apple Pay adding to the existing restrictions against Russian economic activity enacted via Apple's contactless payment service.

The Mir suspension took effect on on March 24 according to an announcement on Mir's website. Apple also alerted Russia's National Card Payment System (NSPK).

According to The Verge the translated announcement states that uploading new Mir cards to Apple Pay is no longer possible and any Mir cards added prior to the suspension should stop working over the next few days.

Apple Pay has been available in Russia since 2016 and Mir has been on the service since last year. But as of March 1 2022 Apple had taken several measures to limit economic activity in Russia on its platforms in response to Russia's attack on Ukraine. Previous measures included restricting access to Russian MasterCard and Visa holders.

This latest Mir suspension removes Russia's own internal payment system from Apple's platform making it so both international and domestic purchases in Russia cannot be made using Apple Pay. Before suspending Mir Russian Apple Pay users had a loophole that allowed them to still access the contactless payment system so long as they were making their purchases via Mir.

SEE ALSO: Apple says Tap to Pay is coming later this year

Apple isn't the only tech company restricting Russian economic activity via its platforms. According to the Wall Street Journal Google is also pausing a pilot program that allowed Mir cards on Google Pay. Russian Google Pay users also cannot access MasterCard or Visa as the U.S.-based card networks have pulled out of the country entirely.

Notably though the lack of contactless card access via Google Pay is not a direct action from Google or its parent company Alphabet. Because Visa and MasterCard suspended their own services in Russia more broadly Google hasn't taken responsibility for suspensions and hasn't itself addressed the pause of the pilot program that Mir was using.

""Google Pay is pausing payments-related services in Russia as a result of payment services disruption out of our control"" a Google spokeswoman told the WSJ.

Russian contactless payment users on both Apple Pay and Google Pay have also been affected by restrictions from other international banks a list that Russia's Central Bank has said includes VTB Group Sovcombank Novikombank Promsvyazbank and Otkritie FC Bank. These restrictions mostly affect any purchases made via Apple Pay or Google Pay by Russians while abroad or online to stores based in countries that have taken financial sanctions against Russia (h/t The Verge).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vOXRvNW1hYy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yNy9hcHBsZS1ibG9ja3MtbG9vcGhvbGUtdGhhdC1hbGxvd2VkLWFwcGxlLXBheS10by1jb250aW51ZS13b3JraW5nLWluLXJ1c3NpYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple blocks loophole that allowed Apple Pay to continue working in Russia,"At the end of February Apple announced it was suspending Apple Pay in Russia due to the war against Ukraine. While Visa and Mastercard cards were made immediately unavailable the Russian Mir card was still working with Apple’s own payment service but not anymore.

Reuters reported that Russia’s home-grown system Mir “remained connected to Apple Pay until that access was removed on Thursday according to Russia’s National Card Payment System (NSPK).”

“Apple has informed NSPK it is suspending support for Mir cards in the Apple Pay payment service. Starting from March 24 users cannot add new Mir cards to the service. Apple will stop all operations of previously added cards over the next few days” NSPK said on Friday.

To Reuters Sberbank said that “Mir cards in Apple Pay will not be available” with Apple restricting access.

By the time the first sanctions landed these were the Russian banks affected: VTB Group Sovcombank Novikombank Promsvyazbank and Otkritie. The Central Bank of Russia also noted at the time that cards issued by these five banks no longer work with Apple Pay or Google Pay as both platforms are US-based.

Apple’s own payment system was launched in Russia in 2016. Now six years after the service has been blocked due to the war against Ukraine. As of now it’s unclear when Apple will bring back Pay to the country.

It’s worth noting that Russian customers will still be able to make contactless payments using their physical cards within Russia but as of now Apple and Google digital wallets have been suspended in the country indefinitely.",,,

Match Play Tiebreakers

There are no tiebreakers in the group stage. Players earn one point for a win and a half-point for a tie. If two players earn two points and are tied for first place in a group the head-to-head result between them is irrelevant.

There will be a sudden-death playoff between the players to determine who advances.

Scottie Scheffler needed only 14 holes to win his match against Matt Fitzpatrick and then six more to beat him in a playoff.

The third full day of endless action in the Dell Technologies Match Play finally ended Friday when Collin Morikawa drove the green on a par 4 this one not nearly dramatic as his shot that won the PGA Championship but still effective in getting him through group play.

Sixteen players remain for the knockout stage that begins Saturday morning all of them knowing that three days of tense matches mean nothing going forward.

“Now it’s real” Abraham Ancer said after squeezing by Webb Simpson. “Now you’re for sure not advancing if you don’t win.”

Rahm had that luxury by winning his opening two matches. He was sloppy on the back nine in losing to Patrick Reed who played his best golf after already being eliminated. But the world’s No. 1 player avoided a playoff in his group when Cameron Young also lost.

Seamus Power also lost his match but by then he was already assured of winning his group. The Irishman got another reward: By reaching the fourth round Power is assured of staying in the top 50 and getting into the Masters.

Four of the groups were decided in extra holes.

There are no tiebreakers and three players who won their match had to return to the first tee for sudden death against the player they just beat.

Scheffler had the toughest time. Takumi Kanaya felt the most fortunate.

Scheffler had to beat Fitzpatrick to have any chance and that was the easy part in a 5-and-4 victory. They had to wait more than two hours for all the matches to go off before their playoff began. They matched birdies on No. 1 pars on the next three holes and birdies on the fifth. Scheffler finally won on the par-5 sixth when he holed a 6-foot putt after Fitzpatrick missed from about 15 feet.

“I knew the rules” Scheffler said of going extra holes after beating Fitzpatrick in the match.

“I didn’t know we had to wait so long to come back for the playoff. I was a bit surprised with that. I would have loved to have just kept going the way I was playing in the beginning and Matt did a really good job of regrouping and he came out and played some really nice golf in the playoff.”

His reward is a fourth-round match against Billy Horschel who beat Scheffler in the championship match last year.

Rahm faces Brooks Koepka who narrowly avoided a playoff. Koepka was tied with Shane Lowry on the 18th when he hit a 45-yard pitch off packed dirt well left of the 18th green to 8 feet and made the birdie putt for a 1-up victory.

Kanaya was in the same predicament as Scheffler. He had to beat Lucas Herbert of Australia and he ended the match in 14 holes.

On the first hole in the playoff Kanaya found a fairway bunker and could only advance to some 90 yards short of the hole — Herbert with a good drive was just outside that with his second shot. Kanaya used the slope expertly for a shot to 2 feet and Herbert three-putted from 18 feet above the hole to lose the match.

Kanaya is No. 56 the lowest seed still playing but not my much. And considering his going to the Masters in two weeks he isn’t the biggest surprise.

That would be Richard Bland of England at 49 the oldest player in the field and the No. 54 seed this week. Bland started his Match Play debut by halving his match with Bryson DeChambeau. On Friday he beat Lee Westwood to win the group.

Bland last year became the oldest first-time winner in European tour history. With one more match victory he might be headed to his first Masters.

“It’s just my time. That’s all I can put it down to” Bland said. “But I’m going to enjoy it while it lasts.”

Will Zalatoris known for his iron game knocked out Viktor Hovland with his putter. Zalatoris made putts of 12 feet on the 16th and 18th holes the last one giving him a 1-up victory to tie the Norwegian in group play.

In the playoff Zalatoris made a 10-foot birdie on No. 1 — Hovland made his from 6 feet — and another 10-footer on No. 2 to advance.

Dustin Johnson Kevin Kisner and Tyrrell Hatton were among five players who won all their matches. Kisner who has won and been runner-up at the Match Play looked tougher than ever in taking down Justin Thomas. Kisner was 6 under through six holes and shot 28 on the front nine to build a 5-up lead. He closed him out on the 15th hole.

“It had to be a 10” Kisner said when asked to rate his performance.

He moved on to face Adam Scott who had no trouble beating Jordan Spieth to advance to the weekend for the first time since 2005. His record isn’t as bad as that would suggest.

“It’s hard to get there when I don’t play in the event” Scott said with a smile. He hasn’t been to the Match Play since 2016. He liked it better at La Costa especially in 2003 when he went 19 holes before losing to Tiger Woods.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hbWliaWFuLmNvbS5uYS9yYWhtLW92ZXJjb21lcy1zbG93LXN0YXJ0LXRvLXdpbi1hdC13Z2MtbWF0Y2gtcGxheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rahm overcomes slow start to win at WGC Match Play,"The 27-year-old Spaniard who fought back from two down after five holes improved to 2-0 to lead his group entering Friday's final group stage matches at Austin (Texas) Country Club.""I'm confident"" Rahm said.

Graeme McCormick who stood to become SNP president in 2023 earlier claimed he could gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

However McCormick’s decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Swinney the former deputy first minister of Scotland as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down. The deadline for nominations is noon on Monday.

McCormick said he reached the nomination threshold of 100 signatures but chose to back Swinney after a “lengthy and fruitful conversation” and said this could be a “fresh start”.

In a statement on Sunday night he said: “John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.

“This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I’m sure that John’s determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

“I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney’s nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.”

McCormick’s supporters had argued it would have been undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. He won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution over mounting a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson earlier attacked Swinney for criticising the planned challenge and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was going up against him.

Swinney who described himself as the candidate to unite the party after a “difficult” few years said an election contest would delay the SNP’s essential rebuild. But he signalled he would win any potential contest telling Sky News that party members “probably know the outcome” between the two potential candidates.

His call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.

Once Swinney is named the next SNP leader he will have to win a subsequent vote in Holyrood later in the week to become Scotland’s first minister.

The SNP said it does not comment on such matters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

Who is John Swinney?

What direction will the SNP take?

Earlier on Sunday Mr Swinney warned potential challengers from entering the race saying it would delay the party from ""rebuilding"".

""My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP. I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence"" he told Sky's Trevor Phillips.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

""So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we've had under my leadership and bluntly I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I can do because every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding and I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtcm9zdGVyLzIwMjQvNS82LzI0MTQ5ODc1L2NvdWxkLXN0ZWVsZXJzLWZvdXJ0aC1yb3VuZC1pb2wtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWZpbmQtaGlzLXdheS10by10aGUtc3RhcnRpbmctbGluZXVwLWluLTIwMjQtbmZs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024,"The Steelers used their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft toward the continued overhaul of the offensive line by selecting tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier. Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

On Monday the fast food giant made it official announcing via a press release and social media posts that Szechuan Sauce would be returning on March 31.

""hi from Szechuan Sauce say it back"" McDonald's tweeted.

Related: How McDonald's Szechuan Sauce went from a ""just fine"" '90s relic to a riot-causing cult condiment

Szechuan Sauce was originally released in 1998 as a promotional tie-in to the Disney movie ""Mulan."" It was a dark brown nugget sauce with a touch of acid from the addition of apple cider vinegar and a little nuttiness from roasted sesame oil. This distinguished it from the chain's OG Sweet and Sour McNuggets dipping sauce.

It was a fine condiment but unassuming enough that there wasn't much outcry when the chain pulled it from their franchises after the month-long promotion. For almost two decades Szechuan Sauce was simply a relic of McDonald's past such as the McPizza or McSalad Shakers. Then the third season of the adult animated show ""Rick and Morty"" debuted in April 2017.

In the first episode ""The Rickshank Redemption"" one of the series' main protagonists Rick Sanchez revisits a memory of going to a McDonald's drive-thru and ordering Chicken McNuggets with Szechuan Sauce. By the end of the episode Rick reveals that his only goal in life is to find more of the sauce. He's not motivated by saving the world or his family or well anything other than ""that McNugget sauce. I want that 'Mulan' McNugget sauce Morty. That's my series arc Morty! If it takes nine seasons!""

Viewers of the show which had a cult following of its own began petitioning McDonald's to bring back the sauce. McDonald's acknowledged fans by sending ""Ricky and Morty"" creator Justin Roiland a four-pound jug of Szechuan Sauce found in ""Dimension C-1998 . . . a dimension where it's always 1998. 1998 every day. No smartphones no social media. It's a weird scary place. But they've got Szechuan Sauce on the regular menu.""

Finally in October 2017 the chain decided to do a one-day promotion centered around the sauce — and it was an unmitigated disaster. There were riots an alleged stabbing and lots of angry customers. You can read more about this in the Salon Food archives.

A few months later to rectify the situation McDonald's revived the sauce with an estimated 20 million portions distributed to locations across the U.S. Reviews were mixed — there was a lot of talk of it tasting like soy-flavored corn starch — and Szechuan Sauce eventually rolled off of the chain's menu offerings again.

When it returns on March 31 it will be only the fourth time that Szechuan Sauce has been available in McDonald's history. Will it be better this go around? Who's to say — though I'm sure the Ebay sauce collectors will start lining up early.

Getty Images

Fast-food enterprises are doing rather well thank you very much.

The pandemic gave them a captive audience.

Technology gave them a headstart in making it easy for customers to order and pick up. Or to come along to the drive-thru and even have a robot take their orders.

All this gave the likes of McDonald's Chick-fil-A and the rest the ability to raise their prices. Dollar deals were no more.

You'd think though that fast-food brands would use technology to create brand affection rather than something different.

Two tales from the past week may make you wonder.

McDonald's decided to release its Szechuan Sauce. Yet again. Should you have been fortunate enough to miss this experience it all started with the Rick and Morty TV show mentioning the sauce.

McDonald's played along by sending the show's creators a large bottle. In 2017 the company released the sauce in minute quantities. This quite naturally caused consternation traffic jams and a lot of angry customers.

Also: How McDonald's keeps getting embarrassed by an engineer's little app

This time around beginning March 31 the sauce may be released in slightly greater quantities. But McDonald's is making it conditional. You have to download its app to qualify.

I don't know about you but I find companies that force me to download an app force me to offload it the minute I get what I want.

Forcing customers to do something is rarely a good thing. Imagine too if you download the app and the sauce is no longer available. This is all menacingly uncomfortable.

Please then contrast it with something Burger King did last week.

It suddenly struck the company that gas prices were going up. This would surely increase the costs for customers who choose to go to the drive-thru.

So as B&T reports Burger King's French arm decided to drop the price of its Whopper to 1 euro and 99 cents -- if the price of gas goes above the highly emotional 2 euros per liter mark.

""Driving may not cost you less but eating will"" says the company's announcement ad. So it's dipping the price -- a Whopper may usually cost around 5 euros -- for drive-thru customers only.

Here then is the contrast.

Where McDonald's focuses on self-interest and app downloads Burger King centers its thoughts on its customers' emotions.

McDonald's may indeed succeed in its initial mission. But how many will still resent that they have to download the app?

Burger King's customers on the other hand will surely feel far warmer. The brand has considered them and their current lives rather than trying to gauge a commercial success from vulnerable customers -- vulnerable to the hype surrounding a highly average sauce that is.

Sometimes being self-regarding isn't the best way to go about business.

And I'm not specifically talking about any tech company when I say that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtbWNkb25hbGRzLWNhbmNlci1jaGVtaWNhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Food Packaging Contains This Cancer-Causing Chemical New Report Finds,"We all know that fast-food isn't the healthiest for us but a new report has revealed that it might not be the best for preventing disease either.

According to a recent investigation from Consumer Reports the packaging used for food at many major fast-food chains including McDonald's Chick-Fil-A Burger King and Sweet Green contain a cancer-causing chemical called PFAS or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.

The same chemical is used to form the nonstick coating on pans make fabrics and carpets stain-resistant and create water-resistant clothing. Packaging made with PFAS often resembles paper or cardboard but oils from greasy foods do not soak through.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Health and environmental advocates are pushing for PFAS use to be restricted especially in food packaging. In response McDonald's has vowed to end the use of the chemical by 2025.

""In recent decades PFAS exposure has been linked to a growing list of problems including immune system suppression lower birth weight and increased risk for some cancers"" the report states. ""This raises alarms about the use of these compounds especially in items such as burger wrappers and salad bowls.""

""We know that these substances migrate into food you eat"" says Justin Boucher an environmental engineer at the Food Packaging Forum a nonprofit research organization based in Switzerland. ""It's clear direct exposure.""

To see how often PFAS are still found in food containers Consumer Reports (CR) tested more than 100 food packages from restaurants and grocery chains. The group found these chemicals in many types of packaging—from paper bags and wrappers to single-use paper plates.

""PFAS were in some packaging from every retailer we looked at"" the report states.

That included many fast-food chains such as McDonald's as well as Burger King and Chick-fil-A both of which publicly committed to reducing PFAS in their packaging after being told of CR's test results.

Chains that promote healthier fare such as Cava and Trader Joe's also had some packaging that contained PFAS CR's tests found.

In any case it's a good sign that fast-food giants are working away from using these chemicals in their products.

""The CDC states that some studies show PFAS exposure may affect growth learning and behavior of infants and older children in addition to other health effects"" said Tracy Gregoire Healthy Children Project Director of the Learning Disabilities Association of America. ""There are safer alternatives to these harmful forever chemicals and we are thrilled that McDonald's is joining a growing number of quick-service restaurants.""

How about McDonald’s? Like Taco Bell or those flame-broiled burgers at Burger King? How about that new Arby’s jingle and their roast beef sandwiches?

You might want to rethink all of those stops because while we knew eating fast food isn’t the most healthy decision a report published by Consumer Reports Thursday sheds light on a concern that might be greater than the calorie splurge those kinds of meals can bring.

Because according to the report all of those establishments have toxic “forever chemicals” known as PFAS in the packaging that they put their food in. And PFAS are bad news having been linked to an increase in a risk of some cancer types immune issues liver damage … the list goes on.

They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment hang around and end up in our food and water supply. According to reports many of us have already been exposed to the chemicals and likely have some level of them in our blood.

But PFAS are not things you want to willingly add more of in your body and according to the recent report the food packaging may be a pretty easy way to up your intake of the nasty substances. Because the report said fatty and salty food are more likely to absorb the chemicals.

“We know these substances migrate into food you eat” Justin Boucher an environmental engineer at the Food Packaging Forum told Consumer Reports. “It’s clear direct exposure.”

According to the latest report “100 food packaging products from 24 restaurant and grocery chain across the country in fall 2021” were tested.

Eight restaurants – Chick-fil-A Arby’s Burger King McDonald’s Nathan’s Famous Taco Bell Sweetgreen and Cava – “had at least one type of packaging” that was found to contain PFAS.

Per the report several restaurants including Cava Chipotle Freshii Panera Bread Sweetgreen and Wendy’s committed to removing PFAS from their packaging by the end of 2021. Chick-fil-A says on its website that such packaging is “expected to be phased out by the end of summer of 2022.”

McDonald’s and Taco Bell have reportedly committed to removing them by 2025.

The national survey entitled “Painful Pandemic: How a Healthcare System Under Strain Impacts Chronic Pain Patients” involved 810 US adults who currently experience chronic back or leg pain. It found “far-reaching impacts of this debilitating condition on patient lifestyle everyday activities and mental state further exacerbated by the pandemic’s impact on stressed health systems and the ability of patients to seek timely care” a Medtronic press release states.

Of those who reported worsening chronic pain during the pandemic 52% cited challenges in receiving appropriate medical care as a contributing factor. Additionally 44% said that since the pandemic began they have experienced care delays including postponed rescheduled or cancelled appointments or procedures for their pain. Of those who proactively postponed their medical care 55% cited COVID-19 fears as a contributing factor.

Most people currently living with chronic back or leg pain report numerous detrimental physical and mental impacts Medtronic states. When listing physical challenges associated to living with chronic pain the survey found sleep exercise habits sense of mobility/function and ability to enjoy hobbies to be the aspects of life most negatively impacted. Chronic back or leg pain sufferers under 55 years of age were more likely than those aged 55 years and over to report that their ability to work has been impacted (36% vs 22% respectively) while those over 55 were more likely than those aged 35–54 to say their sense of mobility/function has been impacted (58% vs 46% respectively).

In addition 66% reported that their mental health has been negatively impacted and list feelings of frustration annoyance exhaustion and depression while 67% of surveyed patients also said that it is harder to enjoy spending time with their family.

As a result some 90% of the patients said they wish there were more treatment options available to manage their pain. While most are aware of traditional treatment options like physical therapy and oral medications far fewer are familiar with alternative options like targeted drug delivery (38%) or spinal cord stimulation (34%) the report indicates.

On average those who have seen or talked to a healthcare provider about their chronic back or leg pain first did so seven years ago while 38% of current chronic back or leg pain sufferers said they have never been referred to a pain specialist physician for their chronic pain.

“These data bear out what we have heard from our clinician customers and patients for two years—the pandemic has been especially hard on those with chronic pain” said Charlie Covert vice president and general manager of Pain Therapies within Medtronic’s neuromodulation business. “There is a tangible human cost to deferred procedures and delayed care. As COVID-19 hopefully begins its transition to a more endemic disease we expect many of these patients to urgently seek relief through new or more effective treatment modalities. Our survey demonstrated that an overwhelming majority want more treatment options yet awareness of spinal cord stimulation and targeted drug delivery options remains relatively low. That represents an opportunity to educate patients about the full range of options available to help alleviate their pain.”

The Dartmouth General Hospital is expecting the arrival of a GI Genius intelligent endoscopy machine in early April just months after the technology was approved for use in Canada.

It's a system that scans images taken during a colonoscopy and detects possible pre-cancerous lesions called polyps that may otherwise go undetected.

""It's innovative. It's going to I hope save a lot of Nova Scotian lives. And we're really excited to bring it to our hospital"" said Dr. Natalie Cheng medical site lead for Dartmouth General.

Cheng said early data from the United States suggests that the technology used by the GI Genius can detect 14 per cent more polyps than a regular colonoscopy during which a doctor assesses images with the naked eye.

The artificial intelligence in the system learns the patterns associated with polyps and as it finds more of them its detection rate improves Cheng said.

Given the high rate of colon cancer in Nova Scotia Cheng said the technology is especially important. She said about 800 cases were diagnosed in the province last year and the disease is the second-most common cause of cancer deaths.

If polyps are not caught in time they can spread to the point of no longer being curable Cheng said. She said early prevention is actually straightforward because the polyps can be taken out at the same time they're found.

Colon cancer is also not something that people might notice in the early stages Cheng added because the symptoms can be ""really subtle.""

Anything to help boost detection is crucial. ""It hits such a large portion of our population that I really think that this could make a positive impact in a preventative way"" she said.

The hospital already serves people across the province with a dedicated room for colon cancer screening as well as two other endoscopy suites.

The new technology will be piloted in Dartmouth to see if it matches the promising results across the border Cheng said and she hopes it could be rolled out to other parts of the province.

""We're so excited to have this here at Dartmouth first"" said Steven Harding CEO of the Dartmouth General Hospital Foundation.

Harding said the GI Genius with a $100000 price tag has been funded in part by the John and Judy Bragg Innovation Fund and the annual Get Up There! (GUT) event that supports the hospital foundation.

The GUT event is being held in Halifax on April 1 and Harding said any funds raised over and above what's needed for the GI Genius could go toward a second device if the pilot goes well.

The machine's distributor Medtronic said in a news release that it received a Health Canada licence for the GI Genius in November 2021.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."
META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvY29tcHV0aW5nL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2hlcmUtY29tZXMtdGhlLW11bHRpLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1tZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Metaverse Will Be a Multi-Platform Mess,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg promises a unified metaverse a seamless expanse of online 3D realms that work together regardless of what company built them. But if current tech industry trends are any indication the future will instead be a multitude of fragmented digital domains each its own separate shard of the metaverse experience.

Different companies have different ideas for what the metaverse should be. And they're all aware of the power of platforms. Apple's iPhone Tencent's WeChat and Meta's own Facebook all demonstrate that controlling a technology platform means you can charge rent. Want to sell an iPhone app? You'll need to pay a tithe to Apple.

It'll be no different in the metaverse says Singulos Research CEO Brad Quinton whose Perceptus AI technology is designed to identify real-world objects in augmented reality one of the metaverse's 3D interfaces.

""WhatsApp and iMessage don't work together"" Quinton said referring to Meta's and Apple's chat apps. ""It doesn't seem like that's going to go away anytime soon.""

The metaverse has captured public attention since Zuckerberg the concept's most vocal backer staked his giant social network's future on it last year. He's pitched it as a realm built by multiple companies using open standards. In it you're promised an experience like Neal Stephenson described in Snow Crash the 1992 novel that introduced the term to the public with a single digital universe where people chat fight gawk at the sights and judge the fidelity of each others' avatars.

In reality the metaverse is an uber-hyped idea that could quickly become a choppy mess. If you find it painful to navigate the current internet with its collection of different services with separate logins currencies contact lists avatars and item inventories wait until you have to log in while wearing a bulky uncomfortable helmet.

Welcome to the messy metaverse

The metaverse broadly speaking refers to 3D environments we'll occupy says Forrester analyst Martha Bennett. That'll include entirely digital zones we'll visit via virtual reality or VR and the blend of digital and real called augmented reality or AR. With the right headset you could play immersive video games don an outrageous avatar at a virtual party go clothes shopping bring new stats and scenery to your workout or see ads and map directions overlaid on your view of the real world.

Arguably the metaverse already exists in video games online chat rooms and fly-through real estate websites. Metaverse proponents say it can be a more immersive convincing experience.

This story is part of CNET's exploration of the internet's next iteration. Naomi Antonino

The concept has been on the agenda at trendsetting conferences like the recently held SXSW festival and the Game Developers Conference which is happening this week.

In Meta's view the metaverse will have an abundance of activities including work conferences virtual table tennis and online education. Powering it will be a common foundation Zuckerberg said in the October speech where he announced that Facebook was changing its name to Meta essentially betting the house on the new digital world.

""Teleporting around the metaverse is going to be like clicking a link on the internet. It's an open standard. In order to unlock the potential of the metaverse there needs to be interoperability"" and digital goods must be portable Zuckerberg said in his metaverse manifesto. ""When you buy something or create something your items will be useful in a lot of contexts and you're not going to be locked into one world or platform.""

That would also let you avoid duplicate purchases like buying Angry Birds twice to play it on your Android phone and Apple iPad. For those unique digital assets like Nike sneakers metaverse proponents want to use technology called nonfungible tokens or NFTs that record ownership on the same blockchain technology as cryptocurrency.

Not so fast Meta

Meta's vision of a unified metaverse foundation is far from unprecedented. Cooperatively developed standards route data across the internet shuttle email from Gmail to Outlook and deliver websites to your browser. Tech's biggest companies benefit from many collaboratively developed open-source software projects like the Linux operating system LLVM for creating software and Chromium for building web browsers.

But most newer tech platforms we experience are characterized by a proprietary design governed by a single company. It's a world of walled gardens more than open standards.

Facebook remains sticky because it's hard to convince all your contacts and for them to convince all their contacts to switch to something else. Apple technology works best for customers who buy Macs iPhones iPads Apple Watches and AirPods and who subscribe to Apple Music Apple TV Plus and Apple Fitness Plus. For Microsoft Office productivity LinkedIn identity and Activision Blizzard gaming will likely be central to its own metaverse not peripheral.

What Meta really wants is to effectively own the metaverse says Jack McCauley an engineer who co-founded the Oculus VR headset effort but left after Facebook acquired it in 2014. ""What they're trying to do is to create their own platform"" complete with apps and services he said.

Meta is indeed trying to create a metaverse platform investing billions of dollars over coming years to build it and trying to attract developers and creators. But its vision doesn't call for a Facebook-only metaverse. Interoperability and open standards ""need to be built into the metaverse from day one"" Zuckerberg said an approach that could lower barriers between multiple metaverses. He decried the ""lack of choice and high fees"" on today's big tech platforms as ""stifling innovation and ... holding back the entire internet economy.""

McCauley isn't alone in expecting big disconnections between metaverses though.

People will go to one metaverse where their friends hang out and another metaverse that their employer sets up predicts Eric Alexander founder of Soundscape VR. Different realms will require different governance models content moderation policies and foundational technologies with proprietary elements. His own service which generates a visually vivid 3D world to match people's music or concerts requires very low latency to avoid lag between real-world musicians' actions and the resulting audio. Soundscape VR isn't eager to share that with others or lower its standards for common foundation.

And those separate patches of turf will define the metaverse at least until consolidation wipes out or absorbs smaller players.

""Everyone will want to own and control their own metaverse"" says Bradley Tusk an investor at Tusk Ventures. ""We'll see who wins once they compete with each other.""

Some openness to metaverse foundations?

The metaverse's underpinnings might benefit from common infrastructure. There are several projects that could help. Open AR Cloud from nonprofit the Open AR Cloud Association could build a digital mirror of the real world that AR headsets could use. OpenXR is an interface that programmers can use to write software for spanning multiple AR and VR headsets. And WebXR brings brings web publishing techniques to headsets' browser interfaces. Graphics chip powerhouse Nvidia likes another possible foundation Pixar's Universal Scene Description technology.

Alliances could give smaller efforts more clout. That's the hope of David Lucatch CEO of Liquid Avatar Technologies which offers identity technology to let people traverse metaverses more easily. He helped launch an alliance called the Multiverse Collective to help companies band together with common technology that should be better able to compete with metaverse efforts from giants like Meta.

Ultimately though closed technology will carry the day says GlobalData analyst Laura Petrone. ""The metaverse is the prerogative of big tech companies with the wealth of data computing power and sophisticated technologies to enable it"" she said.

Expect them to set their own standards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vc2lmdGVkLmV1L2FydGljbGVzL2V1cm9wZXMtdG9wLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1pbnZlc3RvcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Europe’s top metaverse investors,"Some of the shine has come off the metaverse recently with Elon Musk calling it little more than a marketing gimmick and the average price of non-fungible tokens (NFTs seen as a key part of buying and selling things in the metaverse) dropping dramatically.

But big companies’ interest in the metaverse has not dipped at all. Microsoft bought games company Activision Blizzard for $68.7bn while Epic the maker of multiplayer online game Fortnite recently bought Bandcamp a community for independent music artists signalling its intention to move further into online concerts and music discovery. HSBC announced plans to shut down 69 physical bank branches while at the same time buying a plot of virtual land on metaverse platform The Sandbox for an undisclosed sum.

Meanwhile some 70 fashion brands including big names like Estée Lauder Tommy Hilfiger Dolce & Gabbana and Forever 21 took part in a virtual fashion week in Decentraland another metaverse platform.

The metaverse is clearly still big business and venture capital investors even at more generalist funds are looking for deals in this area.

“Web3 and metaverse are here to stay — not just in one industry but across all of them” says Sabina Wizander partner at Creandum.

Though many of the recent big deals have been in the US European investors see the arrival of the metaverse as an opportunity for Europe to regain some of the tech dominance it lost during the last 15 years.

“If the metaverse ends up being mainly games-based then Europe will have a chance — some of the world-leading games companies have come from Europe” says Henry Gladwyn partner at OMERS Ventures.

Europe has a handful of specialist metaverse investors such as FOV Ventures launched just this month and Hiro Capital the Luxembourg-based games sector fund. In addition generalist funds and specialist deeptech investors are looking for select deals. Sifted caught up with a few to get an idea of what they are focusing on and how they see the metaverse market unfolding.

Metaverse startups should take note. This is who you need to pitch to — and what they are looking for.

Luke Alvarez Hiro Capital

Invested in: Frameplay Dreamcraft Entertainment Keen Games

Hiro Capital is the big beast of European metaverse investment having recently launched its second fund — €300m — to accompany its first €115m fund launched in 2019. Hiro Capital has also launched a special purpose acquisition company and is looking to take a games company with an enterprise value of between €400m and €2bn onto the stock market.

Hiro has a solid games pedigree. It was founded by Ian Livingstone the former chairman of Eidos the publisher of the Tomb Raider games who is sometimes referred to as the “father of Lara Croft”. And yes it’s called Hiro Capital after the name of the main character in Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash the 1992 book which predicted the metaverse.

The first investments from the Hiro Capital 2 fund are expected to be announced next month says Luke Alvarez founder and general partner. Most of the fund will be targeted at European startups with about 15% going to the US and a small handful to other markets (for example Hiro Capital recently invested in an Indian realtime games company called Loco).

It is still early days in the metaverse we’ll be building it out over the next 20 years

“We think of the metaverse as partly AR and VR partly massively multiplayer games and partly Web3 and crypto” says Alvarez. He believes in a future with a “mad mishmash of overlapping metaverses” rather than one dominated by Meta or Microsoft.

Alvarez is also very bullish that European companies will take a large slice of the metaverse market.

“2022 is as exciting an opportunity as 2002 when we were at the beginnings of the mobile internet which led to the emergence of companies like Facebook and Google Tencent Alibaba and Baidu.”

While European companies notably missed out on the mobile internet era Alvarez believes Europe can play a big role in the metaverse era.

A third of the world’s games content is developed in Europe and a lot of the early proto metaverses such as Minecraft (now owned by Microsoft but originally created by Sweden’s Mojang) were developed here he points out. Metaverse platform The Sandbox though now owned by Hong Kong’s Animoca Brands was created by Frenchman Sebastian Borget.

“There are more games developers in Europe than in the US and it is generally less expensive to develop things here” says Alvarez.

Alvarez is also keeping an eye on the companies coming out of the Oxford and Cambridge clusters which are developing the hardware for augmented reality and virtual reality. “We’re watching developments like laser holography and other ways of delivering images to people’s eyeballs. These will help create a superscaled AR proposition for billions of people hopefully in 10-15 years.”

Alvarez expects to invest about 20% of the new fund — around 10 or so deals — into deeptech companies. This could mean investing in no-code games platforms that allow kids to create their own games more easily or in-game advertising that will allow for example a brand to put a logo on a t-shirt in a game.

He’s relaxed about the rise and fall of sentiment around the metaverse taking a long-term view on it.

“It is still early days in the metaverse we’ll be building it out over the next 20 years” he says.

Henry Gladwyn OMERS Ventures

Invested in: Medal.tv and about to unveil another metaverse investment

Omers Ventures is a generalist fund that has only recently come round to the idea of investing in areas like gaming and crypto.

“Gaming and crypto has been a journey for us” says Henry Gladwyn partner. “But the metaverse is such a megatrend that we have to try to be a part of it.”

And so in December OMERS chose to lead the $45m Series C round into Medal.tv which makes it easy to make and share clips of memorable gameplay moments.

Gladwyn thinks about the metaverse and gaming as the next stage of the internet and social media.

“A lot of what gaming offers is an interesting alternative to the problems that Web2 had” he says. Web2 depended on attracting a mass audience on platforms then trying to connect people through their interest groups. This could sometimes lead to extremism and obsession and wasn't always a natural way for people to be social.

If you get a Roblox in your portfolio it will give you fund return on fund return on fund return.

Gladwyn says he is looking for games that can truly become social experiences. Medal for example is trying to build the social network of games with its shareable clips of memorable gameplay moments. But equally OMERS might invest in game engines or something else ancillary to games.

Every metaverse investor is secretly hoping to find the next Roblox Gladwyn says. “If you get a Roblox in your portfolio it will give you fund return on fund return on fund return.”

But he worries that metaverse games are too dependent on finding a hit and also that the companies might not have long-term staying power after the initial buzz around them fades. Everyone is watching how Roblox does.

“If Roblox disappears then people will go back to the drawing board” says Gladwyn.

Gladwyn adds that it can be hard for a generalist firm to get into the best metaverse deals. The crypto end is particularly tricky he notes as many crypto companies have a distrust of VCs and have alternative ways of raising money. But he says there is always space for generalists in later stage megarounds.

David Haynes and Petri Rajahalme FOV Ventures

David Haynes one of the founding team at music streaming company Soundcloud has teamed up with Petri Rajahalme an XR industry veteran to launch FOV Ventures a fund specialising in early-stage metaverse startups.

The €25m fund will back 25-30 metaverse startups at the seed and pre-seed stage. FOV will invest in three different types of metaverse companies. First up those that are creating games and experiences in the metaverse including digital fashion shopping and concerts.

They are also looking at startups in the enterprise metaverse — either virtual meetings or digital twins for factories. The third area for investment will be startups creating the “tools” for the metaverse: the platforms avatars sound effects and backdrops.

FOV will not invest in cryptocurrencies and NFTs — although these are seen by some people as an essential building block of the metaverse.

Sabina Wizander Creandum

Invested in: Resolution Games Armada Interactive Scapin

Creadum is a generalist firm but recently decided it needed to participate in the metaverse and Web3 trends. “We need to skate to where the puck is going if that is not too much of a Swedish ice hockey metaphor” says Wizander. “It is clear that metaverse and Web3 are here to stay — it isn’t just one industry but across all of them.”

Wizander remains sceptical on NFTs and cryptocurrencies. “I am still looking for a use case that solves an actual problem” she says. “I wouldn’t want to invest in a speculative NFT project.”

However Creandum did invest in Scapin a metaverse destination game where people can socialise with each other. Much like OMERS Ventures’ Gladwyn Wizander is looking at the metaverse as an evolution of the current internet.

“When people are sceptical about whether we will really live in these virtual worlds I would say — aren’t we already doing that? We are constantly heads down in our phones. It is just that at the moment we are consuming mostly text or video” she says.

“If anyone told us five years ago if we would be sitting in video meetings 12 hours a day and that would be the only way we did business we wouldn’t have believed it. The metaverse idea is just the next step in how we can spend time online in a more meaningful way” she says.

Wizander believes there will be multiple metaverse platforms — a few big ones and a long tail of smaller ones. They will need to be interoperable and people will need to be able to take their profiles and avatars across all of them.

Creandum is interested in virtual goods and fashion. One big question for Wizander is where the power will lie — will big metaverse destination platforms want to control the identities of visitors or will they let users and third-party makers of virtual goods own their own identities and products?

Predicting which platforms will become most popular with users is also a gamble she says.

“Building a consumer platform is not a science you need something of a magic touch to get people to spend time there and build on it” Wizander says.

Ziv Reichert LocalGlobe

Invested in: Improbable 100ms

“Our belief is that there won’t be a single metaverse there will be millions the way we have websites today” says Ziv Reichert partner at LocalGlobe.

“I see the metaverse as a transition from the 2D internet to the 3D internet. The beginnings of that are already emerging in Roblox Minecraft and Fortnite. It doesn’t have to be through VR or AR it could be mobile-first.”

Another generalist VC that occasionally dips its toes into the metaverse LocalGlobe invested in Improbable the gaming engine that is working on getting thousands of people onto the same games server at one time. Technology like this is a foundational block of metaverse platforms — if you can’t get masses of people on at the same time it will be hard to host big concerts or sporting events in the virtual world.

LocalGlobe is also looking to invest in tools to make it much easier for anyone to build a 3D world — the equivalent of what Squarespace and Wix did for building websites. Reichert is also interested in how to build user identities in the metaverse and in digital fashion.

Reichert believes that Europe’s strong arts ecosystem is what will help it dominate the metaverse. “It is one thing to build out 3D persistent environments but if they don’t have any life in them they are meaningless” he says.

Max Bautin IQ Capital Fund

Invested in: Virti Cauldron Audio Analytic

IQ Capital based in Cambridge is a deeptech specialist fund and has invested in startups like Virti which offers VR training for companies and Cauldron the immersive gaming studio spun out of fintech unicorn Thought Machine.

Bautin is wary of the metaverse hype. “We are looking to invest mainly in technologies for which there is a current confirmed demand. This is very unclear right now on the consumer side of metaverse propositions. But there is clear demand in areas such as using virtual and augmented reality for training and education” he says.

“We invested in Virti because it is a virtual training company and this is a fantastic space every company has the potential to use it. There is a need for training in any job and VR can meaningfully improve its efficiency” he tells Sifted.

IQ Capital will also look at other metaverse tools for example technologies for enabling advertising in the metaverse. Bautin sees advertising as one of the main ways of monetising the metaverse.

Anne Glover Amadeus Capital Partners

Invested in: XYZ Reality V7 PolyAI

Anne Glover cofounder and CEO of Amadeus Capital Partners is also something of a metaverse sceptic. She believes that VR headset-related metaverse experiences will only ever appeal to a subset of the population.

“There's a lot of money to be made from that but I personally don't think that format is going to take over all walks of life” she says.

So when it comes to the metaverse Glover and her team are focused more on business applications for example XYZ Reality a London-based startup creating augmented reality overlays of building designs for construction sites. Glover also personally invested in a VR company creating safety training experiences for oil rig workers — able to place them on a virtual oil rig before they would have to face the dangers of the real thing.

Amadeus is also interested in toolmakers and recently invested in V7 a machine vision startup that allows users to rapidly tag people and objects in videos. Glover believes there will be a growing need for tools like this as we move into a more visual internet.

Invested in: Mojo Vision Dream Corporation. BLAST Premier

Edge doesn't brand itself as a metaverse investor but prefers the broader definition of investing in the creative economy.

Like many metaverse investors Edge's focus is on the tools that will allow the metaverse to be built rather than trying to pick the ultimate piece of content that is going to take off. Edge is looking at VR training and education as it believes that more training is going to take place in a more immersive environment. Surgeons for example will use immersive VR as part of their training as haptic technology becomes more advanced and imitates live body surgery.

Edge has invested in some of the hardware that may help make the metaverse a reality — for example Mojo Vision which is developing smart contact lenses with built-in displays and Otherworld a VR entertainment venue in London.

Some of Edge’s portfolio companies like Dream Corporation. BLAST Premier and Jungle started off focused on Web2 experiences but are now expanding into Web3 so Edge is becoming a metaverse investor there by default.

Dream Corporation for example is a virtual reality theme park hosting a wide selection of virtual reality games experiences food and drinks. One of its sub-brands Otherworld has real-life locations across London that take you to sixteen unique VR locations.

BLAST Premier delivers elite level esports and gaming content to viewers worldwide and is looking to develop a more immersive version of the game with creator tools to allow gamers to monetise their own creativity.

Jungle Creations a social-first video content publisher recently launched Futur3ology a social-first consumer brand on Snap as it moves towards providing Web3 experiences for its followers

Ramadan is more than a moment. It is a season of transformation observed by 2 billion people globally – in 2022 between April 2nd and May 1st.

During the month observers refrain from food and drink between sunrise and sunset but as a month it represents so much more than this. It’s a time for meaningful reflection personal connection and renewed purpose.

This period of transformation means Ramadan can be a time when people are open to discovering and connecting with new brands. The suspension of habitual routines provides openness to the discovery and trial of brands. YouGov research commissioned by Meta in 2021 found 81% of shoppers made a discovery of a new product brand or business while shopping online during Ramadan or Eid.

“It is important to meet shoppers in the spaces they’re using and use the right tools to connect with them”

The same research found 79% of observers (and non-observers) in the UK want to hear from brands during Ramadan but 62% don’t feel they are being served – highlighting a huge gap and opportunity to connect with this audience in a meaningful way.

Ramadan observers are also keen to be acknowledged feel seen and see themselves represented. The same 2021 research found 66% of Ramadan observers say they trust brands more if they see themselves and people like them represented in advertising while 68% say they like to see ads that include people from diverse backgrounds during Ramadan.

Most interestingly Ramadan represents the kindest month on Meta’s platforms. The highest level of interaction around kindness takes place on Eid (the last day of Ramadan) followed by the first day of Ramadan. This is more than double any other moment during the year. Eighty-eight per cent of observers surveyed globally participate in charitable activities and more than two-thirds of observers surveyed believe brands should find ways to give back.

We have developed a Discover Good Hub during Ramadan to find inspirational stories from communities creators charities and businesses. Our ‘30 Days of Ramadan Giving’ makes it easy to donate to charities around the world.

For brands wanting to connect with new people during Ramadan there are four areas to focus on:

1. Personalise your campaigns

Meta’s planning tools adjust to how and when people tend to use our platforms. If you plan your campaign for a broad audience and use a long timeframe the platform will automatically find consumers when they are most interested in hearing your message.

2. Inspire with strong creative

Strong content is crucial during Ramadan. For example content streaming platform Shahid VIP wanted to engage a global audience with Ramadan-specific content and used its mobile-first short-form videos on Facebook and Instagram to drive an uplift in brand metrics and subscriptions across the US and Canada. It achieved an 8.4% increase in brand awareness and an 8.2% increase in sign-ups.

3. Convert and retain

Convert and retain customers by optimising the paths you create to serve people and your objectives. Nestlé Middle East did this well in partnership with Facebook’s creative shop media agency Zenith and bot developer Chatlab to create a helpful Messenger experience for Ramadan. People could ask the bilingual bot questions based on five categories: general Ramadan information; health and wellness; food ideas; entertainment; and gifting ideas. The Messenger experience provided answers based on their location. Overall 7000 people engaged and 35% used the service more than once.

4. Learn and optimise

Continuously learn and optimise using digital tools to sharpen and evolve your marketing practices.

Sixty-eight per cent of observers surveyed in a global Facebook-commissioned YouGov survey of 18000 people said they discovered new products and services on Meta technologies making it clear how important it is to meet shoppers in the spaces they’re using and use the right tools to connect with them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L3RvcC0xMC1tZXRhdmVyc2UtcGxhdGZvcm1zLXRoYXQtZW50aHVzaWFzdHMtaGF2ZS10by10cnktb3V0LWluLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Metaverse Platforms that Enthusiasts have to Try Out in 2022,Metaverse is a technology segment that has come to a long way and investments by top tech companies like the Meta Platforms Microsoft and Epic Games have helped accelerate its growth.

Here’s how to find them.,"The pieces are normally confined to museums and art galleries and can go for hundreds of thousands of dollars in some cases. Now anyone can see them free of charge just by strolling through one of these casinos.

Ghada Amer’s ""Portrait of Elizabeth"" from her “The Women I Know Part II” series is a blend of painting and embroidery. (Erik Verduzco / Las Vegas Review-Journal)

You step off the escalator press through the doors from the self-parking garage and there it is: a 5-foot bronze sculpture depicting a seated body inspired by the Grecian Temple of Zeus but with a head evocative of the masks of distant African cultures.

Stop look: It’s right next to the Jumanji 4D penny slots and Posh Burger home of a $100 wagyu beef patty topped with truffles foie gras and of course gold dust — gotta have that gold dust.

Yes just off the Aria casino floor air as heavy with the scent of french fries as those french fries are heavy with calories sits “Oracle” a luminous thought-provoking creation from acclaimed contemporary artist Sanford Biggers.

It’s a small-scale version of the 25-foot-tall 15000-pound sculpture of the same name that went on display at New York City’s Rockefeller Center in May.

It’s one of nine new additions from seven artists to the MGM Resorts International fine art collection which have recently been put on display at the Bellagio Park MGM and Aria. It’s a range of striking works in various mediums from distinguished contemporary artists such as Rashid Jones Ghada Amer and Derrick Adams whose pieces are normally confined to museums and art galleries and can go for hundreds of thousands of dollars in some cases. (MGM Resorts declined to reveal the value of the new collection.)

“It’s an incredible opportunity to be able to offer these works to the public” says Tarissa Tiberti executive director of MGM Resorts Art & Culture who curated the company’s latest art additions. “Rashid Johnson I mean museums have these works.”

A bid for diversity

It was a night of high drama and prices higher still.

Last October MGM Resorts sold 11 Pablo Picasso pieces in a thrilling auction with renowned art brokerage Sotheby’s that netted $109 million.

The idea: to subsequently diversify its public fine art collection to focus on underrepresented artists of various genders ethnicities and sexual orientations.

“We identified works by women artists artists of color the LGBTQIA community” Tiberti explains. “Our properties are hosting visitors from around the globe; we have a huge platform to share the importance of diversity and inclusion in everyday lives.”

Take Jonathan Lydon Chase whose artwork is rooted in the domesticities of queer Black life (Chase’s “The Cook Out” is at Park MGM adjacent to the resort’s lobby); or the aforementioned Biggers whose latest sculptures combine elements of African and European culture to underscore the ongoing influence of the former on the latter.

That these pieces are located in everyday places — behind a check-in desk at a salon; brightening a dining room wall in an Italian restaurant — is key: You can take them in without even being fully aware you’re doing so. But they have the power to stick with you regardless.

“You want to have an artwork that people come across and enjoy it — they might not even know that it’s incredible artwork — but they go away thinking about it” Tiberti says. “We have a great opportunity with the properties that we have to be able to put artwork in many places places that are unexpected and that you wouldn’t think about but you can enjoy them walking to the pool dining at a restaurant checking in at the front desk. As you’re standing in line waiting to check in and you may or may not realize it but you’re looking at it and having a contemplative experience about it.”

Where to experience it yourself

Here’s a quick guide with commentary on each selection from Tiberti.

Rashid Johnson a selection from his “Cosmic Slop” series

Where: A sunlit passageway on Aria’s promenade level

Background: A three-dimensional wall work made of black soap and microcrystalline wax forming a unique intriguing display.

“This is an important series of work for Rashid. I think for this work the material is the access point: It’s a concoction of wax mixed with West African soap that’s used for treatment of sensitive skin. It’s monochromatic with the material that’s important in Rashid Johnson’s culture and how he chooses to use that differently than how it would be used in treatment for your skin. He’s using it to talk about culture and content.”

———

Derrick Adams a selection from his “Floater” series

Where: This commissioned piece is a work in progress; it’ll be installed near the Park MGM pool upon completion.

Background: This joyous brightly colored series features African Americans enjoying a pool setting.

“I think the first things that draw me into the work are just the colors and how he’s making the figures out of shapes. And then you get deeper into it and you see these figures and everything has just such an incredible energy to it. I feel like his work is just very energetic very uplifting yet he has a very poignant context. He’s talking about the Black experience and how that is to navigate — through his world through our country. It’s something that’s fun to look at but yet it has a meaning behind it.”

———

Tomás Esson “Quimera” and “Anestesia”

Where: “Quimera” is just outside the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Garden; find “Anestesia” by the resort’s VIP lounge.

Background: These gorgeous arresting abstract oil-on-linen works are like tractor beams for the eyes.

“(“Quimera”) really kind of just jumps off the wall. The colors are so fabulous — really juicy colors — it just draws you in. He’s very interesting. His work talked a lot about eroticism and mythology before. These take a little bit more of a serious tone. His previous works were based on mythology and figures or creatures that were abstract and he took that abstraction even further. It just provides an energy in the painting that draws you in and captivates you makes you kind of think ‘What is happening in this painting?’ And it’s complete pure abstraction.”

———

Svenja Deininger untitled

Where: Aria’s Carbone restaurant

Background: A large radiant swirl of color and shapes that are immediate visceral and complex at once.

“It’s really beautiful just in the simplicity and the color how she has the raw canvas and the blocks. The forms that she’s creating I think they’re sensual. Her work is interesting; it can be quite complicated even though it seems very simple in the shapes and the color. She talks about the system of interaction: how the shapes interact with one another. And the size — it’s large so you become enveloped in the atmosphere that she’s creating.”

———

Ghada Amer “Portrait of Elizabeth” and “Portrait of Trini” from her “The Women I Know Part II” series

Where: The check-in desk at the Bellagio Spa and Salon

Background: These two mixed-media female portraits feature messages such as “Do not fit into the glass slipper like Cinderella did — shatter the glass ceiling.”

“She’s using a combination of materials. There’s acrylic so she has the painting and then she’s doing embroidery on top of it and it’s also layered with the words in the background. It’s the complexity of the work that is what’s so beautiful about these. Her practice is inherently feminist but she’s really just looking at the female figure and the paintings are exploring the gaze and the female identity that are exchanged between the artist and the subject and the viewer. It’s really kind of a beautiful moment.”

The Saint Peter’s Peacocks busted brackets nationwide and have captured the hearts of social media with many now rooting for the underdog to continue advancing.

Here’s a look at how profitable backing the Peacocks was for the select few who bet on the 15 seed in the tournament.

What Happened: The Saint Peter’s Peacocks entered the 2022 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament as a huge underdog to move past the first round and an even bigger underdog to make it to the Elite 8 where they currently find themselves.

The team knocked off 2-seed Kentucky with an 85-79 overtime win ending the near-impossible odds of a perfect bracket for many on the first day of the tournament.

The team then beat 7-seed Murray State with a 70-60 win to make it to the Sweet 16.

On Friday the Saint Peter’s Peacocks capped the perfect celebration to “National Peacock Day” with a 67-64 win over 3-seed Purdue.

Betting on the Peacocks: The Peacocks entered the 2022 NCAA Men’s National Tournament with 1000-to-1 odds of winning the national championship.

The team had odds of 250-to-1 of winning the East Region and advancing to the Final Four (tied for worst odds with the 14 and 16 seeds in the region) at FanDuel a unit of Flutter Entertainment PDYPY.

To make the Elite 8 Saint Peter’s was offered at odds of 100-to-1 at BetMGM a unit of MGM Resorts International MGM and Entain which was tied for the worst of all teams in the tournament.

Saint Peter’s covered large spreads of 18 8.5 and 12.5 against Kentucky Murray State and Purdue rewarding those who backed the underdog to keep the games close.

Those who bet on Saint Peter’s to win the games have been rewarded even more.

A $100 bet on Saint Peter’s to beat Kentucky paid out $1500 for a profit of $1400.

A $100 bet on Saint Peter’s to beat Murray State paid out $390 for a profit of $290.

A $100 bet on Saint Peter’s to beat Purdue paid out $750 for a profit of $650.

A bettor who let the $100 ride and continued to bet the winnings on Saint Peter’s in each game would have turned $100 into $43875 for a profit of $43775.

What’s Next: Saint Peter’s will take on 8-seeded North Carolina on Sunday March 27 at 5:05 p.m. EDT. The game will be televised on CBS a unit of Paramount Global PARAPARAA.

Saint Peter’s is an eight point underdog and offered at odds of +270 to win the game at DraftKings Inc DKNG.

Namibia’s Nakathila battered Berchelt for most of their six-round lightweight fight at Resorts World Las Vegas which caused referee Russell Mora to stop the action as soon as the sixth round ended. Nakathila landed numerous flush right hands to Berchelt’s head scored a knockdown during the third round and produced the biggest win of his career two fights after Shakur Stevenson out-boxed him in their 12-round 130-pound title fight last June 12 at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas.

Nakathila improved to 23-2 and recorded his 19th knockout by winning a main event ESPN televised. Mexico’s Berchellt (38-3 34 KOs) lost by knockout for the third time as a pro.

The 30-year-old Berchelt was almost a 6-1 favorite entering his first fight since his devastating defeat to Oscar Valdez 13 months ago. Berchelt was a 4-1 favorite over Valdez but the shorter boxer battered Berchelt on his way to scoring three knockdowns and viciously knocked him out in the 10th round of their 130-pound championship match in February 2021 at MGM Grand Conference Center in Las Vegas.

Cancun’s Berchelt determined after that lopsided loss that he had to move up from the 130-pound division to the lightweight limit of 135 pounds. Not draining himself to make weight didn’t matter once the bell rang Saturday night.

The 32-year-old Nakathila exploited Berchelt’s defensive deficiencies and continually caught him power punches to his head and body. The sixth round was particularly telling.

Nakathila caught Berchelt with a right hand 1:15 into the sixth round. Mora warned Nakathila for leading with his head with 1:10 to go in the sixth round.

Yet another flush right hand by Nakathila knocked Berchelt’s mouthpiece flying to the canvas. That gave Berchelt a break he desperately needed with 29 seconds on the clock in the sixth round.

After taking a lot of punches in the first four rounds Berchelt backed up Nakathila with a right-left combination 30 seconds into the fifth round. Another left by Berchelt backed Nakathila into the ropes with 55 seconds to go in the fifth round.

Berchelt and Nakathila then traded flush shots to the head during an action-packed final minute of the fifth round.

Nakathila buckled Berchelt’s legs with a right hand 15 seconds into the fourth round. Nakathila got good extension on another right hand with just over a minute on the clock in the fourth round.

A three-punch combination by Nakathila sent Berchelt to the canvas with 1:27 to go in the third round. Berchelt got up but Nakathila wobbled him with a left-right combination with 30 seconds to go in the third round.

Barely 20 seconds into the second round Nakathila caught Berchelt with a right hand. Berchelt began landing his jab during the middle minute of the second round.

Nakathila’s right to the body got Berchelt’s attention with just under a minute remaining in the second round. Several seconds later Nakathila’s flush right hand landed up top.

According to unofficial punch stats Nakathila landed more punches in the first two rounds against Berchelt (31) than he connected with in 12 rounds versus Stevenson (28).

Nakathila missed wildly with several right hands in the first half of the opening round. Nakathila caught Berchelt with a right hand to his temple with about 1:20 to go in the first round.

Nakathila landed another overhand right just before the bell sounded to end the first round.

Sonnen was initially questioned and released by the police immediately following the incident and then had charges related to the situation dismissed without prejudice by a judge. But in mid-march police re-filed a series of charges against Sonnen including a felony count of battery by strangulation and 10 battery misdemeanors.

A civil lawsuit was also filed by Christopher and Julie Stellpflug claiming a seemingly intoxicated Sonnen knocked a drink out of his hand and then attacked him “without provocation or any communication whatsoever.” Sonnen was wandering the hallway of the Four Seasons hotel next to the Mandalay Bay barefoot and wearing a torn bloody t-shirt at the time.

“I just want people to know it was a totally unprovoked attack” Christopher Stellpflug told Las Vegas Review-Journal. “We were just walking into our room to plan a sushi dinner. We did nothing wrong and this guy went on a crazy rampage.”

The lawsuit says another hotel guest had to stop Sonnen from choking Mr. Stellpflug only to get attacked and elbowed in the face. Sonnen then allegedly attacked Mrs. Stellpflug throwing her against a wall and punching her in the face. The filing alleges that several hotel employees were also assaulted by Sonnen including a security guard who was kneed in the face and another who was kicked in the chest.

Metropolitan Police Department reports obtained by the Las Vegas Review-Journal also mention another hotel guest who was attacked before the Stellpflugs. This man claimed he opened his room door and was “randomly struck” in the jaw by Sonnen. He locked himself in his room and called hotel security.

Chael Sonnen was issues five battery citations in Las Vegas on Saturday night after allegedly fighting in a luxury hotel.



The incident was first reported by TMZ and footage of Sonnen being escorted out by police was captured on camera.pic.twitter.com/CARtLbJZzL — Overtime Heroics MMA (@OTHeroicsMMA) December 19 2021

Police reports state that Sonnen’s wife Brittany Sonnen had visible injuries when interviewed but claimed she had taken an Ambien and was in her room sleeping during the events in question.

“I then began to question Brittany on how she obtained her injuries but she was unsure about how she obtained them” an officer wrote in the report according to Las Vegas Review-Journal. “I then further questioned her about any possible domestic disputes or violence between her and her husband where Brittany stated that Chael has never been violent with her.”

Sonnen has been suspended from all ESPN broadcasting duties while the network investigates the situation. A court date has been set for Weds. March 30 2022 regarding the criminal charges files against him."

Mark Lennihan/AP

An ex-Microsoft employee has accused the tech giant of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

In an essay Yasser Elabd claimed his discoveries included millions of dollars in foreign bribes.

Microsoft said it previously fired employees in relation to the claims The WSJ reported Friday.

A former Microsoft employee accused the tech giant of turning a blind eye on employees subcontractors and government operators engaging in bribery.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the story.

In an essay published Friday on Lioness an outlet that documents stories from whistleblowers Yasser Elabd brought to light accusations of Microsoft employees using local partner companies to help sell the company's products to customers.

Microsoft told The WSJ they previously investigated these allegations ""which are many years old"" and added they had terminated employees and partnerships that were part of the investigations.

In 2016 Elabd said he realized a $40000 payment to an African client didn't seem right. With some digging he found out it was a former Microsoft employee who had been terminated for poor performance. He wrote: ""Corporate policy prohibits former employees from working as partners for six months from their departure without special approval.""

Seeking more details from management he claimed that he encountered resistance and realized there was more to it than and decided to look deeper into the Microsoft employees who were orchestrating fake deals.

Microsoft did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of normal working hours.

In the two years that followed he said he did everything in his power to counter the bribes but believed Microsoft was not interested in stopping the payouts. He said he ultimately ended up being fired in June 2018.

In an interview and according to documents reviewed by the WSJ Elabd had a seven-hour meeting with SEC employees in the agency's offices in Washington DC. Following the meeting he submitted more evidence but agency officials said the investigation couldn't go further due to the pandemic.

Elabd estimated that ""a minimum of $200 million each year goes to Microsoft employees partners and government employees"" in bribes. He continued: ""Among the customers who I believe have received this money are government officials in Ghana Nigeria Zimbabwe Qatar and Saudi Arabia.""

Insider previously reported in 2019 on Microsoft agreeing to pay about $25.3 million including a criminal fine to settle US charges it made improper payments that were used to bribe government officials in Hungary and other countries.

Yasser Elabd recruited by Microsoft in 1998 who helped bring the company's products throughout the Middle East and Africa for the next 20 years said that Microsoft is using illegal bribes and kickbacks in the Middle East and Africa.

As director of emerging markets for the Middle East and Africa he was successful and received many promotions.

""But eventually I noticed something strange: many employees younger than me in lower positions were driving luxury cars and purchasing homes sometimes worth millions of dollars. For my part I could not afford to buy a home let alone anything else luxurious despite my career success"" he wrote in an essay published by the whistleblower platform Lioness late on Friday.

""I wondered naively whether these colleagues had families with money -- but if so why would they be working on a Microsoft sales team?""

Elabd said that in 2016 a request came through in the amount of $40000 to accelerate closing a deal in one African country.

""When I looked through the submission I immediately knew something was wrong. The customer did not appear in Microsoft's internal database of potential clients"" he wrote.

""He had been terminated four months earlier for poor performance on the sales team and corporate policy prohibits former employees from working as partners for six months from their departure without special approval"" said Elabd.

The whistleblower escalated the issue to the senior management and the legal and HR teams put a stop to the $40000 spend ""but to my surprise did not look deeper into the Microsoft employees who were orchestrating the fake deal"".

Elabd said he even wrote an email to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and an HR executive and a vice president of the company ""immediately got back in touch with me to say that by escalating the matter to Nadella I had just 'booked a one-way ticket out of Microsoft'.""

Eventually Microsoft put him on a ""performance improvement plan"" even though he was one of the highest performers on the team.

He also brought the reports to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SE) but ""he's seen little action from the agency"".

In a statement to The Verge Microsoft said the company is committed to doing business in a responsible way and ""always encourages anyone to report anything they see that may violate the law our policies or our ethical standards.

""We believe we've previously investigated these allegations which are many years old and addressed them. We cooperated with government agencies to resolve any concerns"" said Becky Lenaburg a VP at Microsoft and deputy general counsel for compliance and ethics.

Elabd said he is not the only person at Microsoft who has alleged corrupt practices.

""I know of five others from various departments who were terminated or pushed to resign for raising flags about inconsistencies in finances"" he alleged.

""In my estimation a minimum of $200 million each year goes to Microsoft employees partners and government employees"" said Elabd.

Microsoft accused by a former employee of paying bribes in Africa and the Middle East said Saturday it has already probed the allegations and fired several employees as a result.

A former Microsoft employee accused the tech giant of corruption in The Wall Street Journal and in an essay posted Friday to the website Lioness which publishes whistleblower accounts.

The employee says he was fired after working for Microsoft from 1998 to 2018 in Africa where he said he saw company employees involved in corrupt practices in several countries in the region.

He said the practices included using local partner companies to help sell Microsoft products.

""We are committed to doing business in a responsible way"" Lenaburg added.

Microsoft ""always encourage(s) anyone to report anything they see that may violate the law our policies or our ethical standards"" she said.

The Journal said the whistleblower employee also warned the US financial watchdog the Securities and Exchange Commission) of his concerns in 2019.

In deposition documents the employee claimed Microsoft had ""engaged for many years in rampant bribery practices"" according to the Journal.

Part of Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare the new service is a collection of technologies for Protected Health Information (PHI) on the cloud. It helps de-identify data for secondary use protect data privacy and generate insights with analytics and AI tools. Heather Jordan Cartwright vice president of health and life sciences at Microsoft highlights different use cases:

Whether you’re blending patient data with population health data sets for AI development and analytics visualizing data for operational efficiencies deploying patient engagement tools for personalized care or querying imaging metadata alongside clinical data using our new DICOMcast feature Azure Health Data Services work with your existing systems.

Azure Health Data Services merges diverse data types in the same data store at the patient level: structured unstructured and imaging data can be searched and queried together using a FHIR structure. Cartwright adds an example of a query from a clinical case scenario:

Give me all the medications prescribed and connected home health device data with all the CT Scan documents and their associated radiology reports for any patient older than 45 with a diagnosis of osteosarcoma over the last 2 years.

Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-launches-azure-health-data-services-to-unify-health-data-and-power-ai-in-the-cloud/

The service an evolved version of Azure API for FHIR offers a FHIR service for the management of clinical data and tools to enable the transformation of data from different formats to FHIR. It includes a DICOM service DICOMcast technology to extract metadata from DICOM instances the option to stream data from MedTech devices and the mapping of unstructured data from clinical notes or health documents to FHIR.

Charles Poulsen healthcare industry CTO at Microsoft Australia highlights the Interoperability of the solution:

For those of us helping build solutions for digital health care the release is very exciting for two reasons: 1) it simplifies and brings together several existing offerings around FHIR HL7 CDA DICOM medical IoT data and unstructured data under a single banner 2) it adds new capabilities like integration with Synapse/PowerBI for analytics over FHIR data and tools to convert unstructured data into FHIR.

Azure Health Data Services pricing is based on structured storage used provisioned throughput and service runtime. Existing Azure API for FHIR customers can continue using the product without change in the pricing structure."

The company said the vaccine produced a strong immune response despite being only about 40% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19.

The vaccine was tested in this age group during the Omicron wave.

Study participants only experienced mild and moderate side effects.

Moderna plans to request authorization for its low-dose COVID-19 vaccine for children younger than 6 after initial results from its clinical trial showed that younger children had a similar immune response to the vaccine as young adults.

If authorized Moderna’s vaccine will be the first to help protect the youngest group of children who have remained vulnerable to infection throughout the pandemic.

The vaccine prevented symptomatic infection in about 44% of children 6 months to 2 years old and 37% of children from 2 to under 6 years old. The company reported no severe cases of COVID-19 and no new side effects.

“People who get vaccinated and boosted are truly protected from severe COVID. I think that will play out to be true in the youngest kids all the way through to the very oldest adults” Paul Burton MD PhD Chief Medical Officer of Moderna told Verywell. “It's great news for parents. I think it's great news for kids as well.”

In a statement on Wednesday the company said it will submit its request to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “in the coming weeks.”

The announcement comes as cases of Omicron subvariant BA.2 pick up in the U.S. and officials weigh whether to authorize a fourth dose of Pfizer and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine for older adults.

Children aged 5 to 11 are currently eligible for Pfizer’s pediatric vaccine. In its announcement Moderna also said it is seeking authorization for its vaccine to be used in adolescents aged 6 to under 12. The Moderna vaccine is currently only authorized for people aged 18 and older.

How Effective Is Moderna's Vaccine for Young Kids?

To test its vaccine Moderna immunized 2500 children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years and 4200 children between the ages of 2 and 6. Both groups were given two shots a month apart.

Rather than compare disease outcomes between the vaccinated and placebo groups as is done in vaccine efficacy trials the researchers performed an immuno-bridging study measuring how well the shots elicited an antibody response. Nearly all the children in this group produced antibodies at the target level Burton said with the youngest children producing a higher level of antibodies.

What Is an Immuno-bridging Study? Immuno-bridging studies allow researchers to assess whether vaccinated individuals mount a sufficient immune response. Researchers can compare antibody levels in different groups—like kids and adults—rather than measure outcomes like severe disease and death which is a lengthier process.

The dosage for kids under 6 is a quarter of that received by adults inoculated with Moderna’s vaccine: 25 micrograms. In the initial open-label study Burton said the company tested both a 50- and 25-microgram dose before moving forward with the latter.



“The fact that these youngest kids are able to mount a very strong immune response really bodes well for long-term protection” Burton said.

The study didn’t show any cases of kids with severe disease so it’s difficult to know precisely how well the vaccine prevents that outcome William Schaffner MD medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) and professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine told Verywell.

However because these children demonstrated a high level of antibodies after vaccination it’s likely that they will be well-protected against severe disease and death Schaffner said.



“We know that the antibody titers that have been evoked have worked well in older children young adults and older adults” he said.

Importantly the study was conducted while Omicron was the primary variant in circulation. The lower efficacy against infection during this period was “as expected” Moderna said consistent with observational data in adults.



Will Young Kids Need Boosters? Because children and young adults appear to respond similarly to the vaccine Burton predicts that children will also need additional doses of vaccine as their initial antibody levels wane over time though it’s too soon to know the best booster strategy for children.

Is It Safe?

Moderna said the side effects from its vaccine were mild or moderate and reported no severe side effects and no deaths. There were also no signs of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) or myocarditis. Myocarditis a type of heart inflammation has been reported in rare cases after vaccination with Moderna and Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines particularly in adolescents.

About 15% of children from 2 to under 6 years had fevers of 100.4 degrees after vaccination and 17% of children 6 months to 2 years old had the same grade fever. Only 0.2% of children in each age group experienced fevers above 104 degrees.

“Sore arms and fevers and things like that seem to be quite in line with the other vaccines that we give children” Schaffner said. “The question will be: Exactly how effective is it?”

Working Towards Vaccinations for All Children

In addition to its application for younger kids Moderna is also requesting emergency use authorization of its vaccine for children aged 6 to under 12. The primary series for this age group would include two 50-microgram shots.



The company added more safety data to its application for adolescents aged 12 to under 18 years which it submitted last year. It is also testing a booster dose for children from 6 months to 11 years old.

As federal regulators review the data Burton said he expects Moderna’s vaccine to be authorized across all age groups this spring or early summer.



“We have teams on it constantly trying to get the data ready and submitted to regulators” Burton said. “This is a huge priority for us.”

What This Means for Families

The FDA typically calls on a panel of outside advisers to review the data and make a recommendation about whether to authorize a vaccine though this is not a requirement. Before the vaccine may be administered the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must also sign off.



Schaffner said he expects the FDA to authorize the vaccine for this age group. If that happens he thinks the CDC’s advisors will weigh how strongly to recommend the vaccine for young children.



“I think there might well be some discussion in that group as to whether it ought to be routinely recommended or as part of what has been called 'shared clinical decision-making'” Schaffner said.



One in 10 parents of children younger than 5 said they would have their child vaccinated “right away” when it becomes available according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey from January.



While children are reported as being less susceptible to severe disease than adults Burton said it’s still important that children get vaccinated as it remains the most surefire way to bolster immune response against infection.



“If little kids get infected it can be severe. They may be hospitalized—thankfully it's at a lower rate—but it's severe” Burton said.

Protecting children can also be beneficial for limiting viral spread more broadly he said.



“This age group kind of acts as a reservoir. If we don't vaccinate them the virus will keep multiplying potentially mutating and then infecting older more vulnerable grannies and grandads” Burton added.

What This Means For You Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine is not yet available for children under 17 years old. Once the company submits its data for younger children it must be reviewed and greenlit by both the FDA and CDC.

It’s looking as though Moderna might be only moderately effective in preventing infection particularly from a highly contagious variant like Omicron in kids under 6 — which was the case for kids 5 to 11 who received the Pfizer vaccine in a study conducted in New York State. But initially at least it appears that one difference between Moderna’s results and Pfizer’s is in terms of the immune response generated. As The Times’s Sharon LaFraniere put it:

Moderna’s two-dose regimen achieved better results than Pfizer’s in boosting the immune systems of young children. Pfizer said in December that after two doses of its vaccine children aged 6 months to 2 produced antibody levels comparable to those of older teenagers and young adults. But children ages 2 through 4 produced only 60 percent of the sought-after antibody response. After two doses of Moderna’s vaccine the antibody response of children in both subsets compared favorably to that of people 18 to 25 meeting the trial’s primary criterion for success.

And according to Moderna no children in its trial experienced severe illness or hospitalization or died.

Honestly sorting through all of this information is incredibly confusing even for me and I have been covering this for months speaking to quite a few infectious-disease pediatricians along the way. If my children were still under 5 I wouldn’t hesitate to get them vaccinated because I’m generally very confident about vaccine safety. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation which has been tracking vaccine attitudes and uptake over time in February 21 percent of parents with children under 5 shared my faith in these shots and were ready and willing to get a vaccine for their kids immediately after it is approved. (This is down from 31 percent in January.)

But I’m concerned about that other 79 percent. I worry that the level of confusion among many parents and the underwhelming vaccine efficacy among little kids reported for both Pfizer’s and Moderna’s will lead to continued vaccine skepticism when shots are finally rolled out for little kids — even more than when older kids were first able to get shots.",,,,,,,,,

Although the last shipments of the clear wine cooler alternative went out in December of 2021 there was still ample enough stock for them to remain on the market for some time.

There was also a hint of hope that some other distributor could be found in time so that the flow of Zima into Japan would not be disrupted. However by late March it would appear that all flavors in both bottles and cans appear to have been sold out on the Zima Store Amazon page with no sign of more coming in sight.

▼ Little did Mr. Sato know last November that this was the last Zima he would ever have

As is often the case when a popular product goes off the market online resellers started posting them on auction sites and flea market apps at increased prices. On Japan’s popular flea market app Mercari there are numerous accounts selling bottles and cans of Zima with an average price of roughly 500 yen (US$4.11) a bottle which is about twice as much as the retail price was.

It’s still early however and as the resale supply also begins to shrink we can expect prices to go up further assuming there’s enough demand between now and whenever those drinks expire. Some accounts appear to be anticipating a rush and are already selling at hugely inflated prices such as a set of four bottles for 9999 yen (US$82).

What’s interesting about all this is that I never knew it was legal for people to sell alcohol over a flea market app without some sort of license. According to Mercari’s guidelines individuals are permitted to sell alcohol as long as it’s a one-time deal.

In other words people who acquired alcohol with the intention of personal use but who no longer wish to consume it themselves are allowed to sell it. However if a person is found to sell alcohol repeatedly especially of the same type like Zima then they are considered a liquor retailer and are required to have the proper license to sell through the app.

▼ I do like that sign though… Man I got to stay away from these apps.

So perhaps that one person selling four bottles for nearly 10000 yen is playing it smart since they won’t get many chances to sell this way. It’s also a sign that any Zima lovers in Japan aching for one last taste may want to act now before it becomes worth its weight in clear effervescent gold.

Mondelez International is celebrating a milestone this year with the 110th birthday of everyone’s favorite cookie snack Oreo.

Oreo the world’s number one cookie and the best tasting sandwich was first introduced in 1912 and has become a favorite of consumers around the globe.

Oreo has long been the snack that inspires playfulness among the family for the past 110 years with its delicious and high-quality taste.

In the Philippines Oreo is strengthening its relevance to Filipino families by providing playful moments of connection and accessibility.

Oreo is set to launch new flavors and affordability to support more playful moments with the family on top of the “twist lick and dunk” tradition of enjoying the cookie.

Criselle Villafuerte Mondelez Philippines Inc. Senior Marketing Manager for Biscuits said Oreo has become a part of many bonding moments for Filipino families.

“Oreo is our biggest brand here in the Philippines. It’s not just adults it’s really the entire family. Mom Dad Ate Kuya. One of the reasons why people love Oreo is it’s a people brand and a people product” shared Villafuerte.

Villafuerte said Oreo has been ranked as number one globally because it is the best tasting sweet sandwich made of high-quality ingredients couple with the right sweetness in the filling.

“So it’s a perfect combination. You have a great product high-quality ingredient and then the experience of eating it is also fun and playful” she said.

According to Villafuerte Oreo has brought families closer together because it inspires playfulness.

“What the brand stands for. It’s about being playful. It’s about making helping families connect with each other. All the initiative is centered on this playful campaign” she said.

Even during the pandemic Villafuerte said families were able to enioy Oreo as a favorite snack or baking ingredient.

“Our business was hit by the pandemic but despite that we remain an vital part of the Filipino household. We offer playful moments especially during those pandemic where we need time to step away from work pause break and have that playful moment and that’s basically what happened to the brand” she said.

“We are still very much a part of the Filipino consumers’ life and that’s why this year as part of our 110th celebration we want make sure that Oreo is more affordable and more accessible to all Filipinos ” Villafuerte said.

Oreo recently launched its P7.60 per pack snack available in sari-sari stores the extended panty of consumers so families can easily grab a snack anytime they want at an affordable price.

Oreo also introduced new flavors aside from the classic flavors of vanilla chocolate and strawberry.

“We know consumers want variety and that’s why every year we also introduce seasonal flavors. This year we are coming up with two flavors. Right now we have red velvet available in the market but in the second half watch out for more interesting flavors that people will love” Villafuerte said.

Oreo kicked off its 110th celebration with the Save Dads. Make them Play. campaign early this year.

“It’s all about making Dads play because we want to see Dads have a bonding moment with their kid and their families” Villafuerte said.",,,,,,,,,

Companies with high profits and revenue per employee are presumed to be the most successful. Alphabet Microsoft and Meta Platforms owner of Facebook are such companies. These tech companies are among the largest in the United States based on revenue and they are among the youngest large companies. Several were founded in the past 25 years. However a group of relatively small companies leads the list of highest profit per employee.

Data for the recent “Profit per Employee” research paper from software company Tipalti came from the Fortune 500. The paper examined 914 major companies most of which made a profit per employee in the last year. Only 238 reported a loss per employee. The company that has the most profits per employee is Air Lease. The company reported $516 million in profits or $4.3 million per employee.

Air Lease with an employee count of 120 buys passenger planes and leases them to airlines. The process allows carriers that do not have capital access to planes. Air Lease makes its profit largely off the interest it charges these carriers. The company was hurt by the trouble with the aviation industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic but its financials have started to recover.

When the company announced its 2021 results John L. Plueger chief executive officer and president commented: “We had a strong fourth quarter and second half of 2021 that benefited from continuing airline industry recovery as seen in our cash collections operating metrics fleet expansion and record lease placement.”

Air Lease owns 474 planes that it leases to 118 customers in 60 countries. The company is based in Los Angeles. (See if Air Lease is also among the 50 best companies to work for.)

To find the 50 companies with the most profits per employee 24/7 Wall St. reviewed Tipalti’s “Profit per Employee” research paper. Very few of the companies with the highest profit per employee are large tech companies. Meta is highest among these ranking 11th with a profit of nearly $500000 per employee based on over 58000 workers. Several financial firms are ahead of Meta.

Mortgage giant Fannie Mae has profit of $1.5 million per employee based on 7700 workers. This places it second on the list. The third is private equity firm KKR at $1.3 million per employee based on 1583 workers. (Find out if any of the companies on this list were also among the most innovative companies in 2021.)

But as inflows to climate-focused funds accelerate more questions are being asked about the investing approaches of these portfolios.

What type of companies are held in climate-focused portfolios? Can you fully assess a company’s impact on the environment by looking at its carbon emissions metrics alone? And how does a climate-focused fund contribute to global efforts to accelerate decarbonization?

Investors often seek simple metrics to determine which companies are “good actors” in the fight against climate change. The most common metric for evaluating a company’s environmental impact is the carbon footprint—total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by business activities. But a carbon footprint doesn’t tell the whole story of a company’s impact and can also be misleading. There are many other ways for companies to promote a transition to a low-carbon world that simply won’t register in carbon footprint data. And there are many ways for companies to lower a carbon footprint that don’t help in tackling climate change.

So how can investors gain confidence that an equity portfolio is invested in companies that are really helping to address climate risk? Instead of focusing exclusively on a company’s carbon footprint we believe investors should look at a company’s carbon handprint. In contrast to a carbon footprint which measures the negative impact of a company’s operations on the environment a carbon handprint measures the positive impact or carbon avoided by using a company’s products. These products represent the positive solutions to global climate challenges created by a company. From clean energy to recycling transportation to energy efficiency diverse companies with a big carbon handprint are making major contributions to solving the world’s climate crisis.

Applying the Carbon Handprint Principle

There are different ways to quantify a carbon handprint for each solution group. But across solutions—among them agriculture clean energy transportation and energy efficiency—the unifying principal that anchors our analysis is how much carbon is avoided.

This metric becomes the lens for identifying and evaluating a carbon handprint. For example clean energy companies will be judged on the amount of zero-carbon energy generated while resource efficiency companies are ranked on their ability to save energy for other companies and entities.

In this paper we present case studies that show how to apply a carbon handprint analysis. Consider Schneider Electric a French multinational company that provides energy management systems to help buildings data centers and industrial facilities reduce their emissions. These technologies helped companies avoid 45 million metric tons of CO2 emissions in 2020—85 times more than Schneider’s emissions during the same year (Display). Vestas Wind Systems a Danish manufacturer of wind turbines generated 73000 metric tons of CO2 through its manufacturing processes in 2020 but will enable its customers to reduce carbon emissions by 45 times more than that annually over the next 20 years.

Disclosure of carbon avoided is not an industry standard. As a result investors can’t rely on company reports or third-party rating agencies to understand how much carbon is avoided through climate solutions. By actively engaging with management and conducting independent research we believe investors can obtain the information needed to measure a company’s carbon handprint accurately and convincingly. Establishing a clear carbon handprint metric allows investors to assess how a company is contributing to the fight against climate change and how its contribution is evolving over time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGxpYW5jZWJlcm5zdGVpbi5jb20vY29ycG9yYXRlL2VuL2luc2lnaHRzL2ludmVzdG1lbnQtaW5zaWdodHMvZXZvbHZpbmctdGhvdWdodHMtb24tZXNnLXRoZS1jYXNlLWZvci1lbmVyZ3ktYW5kLWRlZmVuc2Utc3RvY2tzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ESG Angles: The Case for Energy and Defense Stocks,"Even as some investors shift their environmental social and governance (ESG) views on energy and defense stocks amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine we think it’s sensible to stick to core ESG principles in identifying responsible companies. In this case it means firms that can contribute to the West’s quest for energy independence and military deterrence.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will have lasting implications for investors in many areas. For example energy independence is now seen as an essential goal for the US and Europe. And defense spending in the West is likely to grow to ensure that countries are adequately prepared to cope with potential threats.

These changes have challenged prevailing norms for some investors focused on ESG issues as they evolve their attitudes to recognize the necessity and value these industries create along with their negatives. Indeed S&P 500 energy stocks surged by 42.3% in the first quarter through March 25 while the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense industry group rallied 13.5% over the same period.

Energy Security in the Spotlight

The Russia-Ukraine war amounts to a monumental shift in the world order challenging the trend toward globalization over at least four decades. Some political pundits say Russian president Vladimir Putin chose to attack Ukraine now due to high oil and gas prices which put Russia in a position of economic strength vis–à–vis the West. It’s also been said that the decarbonization push helped boost energy prices by deterring investment in fossil fuel production. Whether or not that’s true it’s now painfully clear that countries and regions need adequate access to traditional sources of energy while they plot the course for a green energy future.

Now gas prices at the pump have soared in the US. Natural gas prices in Europe which relied on Russian supply have also jumped. Energy prices have fluctuated wildly driven up by war news and falling back when headlines project hopes for a ceasefire. Whatever happens it’s now clear that energy self-sufficiency is vital for the US and will require oil and gas during the transition to renewables as well as more investment in low-carbon energy sources in the coming years.

Investors taking a long-term view should look for energy companies with robust businesses and responsible behavior. We believe high-quality energy groups that can generate solid profit margins with oil prices at much lower levels than today are well positioned to benefit in the current environment but can still thrive if the current crisis is resolved and prices fall back.

Many energy companies are making efforts to meet best-practice sustainability standards. Select energy producers and utilities that are investing in renewables can offer transition opportunities helping to meet the short-term need for oil and gas as well as rising demand for wind and solar energy. Active investors should engage with energy groups to ensure they manage the energy transition appropriately improve disclosures and reduce carbon emissions from activities generated by their operations.

Defense as a Necessity for Democratic Society

It’s easy to understand why the defense industry was avoided by many investors in a world attuned to ESG issues. Defense companies make products that kill people which are often sold to bad actors.

Now as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky seeks weapons support from the West defense contractors are playing a crucial role for defending democracy—a basic ESG human rights goal. However defense spending is close to the lowest level as a percentage of GDP over the last 40 years at 3.7% of GDP for the US and 2.4% globally according to the World Bank.

Putin has pushed us back in time to a world where peace was not a given. The unprovoked war has made many governments aware of the limits of soft power—and the need for military might to safeguard our values and societies.

Nothing symbolizes the shift in sentiment more than Germany’s pledge to double its defense budget to €100 billion this year—a huge change for a country that has strictly limited defense spending since World War II. And Germany’s recent decision to order 35 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin is just the beginning. These moves show how the Russia-Ukraine war on the doorstep of Western Europe is changing public opinion toward the defense industry.

Shares of defense companies tend to hold up relatively well in downturns; they’re likely to be resilient in a recession because of the acyclic nature of defense spending. Investors taking a fresh look at the industry should verify that companies aren’t manufacturing controversial weapons such as cluster munitions or chemical and biological weapons. Business ethics are another important ESG area of focus in an industry where companies have historically violated corruption and anti-bribery laws. Companies should have robust processes to prevent illegal sales and minimize the abuse of their products.

Rethinking ESG Issues: Three Points to Ponder

Changing attitudes toward these industries highlight three important issues related to the integration of ESG in investment processes.

1. Don’t forget the ‘S’ in ESG: Investors often give priority to environmental issues but social issues are also part of the ESG equation. Skyrocketing energy prices are a tax on consumers that can hurt lower-income households disproportionately. And safeguarding democracy is an imperative for every society that values freedom.

2. ESG issues evolve; ESG integration should remain a pillar: While some investors may be rethinking their stance on energy and defense given recent developments we believe ESG integration should remain a consistent thorough framework that considers the complex nuances of ESG issues.

3. Exclusion precludes engagement: Excluding entire sectors and industries from portfolios precludes active managers from engaging with these issuers to encourage more responsible business practices. Investors should understand the limitations of labeling an entire sector or industry “good” or “bad.”

By keeping these three principles in mind we believe investors can deploy a much more thoughtful approach toward integrating ESG research in portfolios. The recent impetus for energy and defense stocks is likely to persist as the world adjusts to changes provoked by the Russia-Ukraine war.

We believe investors should focus on energy and defense companies that have attractive valuations strong cash flows capital return and business advantages while using ESG research to identify businesses that behave more responsibly than their peers. And given the turbulence in equity markets we strongly believe that a flexible investing approach is vital in adapting to changing market conditions."
MOS,Mosaic Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZGN0aGVhdGVyYXJ0cy5vcmcvMjAyMi8wMy8yNy9hLWdyaXBwaW5nLWFuZC1lbGVjdHJpYy1wcml2YXRlLWFzdG91bmRzLWF0LW1vc2FpYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A gripping and electric 'Private' astounds at Mosaic,"It’s as if the playwright has scripted the subtext of every relational betrayal and said all the quiet parts out loud.

There came a point during the performance I attended of this grippingly crafted and deftly acted play when fraught silences between the two main characters were met by the stark stillness of a motionless audience holding its collective breath. That rapt attention — in swaths of quiet thick with tension — was an experience in theater unlike any I can recall. Partly we were hanging on these two people’s every word caught up in their conflict wondering who would speak next what could possibly be said. And partly it was as if we were all of us privy to a trust rupture between them that was so private and personal we had no right to witness it.

Mona Pirnot’s play Private — now playing at Mosaic Theater and one of the most electrifying new works I have seen on any stage — parses the word private in two fascinating ways: In a macro sense the play is set in a future saturated by so much surveillance that citizens must take out privacy insurance in the event their personal data gets leaked. In a micro sense the play ruthlessly dissects what happens in a relationship between two once loving and loyal married thirtysomethings — he Corbin a product engineer and she Georgia an aspiring musician — when a lie between them breaches the foundations of their relationship and a question erupts about how much personal privacy each should have from the other.

Here’s a peephole view of the abyss that opens between them.

GEORGIA: What else have you lied to me about?

CORBIN: Nothing. I

GEORGIA: If you lied about this you’ve lied about other things

CORBIN: I really haven’t

GEORGIA: You’re lying right now

CORBIN: I’m not. I can’t think of any/thing.

GEORGIA: How can I believe you now?

(Beat)

CORBIN: Georgia

GEORGIA: This isn’t who I thought you were

CORBIN: You know who I am

GEORGIA: Do I? I don’t know

It’s as if Pirnot has scripted the subtext of every relational betrayal and said all the quiet parts out loud.

The main two characters whose dramatic arcs ensnare us are played by two exquisitely well-matched actors: Georgia’s razor-sharp mind finds expression in a riveting performance by Tẹmídayọ Amay and Eric Berryman wears Corbin’s earnest desire to please like a comfortable sweater. In the tight timing of their terse lines can be discerned an actors’ rapport that undergirds even their characters’ sharpest ripostes. The connected conviction in their scene work astounds the stage.

The dialog-rich action takes place on Scenic Designer Luciana Stecconi’s spare set a yellowish soft-surfaced nonspecific space that becomes by turns two apartments and a workplace. In the ceiling Lighting Designer Masha Tsimring positions fluorescents that signal location shifts. It all works seamlessly.

At the beginning we are in Georgia and Corbin’s living room. Corbin costumed by Danielle Preston in nerdy glasses and high-waisted trousers arrives home having been offered a job in a startup that would mean twice as much income as they have now. The catch is that his employer would have to know and own their privacy — there would be algorithms literally listening in on everything. Georgia whom we meet barefoot in waist-length braids and sleek sylphlike loungewear will have none of it. Their casual affection is apparent but Georgia is adamant: Corbin must negotiate out of the privacy package or turn down the job.

Thus is set in motion a storyline that engrosses at every turn.

At the workplace where Corbin might get that job he tries to cut a deal with the boss’s assistant Abbey a way around the privacy stipulation. Sophie Schulman captures Abbey’s chirpy chattiness exactly. Later we find Georgia in the apartment of her longtime friend Jordan whom she asks for help in her music career. In the likable ease with which Ben Katz plays Jordan it’s not hard to see why he may know Georgia better than Corbin does.

The spacious nondescript set becomes marvelously metaphorical at times as when Georgia cozies up in a corner cornered or when Georgia and Corbin are far left and far right as if kept apart by the chasm between them.

And the pacing and timing in this show are astonishing. It is a precise and complex score — from staccato crosstalk to a raging aria of a monologue to voids of silence so full of unspoken feeling it almost aches — and kudos for conducting it go to Director Knud Adams.

When Georgia and Corbin’s relationship is most tested most distressed she breaks a silence with a line that just blew my mind:

GEORGIA: I don’t know how to have this conversation or any conversation with you when we have an audience

Georgia means of course the surveillance system to which she and Corbin are inescapably subject. She knows there’s technology tracking every word they say and she does not want to be overheard. But the line also lands with us the audience in the house startling us into realizing what extraordinary intimacy we have been let in on.

Tom Cody / Project^

In the fall of 2020 just after the Almeda Fire had devastated the Rogue Valley Tom Cody traveled through the burn zone. Driving along Highway 99 he witnessed block after block of destruction — homes businesses apartments and RV parks reduced to ash and rubble. Cody founder and managing partner at Project^ a Portland-based real estate development firm felt compelled to help rebuild.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

If all goes according to plan his new apartment development will break ground in Medford this summer. But MOSAIC is no ordinary construction project; instead the 148 units will be built in a modular factory then trucked to the site. The project is being funded in part by a state initiative aimed at helping communities recover from the Labor Day fires of 2020. It’s also an experiment aimed at tackling multiple issues at once: rising material costs a severe shortage of construction labor and an urgent need for housing for working families and fire victims.

The devastating fires that torched off in September 2020 destroyed over 4000 homes in at least nine Oregon counties. Between the Almeda and South Obenchain fires Jackson County suffered the worst impacts. More than 2300 dwellings were lost many of them manufactured homes and RVs.

“The fires burned through where our most vulnerable populations live: retirees older people Latinx and working people” says Rep. Pam Marsh D-Ashland who represents southern Jackson County. “Where we are now is an example of climate injustice.”

The fires exacerbated what was already a dearth of affordable and workforce housing in the Rogue Valley.

Housing for the ‘missing middle’

Through the governor’s office Cody learned about the state’s push to find innovative ways to deliver new projects quickly including modular prefabrication. He was already developing a modular apartment project for Bend — a first for his company — so he decided to apply the same concept to a new wildfire relief project in the Rogue Valley.

“My attitude is it’s always easier to talk about something if you have a case study” says Cody.

He started looking for land for the development initially focusing on those in the burn zone. Soon Cody learned about an undeveloped 7.5-acre property owned by Ivanko Gardens Apartments. Last spring Project^ purchased the property a long narrow parcel tucked between a residential neighborhood and an apartment complex in northeast Medford.

In June of 2021 the Oregon Legislature approved a $600 million dollar package which included $150 million for wildfire recovery housing supply and land acquisition. As part of that funding then-Rep. Brian Clem D-Salem chair of the House Special Committee on Wildfire Recovery championed an initiative called Oregonians Rebuilding Oregon.

“The original idea was to provide temporary shelters for fire victims that could be repurposed possibly for those experiencing homelessness” says Clem. The initiative would also create economic activity in the state by requiring the units to be built by Oregon companies and labor and possibly use lumber salvaged from burned roadways.

Marsh who also served on the House committee thought the MOSAIC project was a “perfect fit.”

“It’s really hard to develop workforce housing in the Rogue Valley” says Marsh. Subsidies and incentives are not available for projects in the “missing middle” between affordable and market-rate housing. From a developer’s standpoint it’s hard to make them pencil out.

Project^ negotiated with Oregon Housing and Community Services on the terms of a $10 million loan which was offered at 0% for the first 24 months and 1% thereafter. In exchange 100% of MOSAIC’s apartments must be marketed as workforce housing. The units will be available to those who earn at or below 120% of area median income and rates will be set so households don’t pay more than 30% of their income on rent.

“We wouldn’t be doing MOSAIC in Medford were it not for OHCS” Cody says.

Another stipulation is that the units must be built in Oregon. Cody is negotiating with a company in Klamath Falls called InteliFab to produce the structures. If all goes according to plan says Cody MOSAIC will cost 30% less and will be built 40% faster than a conventional multifamily project.

Prefab solution?

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

Prefabricated modular construction or “prefab” can save both time and materials says John Mick owner of InteliFab. The modules can be framed while the sites are being excavated and concrete foundations poured and work can carry on without weather delays. Extensive preplanning can also help managers catch errors before construction begins.

MOSAIC will consist of nine three-story buildings and will include one two and three-bedroom floorplans. Amenities such as kids’ play areas will be tailored for working families. The project will be built to Earth Advantage Platinum a green building standard that addresses five “pillars” of sustainability: energy health land materials and water.

Modules are built using conventional light-wood construction methods and while machines supplement human labor the process in not so different from site-built construction says Mick. “The biggest difference an employee sees is that they are less impacted by weather and their job is always in the same place.”

Modular methods also reduce the carbon footprint of construction says Cody in part because building material deliveries to the site are drastically reduced.

Going modular can also potentially speed up the permitting process. While projects must seek land use approvals and permits for site improvements from the local jurisdiction most of the building permitting happens in the factory at the state level. Oregon also offers a “master permit” for prefabricated construction.

“If you get permitted for a particular building you can use it on multiple sites” explains Cody. Project^ intends to use module plans approved for the Bend project in Medford. Modular construction also offers flexibility says Cody. Once cranes swing the factory-built modules into place on site siding and roofing will be installed selected to best fit the character of the neighborhood.

The need to innovate

There is great demand for housing across the state especially affordable and workforce housing says Greg Wolf executive director at Oregon iSector a nonprofit that supports public-private partnerships that are addressing various community challenges.

“We really have a serious problem here in Oregon” says Wolf. “We’re tied for last in having [the] worst housing deficit in the country.”

According to Wolf Oregon underbuilt 150000 homes between 2000 and 2015 and the state must build at least 29000 units a year just to keep up with demand. A severe labor shortage gaps in the supply chain and growing homeless population are worsening the crisis.

In some regions the housing shortage is directly impacting economies says Wolf. On the coast for example while vacation rentals proliferate people in service industries like teaching and firefighting can’t afford to work and live in their communities.

To tackle these issues the Oregon iSector’s board of directors is spearheading an effort called the Housing Innovation Partnership which launched late last year. Composed of representatives from public private and civic organizations from across the state its main objective is to identify innovative approaches that help build housing more quickly and affordably. Marsh and Megan Loeb senior program officer at the Oregon Community Foundation are co-convening the effort.

Working groups have formed to tackle different issues—financing models and modular housing for example. Cody is part of a group studying incentives that could help make workforce housing projects viable. Ultimately the partnership will develop an “innovation agenda” they can present to the Oregon Legislature in 2023.

Several promising ideas are already cropping up. The Port of Portland for example is exploring the possibility of building a modular housing manufacturing facility that utilizes cross-laminated timber panels. These strong but lightweight panels are composed of layers of solid wood that are glued together. They can be made from small-diameter trees including those thinned to improve the health of Oregon forests.

In Eastern Oregon the towns of Lakeview Burns and John Day are partnering in a new intergovernmental agency aimed at spurring new housing in part by utilizing 3D-printing technology to build foundations and walls. A lack of quality housing stifles economic development in these towns but they lack the labor to build enough new housing quickly. By teaming up they hope to garner enough resources to build 100 houses in each community over the next five years.

A test case in Medford

Back in Medford MOSAIC will be a test case to see if alternative construction methods can get units on the ground more quickly. Cody hopes the project can break ground this summer but it will depend on scaling up a manufacturer like InteliFab to build the boxes.

“There’s currently no modular builder or factory in Oregon that is capable of building the modules yet we have this state requirement [to build them in Oregon]” says Cody. “That is our biggest challenge right now.”

InteliFab is in the process of shifting its operations from panelized construction to modular prefabrication. To that end the company has enrolled four current and two new employees in a 12-week basic construction skills course at Klamath Community College (KCC). WorkSource Oregon will reimburse InteliFab for half of the cost of tuition. Employees will see a wage increase once they complete the course.

“We have to start doing something different on the housing front” says Marsh who wrote a letter urging the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission to provide grant funding for KCC’s training program. “If we keep just swinging hammers we’ll never get ahead.”

The Upright Citizens Brigade plans to reopen theaters and training centers under new management in coming months Deadline reports. The renowned comedy brand has been bought by Mike McAvoy the Onion’s former CEO and owner and Mosaic talent-management company founder Jimmy Miller. McAvoy will reportedly serve as CEO of the new UCB entity while Miller will serve as chairman. Elysian Park Ventures a private investment firm led by the owners of the L.A. Dodgers also provided financial backing for the acquisition.

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic UCB laid off all of its theater staff on both coasts in a move that many performers and staffers felt was handled poorly by co-founders Amy Poehler Matt Besser Matt Walsh and Ian Roberts. In April 2020 the UCB theater in Hell’s Kitchen and the UCB Training Center on Eighth Avenue shut down marking the end of an official space for UCB in New York. Eight months later in December 2020 the co-founders announced the closure of the Sunset Theater in Los Angeles. In a letter addressed to the UCB community they said that the organization was pursuing nonprofit status for its theater and school. The letter also stated that UCB would be working with Project Rethink an initiative launched by a group of veteran BIPOC performers; community members had also raised general concerns about mismanagement and systemic racism within UCB.

McAvoy told Deadline that there are many “great plans” for the relaunch of UCB. “Our first priority is to reopen theaters and training centers in Los Angeles and New York with diversity equality and inclusion front and center” he said. “The additional resources at our disposal will enable us to pay performers for stage time and enhance the UCB 4 Scholarship Program which will continue to aid underprivileged students.” Reportedly UCB’s new management will work with the Arts Consulting Group a third-party firm that has consulted the UCB community on diversity initiatives including the creation of an HR department and the formation of a committee to oversee and execute diversity equity and inclusion initiatives.

Project Rethink said in a statement that it encouraged UCB4 to hire the Arts Consulting Group in order to help UCB “become a safer and more inclusive theater.” The group added that over the past year it made significant progress toward creating a sustainable business model but said that “the landscape changed significantly” once the offer of a sale was on the table. According to Project Rethink Elysian Park Ventures expressed interest in collaboration. “We met earlier this year to discuss what a partnership might look like” the statement said. “But after a lot of consideration Project Rethink has decided to dissolve and step away from consulting with this new business venture. Best of luck to the new owners.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWh5cGVtYWdhemluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy9mYW1lZC1jb21lZHktdGhlYXRlci11Y2ItdG8tcmVvcGVuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Famed Comedy Theater UCB to Reopen The Hype Magazine: Unveiling the Pulse of Urban Culture - From Hip Hop to ...,"Famed Comedy Theater UCB to Reopen

Jimmy Miller founder of talent management company Mosaic and Mike McAvoy former CEO/Owner of The Onion with financial support from Elysian Park Ventures have acquired Upright Citizens Brigade one of the most well-known comedy brands in the entertainment business. As part of the acquisition they plan on reopening theaters in the coming months as well as completely rebuilding the business including providing additional support and opportunities for comedic talent and continuing UCB’s efforts to create a more diverse and inclusive environment.

“We are pleased to be handing over the reins to Jimmy and Mike in the hopes the theater and school will continue to be a thriving environment for all who want to learn and perform comedy.” said the UCB 4’s Amy Poehler Matt Besser Ian Roberts and Matt Walsh. “We look forward to the ways they will commit to increasing diversity and ensure the continued existence of an organization we have loved and dedicated ourselves to for over 20 years.”

“We are very excited to reopen theaters and get back to putting improvisers of all walks of life on stage” said Jimmy Miller. “I look forward to helping Mike and the team with their efforts – I look at the UCB theater and school as another great client. To be clear about my interest in this – I love comedy I love improv and I love UCB. I want to be sure that this business continues and thrives for 20 more years and beyond. While this will be a separate business from Mosaic it is my hope that synergies will be found that provide overall value support and stage time to as many performers as possible regardless of representation.”

“I’m thankful for the opportunity to help lead one of the most respected and influential comedy institutions through its next set of challenges and opportunities” said Mike McAvoy. “We have many great plans we can’t yet talk about in detail but our first priority is to reopen theaters and training centers in Los Angeles and New York with diversity equality and inclusion front and center. The additional resources at our disposal will enable us to pay performers for stage time and enhance The UCB 4 Scholarship Program which will continue to aid underprivileged students.”

Miller will serve as chairman and McAvoy will serve as CEO with Miller bringing a long history of success in the comedy world having represented some of the biggest names in comedy.

New management of UCB will also work with Arts Consulting Group a third party firm that has been in consultation with members of the UCB community on a variety of diversity initiatives including HR department creation and the formation of a special committee to oversee and execute clear ongoing and actionable diversity equity and inclusion plans.

Further details around what this acquisition means for the UCB community will be shared in the coming months as well as general updates. For more information please visit https://ucbcomedy.com/.

The BRIC Promise

Bloomberg









When Jim O’Neill devised the BRIC acronym at the turn of the century the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief economist did not intend the catchy phrase to be exploited for marketing investment funds Money managers scrambled to start funds anyway. The likes of Schroders Plc and Franklin Templeton -- along with Goldman Sachs Asset Management -- gobbled up billions of dollars from clients looking to profit by combining investments in Brazil Russia India and China. That marketing ploy has come crashing down and now faces an existential crisis.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made the former uninvestable with MSCI Inc. removing it from benchmarks including the BRIC Index. China which represents a major slice of this benchmark is also slowing and has embarked on an unprecedented crackdown on technology companies that has led to sharp losses.BRIC funds have lost 14.6% this year while their combined assets have slumped by more than 90% from their peak to about $3 billion according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The collapse holds a ruthless lesson for investors on the perils of thematic funds. Combining four diverse complex and risky emerging market countries in a fund was clever wordplay but not a smart bet. While the economies grew rapidly as predicted by O’Neill stocks had mixed fortunes. The MSCI BRIC index now trails the S&P 500 over this century and even lags behind the total returns for individual indexes for the four countries.“Do not confuse the BRIC concepts” O’Neill said in an interview. “My whole purpose of creating the acronym has nothing to do with investment.”Russia’s war has of course wider consequences. The ongoing devastation on the ground in Ukraine has triggered market volatility globally. Commodity prices have surged in response to sanctions imposed by Western countries to isolate the country. That has sparked inflationary fears for big commodity and energy consumers and importers such as India and China.The market turmoil has even hurt hedge funds that are designed to prosper in both rising and falling markets with money managers such as Autonomy Capital Research H2O Asset Management and EDL Global Opportunities facing double-digit slumps. Many have been forced to mark Russian bets to zero.O’Neill’s paper “Building Better Global Economic BRICs” was published on Nov. 30 2001 and focused on how the global economy would be driven by the growth of emerging markets in the following decades. He argued that policymaking forums such as the Group of Seven should be re-organized to incorporate BRIC representatives. Fund managers took notice. Two of the largest surviving funds Schroder International Selection Fund - BRIC and Templeton BRIC Fund  started in 2005 while Goldman Sachs launched its own fund the next year. The Schroder fund grew to more than $4 billion while Templeton’s money pool amassed $3.3 billion by 2010.But the second decade of the century started to take shine off and now they’ve reached a calamity. The Schroder fund which was managing $710 million at the end of February has declined almost 16% this year according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Templeton’s $450 million fund has slipped more than 14% after it marked Russian American depository receipts to zero when Russia’s markets closed according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Goldman Sachs meanwhile closed its money-losing BRIC fund in 2015 and merged it with a broader emerging-market fund joining a string of others to take similar decisions. Bloomberg tracks only 74 surviving BRIC funds now. The same number have shuttered over the years while dozens have been acquired or delisted Bloomberg data shows.BRIC funds’ long-term performance pales in comparison to U.S. stocks which were powered by quantitative easing and the surge in technology stocks over the past decade or so.But to Chetan Sehgal portfolio manager of Templeton BRIC Fund the grouping still offers long-term value even without Russia. Resource- and energy-rich Brazil could benefit from an ex-Russia world he said. “Though China has slowed down its path will very much depend on how it navigates the external environment as many of the internal reforms have already been enacted” he added.To others though the concept has lost its charm. Ed Park the chief investment officer at U.K. wealth manager Brooks Macdonald said Russia is uninvestable Brazil has lots of political risk and his firm can get exposure to China outside BRIC funds. “I don’t see us investing in BRIC as a concept in the medium term” he said. “The economic drivers of the constituents are not as correlated as when the term was coined and some of the countries we would choose to actively avoid.”As for O’Neill he stands by the idea that these economies are growing in size and influence. “Despite the problems that Brazil and Russia have because of the enormous success of China if you look at where they all are together it is still feasible that by the mid 2030s the BRICs could be bigger than the G6” he said.Still he said he’s never invested in a BRIC fund and never will.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This article is the written version of a video presentation which can be viewed here:

Bitcoin is outdated. Bitcoin is too slow. Bitcoin is too simple.

Chances are you’ve heard one of these arguments or maybe even made some of these claims yourself.

With bitcoin sitting around $40000 at the time of this video many people feel as though they have missed the boat. “If I just could have gotten in at $10 $100 or even $1000” they think “then I’d be set for life.”

The truth of course is not so simple. In reality if you would have bought bitcoin at $10 you likely would have sold right around $20 and then bragged to your friends about your 100% gains. Or maybe you would have ended up like this guy:

Image source: embedded video

It takes a special — maybe even a bit crazy — type of person to sit on 300000% unrealized gains. Chances are you’re not that guy. This then brings us to a very important point. It is not about when you buy; it’s about why you buy. Many people who first got into bitcoin over a decade ago remain broke while many others who just a few years ago began religiously stacking sats are sitting comfortably. The difference lies entirely in philosophy.

And chances are if you’re searching for “the next bitcoin” you have a flawed philosophy. You likely suffer from one of the following conditions:

You don’t fully understand Bitcoin’s purpose.

You don’t fully understand bitcoin’s upside.

Or you don’t fully understand what makes Bitcoin special.

The focus of this article will be on the third condition.

What makes Bitcoin special is not simply the fact that it was the first cryptocurrency. When it comes to Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage many people like to bring up the fates of MySpace and Yahoo. However this comparison is a common fallacy and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of what Bitcoin really is.

Instead of thinking of Bitcoin like an internet company it is more accurate to think of Bitcoin as akin to the internet itself.

The Internet Of Money

Just as the internet revolutionized the world of information Bitcoin revolutionizes the world of value. At its foundation the internet of today is the same as the internet of the early 90s. However when it comes to the number of applications user interface and overall societal significance the internet of today is nearly unrecognizable from the internet of the 90s. It was not necessary to create an entirely new internet: rather these new features and applications were eventually built on top of the existing infrastructure. Many people struggle to extend their gaze beyond the present and thus had absolutely no ability to foresee the slow bulky confusing internet of the early days evolving into the high-speed compact intuitive version we now carry around in our pockets.

TCP transmission control protocol and IP internet protocol are two of the base layers underpinning the internet. TCP/IP was invented in the 1970s and still serves as the foundation of internet data transfer.

Has technology not improved since then? Have the brightest computer scientists throughout the world not been able to come up with anything more efficient than TCP/IP?

The answer of course is that technology has improved since the 70’s and many proposals to replace TCP/IP have been made. So then why are we still using an outdated protocol despite the existence of “improved” versions?

The answer to this question gives us a hint as to why bitcoin is likely not to be replaced by any of the 16000+ cryptocurrencies circulating today.

Keep this question in mind as you continue reading and we’ll come back to it later.

It’s important to remember what the purpose of Bitcoin is. Bitcoin’s purpose is to serve as an alternative to our corrupt fiat financial system which is dominated by governments and central banks. Bitcoin was created to bring financial sovereignty to the individual by removing power from central banks commercial banks and governments and giving this power directly to the people.

Bitcoin’s job is simple. Follow the rules agreed upon by the network and keep going.

That’s it.

It does this job extremely well. Not even the most powerful government in the world has the power to change Bitcoin’s rules.

This then is Bitcoin’s key feature. The one thing that sets it apart from every single altcoin: Immutability.

Bitcoin Versus Ethereum

Bitcoin’s monetary policy has not wavered from its course originally set by Satoshi over a decade ago.

Image source: embedded video

This can be compared to the monetary policy of the second-largest cryptocurrency: Ethereum. As you can see it changes drastically and changes often. What is the maximum supply of ETH? There is no answer to this question.

In fairness Ethereum was not created to be a Bitcoin alternative. It was created as an attempt to fulfill another niche: namely that of smart contracts. However today many of the most vocal Ethereum advocates posit that the transition to ETH 2.0 will position ETH as a monetary alternative to bitcoin. They have even gone so far as to unironically call ETH “Ultra Sound Money” in response to the sound-money properties of Bitcoin.

What these people fail to understand is that the ability of Ethereum to alter its monetary policy in order to be “ultra sound” is itself the reason why it cannot be.

Bitcoin is sound money not because of the maximum supply of 21 million coins or its inflation rate halving every 210000 blocks — both of these figures are arbitrary and could have easily been different. We are confident calling bitcoin sound money because of the fact that these numbers are set in stone.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have almost nothing to do with one another. They are both doing separate things and neither one should be trying to compete with the other. Ethereum is no more a threat to Bitcoin than aluminum foil is to gold.

Bitcoin Versus “Faster Coins”

Ever since Bitcoin was launched there have been countless “faster and cheaper” coins that have been created to solve Bitcoin’s supposed problems.

From Dogecoin to Litecoin to Digibyte and Bitcoin Cash there is no shortage of competitors promising to dethrone Bitcoin.

The reason this is unlikely to happen is the same reason that TCP/IP remains the internet standard 50 years after its creation.

Upending and rebuilding the entire internet every time a slightly better data-transfer protocol was invented would be sort of like an artist scrapping and repainting their most famous paintings every time a slightly better canvas was invented. The point is the best paintings are not those with the highest-quality canvases but rather those with simply a good enough canvas to allow the artist to create his masterpiece. All the canvas must do is get the job done.

TCP/IP gets the job done. It allows for the internet to function and for applications to be built on top of it.

In the same way Bitcoin gets the extremely difficult job of separating money from state done. The fact that the Bitcoin blockchain is seemingly slower and more expensive than many other blockchains is irrelevant.

Altcoin marketers have been working hard boasting of greater scalability and faster transaction speeds than bitcoin.

The only problem is that no one seems to care. Countries are not adopting Digibyte as legal tender. Corporations are not holding Dogecoin on their balance sheets. World- class wealth managers are not allocating to Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash.

Why not? Let’s answer this question with an analogy.

Imagine two travelers both leaving from Cleveland Ohio looking to fly into Cairo to visit the pyramids of Egypt. Traveler A’s flight costs $500 and takes 10 hours. Traveler B gets his ticket for only $100 and it takes only 2 hours.

Traveler B boasts and brags to Traveler A about how much more cost- and time-effective his trip is.

Both travelers board their flights and arrive in Cairo. The only difference is while Traveler A ends up in Cairo Egypt Traveler B arrives in Cairo Illinois!

All of that time and money saved by Traveler B ended up actually being a waste of time and money because the prerequisite — the correct destination — was not accounted for.

When it comes to the soundness of a money immutability is a prerequisite. Nothing else matters if this property is not fulfilled. If the monetary policy of a cryptocurrency can be changed after a few phone calls from the U.S. government or because powerful insiders say so then every other feature it offers is completely irrelevant.

Can Bitcoin Be Copied?

Bitcoin did not achieve immutability by virtue of its code but rather through the unique circumstances by which it was created. Bitcoin’s code is completely open source. It can and has been copied and forked several times.

Yet by definition none of these copies can be considered immutable because of the simple fact that immutability had to be broken in order for the fork to exist in the first place. Empirically we can see this playing out in real time with Bitcoin Cash.

In 2017 a group headed by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu decided that it was worth it to sacrifice immutability in order to increase the blocksize. With this precedent set it came to nobody’s surprise when a year later a faction within the Bitcoin Cash community headed by Craig Wright decided to fork off from Bitcoin Cash creating BSV. As these forks continue to be forked and fade into irrelevance Bitcoin continues to chug along unscathed; immutability intact.

Layered Scaling: The Internet And Bitcoin

In 1995 a writer for Newsweek by the name of Clifford Stoll made these sarcastic remarks about the internet:

“We're promised instant catalog shopping — just point and click for great deals. We’ll order airline tickets over the network make restaurant reservations and negotiate sales contracts. Stores will become obsolete. So how come my local mall does more business in an afternoon than the entire internet handles in a month? Even if there were a trustworthy way to send money over the internet — which there isn’t — the network is missing a most essential ingredient of capitalism: salespeople.”

Stoll was describing the internet as he saw it in 1995. He failed to take into account the numerous applications that that same 1995 internet would eventually enable as time went on.

In the same way many people see Bitcoin today as slow and costly. After all it takes around 10 minutes for a transaction to confirm on the blockchain and fees can run up to a few dollars or more depending on the congestion of the network. Just as it took foresight to be able to recognize the ability of the internet to scale in the 90s it takes looking deeper than the surface to understand how Bitcoin can scale to millions of transactions per second.

For those who do not mind giving up some privacy in exchange for ease of transaction many companies such as Square and PayPal are integrating bitcoin into their services.

For people who want to maintain privacy and send bitcoin at the speed of light with negligible fees the Lightning Network is quickly becoming the payment option of choice. Already adopted in El Salvador and currently being integrated into Cash App the Lightning Network is turning bitcoin into a transactional currency rendering thousands of altcoins useless in the process.

Two Parallel Systems

Right now the Federal Reserve is debating whether to keep interest rates low and let the economy be destroyed by inflation or raise interest rates and destroy the economy by popping the debt bubble.

Meanwhile there exists a parallel system where no such decisions need to be made. This system has an algorithmic monetary policy that is known to everyone before they choose to opt in. Over time beginning with small allocations rational actors will move away from the current system characterized by bureaucracy corruption and inflation and move into this other system run on the principles of mathematics immutability and scarcity.

This system is called Bitcoin. And it has no competition.

(NASDAQ:ORGN) have power over the company. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership.

With a market capitalization of US$944m Origin Materials is a decent size so it is probably on the radar of institutional investors. In the chart below we can see that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups to learn more about Origin Materials.

See our latest analysis for Origin Materials

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Origin Materials?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

ADVERTISEMENT

We can see that Origin Materials does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Origin Materials' earnings history below. Of course the future is what really matters.

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Origin Materials. Artius Acquisition Partners LLC is currently the company's largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile the second and third largest shareholders hold 7.7% and 7.1% of the shares outstanding respectively.

On studying our ownership data we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register implying that no single individual has a majority interest.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Origin Materials

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Origin Materials Inc.. In their own names insiders own US$25m worth of stock in the US$944m company. Some would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. But it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public -- including retail investors -- own 50% of Origin Materials. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.

Private Equity Ownership

With a stake of 7.1% private equity firms could influence the Origin Materials board. Some might like this because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times private equity is selling out having taking the company public.

Private Company Ownership

Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 13% of the company's shares. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties such as insiders have an interest in one of these private companies that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Origin Materials better we need to consider many other factors. For example we've discovered 3 warning signs for Origin Materials (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

But ultimately it is the future not the past that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

""Over the last 15 years we have grown our business to become one of India's leading online travel agencies"" said Dhruv Shringi Chief Executive Officer of Yatra Online Inc. ""The Indian travel industry is expected to continue to grow driven by the development of tourism infrastructure rising discretionary spending and more frequent business and leisure travel. With this proposed equity offering we will be able to tap into a complementary shareholder base which provides a tremendous opportunity to benefit from growing tourism spending in India and to accelerate the important growth initiatives we have underway driving value for our investors over the long term.""

Yatra Online Inc. expects that the IPO in India of Yatra Online Limited will enable the company to:

• Access domestic Indian institutional and retail investors who are currently excluded from investing in Yatra Online Inc. through its NASDAQ listing due to regulatory constraints;

• Expand the potential shareholder base of the consolidated company to add the Indian capital markets and increase its visibility to a larger pool of equity analysts;

• Raise capital at a potentially higher valuation thereby reducing dilution and balance sheet risk.

The extent of dilution of Yatra Online Inc. on account of primary issuance of shares and the value of proceeds through a secondary sale of shares by THCL will be determined by a price discovery process.

Peter Lynch the legendary stock picker who ran Fidelity’s market-beating Magellan Fund for 13 years made a prescient observation in a speech he gave to the National Press Club back in October 7 1994.

It comes from the 38-minute mark of this video (via @DividendGrowth):

Some event will come out of left field and the market will go down or the market will go up. Volatility will occur. Markets will continue to have these ups and downs. … Basic corporate profits have grown about 8% a year historically. So corporate profits double about every nine years. The stock market ought to double about every nine years. So I think — the market is about 3800 today or 3700 — I'm pretty convinced the next 3800 points will be up; it won't be down. The next 500 points the next 600 points — I don’t know which way they’ll go. So the market ought to double in the next eight or nine years. They’ll double again in eight or nine years after that. Because profits go up 8% a year and stocks will follow. That's all there is to it.

Peter Lynch (Source: CSPAN)

When he says “the market” Lynch is referring the Dow Jones Industrial Average which closed at 3797 on the day he gave the talk.

If you compound that by an 8% growth rate over 27.5 years which would get you to present day then you get 31520.

The Dow closed Friday at 34861 which is pretty darn close. For context a 7% growth rate would’ve gotten you to 24405 and a 9% rate would’ve gotten you to 40613.

If you did this exercise with the S&P 500 which closed at 455 on the day of Lynch’s talk then you’d get 3778 assuming an 8% compound annual growth rate. The S&P closed Friday at 4543. (A 9% rate would’ve gotten you to 4867.)

According to S&P Dow Jones Indices S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) were $30.11 for the 12 months ending Q3 1994 around the time Lynch gave that speech. If you compounded that by 8% over 27.5 years you’d get $250. S&P Dow Jones Indices estimates EPS for the 12 months ending March 2022 was actually $211 which is close. (They estimate S&P EPS will be $246 in 2023.)

Lynch was not predicting the precise point of the market in March 2022. He was talking about how markets trend over longer-term periods while acknowledging short-term volatility. If you allow him some margin of error to account for unpredictable short-term swings then you may be able to better appreciate how his thoughts speak to some fundamental market truths we often talk about here at TKer.

I think three elements of what Lynch said are critical for investors to understand.

Story continues

1: ‘Some event will come out of left field and the market will go down or the market will go up. Volatility will occur.'

This relates to TKer stock market truth No. 8: “The most destabilizing risks are the ones people aren’t talking about.“

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a good example. For investors a conflict between Russia and Ukraine had not been a concern so markets weren’t prepared for it. This would explain why stocks went into a deep correction amid the initial news and buildup.

With these types of unforeseen events prices will swing wildly as markets digest every positive and negative development as the situation unfolds.

This stands in contrast to the risks everyone has been talking about like inflation and tighter monetary policy. These risks had investors concerned for months before those fears were confirmed and the actual news eventually had a limited effect on market volatility.

2: ‘I’m pretty convinced the next 3800 points will be up; it won't be down. The next 500 points the next 600 points — I don’t know which way they’ll go.‘

Over time the stock market’s biggest moves will be to the upside (which relates to TKer stock market truth No. 4) and the long game is undefeated (which is TKer stock market truth No. 1.) But you can certainly get smoked in the short term (TKer stock market truth No. 2).

As we discuss frequently here on TKer big sell-offs are actually pretty normal. The S&P 500 experiences an average max drawdown (i.e. the biggest intra-year sell-off) of 14% a year.

For what it’s worth the current market correction has seen the S&P 500 fall 12% from its high of 2022 which is less bad than average.

Lynch’s comment speaks to the advantage of a long-term investment horizon which is a valuable edge most investors have.

Share

3: ‘Profits go up 8% a year and stocks will follow. That's all there is to it.’

The stock market has historically usually gone up because earnings have usually gone up. That’s because earnings are the most important driver of stock prices which is TKer stock market truth No. 5.

Check out this chart of S&P 500 earnings since 1986 courtesy of Yardeni Research. It’s on a logarithmic scale which smooths out the curve you get when growth is compounding at a steady rate over time.

There’s some short term noise. But over time earnings have been going up and to the right.

Jurrien Timmer director of global macro at Fidelity Investments recently shared a chart showing the tight relationship between earnings and stock prices.

Stock prices are on the y-axis accompanied by earnings on the x-axis. The data goes back all the way to 1871. The r-squared of 0.9686 in this linear regression is very close to 1 which means earnings do an extremely good job of explaining how stock prices behave.

In other words stocks go where profits go.

“That's all there is to it” Lynch said.

From S&P Global chief business economist Chris Williamson: “The pace of U.S. economic growth accelerated sharply in March as COVID-19 containment measures were relaxed to the lowest since the pandemic began offsetting a drag from growing concerns about the Ukraine War. Output across both manufacturing and services rose at a rate not seen since last June with inflows of new business surging at a rate not witnessed since the strong rebound of the economy seen in the second quarter of last year.”

😤 But consumer sentiment sours: Despite strong labor market prospects sentiment continues to be weak — largely due to inflation. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment fell to 59.4 in March its lowest level since August 2011. From the survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin: “Inflation was mentioned throughout the survey whether the questions referred to personal finances prospects for the economy or assessments of buying conditions. When asked to explain changes in their finances in their own words more consumers mentioned reduced living standards due to rising inflation than any other time except during the two worst recessions in the past fifty years: from March 1979 to April 1981 and from May to October 2008. Moreover 32% of all consumers expected their overall financial position to worsen in the year ahead the highest recorded level since the surveys started in the mid-1940s.“ For more on sentiment read this.

🛍 But consumers are still spending: Despite inflationary pressures and other worries consumers are still spending. Nike General Mills and Olive Garden-parent Darden Restaurants all confirmed strong sales during the three months ending in February. For more on what’s powering spending read this.

🏘 Mortgage rates are surging: The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage carried a 4.42% rate the highest since January 2019. From Freddie Mac: “Rising inflation escalating geopolitical uncertainty and the Federal Reserve’s actions are driving rates higher and weakening consumers’ purchasing power. In short the rise in mortgage rates combined with continued house price appreciation is increasing monthly mortgage payments and quickly affecting homebuyers’ ability to keep up with the market.“

📉 Pending home sales fall: The pending home sales index fell 4.1% in February.

""Buyer demand is still intense but it's as simple as ‘one cannot buy what is not for sale.'""

🏛 The Fed’s ready to get aggressive: In its effort to cool inflation Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is prepared to get aggressive with tightening monetary policy. Here’s Yahoo Finance’s Brian Cheung: “Powell joked that ‘nothing’ could stop the Fed from a double bump in interest rates (50 basis points instead of 25 basis points) at the central bank's next policy-setting meeting in the first week of May. A 50 basis point increase out of a single meeting has not been done since 2000 but Powell emphasized that the Fed is not committed to a specific path.“ For more on tighter monetary policy read this and this.

Up the road 🛣

The highlight of the week will be the March jobs report on Friday. Economists estimate that U.S. employers added 47500 jobs during the month. From Wells Fargo economists: “Job growth has been surprisingly strong and steady in recent months with nonfarm payrolls growing an average of 582K the past three months. The resilient pace of hiring has been facilitated by workers flowing back into the labor force as constraints around COVID have eased and financial needs have risen.“

This might finally be the year,"New York CNN Business —

Netflix has accomplished a lot in Hollywood: It’s partnered with notable filmmakers produced buzzy hit films and launched the streaming craze that revolutionized the industry.

Yet there’s one coveted Tinseltown accolade Netflix (NFLX) hasn’t received: the Academy Award for best picture.

That could change this weekend. Netflix’s film “The Power of the Dog” is among the frontrunners to take home the Oscars’ biggest prize on Sunday night. It would be the first streaming service to win the category.

Critics have hailed “Dog” a western starring Benedict Cumberbatch and directed by Jane Campion as one of the year’s best films. It’s earned a 94% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes is most nominated film at this weekend’s Academy Awards and has swept much of the awards circuit in winning major accolades at the BAFTAs the Director’s Guild of America and the Golden Globes.

That’s good news for Netflix which has tried — and failed — to win best picture for years.

The power of winning best picture

Can ""The Power of the Dog"" finally win Best Picture for Netflix? Kirsty Griffin/Netflix

Netflix scored its first best picture nomination with “Roma” in 2019. The following year it received two best picture nominations with “The Irishman” and “Marriage Story” and another for “Mank” in 2021.

Getting that type of respect from the Academy typically doesn’t come cheap. The Los Angeles Times reported that Netflix spent at least $70 million in 2020 to promote its films to Academy voters. That money likely helped the company pick up a few Oscars that year but not the coveted top prize.

And for Netflix it does matter. The Oscars may be losing their luster with the general public given that its ratings recently hit record lows but the show still carries a lot of prestige in Hollywood. A best picture win could serve both as a marketing tool and as an enticement for top talent.

“As the tech outsider this gives them the ultimate form of acceptance inside Hollywood” Zak Shaikh vice president of programming at research-based media firm Magid told CNN Business. “To win best picture says they are a legitimate movie studio.”

Apple could ruin the party

Could Apple's ""CODA"" take the spotlight from Netflix this weekend? Apple TV+

Still “The Power of the Dog” isn’t a shoo-in. And unfortunately for Netflix another streaming rival could steal the spotlight this weekend: Apple (AAPL).

The Apple TV+ film “CODA” about a girl taking care of her deaf parents won the big prizes at the Screen Actors Guild and the Producers Guild of America awards.

At the Oscars “Dog” received 12 nominations overall compared to just three for “CODA.” But Gold Derby a website that sets Oscars odds currently has the two films in a dead heat.

A best picture win would be a nice marketing story for Netflix but it’s not a must-have. The company has already changed the industry and while some of the old Hollywood types may never fully embrace a streaming service it’s certainly no longer an outsider.

“Their films have won Oscars which is big progress” Tim Gray a senior VP and awards editor at Variety told CNN Business. “Netflix is so gigantic… It’s not like they need a best picture.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL29ic2Vzc2VkL25ldGZsaXhzLWh1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy1tYWRlLXRoZS1iZXN0LXR2LWVwaXNvZGUtb2YtdGhlLXllYXJhbmQtaXQtd2FzLWFib3V0LWdyaWVm0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix's 'Human Resources' Made the Best TV Episode of the Year—and It Was About Grief,"Over the span of five seasons the world of Netflix’s adult animated series Big Mouth has introduced viewers to many monsters based on human emotions including horniness shame anxiety depression and love. Now the workplace spin-off series Human Resources which launched last week continues to expand its universe with more emotional monsters guiding humans through their everyday lives. But one monster introduced in the penultimate episode of the freshman season caught me off guard representing something that hit way too close to home.

Created by the same team at Big Mouth—Nick Kroll Andrew Goldberg Mark Levin Jennifer Flackett and Kelly Galuska—Human Resources centers around a human relations workplace for monsters who are assigned to help humans cope with their daily tornado of feelings.

Because Human Resources deals with the adults instead of pubescent seventh-graders the writers can tell bolder more humanistic stories all while inventing more cartoon creatures to help characters grapple with emotions that Big Mouth’s kids wouldn’t fully comprehend the weight of just yet such as grief.

Relatively early in the season in the episode “Training Day” Walter the Lovebug (Brandon Kyle Goodman) takes his bumbling novice co-worker Emmy (Aidy Bryant) out on a well training day as a means to help improve her performance at her job. He introduces her to Yara (Nidah Barber-Raymond) an elder Lebanese woman with Alzheimer’s whom he describes as his favorite client.

Whenever Walter arrives Yara goes into her memory bank and fondly reminisces about spending time with the love of her life Safi during the peak of her youth. All of this is usually interrupted by the arrival of her son Amir (Ahmed Mawas) who visits her at the retirement home. Though it’s a C-plot that is given little screen time the depiction of the familial love the son has towards his mother despite her health is surprisingly heartwarming.

The way this kind of reality is depicted in a show that when you get down to it is mostly focused on being horny and raunchy on main strikes a cord. That said cord turns into an electrical fire of the heart when Amir and Yara return in the penultimate episode of the season with a more prominent presence and a more poignant story.

In the ninth episode of the season“It’s Almost Over” everyone in Yara’s sphere family and monsters alike have to come to grips with her inevitable passing. After Yara breaks her hip at the old folks home Amir takes on the responsibility of being his mother’s caregiver and brings her home to live with his family.

Logic Rock Pete (Randall Park) arrives to aid Amir in making concrete decisions about his mother’s care while Walter helps Yara navigate her day. Walter is informed by one of his coworkers Anxiety Mosquito (Maria Bamford) that Yara’s time on Earth is about to end. Around the same time Pete and Amir are visited by a wooly cashmere sweater monster with crow legs named Keith from Grief (Henry Winkler) who tries to prepare them for the reality of Yara’s upcoming passing. As Walter tries his best to keep Yara and her memories active as she spends the day with her granddaughter Natalie (Josie Totah) Pete and Amir attempt to evade an ever-transforming Keith.

“It’s Almost Over” wears grief on its sleeve through the duality explored in the perspectives of Amir/Pete and Yara/Walter. Both parties attempt to run from the truth that Yara’s time is nearly coming to an end. How it’s depicted is a major divergence from the normal tone of the series. The more the episode progresses the more stressful the weight of the looming tragedy becomes. Yara’s memory begins to distort and a panicked Walter is unable to maintain control. The same panic applies to Pete and Amir who are trying to find Yara while being chased by the monstrous Keith. The in-your-face metaphor of running from grief only makes the emotions stronger.

For a series full of unapologetic crass humor Human Resources depicts this heavy topic with a balanced sense of creativity and nuance which can be attributed to writer Victor Quinaz. Both “Training Day” and “It’s Almost Over” are penned by Quinaz and the way he introduces these characters to viewers is distinctly more intimate than anything else the Big Mouth universe has offered to date.

Though Yara’s family don’t have as much screen time as the other adult groups the monsters have to assist in the season the way Quinaz illustrates their functionality and togetherness in a loving manner quickly pierces the soul. It triggered my own fresh grief which I’m still working through as I write this article.

“ The painfully resonant episode was a reminder that the only way out is through. ”

Earlier this month I had to say goodbye to my dad Rendy Jones Sr. who passed away just a couple of days before my birthday. Much like Yara he was the parent of three kids and loved us endlessly with his entire heart. It wasn’t something I was prepared for nor did I want to accept what was happening. It was my first time dealing with this level of grief. I’ve seen many movies and television shows that tackle the subject but I could never fully grasp or comprehend it—I was too unfamiliar with the notion. So after my dad’s passing I bobbed and weaved dodging just about anything that even remotely touched upon the subject or dealt with any sort of heavy-handed issues.

I genuinely expected Human Resources to be a light offering that might help distract from my own grief but “It’s Almost Over” saw right through me and tackled my soul head on.

Ever since my sisters and I left the hospital where we had to say goodbye I haven’t had the ability to cry. I traveled between feeling numbness and sadness. But as the episode was nearing its conclusion with all the loving members of Yara’s family coming together to say their goodbyes and cry around her deathbed I was taken back to seeing my old man on his.

It was a visceral reaction that came flooding back and for the first time since his passing I broke down and sobbed. In the moment I realized that I was evading my own grief by seeking out any distractions I could in order to evade the notion of crying. The painfully resonant episode was a reminder that the only way out is through.

It’s surreal that the first piece of media to make me come to grips with my own grief was an episode of a Big Mouth spin-off but it’s as Walter the Lovebug says in the final minutes: “Life is so cruel and unfair and yet so fucking precious.”"

Yasser Elabd recruited by Microsoft in 1998 who helped bring the company's products throughout the Middle East and Africa for the next 20 years said that Microsoft is using illegal bribes and kickbacks in the Middle East and Africa.

As director of emerging markets for the Middle East and Africa he was successful and received many promotions.

""But eventually I noticed something strange: many employees younger than me in lower positions were driving luxury cars and purchasing homes sometimes worth millions of dollars. For my part I could not afford to buy a home let alone anything else luxurious despite my career success"" he wrote in an essay published by the whistleblower platform Lioness late on Friday.

""I wondered naively whether these colleagues had families with money -- but if so why would they be working on a Microsoft sales team?""

Elabd said that in 2016 a request came through in the amount of $40000 to accelerate closing a deal in one African country.

""When I looked through the submission I immediately knew something was wrong. The customer did not appear in Microsoft's internal database of potential clients"" he wrote.

""He had been terminated four months earlier for poor performance on the sales team and corporate policy prohibits former employees from working as partners for six months from their departure without special approval"" said Elabd.

The whistleblower escalated the issue to the senior management and the legal and HR teams put a stop to the $40000 spend ""but to my surprise did not look deeper into the Microsoft employees who were orchestrating the fake deal"".

Elabd said he even wrote an email to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and an HR executive and a vice president of the company ""immediately got back in touch with me to say that by escalating the matter to Nadella I had just 'booked a one-way ticket out of Microsoft'.""

Eventually Microsoft put him on a ""performance improvement plan"" even though he was one of the highest performers on the team.

He also brought the reports to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SE) but ""he's seen little action from the agency"".

In a statement to The Verge Microsoft said the company is committed to doing business in a responsible way and ""always encourages anyone to report anything they see that may violate the law our policies or our ethical standards.

""We believe we've previously investigated these allegations which are many years old and addressed them. We cooperated with government agencies to resolve any concerns"" said Becky Lenaburg a VP at Microsoft and deputy general counsel for compliance and ethics.

Elabd said he is not the only person at Microsoft who has alleged corrupt practices.

""I know of five others from various departments who were terminated or pushed to resign for raising flags about inconsistencies in finances"" he alleged.

""In my estimation a minimum of $200 million each year goes to Microsoft employees partners and government employees"" said Elabd.

Elabd said he is not the only person at Microsoft who has alleged corrupt practices.

""I know of five others from various departments who were terminated or pushed to resign for raising flags about inconsistencies in finances"" he alleged.

""In my estimation a minimum of $200 million each year goes to Microsoft employees partners and government employees"" said Elabd.

Members-only



It’s only fitting that on Air Max Day — Nike’s annual holiday devoted to celebrating one of if not its most iconic footwear lineages — HYPEBEAST comes correct and profiles an authentic Air Max purist for our latest Sole Mates installment. Our newest feature guest is Ryan Hawkins — an avid sneaker collector who is born and raised out of Laconia New Hampshire.

To say that Hawkins is a die-hard fan of Air Maxes would be a huge understatement. His collection right now amounts to approximately over 200 pairs and includes everything from deadstock colorways to vintage gems to nostalgic kicks such as the baseball cleats he produced on Nike ID for his senior year of high school. Hawkins certainly indulges in the energy around the collaborations and retros that dominate today’s sneaker market but his obsessions truly lie within the realm of vintage Nike Air Maxes. He’s extremely meticulous about what he purchases as he often gravitates towards OG shapes and classic colorways and he finds himself engaging with various online Air Max communities who share a similar sentiment. For the east coast native shoes are vehicles of expression and it’s the way that each pair — whether in pristine condition or beat to the ground — possesses a story worth telling.

Just in time for the March 26 Air Max Day celebration HYPEBEAST had a chance to catch up with Hawkins to discuss his affinity for the Air Max 1 which silhouette he wants to see the Swoosh bring back and more.

HYPEBEAST: Who or what got you into shoes?

RH: Honestly it was Eastbay catalogs for me around 1994 or 1995. I’d get those in the mail monthly and I’d browse through pages and pages of sale items since I only had a part-time job at the time. There would be Air Maxes on sale at $19.99 USD from $100 USD because those were crazy back then.

You were born and raised near Laconia New Hampshire was sneaker culture prevalent there?

Nope not at all. I just remember one guy from my high school days who would always get the Air Maxes and wear them to death. Other than that sneakers weren’t really prevalent in my area. The Foot Locker at my local mall was really the only place that I could go and buy sneakers in-store and get the new releases.

What was your intention for starting your IG page and when did you start to gain traction?

It’s funny because it was purely out of a love for sneakers and there was no intent on growing it. Even after I first signed up for Instagram my account was dormant for a couple of years. Then one day I just kind of realized how much I love sneakers and just decided to do it. I think I gained traction through consistency and continuing to share what I love.

“Don’t get me wrong I love a pristine pair but I also love worn-in shoes because there’s a story to tell there. I’ve got shoes that have been worn to death but thankfully and for some reason the previous owner kept it around and I love that aspect of shoes..”

You have an impressive collection of over 200 pairs where do you normally source your kicks from?

Purely online for what I want. I’m obviously a huge fan of the Air Max 1 but I’m also very big on vintage Air Maxes. When I first started to buy kicks I was definitely heavy on pickyourshoes.com and when they stopped carrying Nikes I was pretty devastated as well as the Collect marketplace. Now I mainly sift through eBay Offer Up Mercari Poshmark etc. and I’ll find some of the craziest things on there.

1 of 2 2 of 2

When it comes to buying older Air Maxes do you prefer them to be deadstock or do you not mind them being a little worn in?

Don’t get me wrong I love a pristine pair but I also love worn-in shoes because there’s a story to tell there. I’ve got shoes that have been worn to death but thankfully and for some reason the previous owner kept it around and I love that aspect of shoes.

Your IG page obviously has a ton of Air Maxes on there but there’s also plenty of sports and 90s references whether that be Kobe Jordan Will Smith Mariah Carey vintage Nike posters etc. Talk about what you loved about this era and how it’s influenced your taste.

That’s where I grew up man. I grew up watching The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air listening to Mariah Carey who has pipes from heaven Nas Wu-Tang Clan Eric Clapton Westside Connection all of these people. All of these references make me happy and so I just love sharing that with everyone else.

Nike always tends to retro a different silhouette every year are you very particular about them updating the shape and materials of some models?

I really appreciate their effort and you know everyone loves to critique the bubble size when it comes to Air Maxes. But big bubbles are my style and OG shapes are definitely preferable.

Is there a shoe or silhouette that you’re waiting on Nike to bring back or you wish would have more energy around it?

Definitely the Nike Air Max Racer from 1995. It’s such a rare shoe because they only made it for one year. I’d love to see these make a comeback but if they do I’d love for Nike to show it love and do it right.

What’re your thoughts on how Nike has approached Air Max Day in recent years?

I think they’ve done a good job so far. I know they started back in 2016 with Air Max Con where they had it in Chicago New York and Japan and I think that was the start of something really great and the energy around the holiday as a whole has been great. For this year’s releases I really wish that the Nike Air Max 1 “Wabisabi” pair for Asia was dropping everywhere since I’m an earth-tone type of guy that’s my favorite out of the pack by far. The pale blue nod on the “Blueprint” is nice. I wish they were available to everyone but I understand the process of trying to get more eyes on them.

What is it about the Nike Air Max 1 that resonates with you?

I just think it’s so smooth as a silhouette. You obviously have to call out the creation and evolution of Air. It’s also the ease of wear. When I saw the model in the mid-2000s I thought to myself that it was going to be a model that I could really stick to. I even made my first pair of Nike IDs back in 2002 as my high school baseball cleat during my senior year.

In 2010 is when I really saw it and appreciated it and realized there was an actual community on Facebook out there that was super into it and now I’m connected with all of these big time collectors such as Stevey Ryder Superllalla etc. and I just really love the relationships I’ve made there.

I heard you have a story to tell about the Air Max 1 “Crepe Hemp”. Talk to me about that.

So I’m usually a size 12 but I had a size 11 pair of that shoe. It wasn’t in the best shape but the toe box was in good condition and that’s an important part of the kicks. I randomly got a message from a high-level collector one day who noticed that my pair and I was on the hunt for a [size] 12. He sent me a deadstock pair in exchange for mine which was clearly worn in. I thought it was a scam and that he was going to want something in return but that wasn’t the case. It turns out he already had another deadstock size 11 but it was just the fact that he noticed how pumped I was about getting that pair and our relationship has been all love ever since.

1 of 2 2 of 2

I’m assuming you’re already planning on picking up the 2022 pair?

I’ve already seen leaks of the upcoming pairs and I’m definitely planning on picking those up. I don’t know when they’re coming out exactly and it looks like they made some adjustments to the toe boxes but they look great from what I’ve seen so far.

“I really think that each person can take what they want from it. You look at a certain silhouette and the same Air Max 1 doesn’t mean the same to you than it does to me. You can express yourself through a shoe in so many different ways by lacing it the way you want styling it the way you want sharing it the way you want.”

Being that your page has gained some traction has it opened any doors for you either professionally or personally?

It’s funny because I really only post the same kind of things but I’m still happy that people gravitate towards it and enjoy it. I enjoy engaging with people in the comments and in the DMs about shoes because I really post kicks that I like and necessarily all of the new collabs. It’s opened up the chance to work with size? on certain projects and they’ve been kind enough to gift me three of their exclusives. Deon Point from Concepts also got in touch with me recently and gave me the opportunity to buy the “Mellow” colorway from their latest collection because he admired my love for Air Maxes.

Why are sneakers and the stories they hold important to you?

I really think that each person can take what they want from it. You look at a certain silhouette and the same Air Max 1 doesn’t mean the same to you than it does to me. You can express yourself through a shoe in so many different ways by lacing it the way you want styling it the way you want sharing it the way you want etc. Nike is a mammoth and it goes back to when I was playing hockey back in the day when I saw Wayne Gretzky and Sergei Fedorov rock their Nikes that really hammered it home for me. The nostalgia factor is heavy for me.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZnJvbnRvZmZpY2VzcG9ydHMuY29tL25ld3NsZXR0ZXIvbmlrZS1lYXJuaW5ncy1qdXN0LWJlYXQtaXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Earnings: Just Beat It,"Read in Browser POWERED BY Good morning and happy Sunday. As we inch closer to the Final Four take a moment to learn how Nike has managed to navigate global supply chain issues inflation and geopolitical tensions to continue exceeding expectations. While you’re here check out our most recent Insights Heat Check on the gaming economy. As always drop me a line on Twitter at @liamkillingstad or email me at liam@fos.company if you want to continue the conversation. Nike’s Next Frontier Will Be Digital Nike/Design: Alex Brooks In the 19 quarters dating back to May 2017 Nike has only recorded two earnings misses with one of those coming at the height of the pandemic. During Monday’s earnings call CFO Matthew Friend made it clear that while current results are promising the future is governed by factors outside of the company’s control — namely market volatility which looms large in the immediate future. Despite difficult geopolitical circumstances regarding China and an increasingly inflationary macro environment Nike has managed to weather the storm. The Swoosh beat analysts’ estimates across the board in Q3 2022 and North American sales were especially strong. $10.9 billion in Q3 revenues up 5% YoY

Nike Direct sales hit $4.6 billion up 15%

Nike Brand Digital sales increased 19% and 33% in North America

Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 46.6% On the call Friend noted that the company could have exceeded its revenue print if it had enough merchandise on hand to meet demand. While the lost revenue opportunity is not necessarily something to celebrate it points to an important maxim for the ongoing supply chain crisis: Inventory management can make or break a company. One of the main reasons that Peloton has struggled so mightily in recent months is inventory management. Overestimating the demand for connected fitness bikes led to the company to halt production on its core product. While Nike’s inventory did bloat during the quarter — up 15% YoY — the company still remained profitable. Here’s how Nike was able to (just) do it. The Hard Part: China and the Economy It feels as though any conversation around earnings and corporate performance requires a huge red warning label — results may be impacted by inflation. The most recent inflation report indicated a rate of 7.9% the highest such figure in 40+ years. The current macro economic environment has set the stage for increased prices. Here’s an oversimplified breakdown of why consumer spending is one of the driving factors: High levels of inflation lead consumers to spend more now because their dollars lose value over time — making it beneficial to spend now.

Increased spending from consumers incentivizes corporations to increase the prices of their goods and services to match the new level of spending from consumers. Per its Q2 earnings call Nike is currently hiking prices to offset transportation logistics and air freight costs. The price increases are not only due to economic policy at home but also complexities overseas. The company is still navigating the difficulty of 2021’s Xinjiang controversy and potential sanctions from the U.S. on China should it choose to help Russia in the latter’s war on Ukraine. However sales in the region are only down 8% markedly better than the anticipated 12%. In an effort to quell some of the anti-Nike sentiment brought on by Chinese nationalism Nike partnered with Top Sports and Pou Sheng to extend its reach in the region. Currently about 20% of Nike Brands’ total revenue comes from its China operations. According to Evercore ISI analysts Nike’s current quarter marks a turning point in China: “We think the strong performance eases key concerns that COVID significantly derailed China demand… We also think this puts to bed concerns that any shift in demand towards domestic brands would significantly hamper Nike’s growth.” The Good Part: Women’s Sports While the first three fiscal quarters of 2022 have been difficult for Nike’s share price the company has made significant investments in some of the hottest markets in the industry. Nike only breaks out its specific women’s revenues in annual reports but we can do a little math to back into a probable figure. In fiscal 2021 women’s sales represented approximately 24% of Nike’s total wholesale equivalent revenues. If we use this percentage on the revenues for the nine months ending this March we can assume roughly $7.9 billion in women’s sales for that period — more than all of 2020 and just $600 million away from full-year figures in 2021. Nike was also one of the lead investors in the WNBA’s recent investment round. The $75 million round was the largest ever for a women’s sports property and valued the company at $1 billion. The investment comes from a longstanding relationship with the league as Nike has been its jersey sponsor since 2018. The “sizable” investment is likely to pay off. Regular-season viewership increased 49% compared with the 2020 season and 24% compared to pre-pandemic 2019.

The WNBA’s broadcast rights deals with ESPN and CBS come up for renewal in 2025 providing time for team valuations to grow prior to the league’s most important revenue increasing opportunity — a new broadcast deal. The company also established the Nike Athlete Think Tank — a permanent platform that maintains support for female athletes. The collective of 13 women is led by the likes of Venus Williams and Sabrina Ionescu. In discussions with Nike the group stressed the importance of financial support for women’s sports across the board. Nike wasted no time turning feedback into action pledging $1.3 million to support organizations that reflect how each Athlete Think Tank member promotes a sense of belonging for women girls and all adolescents — both on and off the playing field. With women’s sports popularity on the rise you can bet this is only the beginning of The Swoosh’s investment in the space. The Futuristic Part: Digital and the Metaverse Nike has invested heavily in its digital infrastructure since 2017 and the investment is beginning to scale at an incredible level. The company anticipates that by 2025 60% of sales will come from DTC and separately 50% of total sales will come directly from digital. Digital sales come largely from the SNKRS app. In Q1 CEO John Donahue reported that demand inside the app increased 130% during the quarter. In Q2 SNKRS saw a 50% increase in sales — overtaking the Nike.com store for the first time.

Overall digital sales were up 19% for the quarter.

In terms of total revenues Nike now derives 26% of its total brand revenues from Nike Digital as a whole. Donahue hasn’t been shy about discussing Nike’s metaverse ambitions either. In November Nike announced NIKELAND — a virtual world for Roblox users to play games and purchase goods. Since its launch Donahue says 6.7 million players from 224 countries have visited NIKELAND. Nike has ambitions to build out a full product suite in the metaverse. The company plans on integrating both RTFKT Studios (the digital design company it acquired in December) and native digital studios it will create. The studios will allow Nike to transfer their world class Web2 products into Web3 products at massive scale. Is Nike building a digital moat? The answer appears to be a resounding yes. Margins on virtual goods are high — really high. Nike is betting that if consumers end up caring half as much about their digital avatars as they do their “IRL” selves it will be well positioned to capture a lion’s share of the digital goods market. Wholly owned ecosystems where Nike can develop new digital products and experiences for customers are extremely valuable and from this vantage point Nike appears all-in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtYWlyLW1heC05Ny1icmVkLWJsYWNrLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktcmVkLWR2MzQ4Ni0wMDEtcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Air Max 97 Bred DV3486-001 Release Date | SBD,"Nike Sportswear will be delivering a brand new “Bred” iteration of their classic Air Max 97 in celebration of the model’s 25th Anniversary.

Let the family know you are thinking of them

Harley Steve Butler 66 of 111 Beaver Dam School Road peacefully went into the arms of his Savior on March 23 2022 at home.

Born in Spartanburg SC he was the husband of Claudia Glenn Vassy Butler and the son of Harley Ware Butler and Lillie Mae Bryant Butler.

After graduating from Gaffney High School in 1973 he received his associate degree from Spartanburg Methodist College and continued his education at Wofford College. In school he was an outstanding baseball player at GHS the American Legion and at SMC. After college he spent most of his work career with Norfolk Southern Railway until his retirement. He was a member of the First Baptist Church of Gaffney.

Steve enjoyed farming and raising cattle with his dad. Animals of all kinds found a kindred spirit in him. Children also were drawn to him because he was such a gentle giant who loved to tease and tickle them. Every child knew he loved them. His greatest happiness was found in spending time with family and friends. He watched over them as well as his parents like a mother hen. As Steve always said “Claudia is the love of my life and my favorite woman.”

He is survived by his loving wife of 43 years and his parents son Paul Butler (Jessica) covenant daughter Ashlee Tate and granddaughter Nevaeh Mack brother Don Butler (Connie) of Mooresville NC brother-in-law Dave Vassy (Becky) and numerous nieces and nephews. Special thanks to Tina Littlejohn who he loved like family.

The family will receive friends from 10:30 AM until 11:45 AM on Saturday March 26 2022 in the sanctuary of First Baptist Church Gaffney. The services will be at 12:00 PM with Dr. Tommy Huddleston officiating. The service will also be livestreamed at FBC Gaffney. A private family burial will be at a later date.

In lieu of flowers memorials may be made to Fellowship of Christian Athletes Women’s Ministry P.O. Box 117 Spartanburg SC 29304.

The family will be at the residence 111 Beaver Dam School Road Gaffney SC 29341.

Gospel music has been one of the most integral and sacred forms of that music. It birthed a generation of storytellers influential musicians and agents of social change such as Mahalia Jackson Shirley Caesar Kirk Franklin and many others. The origins of gospel music lie in the transatlantic slave trade as African musical traditions blended with new forms born out of the horrors of slavery. The rich lineage of gospel music began in earnest as a young man named Thomas Dorsey came to Chicago during the Great Migration. His own spiritual rebirth at Pilgrim Baptist Church in Chicago created a form of music that married blues influences with religious themes. Dorsey’s legacy ushered in a generation of Black artists who broke new ground by turning their voices of joy and pain into something powerful.

Poet T.S. Eliot called April the cruelest month but I disagree. April is a transitional time with a focus on renewal. And this year Chicago’s cultural scene has been reborn.

The inaugural Pup Crawl and Cat Walk benefiting PAWS Chicago will take place April 1. Photo by River North Design District.

I was so sad to read about the passing of Peter Fasseas co-founder of PAWS Chicago one of the nation’s largest no-kill animal shelters. Honor his legacy by attending the River North Design District’s inaugural Pup Crawl & Cat Walk benefiting PAWS Chicago on April 1. Actor and author Nick Offerman is the keynote speaker at the Illinois Conservation Foundation’s Outdoor Hall of Fame Gala (virtual) on April 6. Frederick Law Olmsted was a landscape architect and an early conservationist. He designed New York City’s Central Park. His legacy in the Chicago area includes Jackson Park Washington Park and Riverside. Visit Olmsted200 for more information and events celebrating the 200th anniversary of Olmsted’s birth.

I’m looking forward to learning more about Chicago history by watching the new season of WTTW’s “Chicago Stories.” The episodes this month include stories about Chicago’s first female mayor the first and oldest Mexican-American parish Chicago as a center for advertising and meatpacking and two Loop disasters. One of the disasters the Great Chicago Flood was thirty years ago this month – and I remember it as if it occurred yesterday.

April is certainly not the cruelest month as T.S. Eliot said particularly as April 1 marks the end of Chicago’s winter overnight parking ban. And then there are the celebrations of Passover and Easter and all they signify. And of course the Cubs opening day is April 7 and the White Sox open on April 8.

When he did finally get that elusive first Tour victory — at the WM Phoenix Open in February — it didn’t take long for Scheffler to catapult all the way to the top spot in the Official World Golf Ranking. In fact it was only 42 days.

With Scheffler’s victory on Sunday at Austin Country Club moved past Jon Rahm into the No. 1 spot in the world becoming the 25th player ever to reach that position since it started in 1986. He’ll be the sixth-youngest player to reach the pinnacle behind Tiger Woods Jordan Spieth Rory McIlroy Justin Thomas and Rahm.

Three weeks later Scheffler earned his first major championship winning the green jacket at the 2022 Masters Tournament.

Here’s a look at Scheffler’s progression from Dallas-area phenom to PGA Tour star.

This extends agreements with two of the agency's key partners in its ongoing resupply efforts and are designed to keep the station stocked through to 2026.

The new contracts awarded to SpaceX and Northrop Grumman are worth a potential US$14 billion in total but the final amounts will depend on the type of missions which NASA organizes as needed.

SpaceX with its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule combo and Northrop Grumman with its Antares rocket and Cygnus capsule have supplied cargo to the International Space Station for most part of the last decade. In 2016 Sierra Nevada Corporation was brought into the fold as a third private space company to ferry goods to and from the orbiting laboratory.

NASA has now ordered a further six flights each from Northrop Grumman and SpaceX to be carried out between now and 2026. This brings the number of missions ordered under its CRS-2 program to 32 with SpaceX taking care of 15 Northrup Grumman 14 and Sierra Nevada Corporation now known as Sierra Space three.

For the past 20 years commercial space companies have focused on ways of getting people and cargo to space.

Now they are turning their attention to creating destinations in space.

With the International Space Station set to be decommissioned by 2030 NASA will transition from premier gatekeeper of U.S. access to the space station to become just one of many customers of private space stations in what many hope will be a robust low-Earth orbit economy.

Currently there are only two destinations in low-Earth orbit the ISS and a smaller modular station being built by China.

Within the next decade NASA expects that to change.

ISS is costly and old commercial stations are not

The ISS which has been continuously occupied since 2000 is beginning to show its age.

The main portion of the station repeatedly endures impacts from visiting spacecraft as well as harsh cycles of heating and cooling from orbiting the Earth 16 times a day.

NASA spends about $1.1 billion in operating and maintenance costs on the station.

With an increasingly expensive and aging station and higher-than-ever confidence in the low-Earth orbit capabilities of its commercial partners NASA intends to shift its focus to its return-to-the-moon Artemis program.

With NASA as a customer private companies will foot the bill for maintenance and operation of destinations in space potentially saving NASA — and the American taxpayers — billions.

NASA funding commercial station development

Every space station since the Soviet Union's pioneering Salyut 1 in 1971 has been built by NASA and its partners or the national space programs of Russia or China.

The agency's plan to transition from a low-Earth orbit destination provider to a customer of independent commercial low-Earth orbit destinations (CLDs) was first outlined in the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017. At the time the ISS was set to be decommissioned in 2024.

Since then the Biden administration has committed to extending operations of the ISS through 2030. NASA's international partners have also signaled their intention to continue operations until then.

In an effort to duplicate the success it had in fostering commercial cargo and crew transportation to the ISS NASA is funding initial efforts with Axiom Space Blue Origin Nanoracks and Northrop Grumman to develop commercial space destinations through 2025.

Axiom Space has been tapped to develop at least one transitional module that will attach to the ISS and one day separate to become its own space station.

Blue Origin Nanoracks and Northrop Grumman Systems were selected by NASA to develop free-flying independent commercial low-Earth orbit destinations (CLDs).

Commercial stations aren't a new idea

The concept of commercial destinations in space is not new.

Bigelow Aerospace a company founded 20 years ago to develop orbital destinations had been floating the idea of a commercial space station to NASA years before the agency planned for the retirement of the ISS.

In 2017 it proposed an idea to launch a small outpost station to the moon with United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket.

It also planned to pursue an opportunity to develop a free-flying station with NASA using its B2100 ""Olympus"" inflatable habitat designed for crew and tourists.

Bigelow Aerospace was certainly ahead of its time in 2010 when it proposed the concept of connecting an inflatable module to the ISS.

Its Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) was launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 and installed on the ISS in 2016.

Since then Bigelow Aerospace passed on an opportunity to bid on a NASA contract to connect another commercial module to the ISS.

That opportunity was ultimately awarded to Axiom Space for the development of its Axiom Hub 1 — a major first step in the race to develop commercial destinations in space.

Company founder Robert Bigelow said that the funding was too low and his company was more interested in an opportunity to develop a free-flying space station.

Bigelow Aerospace suffered what many architects of the future do facing the reality of grand ideas.

In practicality getting massive inflatable space stations and large numbers of crew members to orbit requires massive launchers — such as Blue Origin's New Glenn SpaceX's Starship NASA's SLS or ULA's Vulcan — and multiple fast reliable and safe crew transportation options.

Even now those options are not readily available. SpaceX is a sole provider of commercial crewed spaceflight while the New Glenn Starship SLS and Vulcan rockets are all still in development.

Being ahead of its time and citing impacts from the global pandemic Bigelow Aerospace has all but closed up shop.

In March 2020 its entire workforce was laid off. In December 2021 it transferred ownership and operation of the ISS BEAM module to NASA Johnson Space Center.

There are other commercial providers succeeding where Bigelow Aerospace failed.

Nanoracks owns and operates a commercial airlock on the ISS.

Sierra Space has its own version of an inflatable habitat in the works called the Large Integrated Flexible Environment which is a planned component of Blue Origin's bet on a commercial space station called the ""Orbital Reef.""

Both of these companies have won big with NASA investment to develop the next era of commercial space stations in a robust economy in low-Earth Orbit.

Axiom Station to lead the way

The first step toward a revolutionary new economy in low-Earth orbit was taken in 2020 when NASA awarded Axiom Space a $140 million contract ordering at least one habitable commercial module that will attach to the ISS — the opportunity that Bigelow Aerospace passed on.

As explained in a statement provided by NASA the contract is a first stepping stone for a commercial partner “to demonstrate its ability to provide products and services and begin the transition to a sustainable low-Earth orbit economy in which NASA is one of many customers.”

Axiom Space has plans to build not only the module that will attach to the ISS but to build onto the initial module and ultimately separate from the ISS as a free-flying self-sustaining facility called Axiom Station.

Axiom Hub 1 the first module of the eventual Axiom Station will consist of crew quarters with windows and will be capable of supporting research and in-space manufacturing.

Speaking to FLORIDA TODAY Axiom Space Executive Chairman Kam Ghaffarian said “We're expecting the first module in our space station to be launched in mid-2024.”

“There will be additional modules that will be launched. And initially our modules will dock with the current ISS. And then as ISS retires somewhere between 2028 to 2030 we will separate from the International Space Station and we'll be operating as the first private commercial space station in orbit” continued Ghaffarian.

Axiom Hub 1 is currently being constructed in Europe by Thales Alenia Space.

Work began in October 2021 just 14 months after the program's launch. The fabrication of the module is expected to wrap up soon followed by initial integration and testing operations.

“We've been working on the project; we've been developing hardware. We will be in orbit by 2024 way ahead of everybody else. And as a result we would have huge first-mover advantage” said Ghaffarian.

Ghaffarian believes that Axiom Space has the advantage over other companies working to develop their own free-flying space stations because “the other companies do not have the ability to connect to the International Space Station. We're the only one that has access"" he said.

Delivery of Axiom Hub 1 to Houston for final assembly outfitting and integration by Axiom Space is expected in early 2023.

While hardware is currently being constructed Axiom Space still has a few logistics to work through starting with how the first module will make it to orbit in the first place.

""We're not 100% sure yet as to who we're going to contract with for the transportation to take that to orbit for us when it's ready"" said Ghaffarian.

In an effort to further open the ISS to commercialization in 2021 NASA solicited proposals to support up to two private astronaut missions a year to the ISS.

NASA has also selected Axiom Space as the provider of the first two private astronaut missions to the ISS. NASA has stated that it will use data and information collected from the first two private astronaut missions to the ISS before announcing the selection of a third mission.

Like NASA's Commercial Crew Program astronaut missions Axiom Space is partnered with SpaceX for crew transport using its Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsules.

The first private astronaut mission AX-1 is slated to launch from Kennedy Space Center on April 3 sending three paying customers and a former professional NASA astronaut on a 10-day mission with eight spent aboard the ISS to conduct scientific research.

The second private astronaut mission AX-2 is targeted to launch between fall 2022 and late spring 2023.

NASA plans for more than one station

In contrast to Axiom Space's exclusive access to build onto the ISS 11 companies submitted proposals to NASA to develop independent free-flying space stations.

From the 11 proposals NASA selected Blue Origin Nanoracks and Northrop Grumman Systems in December 2021 awarding a total estimated $415.6 million for Phase 1 development which is expected to last through 2025.

After the initial design phase NASA intends to move forward with at least one of the companies to certify the space station design as safe for NASA crew members and purchase services from the provider(s).

Blue Origin has partnered with Sierra Space receiving a total $130 million award in Phase 1 funding to develop its proposed ""Orbital Reef"" space station.

Blue Origin and Sierra Space plan to develop the ""Orbital Reef"" and make it enticing to business partners researchers and tourists alike by teaming with Boeing Redwire Space Genesis Engineering Solutions and Arizona State University (ASU).

In a Blue Origin-provided statement Brent Sherwood senior vice president of advanced development programs said ""the Orbital Reef mixed-use space business park will offer reduced costs and complexity turnkey services and inspiring space architecture to support any business.""

Blue Origin's proposal features the most attractive options for wealthy space tourists as well as scientific researchers.

To make ""Orbital Reef"" an easy-to-reach all-in-one excursion and destination in space Blue Origin partnered with Sierra Space and Boeing to provide multiple cargo and crew transportation options.

Lindy Elkins-Tanton ASU vice president of interplanetary initiative explained it as ""a village. Think of it as many different organizations and people in their own parts of ""Orbital Reef"" doing their own activities.""

At any given time the large station would be able to support up to 10 occupants.

It would also be large enough to provide spaces for scientific research in-space manufacturing and even ""exotic hospitality"" for tourists.

Also unique to Blue Origin's proposal is the opportunity for visitors to experience space without the constraints of a spacesuit.

Genesis Engineering Solutions will contribute essentially a space version of a one-person submarine to conduct excursions outside of the main station.

“Until now excursions outside spacecraft have required the challenge inconvenience risk and expense of spacesuits. Orbital Reef changes that with the Single Person Spacecraft an efficient and tourist-safe alternative” said Brand Griffin program manager for Genesis Engineering.

Northrop Grumman — partnered with Dynetics Leidos and more unnamed partners — was awarded $125.6 million in Phase 1 funding.

Northrop Grumman expects to leverage its extensive space experience to develop an as-of-yet unnamed space station.

Initially it will be capable of supporting four permanent crew members with expectations to expand to eight in the future as the market demands.

“Our station will enable a smooth transition from International Space Station-based LEO missions to sustainable commercial-based missions where NASA does not bear all the costs but serves as one of many customers” said Steve Krein vice president civil and commercial space Northrop Grumman in a Northrop Grumman-provided statement.

Northrop Grumman's design also incorporates capabilities to support science manufacturing and tourism.

""Multiple docking ports will allow future expansion to support exploration crew analog habitats laboratories crew airlocks and facilities capable of artificial gravity"" as described in a statement issued by Northrop Grumman.

Nanoracks awarded $160 million in Phase 1 funding has partnered with Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin to develop its space station called ""Star Lab.""

The proposed ""Star Lab"" will be able to continuously support up to four astronauts and ""include a large inflatable habitat designed and built by Lockheed Martin a metallic docking node a power and propulsion element a large robotic arm for servicing cargo and payloads and a state-of-the-art laboratory system to host a comprehensive research science and manufacturing capability"" as explained in a statement provided by Nanoracks.

Nanoracks Chairman Jeffrey Manber says that it's smart that NASA is investing in multiple space stations just as it provided funding for more than one ISS cargo supplier and chose both SpaceX and Boeing to ferry passengers to the ISS.

He pointed out that for nearly a decade the U.S. had relied on one provider — Russia — to carry NASA astronauts to the space station before SpaceX began doing so in 2019.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine would have complicated if not ended the NASA-Russia flights said Manber.

""So you know this crisis shows the value of the United States moving into a new era where there will be multiple smaller private space stations"" Manber said. ""So that we're not single-point dependent on any company any team and we have a really robust presence in space.""

At the time of writing there are just two occupied space structures floating above Earth the soon-to-be-retired International Space Station ( ISS ) and the recently launched Palace in the Sky the Chinese Tiangong. Both are operated by government-backed organizations.Soon enough though some of the private space companies that have changed the industry in recent years will take their business into orbit as well. A number of them are working on developing orbital habitats with the single goal of making money by providing interested parties the tools and locations to conduct experiments and whatnot. And that will be a true game-changer.Recognizing that the American space agency announced in the last month of 2021 the signing of agreements with “three U.S. companies to develop designs of space stations and other commercial destinations in space.”These companies are Blue Origin Nanoracks and Northrop Grumman and it’s time to have a closer look at what each has to offer.Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin has been a player in this industry for two decades but only recently (read last year) its tourism space business if it can be called that took off. The company which is now offering very short trips to the edge of space onboard the New Shepard spaceship is also working to develop a lunar lander for the future Artemis missions.On the space station front Blue Origin partnered with Sierra Space to develop something called the Orbital Reef . It is a station designed to serve the needs of companies space agencies nations media and private individuals – meaning anyone willing to pay whatever Blue decides to ask for his services.Orbital Reef will float at a distance of 500 km (311 miles) from the surface and will comprise 830 cubic meters (29300 cubic feet) of space for living and working with a capacity of 10 people. NASA is backing the development of the Orbital Reef expected to become operational in 2030 and awarded the two companies $130 million for its development.Next up is the Starlab  being cooked up by 13-year old space services company Nanoracks and a giant of the industry Lockheed Martin. Scheduled to be launched in 2027 the “first-ever free-flying commercial space station” as it’s called comprises a large inflatable habitat of 340 cubic meters (12000 cubic feet) capable of holding four a metallic docking node a 60power and propulsion element and a robotic arm.The habitat will be structured in a a ""state-of-the-art laboratory system"" called George Washington Carver (GWC) Science Park comprising a a biology lab plant habitation lab physical science and materials research lab and an open workbench area.NASA is funding this one with a $160 million award.Last on this list is the yet unnamed Northrop Grumman station a modular assembly that will use existing technologies like the Cygnus spacecraft. This contraption will “provide a base module for extended capabilities including science tourism industrial experimentation and the building of infrastructure beyond initial design.”It’s unclear when this one will be ready but the plan is to have it expand in such a way as to be able to support additional habitats laboratories crew airlocks and even a first “facilities capable of artificial gravity.”$125.6 million have been set aside by NASA for this project.The above three space stations are not the only ones in the works in the near term only the ones NASA kind of officially recognized. Besides them the near future will bring five others close to either the Earth (Axiom Russia’s ROSS and an Indian unnamed habitat) or the Moon (NASA’s Gateway and Russia’s Lunar Orbital Station).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2hlcmVzLXdoeS10aGUtbmV3LWItMjEtc3RlYWx0aC1ib21iZXItaXMtc28tY29vbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Why The New B-21 Raider Is So Cool,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2hlcmVzLXdoeS10aGUtbmV3LWItMjEtc3RlYWx0aC1ib21iZXItaXMtc28tY29vbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAzLTI3L3NwYWNleC1yaXZhbHMtZ2V0LWEtbGlmdC1hcy1pbmR1c3RyeS1zaHVucy1ydXNzaWFuLXNveXV6LXJvY2tldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russia-Ukraine Latest News: SpaceX Soyuz and Rocket Industry,"Why did this happen?

The return of the 700-guest vessel also marks a milestone for the luxury brand: its full return to service for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings.

Since first welcoming guests back in September 2021 the company has added all of its five-ship fleet back into revenue service.

For its first cruise after a two-year hiatus the Voyager is sailing in the Western Mediterranean.

The ten-night destination-intensive voyage departs Civitavecchia the cruise port for Rome and features calls in ten ports across Spain Italy and France.

Before arriving in Barcelona – the cruise’s final destination – the vessel is also visiting Cagliari Ajaccio Livorno Villefranche Marseille Mahón and Palma de Mallorca.

Continuing its summer program the Voyager is offering additional itineraries in the Mediterranean and also the Canary Islands thought the end of May.

In early June the ship repositions to Northern Europe for a series of cruises to the British Island Iceland the Baltic Scandinavia and more.

The Seven Seas Voyager originally entered service in 2003. The all-suite all-balcony ship offers an ultra-luxury cruising experience with an all-inclusive product that focus on high-end culinary and service.

In 2016 the vessel was subjected to a major refit as part of a $125 million refurbishment program that aimed to bring the entire Regent fleet to the same standards of the company’s latest newbuild the 2016-built Seven Seas Explorer.

According to the company during the 25-day drydock renovation the Voyager received “the same elegant style and indisputable attention to detail famously featured on Seven Seas Explorer.”

The vessel’s suites were also upgrade with new amenities and features.

After ending 2021 with three ships back in service Regent completed its restart program in 2022.

Earlier this month the company added the Seven Seas Navigator into the active lineup offering cruises in the Caribbean and North America.

Previously the company had welcomed guests back on the Seven Seas Splendor the Seven Seas Explorer and the Seven Seas Mariner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy96ZW5kYXlhLWdvcmdlb3VzLWNyb3AtdG9wLXNpbHZlci0yMjUwMDAwNDYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zendaya Is Gorgeous in a Crop Top and Silver Skirt on the 2022 Oscars Red Carpet,"Zendaya and her stylist Law Roach came ready to make a strong bid for best dressed at the 2022 Oscars.

Dune has a Best Picture nomination tonight. While Zendaya's screen time in the film was limited she will be playing a bigger role in the sequel and is excited to shoot it. “I'm ready to do a second” Zendaya told InStyle for its November 2021 issue. “Whenever they call I'm here. [Co-star] Timothée [Chalamet] is an extraordinary talent and just a lovely person—he's become my family.”

Zendaya revealed to Empire magazine in August that she only spent a couple days working on set because her role as Chani was small in the first film. “My part is very very small in this movie and that’s why I’m so excited to see it to see what everyone’s been up to” she said. “[Director Denis Villeneuve and I] had a little discussion about who Chani is and the strength she possesses. She’s a fighter that’s what her people are. I only really had a few days with her so I kind of scratched the surface but it was so much fun figuring her out. What does she walk like what does she talk like? This is her planet so how does she navigate this world? It was so fun.”



“I was only there for four days and I did not want to leave!” she added. “Denis understands what he wants from us but he’s also very collaborative allowing me to have my take on the character as well. I don’t want to jinx anything but I can’t wait to explore her more.”

Tonight was no exception. The 94th annual Academy Awards kicked off with the usual glitz and fanfare. At the center of the evening’s drama was Billie Eilish’s Oscars 2022 look: a massive Gucci gown.

Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas attended the 2022 Oscars as young fashion icons but more importantly as performers and Academy Award nominees. The duo received a Best Original Song nomination for No Time Die the title and theme from the 2021 James Bond film. Though this is the first Academy Award nomination for the seven-time Grammy winner it won’t be her first performance at the Oscars. Eilish sang a rendition of Yesterday by The Beatles during the 2020 Oscars “In Memoriam” segment.

Billie Eilish may have No Time To Die but she certainly dressed to kill. Everyone’s favorite Gen-Z alternative pop star took her usual gothic fashion to the red carpet. While she usually often opts for menswear-inspired suits she broke her causal streak with a multi-layered ruffled Gucci dress its train spilling beautifully like a puddle around her feet. Billie Eilish doesn’t go full glam too often but when she does it’s very memorable.

It’s not surprising that Billie Eilish wore Gucci on the red carpet for her first Oscars nomination as the singer is a Gucci brand ambassador. She even partnered with Gucci to create a limited edition vinyl for her latest album Happier Than Ever. Eilish has been known to wear full ‘fits embellished with the Gucci logo but her Oscars red carpet gown had all the flair of the brand without a single interlocking “G”.

AP Newsroom.

Eilish is known for extending the narrative of her clothing to her hair and makeup choices. You probably remember her incredible Marilyn Monroe-style blonde hair at the Met Gala that perfectly matched her Oscar de la Renta ball gown—a head-to-toe princess moment. Her blonde hair was a rare departure from the wilder hairstyles the singer usually rocks. From neon green roots bright blue locks to full-on space buns Billie Eilish is known for making her the main focus of her red carpet looks.

AP Newsroom.

This year the singer kept things more simple matched her Gucci dress to her jet black hair which was parted with side-swept bangs (I’m sensing the return of the side part and the death of the middle part). She completed the look with gothic star rings on both hands and simple earrings. There was no need to add a necklace because the dramatic off-the-shoulder bust of the dress contrasted beautifully with her bare collarbones.

The overall darkness of Billie Eilish’s look for the Academy Awards matches the dark tone of her nominated song and she did an excellent job setting the mood for her performance. There is no question that Eilish will have many more red carpet appearances—and maybe even a few more Oscar nominations in the coming years. We can’t wait to see what else she writes and of course wears.

Anne Hathaway’s transparency on important hard issues is one of the many reasons we love her. The Oscar-winning actress recently opened up about her past pregnancy journeys for her cover story for WSJ. Magazine. Hathaway not only said she’s open to welcoming a third child in the future but got candid about her fertility issues and postpartum journeys with her two kids.

She said ‘There’s this tendency to portray getting pregnant having kids in one light as if it’s all positive. But I know from my own experience it’s so much more complicated than that. When you find out that your pain is shared by others you just think ‘I just feel that’s helpful information to have so I’m not isolated in my pain.’ I mean what is there to be ashamed of? This is grief and that’s a part of life.’

Hathaway tied the knot with her husband of nearly ten years Adam Schulman back in 2012 in a small ceremony. The two share two sons together named Jonathan Rosebanks 6 and Jack 2.

The Locked Down star has been very open in the past about anything to do with parenting. Back in July 2019 when Hathaway announced her second pregnancy in an adorable low-key Instagram post she also gave a love letter to people struggling with fertility like herself.

She said “It’s not for a movie…⁣⁣ #2⁣ ⁣All kidding aside for everyone going through infertility and conception hell please know it was not a straight line to either of my pregnancies. Sending you extra love.”

Note: This article was first published on 23rd March 2022 and updated with more details on 4th April 2022.

Three years have passed since NVIDIA's Ampere architecture based A100 a GPU that kick-started the data centre revolution. Today at GTC 2022 NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged the importance of advancing AI and to that extent launched a new processing engine to manage the world's AI infrastructure through its next-generation accelerated computing platform with the NVIDIA Hopper architecture.

Named after Grace Hopper a pioneering computer scientist the NVIDIA Hopper architecture will supersede the already powerful NVIDIA Ampere architecture. The all-new NVIDIA H100 is the company's first Hopper-based GPU that packs a whopping 80 billion transistors. This monster of a GPU boasts AI training performance throughputs up to 9x faster than the predecessor NVIDIA A100 30 times more throughput for AI inferencing performance and up to seven times more HPC performance. As powerful as the NVIDIA A100 is this level of performance leap over it is phenomenal to say the least.

It goes without saying that the NVIDIA H100 sets a new standard in accelerated large-scale AI and HPC capabilities and this is made possible via these seven innovation breakthroughs:-



1) World's most advanced chip

Built with 80 billion transistors using a cutting-edge TSMC 4N process designed for NVIDIA's accelerated compute needs H100 features significant advances to accelerate AI HPC memory bandwidth interconnect and communication including nearly 5TB per second of external connectivity. H100 is the first GPU to support PCIe Gen5 and the first to utilise HBM3 thus doubling the memory bandwidth to a staggering 3TB/s. Even the L2 cache has been bumped up to 50MB (previously 40MB) to better fit more significant portions of datasets and models thus reducing HBM3 memory access.

To put that into perspective NVIDIA says just twenty H100 GPUs can sustain the equivalent of the entire world's internet traffic making it possible for customers to deliver advanced recommender systems and large language models running inference on data in real-time. Here's how the brand new H100 compares against its predecessors:-

1. Effective Tensor performance with and without using the Sparsity feature.

2. Data Center GPUs do not have RT Cores for ray-tracing media encoder and display connectors as these GPUs are meant for installation in servers and data center racks to power AI and HPC tasks.

3. GPU peak and boost clocks are synonymous in NVIDIA Data Centre GPUs. Not yet finalised for H100.

2) Fourth-Gen Tensor Cores and updated Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) offer massive speed-up

With a new fabrication process NVIDIA bumped up the number of streaming multiprocessors (SM) it can pack and boosted its clocks considerably over the A100. This has massively helped improve the H100's fourth-generation Tensor Core's performance by at least three times the throughput of the A100.

To recap the Tensor Core is a crucial piece to advance math operations for Matrix Multiplication and Accumulation (MMA) to deliver next-gen performance for HPC and AI tasks compared to traditional FP INT and fused multiple accumulation (FMA) operations that are part of the main SM's pipeline.

The fourth-gen Tensor Core also adds a new FP8 data format which halves the data storage and doubles the throughput compared to a traditional FP16 data type. With an updated compiler to take advantage of the new data format the H100 can theoretically speed-up crunching FP16 data types through the FP8 format more than six times faster (inclusive of architectural advancements) than the A100 can on its own in FP16 format. That's under the assumption that the data that needs to be processed can do with less precision and still maintain the required accuracy a trait that's further aided by the new Transformer Engine (more on this later).

The new Tensor Core also boasts far more efficient data management which saves up to 30% operand delivery power. This is thanks to Distributed Shared Memory which enables more efficient communications directly between SM-to-SM using shared memory blocks within the same cluster. This offers a 7x reduction in latency to access different SM units on the H100 than writing to global memory on the A100 before other SM blocks can use the data. Yet another proponent that adds to more efficient data management is improvements in asynchronous execution via a new Asynchronous Transaction Barrier to improve data exchange or memory copy functions as well as Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) which is essentially what DMA does for memory but specific to the usage of tensor cores.

3) New Transformer Engine

Transformers are deep learning models that have unlocked serf-supervised learning in a big way in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) for translations and text summaries as well as computer vision (CV). Google's BERT is an early example of a Transformer machine learning model that has been widely used. Head over to this Wikipedia page for more base knowledge on Transformer deep learning model.

As AI progressed through various stages of development from just image classification to recommendation engines language translation modelling and more recently the ability to produce conversational AI and avatars such as in Omniverse Avatars many of the later developments were traced back to the Transformer deep learning model. NVIDIA also states that 70% of academic AI papers submitted in the last couple of years were based on Transformer models.

Increasingly Transformers have become the cornerstone of AI evolution and NVIDIA believes the next wave of AI will be further fuelled by Transformers. This is why the new Hopper architecture and H100 chip features a brand new Transformer Engine to speed up these neural networks by as much as six times the previous generation GPU without losing precision or accuracy.

Transformer model training can be reduced from weeks to days – NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.

The new Transformer Engine uses software and custom NVIDIA Hopper Tensor Core technology to accelerate training and inference of transformer models the prevalent AI model building block. These Tensor Cores can now apply mixed FP8 and FP16 formats dynamically and intelligently without performance or accuracy loss to dramatically increase AI calculation for transformers. It will also automatically handle re-casting and scaling between these precisions in each layer.

As iterated earlier the Hopper architecture's new fourth-gen Tensor Cores triple floating-point ops. When combined with the new Transformer Engine and fourth-gen NVLinks (covered more in a later point) the Hopper Tensor Cores enable an order-of-magnitude speed-up for HPC and AI workloads.

4) Second-gen Secure Multi-Instance GPU (MIG)

The Ampere A100 was the first to sport Multi-Instance (MIG) functionality to partition the GPU into seven independent instances or seven virtual GPUs each with its own resources (memory cache streaming multiprocessors) to tackle various workloads. The new Hopper H100 extends MIG capabilities that's 7x the previous generation by offering secure multi-tenant configurations in the cloud across each GPU instance. The A100 was only able to do this on a single GPU instance.



5) Confidential Computing

Previously only available in CPUs the H100 is the first to bring confidential computing to an accelerated compute accelerator through a GPU. This protects AI models and customer data while they are being processed. Customers can also apply confidential computing to federated learning for privacy-sensitive industries like healthcare and financial services as well as on shared cloud infrastructures.

For one it has a hardware firewall on-die root-of-trust device attestation hardware-accelerated AES-256 full encryption and decryption at the PCIe line rate all through the device. At the end of the day confidential computing is a step towards supporting the zero-trust computing model.



6) Fourth-gen NVLink

As powerful as a single H100 GPU is NVIDIA's scalable GPU architecture via its proprietary NVLink high bandwidth energy-efficient low latency lossless GPU-to-GPU interconnect is a crucial enabler in massive multi-node computational performance.

The H100 boasts a fourth-generation NVLink that maintains the same 25GB/s effective bandwidth in each direction but instead of 12 NVLinks on the A100 the H100 has 18 NVLinks. Also the H100 now has only two high-speed lanes to create a single link instead of four on the A100. The net outcome is a 1.5x GPU-to-GPU bandwidth boost over the third-gen NVLink with 900GB/s total multi-GPU IO and shared memory access on the fourth-gen NVLink.

To accelerate the largest AI models NVLink combines with a new external third-gen NVLink Switch to extend NVLink as a scale-up network beyond the server connecting up to 256 H100 GPUs at 9x higher bandwidth versus the previous generation using NVIDIA HDR Quantum InfiniBand.

The new third-gen NVLink Switch is an impressive piece of standalone silicon. Residing inside and outside nodes to connect multiple GPUs across servers clusters and data center environments this new NVSwitch boasts 64 ports of fourth-gen NVLinks to accelerate multi-GPU connectivity in a big way for a total of 1.6TB/s switch throughput. Check out how powerful it is than the first-gen NVSwitch that debuted four years back.

7) New DPX Instruction

A GPU will be accelerating dynamic programming for the first time ever thanks to the new Hopper GPU architecture. Dynamic programming algorithms are currently used in healthcare robotics quantum computing data science and more. The new DPX instructions support will help developers write code to achieve speed-ups on dynamic programming algorithms in multiple industries boosting workflows for disease diagnosis quantum simulation graph analytics and routing optimisations by up to 40x compared with CPUs and up to 7x compared with previous-generation GPUs.

This level of acceleration will also help democratise genomic analysis in hospitals worldwide bringing scientists closer to providing patients with personalised medicine.

More about the DPX instructions can be found here and here.

The H100 chip is now in full production with availability slated for Q3 later this year.

There's an NVIDIA H100 at every scale

H100 will come in SXM and PCIe form factors to support a wide range of server design requirements.

The H100 PCIe (utilising PCIe 5.0) with NVLink to connect two GPUs provides more than 7x the bandwidth of PCIe 5.0 delivering outstanding performance for applications running on mainstream enterprise servers. Its form factor makes it easy to integrate into existing data center infrastructure. However it will have slightly more tamers specs than an H100 SXM module tailored for data center deployment.

NVIDIA's H100 SXM will be available in HGX H100 server boards with four- and eight-way configurations for enterprises with applications scaling to multiple GPUs in a server and across multiple servers. HGX H100-based servers deliver the highest application performance for AI training and inference along with data analytics and HPC applications.

A new converged accelerator the H100 CNX Converged Accelerator couples an H100 with a ConnectX-7 SmartNIC to attach the network directly to the GPU thus bypassing all the legacy CPU bottlenecks. This frees up the CPU to process other requests while bringing ground-breaking performance for I/O-intensive applications such as multi-node AI training in enterprise data centres and 5G signal processing at the edge.

For a supercomputer that can be deployed into a data centre on-premise cloud or even at the edge NVIDIA's DGX systems advance into their 4th incarnation with eight H100 GPUs. The 4th-gen DGX H100 will be able to deliver 32 petaflops of AI performance at new FP8 precision providing the scale to meet the massive compute requirements of large language models recommender systems healthcare research and climate science while still maintaining the same form factor of the DGX A100 and its traits.

Every GPU in DGX H100 systems is connected by fourth-generation NVLink providing 900GB/s connectivity 1.5x more than the prior generation. NVSwitch enables all eight of the H100 GPUs to connect over NVLink. Meanwhile an external NVLink Switch can network up to 32 DGX H100 nodes in the next-generation NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD supercomputers.

It's not all about the hardware

If you recall CUDA-X debuted a few years back to represent the GPU-accelerated computing libraries tools and technologies that focus on AI and data science acceleration. We've got more groundwork of this covered here previously. At GTC 2022 NVIDIA introduced over 60+ updates to CUDA-X libraries opening new science and industries to accelerated computing such as quantum computing genomics drug discoveries 6G research data analytics etc. You can find out more in this NVIDIA press release.

These days we can do a bit more like bringing vintage photos to life à la Harry Potter. And this week chipmaker NVIDIA performed another magic trick.

Building on previous work NVIDIA researchers showed how a small neural network trained on a few dozen images can render the pictured scene in full 3D. As a demo the team transformed images of a model holding a Polaroid camera—an ode to Andy Warhol—into a 3D scene.

The work stands out for a few reasons.

First it’s very speedy. Earlier AI models took hours to train and minutes to render 3D scenes. NVIDIA’s neural network takes no more than a few minutes to train and renders the scene in tens of milliseconds. Second the AI itself is diminutive in comparison to today’s hulking language models. Large models like GPT-3 train on hundreds or thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs). NVIDIA’s image rendering AI runs on a single GPU.

The work builds on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) a technique developed by researchers at UC Berkeley UC San Diego and Google Research a couple years ago. In short a NeRF takes a limited data set—say 36 photographs of a subject captured from a variety of angles—and then predicts the color intensity and direction of light radiating from any point in the scene. That is the neural net fills in the gaps between images with best guesses based on the training data. The result is a continuous 3D space stitched together from the original images.

NVIDIA’s recent contribution outlined in a paper puts NeRFs on performance enhancing drugs. According to the paper the new method dubbed Instant NeRF exploits an approach known as multi-resolution hash grid encoding to simplify the algorithm’s architecture and run it in parallel on a GPU. This upped performance by a few orders of magnitude—their algorithm runs up to 1000 times faster according to an NVIDIA blog post—without sacrificing quality.

NVIDIA imagines the technology could find its way into robots and self-driving cars helping them better visualize and understand the world around them. It could also be used to make high-fidelity avatars people can import into virtual worlds or to replicate real-world scenes in the digital world where designers can modify and build on them.

The speed and size of neural networks matter in such cases as huge algorithms requiring prodigious amounts of computing power can’t be used by most people nor are they practical for robots and cars without lightning-quick dependable connections to the cloud.

The demo was part of NVIDIA’s developer conference this week. Other highlights included a system for self-driving cars that aims to map 300000 miles of roads down to centimeters by 2024 and an AI supercomputer the company says will be fastest in the world upon release (a claim also made by Meta recently).

All this fits snugly into a larger narrative. The digital world is bleeding into the real world and vice versa. And not just books music photos documents and payments—but people places and infrastructure. Given NVIDIA’s chips excel at AI and graphics the company is well-positioned to have a hand in it all. Indeed not content with creating digital replicas of individual scenes the company has said it’s building a digital twin of the Earth too.

Granted it’s getting increasingly difficult to draw the line between marketing and sales pitches and serious developments. It’s not uncommon to see mashups of all tech’s top buzzwords—NFTs the metaverse AI blockchain—in one headline. But while vision seems to be outpacing capability there are plenty of hints we’ll get there sooner or later.

A mini AI that can turn a pile of polaroids into a 3D scene is just one of them.

To do this the researchers leveraged the power of AI more specifically through the so-called neural radiance fields. NeRFs use neural networks to reconstruct the scene from the images by predicting the color of light radiating in any direction. NVIDIA claims Instant NeRF to be the fastest technology of its kind yet allowing for a multiplicative speed-up of over 1000x in some instances so that rendering at 1080p occurs in mere milliseconds.

As discussed by Principal Research Scientist Thomas Muller in a GDC 2022 talk titled Instant Neural Graphics Primitives this compounded effect is the result of three main improvements: a task-specific GPU implementation of the rendering/training algorithm which uses the GPU's fine-grain control flow capabilities to be much faster than dense tensors; a fully fused implementation of a small neural network which is faster than general purpose matrix multiplication routines; lastly NVIDIA developed a technique called multiresolution hash grid encoding which is task agnostic and has better speed/quality tradeoff than preexisting work.

Unsurprisingly the model for Instant NeRF was developed with the CUDA Toolkit and the Tiny CUDA Neural Networks library. You can dive deeper into the research and even access its code on this page; according to NVIDIA the neural network is lightweight enough to run easily on a single GPU especially if it is equipped with Tensor Cores.

David Luebke vice president for graphics research at NVIDIA said in a statement:

If traditional 3D representations like polygonal meshes are akin to vector images NeRFs are like bitmap images: they densely capture the way light radiates from an object or within a scene. In that sense Instant NeRF could be as important to 3D as digital cameras and JPEG compression have been to 2D photography — vastly increasing the speed ease and reach of 3D capture and sharing.

The applications for the Instant NeRF technology can be many from quickly scanning real environments or persons so that game creators can then use the digital scans in their projects to training self-driving cars or robots to understand the shape and size of real objects.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9jdXN0b20tZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA5MC10aS1mZWF0dXJlcy1xdWFkLXNsb3QtY29vbGVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Custom GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Features Quad-Slot Cooler,"Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti promises to vie for a spot on the best graphics card for gaming when it becomes available in a week or two but this card will require a lot of power and a lot of cooling. Early pictures of GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics cards from Nvidia's partners show massive cooling systems that are 3.5 – 4 slots wide.

Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti reportedly uses a fully-fledged GA102 GPU with 10752 CUDA cores (up from 10496 on the GeForce RTX 3090) mated with 24GB of GDDR6X memory running at 21Gbps across a 384-bit interface. The unit has all the chances to become the world's fastest graphics card but this also means a rather extreme power consumption. Reports indicate that GeForce RTX 3090 Ti will have a recommended thermal board power (TBP) of around 450W. Still some of Nvidia's partners may go as high as a whopping 480W (it is better not to think how much such a board will cost and keep in mind that Nvidia's current GeForce RTX 3090 has a power rating of 350W).

But 450W – 480W or thermal power needs some excellent cooling and with air cooling things get complicated. Nvidia's GA102 is a highly complex GPU and with its 28.3 billion transistors it wants power. But GDDR6X memory with its PAM4 encoding also consumes a lot of power so the card emits vast amounts of heat.

This situation is where rather large cooling systems come into play. VideoCardz has gathered images of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti partners cards (including those from Colorful and EVGA); they are either 3.5 – 4 slots wide or hybrid liquid cooling.

A quad-slot cooling system is without any doubt remarkable. Yet it reminds us of some other graphics subsystems we have encountered before.

The year was 2006 and the battle for the best graphics subsystem between ATI Technologies and Nvidia was raging. It was then possible to increase graphics performance by adding GPUs into a subsystem so both Nvidia and ATI introduced their SLI and CrossFire 2-way GPU technologies. But this was not enough for Nvidia which thought there was some space for ultra-high-end graphics subsystems involving four GPUs.

To make those 4-way SLI possible Nvidia developed its dual-GPU GeForce 7900 GX2 (for PC OEMs for regular users it followed with GeForce 7950 GX2). Quad SLI did not work correctly (yet the interest towards that setup was extremely high) but it set the tone for extreme performance and power consumption.

Nvidia's GeForce 7900 GX2 consumed some 110W of power and required a hefty power supply unit (by the standards of 2006) and two of such cards needed 220W of power. Today a single chip with its top configuration running at high clocks can use some 450W or more. Funny this power consumption with a single graphics processor is comparable to that of four GPUs back in the day.

Then again Nvidia's GA102 is faster and more capable than nearly every GPU designed. So maybe it is worth it?"

It involves the very possible task of putting on a shirt while performing a wall-assisted handstand.

Be careful trying this at home.

On the path to peak quarantine celebrity: the Marvel Cinematic Universe members who are now Instagram-challenging each other to carpeted feats of strength balance and not-so-subtle Insta-flexing of their very sculpted back muscles.

“Okay thanks @Olieg for this impossible challenge” Tom Holland said on Instagram before doing a shirtless handstand against a wall and then putting on a Yankees T-shirt. He then nominated Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal.

Good to see Tom Holland's Spider-Man training is (somewhat) paying off 🙃

First off: Sucks for Mets nation that Queens native Peter Parker is actually a Bronx Bombers fan. It also sucks for Ryan who responded to the video by staring into his phone’s camera today for 12 seconds before exclaiming (Deadpool voice) “Noooo.”

Ryan Reynolds gives a very appropriate response after being tagged in Tom Holland's strenuous IG fitness challenge 😬



(via @VancityReynolds) pic.twitter.com/m792TGd1vD — Fandom (@getFANDOM) April 2 2020

But not to be outdone Jake answered doing the shirt trick faster (?) shouting out a local business (Russ & Daughters) and then challenging his sister Maggie Gyllenhaal.

Jake also had the added challenge of fitting the shirt over his man bun. So extra points for him!

Of course Ryan was right to find the challenge a bit unfair. Tom received dance and gymnastics training as a young(er) kid. And also he’s Spider-Man. Still Tom’s athleticism landed him in trouble once when he was peer pressured into attempting a backflip on-set. He ended up breaking his nose!

Needless to say the “impossible challenge” ought to be attempted carefully and with someone close by just in case. Always use a spotter.

Hill Sports Complex.



With the score tied at 10 Delaware took the lead on a goal from Lizzie Yurchak but two minutes later Claire Porter connected with Sydney Taylor as Taylor tied the score at 11 with 6:33 remaining. With 37 seconds left Swech got the ball at the top of the circle and raced to the front of the net and fired a shot just inside the left post for the game-winner.



Delaware (3-7) jumped out to a 3-0 lead two minutes in but Old Dominion (5-7) scored the next two from Lilly Siskind and Corrinne Stratton before Delaney McDaniel added another for UD to make the score 4-2.



The Monarchs responded with four-straight goals from four different players to take a 6-4 lead. Maddie Mullenbach pulled ODU to within one and Carolina Shaefer tied the score at four. Claire Porter gave ODU its first lead of the game and Taylor made it 6-4 early in the second quarter.



As was the theme of the game the Blue Hens scored twice to end the second quarter and send the game into halftime tied at six.



Siskind scored for the Monarchs early in the third quarter to give ODU a 7-6 advantage but Delaware scored and took the lead on goals from Kendra Schweizer and McDaniel.



Haley O'Connor knotted the score at eight and Mullenbach gave ODU the lead at 9-8. Stratton gave ODU a 10-8 lead but the Blue Hens again fought back to tie the score on goals from Lizzie Yurchak and Swech.



Jenna Peccia registered a career-high 20 saves for the Monarchs. The 20 saves is the second most by a goalie in a single game in the country so far this season.



Siskind had two goals and two assists while Taylor had two goals and an assist.



ODU concludes nonconference play and begins American Athletic Conference action next Saturday at ECU.

The Hornets' extra-inning win in the opener earned career win No. 650 for head coach Dawn Simmons. Lynchburg's mentor of 24 seasons became the 33rd softball coach in NCAA Division III history and the first from the ODAC to reach the milestone. She ranks 16th among active D3 coaches in wins.

Things did not start on the right foot for the Hornets. Lynchburg loaded the bases in the first inning of Game 1 but could not bring anyone in to score and the Royals drew first blood with three runs in the bottom half of the inning and held that 3-0 lead through two innings of play.

Lexi Powell led off the third with a single and came around to score on Karle Cundiff's RBI single to cut the lead to 3-1. Powell sparked another Hornet rally in the fifth with another leadoff single. With two out in the inning Kaleigh Hackett delivered a game-tying two-run single and Addison Walter followed with a two-run homer that put Lynchburg in the lead.

Down to their final out EMU rallied to tie the game at 5-5 in the bottom of the seventh sending the game into extra innings.

Lynchburg wasted no time regaining the lead. Gracie Dooley delivered a go-ahead single with one out in the top of the eighth bringing Hackett in to score and Kailey Dorcsis struck out the side in the bottom to cinch the milestone victory for Simmons and the Hornets.

Lynchburg had a similar flair for the dramatic in the nightcap. EMU took an early 3-0 lead with a trio of unearned runs against starter Emily Charlton . The Hornets came up with the answer in the top of the fourth. Powell got things going with a one-out base hit that Sophie Tully followed with a knock of her own. After a Royals error loaded the bases Cundiff slugged a grand slam to left field to put Lynchburg ahead 4-3.

EMU took advantage of another Lynchburg error to tie the game in the fourth and the teams went into the sixth inning tied 4-4.

Cundiff came to the plate with two outs in the top of the sixth and delivered another big hit an RBI double to right-center that plated Hackett and the Lynchburg third baseman came around on Walter's RBI single for a two-run Hornet lead.

Lynchburg scored twice more in the top of the seventh on RBI hits by Anna Grace Terrell and Tully and Charlton polished off the complete-game victory in the seventh. The lefty scattered seven Royals hits and allowed just one earned run for her fifth win of 2022.

The Hornets (11-11 2-0 ODAC) will look to keep the winning streak alive Sunday with a home doubleheader against Bridgewater. Lynchburg softball will celebrate Military Appreciation Day prior to the 1:30 p.m. first pitch.

Now they’ll return to competitive golf for the first time in over a month.

After a week of training in Florida over spring break the Iowa women’s golf team will return to action at the Chattanooga Classic March 27-29.

Counting Iowa the Tennessee-based tournament boasts a 21-team field. Iowa will be joined at Council Fire Golf Club by Central Arkansas Chattanooga Colorado State Duke East Carolina East Tennessee State Florida Atlantic Florida International Indiana James Madison Middle Tennessee State Murray State North Florida Old Dominion Samford Southern Miss UTSA Wisconsin and Yale.

Iowa’s lineup for the Chattanooga Classic will include freshman Paula Miranda senior Dana Lerner and juniors Lea Zeitler Jacque Galloway and Morgan Goldstein.

Iowa head coach Megan Menzel said her players worked hard on their games during the Hawkeyes’ spring break trip to the Sunshine State. Iowa played four different courses while it was in Florida.

“We had a great trip” Menzel told The Daily Iowan. “We got to play four really phenomenal golf courses. We played each day so I think it stretched their golf games and also their minds. We got great feedback on our games just being able to be on grass and playing for the four days. So very productive week for us.”

Course management was a point of emphasis for Miranda and her teammates while they were in Florida.

“It was really fun” Miranda said of Iowa’s trip. “I think getting used to hitting on grass again and just working on our course management skills [was important].”

Iowa hasn’t had many opportunities to hit on real grass in Iowa City. Colder temperatures have kept the Hawkeyes off the course and inside their practice facility. As a result Iowa has been hitting off artificial grass mats for much of this year.

Miranda also noted that she struggled on the greens during spring break slowly adjusting to new putting surfaces each day. To counteract the problems she’s had Miranda has been working diligently on the pace of her putting stroke.

“I’ve always kind of struggled with a bit of pace a bit of our rhythm in my putting so all those changes kind of messed me up a bit” Miranda said. “But I got back to the basics here at the facility and I’ve been working on it the past few days. So I think I can easily get it back into a good place.”

Menzel believes Council Fire Golf Club will be a good track for the Hawkeyes to get back into the swing of competitive golf. Iowa hasn’t played in a tournament in more than a month.

I think it’ll set up nicely for us” Menzel said. “Just like any golf course I think ball striking is going to be the key but it looks like also we want to make sure that we leave the ball in the correct spots around the greens. It’s well-bunkered in areas.”

Iowa finished second in the 2021 Chattanooga Classic’s 12-team field. The event was held at Black Creek Club last year.

Goldstein and Galloway each posted top-five finishes at last year’s Chattanooga Classic. Zeitler ended tournament play in 48th place.

Getting married at the age of 17 and still chasing her dreams with all the growing responsibility — even passing her first advanced calculus class with an “A” without being acquainted with English this Muslim woman has been defying the odds since the second she stepped into the U.S. With her three simple yet empowering principles Amer has become one of the leading Muslim women that are laying a solid foundation for many Muslim girls to unapologetically break into STEM and chase their dreams.

As we head into Muslim Women’s Day we sat with Amer to talk about her journey as one of the Muslim women of NASA: how she got there what inspired her to pursue her career path and how she currently navigates her life as the Program Executive for the Earth Science Division in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters.

Muslim Girl: How did you end up working at NASA?

Tahani Amer: NASA is my dream job. I have been working at NASA for over 30 years. I started when I was an undergraduate at Old Dominion University in Norfolk VA. I collaborated with NASA during my senior research project. It was a great opportunity and an exciting experience to work with the best talent in the world to advance aeronautics and technology.

The Virginia Space Consortium supported my entry into NASA programs by providing grants to excelling women engineers and scientists. I was the first woman to be selected for the program. After I successfully completed my project and graduated I applied for a job at NASA.

Muslim Girl: What is a typical day for you in the work that you do?

Tahani Amer: When I first started as an engineer I worked in a laboratory developing instruments for wind tunnels to measure drag on the fuselage of airplanes to improve aerodynamic performance. After that I worked in different positions at NASA that expanded my love of science and NASA’s goals. I worked in the Technology Development Mission Directorate the Independent Program Assessment Office that evaluates other NASA major programs and wind tunnels experiments; and in the Computational Fluid Dynamics Project (CFD).

Currently I am the Program Executive for the Earth Science Division in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. I lead and serve as the technical and programmatic expert for complex agency programs supporting the Earth Science Division. My projects are very important to NASA and to our planet Earth. My missions are Geostationary Carbon Cycle Observatory (GeoCarb) Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) and Atmosphere Observing System (AOS).

Tahani Amer / SWOT Satellite in NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) cleanroom

Muslim Girl: What’s your favorite part of what you do in a day?

Tahani Amer: My favorite part of the day is when we solve a problem on a project or when we come to an agreement that a certain path is the right one. It is a challenge working on multiple projects with different time zones and several parts of the world with our international partners to acquire scientific knowledge to understand our home planet.

Muslim Girl: What else do you like to do when you’re not focused on NASA engineering stuff? What are some of your other interests?

Tahani Amer: I live by three simple principles: 1) Please God and you will please all. 2) Education is the key to opportunity. 3) Serve others with compassion and kindness. The third principle inspires me to volunteer a great deal. My favorite is volunteering to support mosques activities and conduct outreach education to schools synagogues and churches to share Muslim women’s rights.

Tahani Amer / Public service award in NASA’s headquarters

Muslim Girl: Who inspires you?

Tahani Amer: I have so many but the first and perhaps most important was my father Reffat Ayoub. He is the one who gave me my backbone and my confidence. He encouraged me to do everything I wanted within the limit of the values of our religion.

Muslim Girl: What are your deepest values and how as a Muslim woman? Does your faith impact your career?

Tahani Amer: My faith not only impacts my career but the structure of my whole life. I live by the guidance of my faith and I wouldn’t do it any other way. Faith gives you a structure it gives you inspiration and it gives you a purpose.

For me there’s no conflict between faith and career because if you have faith your career is going to excel automatically. Faith encourages you to do your utmost in everything.

Tahani Amer / An illustration from “Muslim Women Are Everything” by Seema Yasmin featuring Tahani’s accomplishment

Muslim Girl: Do some people think that there’s a conflict between having faith and being somebody in science? What do you say to that kind of thinking?

Tahani Amer: Scientific discoveries are confirmed by faith. The more knowledge I acquire in a scientific sense it only reinforces what I’ve already known to be true from a spiritual sense.

Muslim Girl: What kind of prejudices if any did you have to face? In some countries such as France wearing the hijab or headscarf at work has been prohibited by the law. As a brilliant woman that proudly wears the hijab if ever how did it affect your career?

Tahani Amer: It does happen unfortunately and I think a lot of it comes from a lack of awareness and understanding. September 11th for example affected all of us and my goal during that time was to reach out to the community around me to provide education and develop a relationship of trust showing people I — and people like me — are part of the mixing pot and the fabric of America.

Muslim Girl: Do you feel that you’ve ever had any challenges specifically you’ve had to deal with that you don’t think a man would have to deal with?

Tahani Amer: Luckily we’ve seen lots of great strides for women over the past30 years at NASA I always felt very fortunate because we work hard to have an environment of inclusion and diversity.

Muslim Girl: What are some changes that need to happen to make science more attractive to women and get more women in the field?

Tahani Amer: Encourage girls and women; support their interests help them to develop their skills and have fun with STEM. For Muslim countries in particular I try to communicate that in Islam it was never said that women don’t work. The Prophet peace be upon him used to work for a woman — his wife. She was a businesswoman. So where did we get this notion that women shouldn’t work? I try to emphasize there’s a difference between religion and culture.

Muslim Girl: What is a funny or memorable thing that has happened to you while working in science?

Tahani Amer: One of the funniest moments is when I got stuck in a wind tunnel. I was installing a probe in the tunnel so I was crawling around inside it when all of a sudden my scarf got caught on the wall of the tunnel and a whole team of people had to stop what they were doing and come help me get unstuck.

Muslim Girl: What is your number one piece of advice to young Muslim girls that you would pass on?

Tahani Amer: I have my own Equation of Success: (IP3 + R) / T. The explanation of the equation is Imagination multiplied by the three P’s of Passion Perseverance and Planning plus Relationships over Time equal Success."

Ajit Manocha president and CEO of SEMI says: “Crossing the $100 billion mark in spending on global fab equipment for the first time is a historic ​milestone for the semiconductor industry.

“This ​significant achievement is a tribute to the relentless drive to add and upgrade capacity to address a diverse range of markets and emerging applications solidifying expectations for long-term industry growth to enable electronics for the digital world.”

Sanjay Malhotra vice president of corporate marketing and the market intelligence team at SEMI says: “Global fab equipment spending is forecast to have another healthy year in 2023 and is expected to remain above the $100 billion mark.

“We expect global semiconductor capacity to maintain steady growth this year and in 2023.”

Fab equipment spending by region

Taiwan is expected to lead fab equipment spending in 2022 increasing investments 56 percent YoY to $35 billion followed by Korea at $26 billion a 9 percent rise and China at $17.5 billion a 30 percent drop from its peak last year.

Europe/Mideast is forecast to log record high spending of $9.6 billion this year and while comparatively smaller this would represent a staggering growth of 248 percent YoY.

Taiwan Korea and Southeast Asia are also expected to register record high investments in 2022. In the Americas the report shows fab equipment spending peaking at $9.8 billion by 2023.

Industry continues to boost capacity

The SEMI World Fab Forecast report shows the global industry increasing capacity 8 percent this year after a 7 percent rise in 2021.

Capacity growth is expected to continue increasing rising 6 percent in 2023. The fab equipment industry last saw a YoY growth rate of 8 percent in 2010 when it topped 16 million wafers per month (200mm equivalents) – nearly half of the 29 million wafers per month (200mm equivalents) projected for 2023.

Over 83 percent of equipment spending in 2022 will stem from capacity increases at 150 fabs and production lines a proportion expected to edge down to 81 percent next year as 122 known fabs and lines add capacity.

As expected the foundry sector with a share of about 50 percent will account for the bulk of equipment spending in 2022 and 2023 followed by memory at 35 percent. The two sectors also represent most of the capacity increases.

The SEMI World Fab Forecast report lists 1426 facilities and lines globally including 124 future facilities and lines with various probabilities that are expected to start volume production no sooner than 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy92aWRlb3MvMjAyMi0wMy0yOC9hc21pLXNpbmdhcG9yZS1leHBhbnNpb24tcmVmbGVjdHMtc3Ryb25nLWdyb3d0aC1hbWJpdGlvbi12aWRlb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ASMI: Singapore Expansion Reflects Strong Growth Ambitions,"Why did this happen?

The delays in receiving brand new fully equipped cars coupled with a confluence of other factors such high Certificate of Entitlement (COE) prices have left some car buyers here turning to second-hand cars instead dealers have told TODAY.

The global semiconductor supply has been hit since 2020 due the Covid-19 pandemic as well as tensions between the United States and China.

Supply has recently been exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war. Ukraine is a major supplier of wire harnesses which are a critical component of vehicles.

The supply crunch has affected the production of electronic devices in which semiconductors are predominantly used such as smartphones computers and cars.

MISSING FEATURES IN NEW CARS

In Singapore some new cars have been arriving since last year without some added frills.

Mr Lars Nielsen the managing director of BMW Group Asia said that certain features such as touchscreen functionality digital key and wireless charging are currently unavailable in some of the brand’s vehicles in Singapore.

Last year about 30 per cent of BMW vehicles in Singapore had at least one feature omitted due to the shortage in semiconductors said Mr Nielsen.

Mr Abel Eng the director of dealership CarBiz said that components of steering wheels and communication modules were also removed in some cars arriving here.

Mr Eng said he did not have specific information of which car models were more affected by the shortage in semiconductors but said it was “common knowledge” that car manufacturers will divert available parts to models that make the most money.

For example they will divert available semiconductor parts to “high profit margin low volume” cars such as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class model over “high volume low profit margin cars” such as the Mercedes-Benz C-Class model he explained.

The semiconductor supply crunch has meant longer-than-usual delays in the shipment of new cars said car dealers.

Mr Eng said that before the Covid-19 pandemic when there was no disruption to the semiconductor supply the wait for a new car was between three and six months.

But since the disruption started a car can take up to nine months to be delivered. This waiting time has now been lengthened by a further three months due to the Russia-Ukraine war said Mr Eng.

Mr Nielsen of BMW said he was unable to specify how long more buyers would have to wait for fully equipped BMW cars due to the “fluid” situation.

Likewise a spokesperson for Daimler Southeast Asia which manufactures Mercedes-Benz cars said that the delay in delivery times would vary depending on the model and the equipment of the individual models.

Nevertheless Mr Raymond Tang the managing director of Yong Lee Seng Motor said that the semiconductor shortage was not affecting the prices of cars in Singapore as these are mainly determined by COE.

Some agents also bring in cars with missing features first and then ship in the necessary parts to make them fully equipped he added.

DELAYED CAR SHIPMENTS

Car dealers said that they observed an increase in customers turning to used cars in recent times.

Mr Daniel Ng the general manager of used car distributor Eurokars Pre-Owned said that the company has seen a 20 per cent increase in sales for pre-owned vehicles between last November and this February.

Both Mr Eng and Mr Tang estimated that about 50 per cent more of their customers are picking up second-hand cars this year compared to last year.

Mr Eng pinned the increase on a “confluence of factors” including the delay in shipment of new cars high COE prices as well as a higher tax on luxury cars imposed last month.

COE prices for cars went up at the end of the latest bidding exercise last Wednesday. Premiums for small cars closed at S$71556 while those for larger cars closed at S$98889.

Mr Tang added that customers were also choosing resale over new cars as the former afforded more price certainty.

With resale cars customers are certain of their car prices as these are based on prevailing COE prices.

In the case of new cars however the COE prices could go up by the time the shipment arrives in Singapore said Mr Tang.

WHAT BUYERS SAY

Mr Mark Koh said that he was deterred from buying a new car due to the high cost.

But even if they were affordable the 30-year-old sales manager said that he would still prefer a pre-owned car rather than a new car without frills like a touch screen as “technology is something I would want in a good car”.

Similarly a 42-year-old buyer who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan said that he prefers an older car model with all features included rather than a new car with missing features.

Mr Tan who works in a bank said that carmakers should only release cars with all features intact as consumers may overlook the missing features but end up paying the same price.

One buyer however said he will still buy a new car as he does not want a resale car that might be defective.

The buyer 30-year-old dentist Bobby Tan is willing to buy a new car even if it comes without certain features and faces shipment delays.

He said: “I am just looking to get something that can get me from one point to another.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vYmVybmFtYS5jb20vZW4vYnVzaW5lc3MvbmV3cy5waHA_aWQ9MjA2NTk3NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TITIJAYA DHL TO DEVELOP SEMICONDUCTOR LOGISTIC FACILITY,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='bernama.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /en/business/news.php?id=2065975 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000027D658CEBF0>, 'Connection to bernama.com timed out.

SailGP announced a multi-year partnership Thursday with blockchain development platform NEAR that will allow sailing and cryptocurrency fans to engage with their favorite teams and athletes in new ways.

The announcement came ahead of SailGP’s Season 2 finale the Mubadala United States Sail Grand Prix in San Francisco which will culminate with Sunday’s $1 million winner-take-all podium race.

SailGP features most of the world’s top sailors including America’s Cup winners and Olympic gold medalists who race aboard wingsailed 50-foot catamarans that can reach 60 mph while skimming above the waves on hydrofoils. SailGP will expand from eight to 10 national teams for its third season.

While the agreement with NEAR is expected to have many benefits for fans including NFTs the highlight would be ownership of a sailing team by a community of token-holders known as a DAO or decentralized autonomous organization.

The SailGP DAO would differ from traditional sports team structures in which a single owner or a small group calls the shots said SailGP co-founder Russell Coutts and NEAR Foundation CEO Marieke Flament. The DAO could involve people from all over the world who vote on everything from the management structure to the length of the skipper’s contract and could even decide whether there should be a woman steering the boat.

""That’s in some ways why this is so exciting"" Coutts said in a video interview. ""This is groundbreaking technology a groundbreaking initiative. We don’t believe it’s been done before especially on this scale. And when you think about it with our events being all over the world as well we’re not just in one particular territory. That’s of interest as well.""

CRYPTO FOR UKRAINE PROVIDES A FLOW OF WAR-RELATED ASSISTANCE

Coutts a New Zealander who has won the America’s Cup five times said he expects a DAO would attract more than just sailors. ""I think sports fans racing fans businesspeople tech people … you can imagine this being a very diverse group of people and they would probably feed off each other’s skills"" Coutts said. ""The whole concept of ‘Hey we’d like to have a say in what’s going on’ that will appeal to a lot of people out there.""

Coutts said a DAO would have to be viable enough for SailGP to sell it a position as a team operator.

Coutts and Ellison the co-founder of Oracle Corp. started SailGP after their two-time defending champion Oracle Team USA was routed by Emirates Team New Zealand in the 2017 America’s Cup. They re-engineered the 50-foot catamarans used in that regatta and formed an annual circuit with regattas around the world.

Tom Slingsby an Olympic gold medalist and former America’s Cup champion steered Team Australia to the inaugural championship and $1 million prize in 2019. Slingsby and Team USA skipper Jimmy Spithill a two-time America’s Cup winner have qualified for Sunday’s $1 million winner-take-all race that will decide the pandemic-delayed Season 2 championship. The final spot will be determined by five fleet races this weekend.

For Season 2 SailGP has been using Oracle Stream Analytics to provide real-time race metrics that are available to the sailors as well as fans watching on TV or online.

Coutts said one reason for partnering with NEAR is that it’s carbon-neutral which fits the league’s goal of being environmentally responsible.

""We want to be leading in terms of tech whether it’s our boats our media interactions with our fans"" Coutts added. ""We want to be modern and leading. We want to be at the forefront not just what’s happening today but we want to be looking at and leading what’s happening tomorrow.

Flament said NEAR was looking for a partner ""who was willing to innovate and when I look at SailGP and the amount of data and innovation and what’s being done with that I think it’s amazing.

On Friday Yemeni rebels blew up an oil depot 11 kilometers from the race track in Jeddah—minutes before the second practice session was set to begin. After assurances from government security forces F1 leadership decided to go ahead with the race weekend as scheduled. Then Mercedes star Lewis Hamilton was knocked out in the first qualifier and Haas star Mick Schumacher withdrew with an injury following a scary crash in the second qualifier.

The steady drip of unfortunate events took some luster off what is otherwise shaping up to be a stellar season at least if audience growth and dollars are any indicators.

For 2022 top teams Mercedes and Red Bull are expected to generate $190.5 million from title sponsorships according to GlobalData analysts. Mercedes retained its partnership with Petronas the Malaysian oil and gas company while Red Bull has signed a new deal with Oracle—its first title sponsor since 2018.

“The deal with Oracle offers substantial revenue for the team and is a testament to how far the sport has come in the American market recently” said Jake Kemp an analyst with GlobalData. “Oracle has a limited sports sponsorship portfolio linked primarily with U.S.-based properties such as the Golden State Warriors the Indian Wells tennis tournament and Team USA at the America’s Cup.”

For the year 60% of the teams boast an official title partner which is the most lucrative offering available and the total estimated value of title sponsorship deals signed with F1 is likely to be “in the region $326.5 million” said Conrad Wiacek Global Data’s head of sports. “In 2020 this figure was $272 million and in 2021 this was $230.5 million which was due to COVID-19’s impact on the sport.”

Not every teams has been so fortunate with its title sponsorships. Ferrari ended its 38-season affiliation with Phillip Morris and Haas terminated its Uralkali backing after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ferrari has since signed other major sponsorship agreements with Spanish bank Santander software giant Qualcomm and Swiss-based blockchain company Velas Network AG to fill the $160 million-a-year hole left by Phillip Morris.

F1’s combined team sponsor income including all sponsorships beyond title deals will be worth an estimated $961.25 million. Eight out of 10 teams have a cryptocurrency- or NFT-related partnership and Red Bull’s contract with Bybit reportedly worth $150 million is among the most lucrative. And Oracle is not the only U.S.-based company getting involved. A week before the new season started in Bahrain McLaren announced a multi-year partnership with Google.

Not to be left out of the action Formula One itself signed a $100 million agreement with Crypto.com and the company was recently announced as the title sponsor of the new Miami Grand Prix. F1 is also about to sign a 30-year deal with Salesforce according to Sky News and it’s expected to confirm a second U.S. race in the near future.

Wiacek said the sport’s growing popularity in the U.S. relates to the success of Netflix’s Drive to Survive. “What the series really does is bring the sport in front of new fans” said Ian Holmes director of media rights of F1. According to F1 the 2021 season finale in Abu Dhabi had a 108.7 million TV viewers 29% higher than the same race in 2020 and higher than the Superbowl globally.

Formula One’s surging popularity goes beyond couches across America. Last season’s three Grands Prix (COTA Mexico City and British Grand Prix) saw weekend attendance spike past 350000 spectators coming in at 400000 371000 and 356000 respectively.

However ransomware doesn't occur in a vacuum according to security startup Lumu Technologies.

A ransomware infection is usually preceded by what Lumu founder and CEO Ricardo Villadiego calls ""precursor malware"" essentially reconnaissance malicious code that has been around for a while and which lays the groundwork for the full ransomware campaign to come. Find and remediate that precursor malware and a company can ward off the ransomware attack is the theory.

""The moment you see your network – and by network I mean the network defined the modern times whatever you have on premises whatever is out in the clouds whatever you have with your remote users – when you see any assets from your network contacting an adversarial infrastructure eliminate that contact because that puts you in your zone of maximum resistance to attacks"" Villadiego told The Register.

If a company detects their network is contacting what looks like the command-and-control servers of malware such as Emotet Phorpiex SmokeLoader Dridex and TrickBot shutting down those contacts right away ""is going to eliminate the catastrophic effect which is the ransomware attack"" he said.

Lumu outlined the idea of the warning signs of an impending ransomware attack in a quick report – what the company calls a ""flashcard"" – this month. In it the startup outlines what it says is a vicious cycle of ransomware.

Citing statistics from cybersecurity consultancy CyberEdge Lumu said that victims that pay the ransom are increasingly recovering their data from 19.4 percent in 2018 to 71.6 percent last year. This has made companies more willing to pay the ransom – 38.7 percent in 2018 57 percent now – despite recommendations and pleas from the government and cybersecurity experts not to pay.

With more companies paying threat groups are incentivized to run ransomware attacks and invest more money into their efforts the Lumu researchers wrote adding that result is more infections. Several US agencies – the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) FBI and NSA – joined counterparts in the UK and Australia in February in issuing a joint advisory that indicated the threat of ransomware around the world will increase this year.

Addressing the precursor malware when it arises can reduce the incidence of ransomware it's claimed. Of the more than 2000 companies Lumu monitors every ransomware attack came with other malware preceding it and paving the way.

""When we see the companies that were affected there were a lot of signs that were happening months – and in some cases more than three months – before they were affected by the ransomware attack"" Villadiego said. ""When you see a network that is contacting these precursors of ransomware there are other pieces of malware that cause less harm.""

The precursor malware will spread laterally through a company's network and devices escalating access before a ransomware package is deployed he said. Security pros within the company may see some kind of activity and assume their firewalls or endpoint detection and response (EDR) software has caught it and protected them whereas it's just the precursor that was picked up. At the same time a company's security operations may be flooded with unrelated alerts that they are paying more attention to than that of the precursor malware he said.

Meanwhile the bad actors are being given months to set up a ransomware outbreak the CEO said.

""What we make clear to the companies that we're protecting is your point of maximum resistance to attacks is your point of lesser contact"" he said. ""Whatever that infrastructure is that is going to be one of maximum resistance to attack ... My advice to security operators is to deal with small problems so you don't have to deal with a catastrophic event of a ransomware attack. And what is a small problem? A small problem in security is when your network is starting to contact these adversarial infrastructures which typically goes unnoticed and typically doesn't create an event that compels the operators to act.""

The company identified the malware backend that was most often detected being contacted. At the top of the list is Emotet a banking trojan first discovered in 2014 that later evolved to include spamming and malware delivery services. Among the other malware were Phorpiex (a botnet first seen in 2016 that later included crypto-jacking and spreading ransomware) SmokeLoader (a backdoor for malware delivery) Dridex (known for stealing bank credentials) and TrickBot (a banking trojan).

Villadiego in 2018 founded Lumu based in Doral Florida. The company which raised $7.5m in Series A funding a year ago and has about 80 employees offers the Continuous Compromise Assessment model which enables organizations to measure compromises within their systems in real time and automate the mitigation responses. The technology integrates with security tools enterprises are already using delivers intelligence about compromises and lets organizations intentionally hunt for compromises.

Lumu assesses and collects information from such aspects as DNS queries network flows access logs firewalls and proxies and correlates the data to identify whether any asset is trying to contact an adversarial infrastructure. Having that information enables organizations to end such contacts.

Enterprises are spending millions of dollars on security products and managed security services providers (MSSPs) but often their security teams are not looking for compromises.

""It's hard to find something that we're not looking for"" he said adding that many assume that their organization is secure. ""That is the wrong mindset and the breaches that have happened demonstrate that. A better way to operate is by assuming you're compromised and let your network prove otherwise. Let the network prove you're not."" ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3MvdXMtZG9taW5hdGVzLWdsb2JhbC1jbG91ZC1kYXRhLWNlbnRlci1mb290cHJpbnQtY2FwYWNpdHkvMjAyMi8wMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Dominates Global Cloud Data Center Footprint Capacity,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/us-dominates-global-cloud-data-center-footprint-capacity/2022/03/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3MvdXMtZG9taW5hdGVzLWdsb2JhbC1jbG91ZC1kYXRhLWNlbnRlci1mb290cHJpbnQtY2FwYWNpdHkvMjAyMi8wMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

The series is based on the popular xBox game Halo which debuted in 2001. The game has sold 82 million copies worldwide and grossed more than $6 billion in total sales revenue.

Having a hit would give Paramount Plus a boost as it seeks to compete in the high-stakes big-money competition among the streaming services looking to compete with Netflix.

While the older female demographic has been known to be cautious about moviegoing during the pandemic they indeed showed up at 61% overall with those over 35 repping close to half the crowd. Previously over Valentine’s Day weekend two-glossy female targeted movies tried to deliver but did not in their openings: Death on the Nile ($12.8M) and Marry Me ($7.9M).

Moreover give it up for an original piece of content opening at the box office off of sheer star power and not brand IP.

“It’s kind of a throwback” says Paramount Domestic Distribution Boss Chris Aronson this morning. “But it shows that movies still matter.”

Sandra Bullock Paramount Studios president Brian Robbins producer Liza Chasin and Daniel Radcliffe at the SXSW world premiere of ‘Lost City’ AP

“This is very much a crowd-pleasing movie and it points toward people want to laugh and they want to be entertained after the last two years we’ve been through” added Aronson about feature comedy’s return at the B.O.

Lost City‘s debut ranks second for Paramount during the pandemic behind A Quiet Place Part II ($47.5M). It’s the studio’s third movie to open at No 1 this year after Scream and Jackass Forever.

In the switch-off from Jim Gianopulos to Brian Robbins as Paramount Studios boss the latter was immediately painted by the media as a guy who was primed to embrace theatrical day-and-date as Paramount Global board chair Shari Redstone looked to mushroom the studio’s fledgling streaming service Paramount+. Not true: This guy isn’t going to burn down a great theatrical slate to keep warm. His talent and experience is in building franchises and that’s on the streaming and the theatrical side.

As the box office bounces back industry executives are reminded about the riches inherent in the ancillary model especially in the streaming age. Even though Marvel departed Paramount for Disney a while ago the former studio is still franchise-rich in its Nickelodeon Hasbro etc. IP and that’s currency which will go a long way for a long time. Even the younger-skewing stuff when made at the right price is a box office cash cow.

Talking to Deadline at SXSW Bullock said that she had read Lost City a few years ago “But I said ‘No’ this is outdated it had been on the shelf for seven years.”

“Then it was brought back to me by Elizabeth Raposo who was at Paramount at that time and she said ‘You can do what you want with it.” adds the Oscar winning actress who is also a producer there.

“As soon as you’re given that allowance you can see things that you couldn’t see before because there weren’t a bunch of attachments to it” adds Bullock.

She called producer Liza Chasin to develop the project and they found their hook in Couples Retreat and Cruella scribe Dana Fox.

“You know how hard it is to find a writer with this tone of action comedy drama it’s not easy and Dana Fox is one of the top writers for that very reason” says Bullock. The Nee Brothers who were hot around town with their VFX pitch of Bumblebee won Chasin and Bullock over with the film ultimately shooting down in the Dominican Republic during Covid for a reported net budget of $68M.

“Sandy set out to make a movie to entertain people and boy did people respond” adds Aronson.

Check out our video interview with Bullock and Radcliffe here:

Bullock didn’t speculate on a sequel at interview time. However if she’s making something that’s greater than Lost City it’s with Fox.

Lost City‘s weekend number is in the range from other Bullock pre-pandemic openers such as the comedy The Heat ($39M) and The Proposal ($34M). It’s a number many in distribution circles were expecting and continues to prove that theatrical isn’t broken especially for comedies and female-driven fare which have largely been jettisoned to streamers. Comedies still work on the big screen and Lost City played like a rock concert during its world premiere at SXSW at the Paramount Theatre on March 12.

Box office analytics corp EntTelligence clocked 935K admissions for Lost City‘s opening day and 2.6M admissions for the weekend. The average ticket price for the pic was $11.66. The major circuits didn’t upcharge on Lost City like they did for Batman. Saturday matinees were strong for Lost City with over 46% of the audience coming before 5PM. Approximately 36% of the audience came between 5PM and 8PM and 18% came after 8PM.

The Lost City overperformed west of the Mississippi and was at norm in the Southeast. Canada repped 7.54% market share on 8% of total locations. Top markets that overperformed included Salt Lake City Phoenix Denver Tampa Minneapolis Portland OR Kansas City Indianapolis Albuquerque Honolulu and Oklahoma City while the top markets that under-indexed include NY Chicago Houston Atlanta Philadelphia and Boston. Top grossing theaters hailed from LA Orlando Salt Lake City Albuquerque NYC San Antonio Phoenix Pharr TX OKC El Paso Denver Nashville Dallas Canton OH Colorado Springs and Toronto.

Premium large format screens we hear are driving 21% of ticket sales. Diversity demos were 61% Caucasian 21% Latino and Hispanic 6% Black and 7% Asian. Cinemascore here is a B+ with 81% on PostTrak and a 61% recommend which is very good for this type of movie right now. Rotten Tomatoes’ audience meter is a bit higher at 86%.

Ahead of opening social media monitor RelishMix spotted positive conversation for Lost City with those online “making unending comparisons to Romancing the Stone and The Jewel Of The Nile — with enthusiasm for the playful onscreen chemistry of Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum and boiling screams of joy for Brad Pitt.” Total reach across Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram and TikTok combined is 125.3M social media followers “exceeding genre norms for action-adventure-comedy” says RelishMix with Tatum posts spiking with a super Instagram post at 3.1M views plus a solid stack of YouTube materials driving 56.6M views.

Tatum is the social media champ here for the pic engaging 45.6M fans and driving cast activation on the film at 96% while also repping 36% of the pic’s entire SMU reach. Other cast members Bullock Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt are hot topics in social chatter but are socially off-the-grid.

The Lost City campaign launched with a trailer in December with a custom intro by Bullock Tatum and Radcliffe which ultimately yielded over 170M views to date. Ad spots ran during the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LVI. iSpot estimates that Paramount spent $27M on TV ads stateside across NBC (27.8%) ESPN (6.6%) CBS (4.9%) ABC (4.8%) and Food Network (4.3%) with ads also running on Survivor Sports Center and Today.

Warner Bros.

While we have some depth in the box office chart with The Batman seeing a fourth weekend of $20.5M RRR now seeing the second-best opening for an Indian movie at $9.5M stateside and Spider-Man: No Way Home clicking past $800M we’re still used to seeing more depth at the weekend box office. All ticket sales look to be coming in at $81.5M which is 45% off of weekend 12 in 2019. That’s when Universal’s Us drove all movies to a $148.8M weekend. Looking under the hood of that weekend Jordan Peele’s Us rang up a $71.1M opening while Disney’s third weekend of Captain Marvel did $34.2M.

Pen Studios

The ticket prices for the three-hour action movie RRR which includes an intermission are being charged at specialty event prices at $22.54 per seat according to EntTelligence. The pic is booked at 1200 theaters and notched a $4.5M Thursday preview the highest ever recorded for an Indian title in US/Canada.

Unfortunately Saturday ticket sales fell apart according to industry estimates with $2.5M making S.S. Ramajouli’s RRR the second best opening for an Indian movie stateside after his own stateside record with 2017’s Baahubali 2: The Conclusion which opened to $10.4M and finaled at $20.8M per Comscore. RRR played best in the East and the South with the top 10 theater delivering over $50K and 46 bookings seeing over $25K. Specialty cinema is very much alive and it’s with Indian epics.

With the major studios not sopping up all the theaters just yet Bleecker Street took its Naomi Watts thriller Infinite Storm much wider than intended with 1525 theaters in 187 markets. The survival mountain climber blizzard movie didn’t wow critics at 59% rotten and froze out PostTrak audiences at 55%. Any money came from the coasts with NYC Lincoln Square doing $2K to date. Friday looks to be $262K and the weekend a not-very-powerful $7512K for a $492 theater average for a No. 10 slot.

A24

Also in another big plus sign for arthouses during the pandemic is the Daniels’ martial arts fantasy Everything Everywhere All at Once which racked up a $2039K Friday at ten theaters for a $20K average and very strong numbers across the board in NYC LA and respectable results in San Francisco where the pic is booked at the New Mission Metreon & Kabuki. The opening for the AGBO produced movie per A23 is $5096K. That’s a $50965 theater average which is the second-best opening theater average during the pandemic for a platform release after MGM/UAR’s Licorice Pizza ($86K) — and the best opening theater average of 2022 to date. The Daniels’ previous A24 movie Swiss Army Man opened to $1054K in three theaters back in June 2016 for a $351K theater average. Bravo A24.

A24 is looking to make this a platform arthouse event similar to its 2014 spring hit Ex Machina but even bigger with an Imax screening event across top markets on Wednesday ahead of a nationwide launch on April 8. Already there were sold-out Imax engagements with exit polls in the 90s. As we told you prior A24 fired Everything Everywhere All at Once off at SXSW’s opening night to a rapturous response.

On the other end of the arthouse spectrum there’s Sony Pictures Classics’ Mothering Sunday a very naughty R-rated Merchant-Ivory type of film by filmmaker Eva Husson about a maid living in post-World War I England who secretly plans to meet with the man she loves before he leaves to marry another woman. The pic which launched at Cannes last summer got a 76% from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. That score needs to be higher to draw this cautious over 50 crowd back. Five runs in NY and LA are seeing an estimated $107K for a low $21K per theater.

In regards to the Oscar’s halo effect for Best Picture nominees it’s sad — there really wasn’t that much nor did these films really wow on streaming as we previously reported. Should Coda take home Best Picture tonight the boom will be in subscriptions.

Friday AM: The first big studio wide release in three weeks Paramount’s The Lost City kicked off at 4 p.m. Thursday in 3400 theaters for a $2.5M take. I understand that number doesn’t include any of the previous weekend’s Fandango previews or those at the AMC earlier in the week.

The Sandra Bullock-Channing Tatum-Brad Pitt-Daniel Radcliff romantic comedy adventure is expected to hit $25M at 4248 but it would not be shocking if it lands in the $30M range. Rotten Tomatoes reviews are at 75% fresh. Overall it’s a solid weekend for exhibition and we’re hearing that the Indian movie RRR should be ringing up $12M at 1000 theaters this weekend.

The top theaters for The Lost City on Thursday came from Los Angeles Orlando New York City Albuquerque Salt Lake City Pharr (Texas) Miami Colorado Springs El Paso and Sacramento showing a good breadth of regional appeal for the pic.

It’s tricky.

TL;DR:

Taylor Sheridan was a struggling actor for years before becoming one of the most sought-after writers and directors in the industry.

The Yellowstone creator just made a very big very real group purchase with the Four Sixes Ranch.

What is Sheridan’s net worth? It’s kind of tricky to figure out.

Taylor Sheridan has been making some serious money moves over the past couple of years. The Yellowstone creator signed a nine-figure deal with Paramount Global (formerly Viacom CBS) in early 2020 to bring a number of series to streamer Paramount+.

A year later he renewed the deal for even more cash. Then he led a group of investors who just purchased one of the largest ranches in West Texas — the Four Sixes. Now that his purchase of those quarter-million acres has officially closed fans are wondering — what is Taylor Sheridan’s net worth?

Taylor Sheridan was a struggling actor for years

Before he created Yellowstone Sheridan was a struggling actor in Hollywood who taught acting classes to make ends meet — which is how he met his wife Nicole. His most notable role was Deputy David Hale on Sons of Anarchy. But his paycheck was barely allowing him to make ends meet. So Sheridan quit acting and transitioned to writing and directing.

Sheridan immediately found his niche and put his Hollywood connections to good use and that quickly paid off. His first script was for the Emily Blunt-led thriller Sicario. He followed that up with Hell or High Water starring Jeff Bridges. And that earned Sheridan an Oscar nomination.

“At the time it was like ‘let’s just make enough to pay a mortgage or rent or food.’ We were literally starving” Nicole Sheridan told Cowgirl Magazine. “That’s when Taylor started writing and two years later we were at the Oscars … I still can’t believe it.”

The ‘Yellowstone’ creator just bought over a quarter million acres with the Four Sixes Ranch

Fast forward just a few years later and Sheridan is one of the biggest power players in Hollywood. According to The Hollywood Reporter the success of Yellowstone led to a nine-figure deal in 2020.

A year later the Yellowstone creator inked a second overall deal that extended the original agreement an additional five years through 2028. That deal was also estimated to be nine figures but the exact figures are unknown.

Not long after the iconic Four Sixes Ranch went up for sale for the first time in 150 years. And Sheridan led an investment group to make the purchase.

“Recently featured on the hit show Yellowstone the ranch was purchased in its entirety and will continue to represent the icon that it is in the ranching community” Don Bell owner-broker of Brazos River Land said in a statement per The Real Deal. “History is always being made around this unique ranch and this purchase was no different.”

The property was originally listed for $341 million but the final sale price was not revealed. The 6666 is one of the largest ranches in Texas spanning more than 266000 acres across four counties.

What is Taylor Sheridan’s net worth?

As for how much Sheridan is personally worth that can get a bit tricky to figure out. The Cinemaholic estimates that the Yellowstone creator has a net worth of $10 million. But that was before he closed on the sale of the Four Sixes.

Sheridan doesn’t own that ranch all on his own. But he does own other Texas properties. Like his family’s current home — the 600-acre Bosque Ranch on the Brazos River. On that property the Sheridans raise dozens of horses that compete in reining and cutting sports. It was also a shooting location for 1883.

Sheridan also has a nice income from his Paramount Global deal. At this point that $10 million net worth is most likely a low estimate.

The film from directors Aaron and Adam Nee debuted with a treasure trove of $31 million in North America per Comscore. Ahead of its wider international release on April 15 The Lost City grossed $3.7 million across markets that represent just 7 percent of international rollout numbers by weekend's end. It marks Paramount's third No. 1 box office film this year preceded by Scream 5 and Jackass Forever.

Daniel Radcliffe Oscar Nunez Da'Vine Joy Randolph Patti Harrison Bowen Yang and Brad Pitt also star in the adventure film which follows a reclusive romance author (Bullock) who gets swept up into a kooky jungle adventure after an eccentric billionaire (Radcliffe) kidnaps her to find an ancient city's treasure featured in her latest novel. Her handsome cover model (Tatum) sets off on a mission to save her.

EW critic Leah Greenblatt calls the film a ""breezy patently ridiculous throwback to '80s romps"" in her B grade review writing that the Bullock and Tatum-led flick is ""cheerfully shambolic grab-bag of shenanigans and movie stars with enough screwball wit and self-awareness to drag it into 2022.""

In EW's Around the Table the cast and crew called shooting in the jungles of the Dominican Republic a ""crazy zany time"" recalling some of the stunts Radcliffe did on set. ""I think Adam and I thought 'Oh no we've just gotten Daniel here and we're going to throw him in the ocean'"" Aaron said while Bullock quipped ""And now we're going to kill him.""

Bullock's sequined pink jumpsuit was no match for Bruce Wayne's Batsuit: Robert Pattinson's The Batman came in at No. 2 at the domestic box office earning an additional $20.5 million by Sunday. The weekend sum brings the North American total to a valiant $332 million. Director S. S. Rajamouli's Indian Telugu-language period drama epic RRR inspired by Telugu revolutionaries Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem's fight against British colonialists had a triumphant $9.5 million debut in third place.

Elsewhere Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg's Uncharted continued to find box office treasure in fourth place earning an additional $5 million by Sunday and $133.5 million overall. Director Sunghoo Park's Jujutsu Kaisen 0 once again remained in the top five at No. 5 earning an additional $4.5 million during its second weekend in theaters and $27.7 million overall.

“Watch this” Elon Musk replied.

It was March 2000 one year after the 28-year-old Musk sold his first start-up for $22 million. He’d dropped $1 million of it on the silver sports car then pumped most of the rest into a grandiose business scheme: X.com an internet-based megabank that aimed to remake the global financial system.

But his plans had been blocked by Confinity a company led by Thiel. The two were about to discuss a “shotgun marriage” merger to end their destructive competition. Musk pulling rank had offered Thiel a lift. “I didn’t really know how to drive the car” he tells author Jimmy Soni in “The Founders: The Story of PayPal and the Entrepreneurs Who Shaped Silicon Valley” (Simon & Schuster) out now.

Musk gunned the McLaren’s gold-plated engine. The force was more than he could handle. The car spun out on the busy Silicon Valley road hit an embankment went airborne and smashed on the roadside. Glass shattered tires burst and the vehicle’s suspension snapped.

6 At just 28 Musk made news by buying a $1 million sports car (above). He went on to become CEO of Tesla. YouTube

The crash could have killed both men and also destroyed PayPal — the company that revolutionized e-commerce and gave rise to YouTube LinkedIn Yelp Tesla and SpaceX — before it even began.

But miraculously Thiel and Musk were unhurt. They dusted themselves off stuck out their thumbs and hitchhiked off to change internet history.

In “The Founders” Soni tells the story of PayPal from its beginnings as a simple bill-splitting app meant for the now-forgotten PalmPilot device adored by pre-smartphone Silicon Valley. The app was the brainchild of Max Levchin a 24-year-old computer programmer who had befriended Thiel then 32 through a series of what Levchin calls “ultra-nerd dates” bookstore meetings where they spent hours one-upping each other with brain teasers and math problems.

When the financier and the engineer launched Confinity the geek crowd swooned over Levchin’s PayPal app which let PalmPilot users beam money to each other — if their devices were in the same room.

It was impressive tech for the time but limited. Then Levchin added an afterthought bonus feature to PayPal’s website: email-based payments.

Buyers and sellers on eBay instantly latched on. Within six months of PayPal’s November 1999 launch the company had more than a million users.

However Musk’s deep-pocketed X.com was targeting eBay users too enticing them with hefty sign-on bonuses that Confinity struggled to match. “It was kind of a race to see who could run out of money the fastest” Musk said.

6 Musk and Thiel remain on decent terms. In 2016 they met with President-elect Donald Trump at a gathering for tech leaders including Apple CEO Tim Cook and Oracle CEO Safra Catz (center). REUTERS

After the car crash in the spring of 2000 the exhausted combatants agreed to merge under the X.com banner. But the merger proved rocky. Musk still aiming for his ultimate goal of world financial domination saw PayPal as merely a means to that end.

As CEO of the blended company Musk insisted on the primacy of the X.com brand — even though customers hated it focus groups found. “Again and again the theme of ‘Oh God I wouldn’t trust this’” recalled Vivien Go a PayPal marketing exec. “‘It’s an adult website.’” No matter: Musk ordered PayPal to be rebranded as “X-PayPal.”

Then Musk decreed PayPal’s code to be scrapped in favor of a brand new codebase meshing with X.com’s architecture. That was a blow to Levchin whose PayPal code was full of quirks bearing his fingerprints — lines known to all as “Max code.”

“This … is just destroying my will to live” Levchin remembers thinking in despair.

6 Author Jimmy Soni interviewed scores of Silicon Valley insiders for his new book “The Founders.”

“I did not fully appreciate the emotional element” Musk later admitted.

The furious Levchin staged a coup. When Musk headed to Australia for a long-delayed honeymoon Levchin mobilized Thiel and other allies on the X.com board of directors and ousted Musk from his CEO position.

“Sneaky backstabbing bastards” Musk said in 2019 — humorously Soni writes. “Too scared to stab me in the front.”

6 When Musk went on a long-delayed honeymoon Levchin convinced allies to on the X.com board to oust him as CEO.

Musk retained his stake profiting handsomely when PayPal went public in 2002. The capital he realized from the company’s billion-dollar IPO helped launch SpaceX.

Today Thiel and Musk are on good terms with Thiel even joking about the car crash that preceded their success.

It’s looking as though Moderna might be only moderately effective in preventing infection particularly from a highly contagious variant like Omicron in kids under 6 — which was the case for kids 5 to 11 who received the Pfizer vaccine in a study conducted in New York State. But initially at least it appears that one difference between Moderna’s results and Pfizer’s is in terms of the immune response generated. As The Times’s Sharon LaFraniere put it:

Moderna’s two-dose regimen achieved better results than Pfizer’s in boosting the immune systems of young children. Pfizer said in December that after two doses of its vaccine children aged 6 months to 2 produced antibody levels comparable to those of older teenagers and young adults. But children ages 2 through 4 produced only 60 percent of the sought-after antibody response. After two doses of Moderna’s vaccine the antibody response of children in both subsets compared favorably to that of people 18 to 25 meeting the trial’s primary criterion for success.

And according to Moderna no children in its trial experienced severe illness or hospitalization or died.

Honestly sorting through all of this information is incredibly confusing even for me and I have been covering this for months speaking to quite a few infectious-disease pediatricians along the way. If my children were still under 5 I wouldn’t hesitate to get them vaccinated because I’m generally very confident about vaccine safety. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation which has been tracking vaccine attitudes and uptake over time in February 21 percent of parents with children under 5 shared my faith in these shots and were ready and willing to get a vaccine for their kids immediately after it is approved. (This is down from 31 percent in January.)

But I’m concerned about that other 79 percent. I worry that the level of confusion among many parents and the underwhelming vaccine efficacy among little kids reported for both Pfizer’s and Moderna’s will lead to continued vaccine skepticism when shots are finally rolled out for little kids — even more than when older kids were first able to get shots.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpYXNhdC5jb20va3RyLW1lZXRzLWxlYWRlcnMtb2YtdG9wLXBoYXJtYS1jb21wYW5pZXMtYXMtcGFydC1vZi1oaXMtdXMtdHJpcC0yMjk2OTMyL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpYXNhdC5jb20va3RyLW1lZXRzLWxlYWRlcnMtb2YtdG9wLXBoYXJtYS1jb21wYW5pZXMtYXMtcGFydC1vZi1oaXMtdXMtdHJpcC0yMjk2OTMyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KTR meets leaders of top pharma companies as part of his US trip,"Hyderabad: As part of his US trip aimed to bring new businesses to Hyderabad Telangana IT and Industries minister KT Rama Rao met with leaders of Pfizer J&J and GSk which are the world’s top three biggest pharma companies.

One of the brightest was Keyonte George the rookie out of Baylor who burst onto the scene from day one and seized the Jazz starting point guard role.

It’s hard to expect any more from the 20-year-old who was taken with the 16th pick in last summer's draft. George averaged 13.0 points 4.4 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game for the Jazz. Those numbers were good for fourth in scoring and second in total assists amongst all rookies this year. The passing in particular was a lot better than advertised after not being asked to do much of that while at Baylor.

George’s scoring remains the most intriguing piece of his game. He recorded three games in which he scored over 30 points and went over 20 points in nine others. When he’s playing confidently he can get buckets from all three levels and has plenty of juice from long-range. On February 15 George etched his name into the record books when he knocked down nine three-pointers which tied him for the rookie record and put him all alone for Jazz rookies.

An underrated storyline from the season was the leadership role the rookie took on as the season progressed. Jazz head coach Will Hardy thrust him into the starting point guard role early on and along with this came added responsibility- a responsibility that George seemed comfortable with. Heading into his first full offseason George will have even more of an opportunity to be a leader for this Jazz team that is looking to improve.

Despite all the positives it wasn’t a perfect season for George. He like the Jazz's other guards struggled with efficiency. There was a point in the middle of March where George seemed to have figured out how to get to his spots and score more efficiently but those numbers dipped as his teammates missed games and his name became more prominent on opposing scouting reports. Judging by his end-of-season comments he’s not worried about the misses. George said getting stronger and in better shape would result in the shots falling at a higher clip.

Defensively George is still a work in progress. Although his length stands out there's still plenty of room to grow. He has enough size to play either backcourt position which he used to showcase some nice individual defensive sequences. His off-ball awareness needs to improve as does his general focus on that end but he certainly has the potential to be a fine defender in this league.

One area where George can improve is in his words emotional intelligence. He’s immensely talented but he needs to keep his head up when he misses a shot or makes a silly turnover. He’s young though and there’s so much good that it’s hard to dwell on the bad.

Overall it was a very promising season for George. He’ll head into a big offseason with a lot to learn but a great foundation of skills & intelligence to build on. In a postgame press conference Hardy said that Keyonte could become the future of the Jazz program. That is high praise from his head coach but it is certainly a quote that should make you feel good as a Jazz fan.

Point guard Deivon Smith is transferring to St. John's from Utah giving Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino a veteran replacement for Daniss Jenkins next season.

A fifth-year senior Smith ranked sixth in the country with 7.1 assists per game last season. He averaged 13.3 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Utes compiling five triple-doubles -- second most during a single season in NCAA history and the most by any Pac-12 player.

In a St. John's news release Monday Pitino said the 6-foot Smith reminds him of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier a standout player for Pitino at Louisville.

""Super excited to have Deivon Smith joining the Johnnies"" Pitino said. ""Total dog who rebounds creates and scores.""

Smith from Decatur Georgia played his freshman season at Mississippi State and then spent two years with Georgia Tech. He shot a career-high 46.7% from the field in 28 games during his only season at Utah.

Two of his triple-doubles came during Utah's run to the NIT semifinals and he scored a career-best 28 points against tournament runner-up Indiana State on April 2.

Smith becomes the third notable transfer the Red Storm have landed this offseason joining 7-foot-1 center Vincent Iwuchukwu from USC and 6-foot-7 forward Aaron Scott from North Texas. They both committed last month.

At point guard St. John's also returns sophomore Simeon Wilcher a touted recruit who began to show marked improvement late last season in his limited role as a freshman. Wilcher averaged 2.8 points and 9.1 minutes in 28 games as Jenkins' understudy.

Jenkins followed Pitino from Iona to St. John's for his senior season and propelled the Red Storm to a 20-13 record including 11-9 in conference play for their most Big East wins in 14 years. They reached the Big East tournament semifinals for the first time since 2000 losing 95-90 to eventual NCAA champion UConn.

Jenkins led the team in scoring (14.9 points per game) assists (5.4) steals (1.6) and minutes (30.7) earning second-team All-Big East honors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”"

A taxable spinoff is a divestiture of a subsidiary or division by a publicly-traded company which will be subject to capital gains taxation. To qualify as a taxable transaction the parent corporation must divest through direct sale of the division or the assets it contains. The profits made from the sale will be taxed as capital gains.

Key Takeaways A taxable spin-off is a form of corporate divestiture where the conditions of Internal Revenue Code provisions for tax-free spinoffs are not met.

In a taxable spinoff both the parent company and the shareholders incur an additional tax obligation from the transaction.

Changes to tax law under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 including lower corporate tax rates may impact firms’ decision to pursue taxable versus tax-free modes of corporate divestiture.

Most spinoffs are tax-free and a company will fulfill the IRS requirements in order to ensure this.

Spinning off a portion of a company is usually beneficial to the share price of both companies.

Understanding Taxable Spinoffs

A spinoff occurs when a parent corporation separates part of its business to create a new business subsidiary and distributes shares of the new entity to its current shareholders. The subsidiary will become completely independent from the parent corporation operating entirely on its own. If a parent corporation distributes the stock of the subsidiary to its shareholders the distribution is generally taxable to the shareholder as a dividend payout.

In this case ordinary income tax equal to the fair market value of the stock received is imposed on investors. In addition the parent corporation is taxed on the built-in gain (the amount the asset has appreciated) in the stock of the subsidiary.

The tax in this case is a capital gains tax equal to the fair market value of the distributed shares less the parent company’s inside basis in the stock. When cash is received in lieu of fractional shares in the spinoff the fractional shares are generally taxable to shareholders.

A taxable spinoff will bring in liquid assets to the company usually in the form of cash. The downside of this transaction comes from the decrease in income from the capital gains tax. If a parent company wishes to avoid taxation it may consider a tax-free spinoff. Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provides an exemption to taxing transactions from spinoffs allowing a corporation to spin off or distribute shares of a subsidiary in a transaction that is tax-free to both shareholders and the parent company.

When a Spinoff Is Taxed

A spinoff is taxed when the company outright sells the subsidiary. This can include the company being bought by another company or when the company is sold via an initial public offering (IPO).

When cash is received instead of shares in a spinoff the shares of the spinoff are generally taxable.

When such events occur there are two levels of tax that need to be paid. An ordinary tax would be applied at the shareholder level which would be equal to the fair market value (FMV) of the stock received. In many ways it is similar to a dividend payout. A capital gains tax may also be applied on the stock sale at the level of the company equal to the FMV of the stock minus the company's inside basis in the stock.

There are also cases when a spinoff may be taxed simply because it didn't adhere to the tax-free spinoff requirements listed below.



Tax-Free Spinoff

There are typically two ways that a company can undertake a tax-free spinoff of a business unit. First a company can choose to simply distribute the new shares (or at least 80%) of the division to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis.

The second way a company can avoid any capital gains from divestiture is by giving current shareholders the option to exchange shares of the parent company for an equal stock position in the spun-off company or to maintain their existing stock position in the parent company. This means the shareholders are free to choose whichever company they believe offers the best potential return on investment (ROI) going forward.

The IRS has certain requirements for companies to be able to spin off tax-free. They are control device active trade or business and distributions.

Control requirements stipulate that the corporations must own stock possessing at least 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of the stock of that corporation. There are different measures for determining voting control but are usually determined by the ability to elect directors.

Device requirements for tax-free spinoffs mean the spinoff cannot be used as a device for the sole purpose of distributions of earnings and profits. This is determined on a case-by-case basis and considers all aspects of the spinoff.

The active trade section requires both the pre-existing company and the newly spun-off company to qualify as what the IRS calls an ""active trade or business"" immediately once the deal is finalized. This also requires that both businesses are actively engaged in business.

The distribution requirements mean that the IRS requires the pre-existing company to distribute all stocks and securities held in the newly spun-off company in specific ways. Usually this is for the company to distribute at least 80% of the shares to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis. The second involves the stock options given to shareholders explained above where they can choose either the pre-existing company or the new company to invest in.



Special Considerations

Because of the availability of a tax benefit under Section 355 most spin-offs are conducted in order to take advantage. Rather than incur an additional tax burden through a taxable spin-off businesses may often find that it makes more sense to pursue some other form of divestiture if the benefits of the divestiture outweigh the additional tax incurred.

This also means that corporate income tax rates may influence firms’ decisions to divest and how. Cuts to corporate income tax rates in the U.S. under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 signed by President Trump may have changed this calculus somewhat in favor of other forms of divestitures such as subsidiary stock sales or asset sales.



Real-World Example

One of the largest corporate spinoffs of all time occurred in 2008 when Altria Group Inc. (MO) spun off Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) spinning off 100% of the shares of Philip Morris. In this case each Altria shareholder received one share of Philip Morris stock for every share of outstanding Altria common stock.

They split due to concerns over payouts to shareholders as well as the mounting pressure of smoking lawsuits. However on Altria's website they state that they spun off Philip Morris as ""management believed that the spinoff would enable each of Altria's international and domestic tobacco businesses to focus exclusively on realizing its own opportunities and addressing its own challenges thereby building long-term shareholder value.""

On Jan. 30 2008 Altria authorized the spinoff. By March of the same year Philip Morris shares were distributed to shareholders on record of Altria that held shares during the distribution date. This was a non-taxable spinoff example as most spinoffs are conducted in order to be tax-advantaged.

Is a Stock Spinoff Taxable? Stock spinoffs are usually tax-free. There are many advantages for both the parent organization and the common shareholder if the spinoff is not taxed.

Is a Spinoff Considered a Dividend? Since the spinoff is paid to the shareholder as a distribution it is very similar to a dividend. The main difference between the two is that a dividend will pay the shareholder in cash whereas a spinoff will pay the shareholder in additional stock shares.

What Is the Difference Between a Spinoff and a Split-off? The method of creating a tax-free spinoff that involves presenting shareholders the options of investing in either the spun-off company or the pre-existing company is called a ""split-off."" These terms are used to avoid confusion when discussing the spinoff and whether the company distributes the shares on a pro-rata basis or gives shareholders the option to choose.

How Many Shares Do you Get in a Spinoff? How many shares you receive in a spinoff is determined by whether the company performs a true spinoff or if there is a split-off. In a split-off you are able to choose between receiving shares in the newly spun-off company or keeping your shares in the parent organization.

The Bottom Line

Most companies who spin off portions of their companies will do so in a tax-free way. There are enormous tax benefits to not selling a company outright therefore most companies will fulfill the IRS requirements for spinning off portions of their company in a tax-free way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2ZlcnJhcmktd2lsbC1ub3ctbGV0LXlvdS1wYWludC15b3VyLWNhci1pbi1pdHMtZjEtY2FyLWNvbG9ycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ferrari Will Now Let You Paint Your Car In Its F1 Car Colors,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2ZlcnJhcmktd2lsbC1ub3ctbGV0LXlvdS1wYWludC15b3VyLWNhci1pbi1pdHMtZjEtY2FyLWNvbG9ycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

Featuring USMTS Modifieds and Medieval USRA Stock Cars plus the 7th Annual B-Mod Battle at The Bullring fans witnessed an action-packed program provided by the nation’s top talent in their respective divisions.

Dustin Sorensen who won the USMTS season opener three weeks ago at the Rocket Raceway Park in Petty Texas led the opening lap Saturday night with Dereck Ramirez giving chase but by lap 15 O’Neil passed Ramirez for second after advancing from his fifth row starting spot.

Ten laps later O’Neil snuck by Sorensen on the outside and the pair proceeded to battle door-to-door for the next 15 laps as lapped traffic kept the lead duo on their toes.

A caution on the 43rd lap of 60 bunched the field. O’Neil drove away on the ensuing restart and again following two more yellow flags in the final 10 laps to net a $15000 paycheck and a new carbon fiber driveshaft from Fast Shafts.

The Kansas contingent in attendance were cheering on Darron Fuqua the last 10 laps as he put pressure on O’Neil by keeping the outside wall cleaned off with his right-side spoiler but despite his best efforts he settled for second place.

Sorensen held on for third to regain the points lead over Jason Hughes who came from 15th to grab fifth behind defending USMTS National Champion Dereck Ramirez.

Zack VanderBeek—now a new daddy and around 80 pounds lighter than one year ago—held off Jake Timm for sixth. Ethan Dotson earned an eighth-place paycheck Tanner Mullens nabbed ninth and Oregon traveler Tom Berry Jr. rounded out the top 10.

Saturday night’s win was the 21st career USMTS win for O’Neil and made him the fourth different winner in four events in 2022. He’s also the 10th different winner in 11 editions of the King of America race. Ryan Gustin remains the only two-time winner.

The 20-lap Summit Racing Equipment “A” Main saw Clear Lake Iowa’s Chanse Hollatz take the win over a strong field of Medieval USRA Stock Cars.

Colorado’s Angel Munoz was second Derek Brown claimed the third spot fourth went to Derrick Agee and 12th-starting Rodney Schweizer completed the top five.

One of the most dominant efforts happened in the finale of the 7th Annual B-Mod Battle at The Bullring as polesitter Lucas Rodin of Marion N.D. led wire to wire in the 50-lap G-Style Transport “A” Main.

Former USMTS regular Travis Saurer held off former USRA B-Mod National Champion Andy Bryant for runner-up honors with Kyle Slader and Shadren Turner finishing fourth and fifth.

Krew Walburn 23rd-starting Kris Jackson Jake Smith Ryan Gillmore and defending race winner J.C. Morton crossed the finish line in sixth through tenth respectively.

After a tense battle with Dereck Ramirez early in the race polesitter Kale Westover of Altus Okla. won going away in the 35-lap USMTS Modified main event—his first with the USMTS.

The win was worth $5000 to Westover while Ramirez settled for the runner-up paycheck. Tyler Peterson mixed it up with the defending USMTS National Champion but settled for third at the finish line with 18th-starting Dustin Sorensen fourth and 15th-starting Tyler Wolff in fifth.

Tyler Davis wound up sixth—good enough to take the temporary points lead before the evening show got started. Seventh through tenth respectively went to Tanner Mullens Jayson Good Jake O'Neil and new father Zack VanderBeek.

Beau Davis of Cheney Kan. nipped North Dakota’s Aaron Olson at the checkered flag to win the Medieval USRA Stock Car main event and the $1000 winner’s share of the prize money.

Derrick Agee Angel Munoz and Dominic Thyfault rounded out the top five while sixth through tenth went to Derek Brown Austin Brands Zeb Keepper Tim Brown and Scott Johnson.

To kick things off Saturday afternoon B-Mods opened the show with their third set of heat races and the checkered flag waved in those eight contests for Brennan Gave Luke Phillips Lucas Rodin Gabe Hodges Terry Schultz Mike Striegel Jake Smith and Krew Walburn.

Each B-Mod competitor will have his or her worst finish of the three heat races thrown out and the accumulated points set the lineups for Saturday night’s “alphabet soup” of main events.



Kale Westover won the USMTS/USRA Modified main event.

King of America Bullring and Stock Car champs to be crowned Saturday night: As part of today’s doubleheader the finale for Summit King of America XI and the Battle at The Bullring at the Humboldt Speedway gets the green flag Saturday evening.

USMTS Modifieds will compete for $15000 and a new carbon fiber driveshaft from Fast Shafts. Medieval USRA Stock Cars are racing for $1500 to win and a fat $10000 check awaits the B-Mod main event winner.

College: Iowa.

Season flavor: Triple berry.

There's a kicker with the McCabe ice cream flavor. It melts fast. As one of the greatest girls shooters in state history McCabe scorched the nets for four seasons hitting an all-class career record 389 three-pointers including 104 this past season. But shooting isn't the only thing that defines McCabe's game. Usually assigned to guard the opposing team's best shooter and getting her hands on a lot of steals McCabe was arguably the best defensive player in Class A. She also rebounded well and could run point if the Tigers needed her to. But when the Tigers needed a big shot they went to McCabe who had 13 games of four threes or more including nine against Lincoln Southeast. The biggest treat for McCabe though was leading her team to the school's first Class A state title.

Coach speak: ""Taylor is probably the best as far as total player. We talked a lot times about her scoring and her numbers and how impressive all those stats are but the ones that don't show up are the defensive ones. To get assigned to the best player almost every single game and really neutralize that best player even shut them down sometimes for her to get every team's best and really not be shut down … is impressive."" — Fremont coach Kelly Flynn.

Three scoops with Taylor:

Favorite ice cream: Chocolate chip cookie dough.

Favorite ice cream topping: Gummy bears.

Favorite moment of season: ""Winning a state championship obviously stands out. We took a (team) trip to Florida and I had a lot fun with my team down there.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwbm5ld3MuY29tL21ha2UtdGhlLW1vc3Qtb2YtZ3VkaS1wYWR3YS1vZmZlcnMtd2hpbGUtYnV5aW5nLWEtcHJvcGVydHkv0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBubmV3cy5jb20vbWFrZS10aGUtbW9zdC1vZi1ndWRpLXBhZHdhLW9mZmVycy13aGlsZS1idXlpbmctYS1wcm9wZXJ0eS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Make the most of Gudi Padwa offers while buying a property,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apnnews.com/make-the-most-of-gudi-padwa-offers-while-buying-a-property/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwbm5ld3MuY29tL21ha2UtdGhlLW1vc3Qtb2YtZ3VkaS1wYWR3YS1vZmZlcnMtd2hpbGUtYnV5aW5nLWEtcHJvcGVydHkv0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBubmV3cy5jb20vbWFrZS10aGUtbW9zdC1vZi1ndWRpLXBhZHdhLW9mZmVycy13aGlsZS1idXlpbmctYS1wcm9wZXJ0eS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

While the crude oil prices per barrel have come down the prices at gastations have not. The oil companies have no plans to lower the gas price even though they are packing in more profits than ever.

Oil Vs. Regular Unleaded Gasoline Prices

All-Time High Crude Oil Prices In 12 Years

The price of crude oil has been rising since the start of last year. It crossed $100 a barrel in March after the Russia-Ukraine war. This is the first time in 12 years the price per barrel crossed 3 digital.

Usually Oil companies in that supply situation would be running to find more places to drill oil but this time they did not nor do they plan on. The oil executives are now focusing on the “growth trajectory” to satisfy their shareholders.

US Oil Companies Have No Plans To Increase Oil Production

CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources Scott Sheffield told Bloomberg that “Whether it’s $150 oil $200 oil or $100 oil we’re not going to change our growth plans”

While many consumers falsely believe that the rising gas prices is caused by the president it’s not. Exxon’s CEO Darren Woods also told his shareholders that they are focusing on “profitability over the volume of oil. “",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzIxNjRkMWUzLWVlNjgtNDNhYi04YzNkLTYxYmQ2Y2NkZTIzOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russia's Arctic gas ambitions at risk as sanctions imperil LNG icebreakers,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

Drew Angerer | Getty Images

Over 400 multinational corporations have pulled out of Russia as a result of its invasion of Ukraine. It's not only reputational risk at stake but a complex web of sanctions imposed by the U.S. government as well as a global financial systems blockade that makes operating in Russia difficult if not impossible — and the list of sanctioned entities and individuals keeps getting longer. As the economy's largest companies protect their brands and operations Main Street may breathe a sigh of relief that at least this time being small and local is better than being big and global. That would be a mistake. The risk may be the exception to the rule for many Main Street firms but experts say small businesses need to take basic steps to investigate their own potential links to sanctioned Russian businesses and individuals or else face the potential for what should be an avoidable worst-case scenario. Take cybersecurity training firm INE as an example. It is a mid-sized business that did not expect to run afoul of sanctions but taking a few basic precautions once the sanctions started hitting led it to uncover potential violations which it might have otherwise missed. And its path to uncovering the issues was somewhat coincidental. One of its founders is married to a former government official and Citigroup compliance executive and she mentioned that it is hard for companies beyond the Wall Street banks to stay on top of all of the sanctions and support from the Treasury Department isn't going to filter down through the economy. This knowledge led INE to run its own client list against the U.S. Treasury sanctions database and to its surprise INE was doing business with sanctioned banking entities. ""We found two Russian businesses sanctioned at the highest levels"" said Scott Cederbaum INE's chief marketing officer whose wife is the Citi executive. ""We were shocked when we found it"" he said. ""It would not have occurred to me we would have ever sold to Russian clients."" The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control website was the starting point for the discovery but the results led to questions the firm couldn't find sufficient answers for from the government. INE had to immediately sever ties with the two clients to which it had been providing IT training services. ""From a small business perspective there is no visibility no one talking about it. I've talked to a lot of people and no one is thinking about it"" Cederbaum said. While legal firms and Wall Street banks work with their top-tier clients small businesses are not likely to find as much help even if they have banking relationships. CNBC contacted PNC JP Morgan Wells Fargo Bank of America and Goldman Sachs all of which declined to comment or did not return calls seeking comment. Silicon Valley Bank which INE works with and Cederbaum said has been helpful said through a spokeswoman that it is advising clients to contact their law firms. While the risk of a small business having ties to Russian entities on sanctions lists may be low in a global digital economy where services are offered instantaneously through the internet and technology talent is sources globally the risk is there. Instilling fear on Main Street isn't the goal and the risk of being in violation of sanctions may be small but it is a much better posture to investigate than assume the business is safe. ""The specter is there"" Cederbaum said. ""If you have that risk you should know it. Any small business who has any dealings that might have a Russian tie at least perform the due diligence"" he said.

Sanctions safety steps for small business

In fact experts say a little prevention can go a long way in this case. While it is impossible to know how hard a line the U.S. government would take against a small business in violation of sanctions — firm size alone is no excuse for breaking the law — the government may at least be more understanding of violations if the business can prove that it took steps to investigate that it had protocols in place to search for potential violations even if it ended up making a mistake. The government does often take into account efforts to comply that are documented even if those efforts were ultimately lacking. The first step is to access the sanctions lists that are searchable and downloadable from the Treasury OFAC website and run the database against a client list.

watch now

Doreen Edelman partner and chair of Lowenstein Sandler's global trade and national security practice said there is a big gap between start-ups in technology and smaller companies in general when it comes to compliance. Typically ""it's not on their top 10 list"" Edelman said. ""Now everyone has a problem."" Potential issues are not only limited to OFAC sanctions but Commerce Department export controls which ban export or transfer of products to Russian entities on export lists and which can be interpreted broadly to include researchers or research institutions. And it doesn't need to be a physical product — putting data on the web or in the cloud could be a violation based on who can access it. ""And that's just general products"" Edelman said. If items have an export classification number such as a scientific measurement device all products need a license in almost every category and Edelman said to expect a presumption of denial from the government. It also includes any Russian foreign nationals working for U.S. firms for example at a software or machine development company a situation in which sharing of any technology with them can be deemed the same as sending it out of the U.S. ""A Russian working for you living in the U.S. is an export to Russia"" Edelman said. On the Treasury OFAC side of sanctions most small companies will assume they are not sending anything out of the U.S. and therefore it doesn't apply to them. But businesses need to be screening every single relationship because even companies based in the U.S. could be Russian entities. ""You are supposed to be screening absolutely everyone you do business with — suppliers customers and partners. This is a strict liability and it doesn't matter if you didn't know"" Edelman said.

Technology industry risk

Physical product chains may be easier to track but software companies need to screen to make sure no restricted parties are accessing their website. Russia has hundreds of thousands of technology professionals in Moscow and St. Petersburg in particular. From graphic design to web development and marketing Russia is a place where business ties exist at all levels of firm sizes. ""People selling goods and services into Russia are not even thinking about it"" Cederbaum said. ""There are tons of companies that might have two or three customers in Russia"" he said. The largest banks in Russia which are sanctioned have many subsidiaries operating across business types from web development to cyber products and as INE found just having any associated entity as a client is a violation of Treasury Department sections. ""This is uncharted territory in terms of having OFAC sections at a time of digital connections with countries and the degree of interconnectivity with Russia"" Cederbaum said. Edelman said in addition to screening client lists against government sanctions databases putting geolocation blocks on web platforms is a wise move so that restricted parties in certain areas can't access online services. In the strictest sense of the law it does not matter if a client is paying or not. ""You can't do 'business' with them"" isn't a restriction measured only by payment received for services she said. Providing access to software on a website is enough. Financial services and fintech companies computer services and IT companies and software development firms all are involved in outsourcing relationships and Eastern Europe has become a popular place for tech outsourcing and that means there is a greater chance there might be a Russian investor or parent company. ""It won't be the local flower shop in all likelihood"" said Andrew Sherman a partner at Seyfarth Shaw who specializes in business law. And it can extend to a business that may be partially owned by oligarchs or Russian entities operating in other countries that a U.S. firm had no reason to know about previously. The issues for the tech sector run to the highest levels of Silicon Valley but also the smallest start-ups individually. ""You need to look at distributors consultants programmers and engineers overseas"" Edelman said. ""We're seeing with start-up tech companies investors who say 'it is a Cayman Islands company but who owns it?' If it turns out to be a Russian sovereign wealth fund you can't do business with them"" she said. ""I think it is surprising everyone the extent to which either foreign funds with Russian investors in them investing entities in places like Singapore or Russian investors directly are in U.S. entities because you have to pierce the veil a few levels"" she added.

Treasury has made it easier to identify violations

The government has made it easier in recent years to perform due diligence with the companies now able to go on OFAC's website and run the screening on sanctioned entities — but it can still be cumbersome with additional Treasury Commerce and Postal Service lists. There are a few dozen lists in all that involve U.S.-sanctioned entities and there are also UK and EU lists for businesses that operate in those markets Edelman said. As an example software that is commonly used today might have to screen against a total of 60 lists. But the best place to start she said is by running a screen of a company's relationships against the consolidated list OFAC which also includes Customs and Commerce data. Taking these steps is critical experts say even if a company misses a potential violation. Inadvertent violations do happen but companies that can show they had a policy in place and were doing screenings — more than once as sanctions are added — may lead the government to be less punitive if a violation is found. ""These sanctions are a reason to start a compliance program"" Edelman said. And for firms that have a compliance policy in place for global trade but have not been actively managing it ""if the last time you screened was three years ago I'm not sure OFAC will give you much credit"" she said. Size of business too can be a mitigating factor as is self-disclosure if a firm does find a violation. But ultimately a violation is a violation and it is based on each transaction. ""If it is $1 each time one thousand times it is a thousand violations"" Edelman said. ""I don't want to scare companies because if they make the disclosure and show they are trying to be complainant and it is their first offense they can end up without a fine and just a notification letter but it's better not to have a problem."" For any firms doing business abroad in Europe for example it is a good idea to do a deep dive of business relationship lists against sanctions lists Sherman said. ""If you've got software under development and you're shipping monthly and making wire transfers to Eastern bloc countries or one of the former members of the USSR you might want to at least ask questions"" said Sherman. For smaller firms it would be a bitter irony if as a result of the current situation they unintentionally ended up on the wrong side of the U.S. government. ""Many small to medium-sized businesses are too small to have any significant interest or holders in Russia but they do want to be seen as standing with Ukraine and in particular for entrepreneurs it's a little bit of a David and Goliath story and they relate to the Davids. It is probably a 1% a 2% kind of chance but substantiating your attempt to comply will go along way"" Sherman said. ""If you do nothing and do get audited or run into problems you won't have a very good case. Make the effort. ... It is not like 20 years ago. You can get lots of work done on the internet just a few Google searches and emails and pack in a compliance file and at least know if asked you did take steps to protect."" Edelman said the process does not need to be costly and simple steps like preparing a sanctions compliance policy document to prove your business is aware of the risk and has taken basic steps is a start. ""Every business in this county has an obligation to try to comply regardless of the likelihood"" Cederbaum said. ""It's worth leaning on the side of caution. ... We are the quintessential company that at the end of the day could easily have sleepwalked into sanctions violation. Two clients out of 150000 individuals and businesses working with us.""

Even as swimming pools were allowed to open from February 1 Mumbaikars rue that civic swimming pools are not accepting new memberships forcing many to go to private pools where the fees are five times higher. BMC officials said new memberships will start from April 1 and cited a new fee structure as reason for delay.

There has been a demand for swimming pool membership especially in view of the summer. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has five swimming pools in the city—at Shivaji Park Kandivli Dahisar Chembur and Ghatkopar. However the Ghatkopar one has been closed since 2016 because of a leakage. The pool will now undergo renovation and is likely to open after two or three years.

‘Looking at private pools now’

“The BMC’s olympic-size swimming pool at Chembur is just seven minutes away from our home. My children aged 9 and 11 are fond of swimming but were stuck at home for two years. So when I heard that the pools were opening I went to get membership the very next day. There was a long queue and after inquiry I realised that new memberships were not open yet” said Pradnya Hattangadi. She added that she would now look for a private club where the membership fee is around Rs 1 lakh.

The issue has also made rounds on social media. A twitterratti @thekaipullai posted “Is there a place in Mumbai that allows swimming memberships? All the BMC pools are not accepting new members. (sic)” Vinay Chitale a regular member of the Shivaji Park pool said that many of his friends inquired about membership after watching his videos on Instagram but he could not help as the process is yet to start.

Fees revision

Vidyadhar Modak a senior citizen and member of Shivaji Park swimming pool said that his membership was valid till July in 2020 but the pool had to close after the first lockdown. “When the pools reopened last month they gave us an extension for the remaining time of our yearly membership” said Modak. Citing that the membership fee increases by 10 per cent every year he said “We submitted a written request to the mayor and the civic commissioner on March 7 to not increase the fee as the pool was shut for over two years.”

A BMC official said “Every year the fee of all the services including pools and theatres increases by 10 per cent. This year many have requested us to not increase it as pools were closed for two years. So we are in the process of revising the fee structure which is why we are not accepting new members yet. It is so that they can benefit from the revised structure.”

As per BMC’s existing fee structure the fees at the Olympic-size swimming pools at Shivaji Park Chembur and Kandivli were at Rs 9600 which would have increased to Rs 10560 from April 1 as per the old structure. The normal pool at Dahisar had a yearly fee of Rs 6660. “As per the revised structure which is yet to be approved the fees for Olympic-sized pools will be below Rs 10000 and normal pools will have a fee around Rs 6000. Even the concession for seniors students and disabled may be hiked from 30 to 50 per cent” said the official.

More pools to come up soon

“We have a limited number of civic pools but several new pools are currently under construction and will open in a month or two. We know people are waiting for new memberships and the process is on to start it soon” said Prabhat Rahangdale deputy municipal commissioner of the disaster management unit and in-charge of pools.

The BMC has started construction of six new pools in Worli Hill reservoir; Chacha Nehru Garden Malad; Indira Gandhi Manoranjan Maidan Andheri West; Kondivita in Andheri East; Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar in Govandi; and Gyandhara Garden in Dahisar. The Dahisar and Malad swimming pools may reopen within the next two months.

By Kartik Lokhande :

IT CANNOT be just a coincidence that the words “Dream Development Delay and Disappointment” start with the letter ‘D’. Take the case of the ambitious Multimodal International Hub and Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN) and Special Economic Zone (SEZ) project. What was touted as the biggest economic turnaround story for Developmentally backward Vidarbha region has proven to be a big Disappointment more than two decades later. What has come to the fore is the fact that more than 40 per cent of the land for the SEZ and non-SEZ components of MIHAN project is still ‘balance’. SEZ component has total 1236 hectares of land pool of which 290 is ‘non-disposable’ that is land required for roads drainage line forest land canal landscaping etc. The SEZ component had 945 hectares of ‘disposable’ land that is available for investors. However sadly only 560 hectares of land has been ‘disposed of’ (sold to investors in other words). And 384 hectares -- that is over 40 per cent of total area -- is still ‘balance’. Similarly in case of non-SEZ component of total land pool of 1013 hectares 328 hectares is ‘non-disposable’. Of 684 hectares of ‘disposable’ land pool only 394 hectares has been ‘disposed of’ and 289 hectares -- again more than 40 per cent of total area -- is still ‘balance’ with the authorities. In several cases as has been highlighted by ‘The Hitavada’ in earlier reports the investors to whom the land has been made available have not yet started their units.

As such even the ‘disposed of’ part does not present the true picture of the so-called progress made by MIHAN project in more than two decades. When ‘The Hitavada’ sought to know the details regarding land pool and balance area Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) officials refused to provide those officially citing various reasons. Officials passed the buck to other colleagues whe details sought. One official even asked “Such reports might adversely affect the prospects of investment that may come to MIHAN project.” However he had no answer when ‘The Hitavada’ asked “If highlighting status of the project after over two decades might adversely affect the prospects of investment what about the abject failure of the project in achieving desired outcome in these years?”

For the record MADC was constituted in the year 2002 by Government of Maharashtra as a special purpose vehicle to develop MIHAN and aviation infrastructure in the State to provide regional air connectivity. MADC had equity participation from City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Ltd Nagpur Improvement Trust Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation State Industrial & Investment Corporation of Maharashtra Ltd Nagpur Municipal Corporation Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation Ltd as per the information on MADC website. While the land is still ‘balance’ with the authorities land acquisition issues also are yet to be sorted out fully. According to sources close to 300 of total around 1000 project-affected persons (PAPs) from Shivangaon village have shifted to relocation site and others are ‘in the process of shifting’. The PAPs from Dahegaon Telhara Kalkuhi have settled in new gaothan. So far compensation of Rs 486 crore has been paid to the PAPs from whom land was acquired. An amount of Rs 248 crore has been paid as ‘enhanced compensation’ following litigations. And an amount of Rs 140 crore has been provided for housing construction and as ex-gratia. Given these facts it becomes clear that either there has been failure of the authorities concerned in all these years in aggressively marketing MIHAN and providing necessary facilities or there has been utter disinterest of the political powers-that-be or there has been lack of conviction in turning tall claims into reality. Whatever the case may be MIHAN has proven to be a tale of disappointment for those who really believed that it would change the economy of the region and provide five lakh jobs as promised.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vdGF0aHlhLmluL2NlbnRyZS1zaHktb2YtcGFyLWJvaWxlZC1yaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Centre Shy Of Par-Boiled Rice,"New Delhi: It seems that the Union Government is not in favour of lifting all surplus par-boiled rice from Odisha for which the BJD Government is fighting for a long time.

This was indicated in a written reply given by Union Minister of State for Consumer Affairs Food & Public Distribution Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti in Rajya Sabha yesterday.

BJD MP Prasanna Acharya has asked “Whether it is a fact that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has refused to receive surplus par-boiled rice from Odisha if so the reasons therefore”

In her reply Ms.Sadhvi said a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Government of India and the State Government for procurement of paddy from farmers.

A clause of the MoU stipulates that —”if the stocks of the rice procured by the State Government exceeds its allocation under targeted PDS and other welfare schemes such excess stocks shall be handed over to FCI by the State Government. However FCI shall have the option to specify whether such excess rice that would be handed over to FCI for central pool by the State Government shall be in the form of raw rice or Parboiled rice to meet overall consumption requirement of the country.”

Due to burgeoning stock levels of parboiled rice in the central pool it was informed to the States that FCI will not be in position to accept parboiled rice during KMS 2021-22. However States can procure parboiled rice for consumption within the State the Minister said.

Still on the request of Odisha Chief Minister Government of India vide letter dated 03.11.2021 has allowed to Odisha for delivery of 5 Lakh MT of parboiled fortified rice to FCI during KMS 2021- 22 and remaining surplus custom milled rice in the form of raw rice she informed.

This reply of the Union Minister indicates that the Ministry is not going to lift the excess parboiled rice from the State.

Giving details of surplus rice lifted by FCI from Odisha during past five years Ms.Sadhvi said 16.09 Lakh Metric Tonne (LMT) rice lifted in the Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2016-17 while 12.36 LMT rice lifted in 2017-18 17.83 LMT in 2018-19 17.21 LMT in 2019-20 and 18.99 LMT during last year.

During Kharif Marketing Season 2021-22 (Kharif crop) up to March 15 2022 56.19 Lakh Metric Tonnes (LMT) paddy has been procured by State Procuring Agencies she added.",,,,,,

The UK's National Grid Plc stated that it would sell 60% stake in its gas transmission and metering business (NGG) to a consortium of Macquarie Asset Management and BCI

NGG's enterprise value is estimated at around £9.6 billion ($12.6 billion) based on the terms of the deal

Subject to certain antitrust and regulatory approvals the transaction is planned to be completed in the second half of 2022.

On March 27 2022 the UK's National Grid Plc (National Grid) an energy utility that transmits and distributes electricity and natural gas stated that it would sell 60% stake in its gas transmission and metering business (NGG) to a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors. The consortium includes Macquarie Asset Management a global financial services group and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) one of the largest asset managers in Canada. The deal is part of National Grid's strategic shift to renewable electricity.

Details of the National Grid Deal

By 2050 National Grid intends to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to zero. As part of this target the company acquired PPL Corp.'s UK electricity business Western Power Distribution PLC for £7.8 billion ($10.24 billion) in the previous year. The innovative strategy of National Grid to reduce carbon emissions will position the company as a leader in low carbon emission segment in the UK. Currently National Grid operates its business through four segments: US Regulated UK Electricity Transmission UK Gas Transmission and National Grid Ventures (NGV). The company generates the majority of its revenue from US Regulated (62%) followed by UK Electricity Transmission (27%). Mounting pressure from investors and activists on National Grid regarding its fossil fuel businesses led the company to consider rapidly transitioning to clean energy business.

National Grid's gas transmission business comprises a 7660-kilometer pipe network across the UK which facilitates transporting the gas required to heat homes power industries and generating energy. This unit is valued at around £9.6 billion ($12.6 billion) based on the terms of the deal. As part of the acquisition National Grid will receive £2.2 billion ($2.89 billion) in cash and about £2 billion ($2.63 billion) in additional debt financing after the completion of the deal. Consequently National Grid will own 40% minority equity stake in NGG through a new holding company called ""GasT TopCo."" The company has the option to sell the remaining 40% stake to the consortium.

Moving towards clean energy

Climate change is one of the world's most pressing challenges prompting governments and business entities to seek sustainable solutions. Oil & gas companies and utility companies began to invest in clean energy strategically. Energy utility corporations remain committed to achieving net-zero emissions. However the shift from fossil fuels to clean energy will be challenging because of the heavy investment by energy utility companies in their fossil fuel infrastructure. The total number of deals by oil & gas companies in the renewable sector reached 134 in 2021 which showed an annual increase of 80%. However the value of the deals declined due to the pandemic.

Recently Woodside Petroleum an Australian oil and gas producer invested in Heliogen a renewable energy technology company. Woodside Petroleum targeted an investment of $5 billion in new-energy products by 2030. BP Plc the UK oil and gas company announced that it would build a renewable energy capacity of 20 gigawatts by 2025 and 50 gigawatts by 2030. Shell Plc a multinational oil & gas company will invest around $6 billion annually in renewable energy to accelerate its transformation into a net-zero-emissions energy product and service provider.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAzLTI3L25hdGlvbmFsLWdyaWQtc2VsbHMtNjAtb2YtZ2FzLXVuaXQtdG8tbWFjcXVhcmllLWFuZC1iY2nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Macquarie Buys Stake in National Grid's $13 Billion Gas Unit,"Why did this happen?

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzNWNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy9vaGlvLXBvbGl0aWNzL3Byb2N0ZXItYW5kLWdhbWJsZS1oZWlyZXNzLXByb3Bvc2VzLWJpbGwtdG8tc3RvcC10aGUtdHlwZS1vZi1hbmltYWwtdGVzdGluZy1wLWctaGFzLWRvbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter and Gamble heiress proposes bill to stop type of animal testing,"COLUMBUS Ohio — The heiress of Procter and Gamble a multi-billion dollar consumer goods company is proposing legislation in the Ohio House to stop cosmetics testing on animals. P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials. It is therefore unclear whether the proposed state bill HB 495 could have a negative impact on new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual - cosmetic and medical - application.""

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

With the AG seat wide open and the primary under six months away the three Democratic candidates vying for the job used a Progressive Massachusetts questionnaire and forum to differentiate themselves.

“Massachusetts benefits when we have robust debate on where people stand “ said Jonathan Cohn of Progressive Massachusetts. “There is a tendency among some politicians to hide positions and we’re all better off when people have their debates on issues openly.”

The 45-page questionnaire and ensuing forum questioned candidates on issues including qualified immunity racial justice climate change and supervised consumption sites.

All three Democratic candidates — Andrea Campbell Shannon Liss-Riordan and Quentin Palfrey — filled out the questionnaire.

In her questionnaire and forum Campbell an attorney and former Boston City Councilor who ran for mayor last year emphasized equity.

“That should be the norm” Campbell said. “If we’re going to be serious about closing these gaps when we do that work through that lens we will actually begin to close gaps.”

She emphasized the role equity plays in housing health disparities economic development and criminal justice reform.

Campbell stood apart from the field with her support for charter schools which Progressive Mass alleges “siphon” millions of dollars from public schools.

She explained that many Black families choose to send their kids to charter schools given their low odds of getting into an upper-tier Boston public school.

“Most of the kids that were going to the charter schools in my district were Black and so I didn’t want to judge that choice” she said at the forum. “For me my stance on the issue was standing with them.”

She was also the only candidate who did not support single-payer health care or social consumption sites which allow drug users to take drugs in a supervised and sterile environment.

Labor attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan portrayed herself as a lawyer — and the only practicing lawyer — for the people tackling corporations including Uber Starbucks Amazon and Harvard her alma mater.

She spent much of her forum interview speaking about the cases she’s worked on including recent lawsuits against the State Police for violating the Paid Family Leave Act and the state for its civil service exam which she called discriminatory toward Black and brown police and firefighters.

Liss-Riordan is the only candidate who does not support eliminating qualified immunity for police officers which shields them from legal liability in cases without a legal precedent.

“There are just too many gaps. The law is too murky” she said. “We need to have the rules more clearly spelled out” advocating for reform instead of removal.

The final Democratic candidate Quentin Palfrey emphasized his experience as assistant attorney general and working under the Obama and Biden administrations and painted himself with a broad progressive brush.

Palfrey praised former Suffolk DA Rachael Rollins’s approach to criminal justice.

“​​We do need to follow the leadership of Rachael Rollins in the progressive DA movement to be innovative in the use of prosecutorial discretion to take some of the disparities out of our criminal legal system” he said. “The platform of the AG can be a very powerful one to push or really aggressive reforms to end the carceral state and take some of these racial disparities out of the criminal justice system.”

He also highlighted his differences with current AG Maura Healey’s approach to the crisis at Mass and Cass.

“I don’t think we’re going to incarcerate and arrest our way out of problems that are primarily about mental health and substance use and housing instability” he said of the persistent homelessness and drug use there.

Progressive Mass will formally endorse a candidate on April 4.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYW5pdHJlbmR6Lm5ldC9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDMvMjcvc3dvcmQtYXJ0LW9ubGluZS1wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS1zZXF1ZWwtbW92aWUtcHJldmlld2VkLWluLW5ldy12aWRlby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sword Art Online Progressive Sequel Movie Previewed in New Video,"By Melvyn Tan -

A new video previewing footage from the upcoming Sword Art Online -Progressive- Kuraki Yuuyami no Scherzo (Scherzo of Deep Night) movie has been released offering a fans a glimpse of Asuna and Kirito’s next adventure.

The movie is set to premiere in Japan in Autumn. The previous Sword Art Online -Progressive- movie Aria of a Starless Night premiered in the country on October 30.

Yen Press describes the volume as:

It’s been just two months since they were trapped in the game of death that is Sword Art Online and Kirito and Asuna continue their struggle at the vanguard of progress through the game. The fifth floor of Aincrad is a mazelike ruin and the two dare to take pleasure in raiding it for the treasure it contains. Upon returning to the fourth floor it’s time to do some questing on behalf of the Elf Lord Yofilis–but here begins Asuna’s discontent for in doing so they will have to face her least favorite monster ever…

Like the first movie Sword Art Online -Progressive- Kuraki Yuuyami no Scherzo‘s staff includes Ayako Kounou as director Kento Toya as character designer and chief animation director and Yasuyuki Kai as action director and monster designer. A-1 Pictures is the animation production company.

The first volume of the Sword Art Online Progressive light novels was published in 2012 while the eighth and latest volume was published in June 2021. The books are published under the Dengeki Bunko label.

Both the main and Progressive Sword Art Online light novels are written by Reki Kawahara with illustrations by abec. A manga adaptation of Sword Art Online Progressive by Himura Kiseki ran from 2014 to 2018 with seven tankoubon volumes.

The Consortium is comprised of Macquarie Asset Management a global asset manager and the world’s largest infrastructure manager and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) one of Canada’s largest institutional investors. As announced in March 2021 the Transaction forms part of National Grid’s strategic pivot towards electricity and follows last year’s acquisition of Western Power Distribution (WPD) the UK’s largest electricity distribution business and announced sale of The Narragansett Electric Company (NECO) in the US.

The terms of the Transaction imply an enterprise value for NGG of approximately £9.6 billion. On completion National Grid will receive approximately £2.2 billion in cash consideration (subject to customary completion adjustments). Following the Transaction National Grid will own a 40% minority equity interest in NGG via a new holding company called 'GasT TopCo'. In addition National Grid will also receive approximately £2.0 billion from additional debt financing at completion. As at March 2022 NGG’s regulated asset value is estimated to be approximately £6.6 billion and its net debt is estimated to be approximately £3.8 billion.

National Grid has also entered into an option agreement with the Consortium for the potential sale of the remaining 40% of equity in GasT TopCo (the 'Further Interest'). The option may be exercised by the Consortium between 1 January 2023 and 30 June 2023 (subject to change depending on the timing of the closing of the Transaction). If the option is exercised the consideration for the Further Interest is expected to be paid in cash to National Grid on broadly similar terms to the Transaction subject to adjustment for dividends paid in the business at the time of exercise. Further details will be announced if the option is exercised.

Completion of the Transaction will be subject to certain antitrust and regulatory conditions. Subject to these clearances National Grid expects that the Transaction will complete in the second half of calendar year 2022.

On completion the Transaction together with the proposed sale of NECO will:

Increase the balance of National Grid’s portfolio towards electricity with the proportion of the Group’s assets in electricity growing from c.60% to c.70%;

Significantly enhance National Grid’s central role in the delivery of the UK’s net zero targets;

Underpin National Grid’s 6 to 8% asset growth target for longer;

Enable National Grid to maintain a strong balance sheet with its strong investment grade credit rating supporting its sustainable dividend policy.



John Pettigrew Chief Executive of National Grid said: “This transaction further enhances our role in delivering the UK’s energy transition pivots our portfolio towards electricity whilst ensuring the security of the energy supply for the country. Alongside our plans to invest up to £35 billion in energy infrastructure over the next five years the series of transactions announced last March will strengthen our long-term growth prospects and drive long-term value for shareholders.

""Today’s announcement is a strong result for all our stakeholders including employees and customers. The Consortium has a long-term commitment to the UK with significant experience in owning and operating infrastructure assets. I look forward to our partnership and continuing to deliver safe and reliable gas service at the least cost to consumers. I would also like to thank my colleagues in Gas Transmission and Metering for their hard work that has helped us reach this important milestone.”

Martin Bradley Head of Macquarie Asset Management’s Real Assets team in EMEA said: “The national transmission system is a critical enabler of the UK’s energy transition providing the flexibility and reserve energy needed in the electricity system as the deployment of renewable sources of generation accelerates. However if the UK’s net zero by 2050 target is to be met the country must have a next-generation transmission backbone to power homes and businesses with renewable energy.

""Backed by our significant investment the transmission system will play a leading role in making the network ready for this transition. In doing so it will support the expansion of hydrogen’s role in the energy mix to deliver a competitive edge to the UK and its industry while working closely with the Government and Ofgem to maintain security of supply.”

Lincoln Webb Executive Vice President and Global Head of Infrastructure & Renewable Resources at BCI said: “This investment aligns well with our diversified portfolio of regulated utilities that securely deliver critical services to customers. We believe National Grid’s innovative decarbonisation strategy will ensure the business plays a leadership role in supporting the UK to achieve net zero carbon emissions on target by 2050 while meeting consumer demand for reliable networks.”



Following completion of the Transaction National Grid intends to use proceeds of approximately £4.2 billion towards repayment of the bridge financing facility that was drawn as part of the acquisition of WPD. For the purposes of Listing Rule 10.4 NGG’s gross assets as at 30 September 2021 were £6.1 billion. For the period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 NGG group generated profit before tax of £406 million.

The Transaction constitutes a class 2 transaction for the purposes of the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules and as such does not require National Grid shareholders' approval.

Following completion National Grid’s interest in GasT TopCo will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

National Grid was advised by Barclays Goldman Sachs and Robey Warshaw.

SACRAMENTO Calif. — A state law advanced by Gov. Gavin Newsom in response to PG&E’s crimes was drafted by a law firm that previously represented the power monopoly for decades.

The firm O’Melveny & Myers was listed on documents PG&E filed with the state as recently as five months before the November 2018 Camp Fire ABC10’s investigation reveals.

PG&E later pleaded guilty to 85 felonies for recklessly sparking the fire which destroyed Paradise California in the largest mass homicide committed by a corporation in the United States.

“PG&E’s lawyers wrote the law that allowed them to get away with murder” said Steve Bradley whose grandmother Colleen Riggs was one of PG&E’s 84 manslaughter victims. “That's absolutely horrifying.”

Law experts told ABC10 they did not see anything inherently illegal about the fact that the firm represented Newsom’s office in PG&E’s bankruptcy after previously working for PG&E.

As a political and governmental ethics issue however multiple fire survivors say the arrangement doesn’t pass the smell test.

“The corruption is rampant” said Paradise town Councilman Woody Culleton whose house burned down in the Camp Fire.

“It's completely a farce” Bradley said after viewing the documents. “It's almost like the bank robbers’ union designing the bank safes.”

The 2019 law known as AB-1054 was critical in enabling PG&E to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy offering the utility financial protection from the cost of wildfire damage.

ABC10 previously reported that O’Melveny & Myers drafted the legislation under a $9.6 million contract with Newsom’s office that began in February 2019 three months after the Camp Fire.

Investment bankers from financial firm Guggenheim and officials from PG&E’s ostensibly-independent state regulator the California Public Utilities Commission worked with O’Melveny lawyers to write AB-1054 before it was revealed to state lawmakers.

The CPUC was the recipient of the documents reviewed by ABC10 for this story in which PG&E lists O’Melveny as one of its outside law firms.

CPUC filings show O’Melveny performed legal services as recently as 2017 for the corporation’s electric and gas businesses.

PG&E’s bankruptcy deal settled damages claims for wildfires that killed 131 people in 2015 2017 and 2018.

The filings show the law firm billed PG&E nearly $250000 of legal work from 2012-2017 but O’Melveny told ABC10 it previously did “major work” for PG&E that dates back at least two decades.

Neither Newsom’s office PG&E nor O’Melveny agreed to be interviewed for this story.

In email exchanges all three disputed the idea that the firm’s work crafting AB-1054 presented any sort of conflict.

Newsom spokesperson Alex Stack wrote “The firm you’re referring to did not represent PG&E when it worked for the State of California on this matter.”

Bradley said “It still looks bad. They still have a law firm that previously represented PG&E now representing the state. They're treating PG&E like another office of the governor.”

“The way that decisions are being made on our energy system… would be appalling to any third grader who's trying to figure out how a bill becomes a law” said Pete Woiwode with Reclaim Our Power a left-leaning group pushing for PG&E’s power grid to be converted to a non-profit public utility.

By email PG&E spokesperson Lynsey Paulo asserted “there was no conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of interest.”

“It sure appears to me” Bradley said. “I don't think any reasonable person would think that this was a good idea at all.”

“Conflict of interest is the most benign explanation for this” said Phil Binstock the son of PG&E manslaughter victim Julian Binstock. “The most malignant is that they’re corrupt.”

Culleton the Paradise town councilmember gave a one-word response to PG&E’s statement: “Bull****.”

RENEWED FOCUS ON PG&E’S POLITICAL DONATIONS MEETINGS

In interviews for this story multiple fire survivors pointed to the fact that Newsom’s campaign and a supermajority of state lawmakers benefitted PG&E political donations and that the company gave money to a nonprofit founded by Newsom’s wife.

“If the suggestion is somehow I’m influenced by that you’re wrong” Newsom previously said.

The donations were made while the corporation was serving time on probation for six federal felonies tied to the deadly San Bruno Gas explosion. Newsom called it a “strange question” to ask whether it was right to accept PG&E funds during that time.

Bill sponsor Asm. Chris Holden (D-Pasadena) who previously declined to comment on the $8800 PG&E donated to his 2018 campaign scheduled an interview for this story.

His office then canceled with no explanation and did not respond to a request to reschedule.

In a brief unscheduled interview inside the state Capitol Holden said he was unaware O’Melveny had previously represented PG&E but he pushed back on the view from fire survivors that the arrangement was improper.

“I don’t agree with that” Holden said. “They have every right to view it in the way that they are. But this was not something that PG&E designed.”

AB-1054’s opponents beg to differ.

“The governor was holding a series of secret meetings some of which included O'Melveny and Myers with PG&E” said former prosecutor Mike Aguirre who represents PG&E customers in a lawsuit challenging AB-1054.

As part of his work on the suit Aguirre and his colleagues obtained calendar entries from the governor’s office.

One meeting stands out: On June 18 2019 the documents show six representatives of PG&E met behind-closed-doors with a group of Newsom’s staff and Nancy Mitchell the lead O’Melveny attorney working for Newsom.

Mitchell was included on emails sharing and revising draft versions of AB-1054 five days before the meeting.

Nearly two weeks after the meeting the bill would be unveiled to state lawmakers at the Capitol.

Mitchell no longer works for O’Melveny. She did not respond to a voicemail left on her cell phone.

Notably the meeting also included Newsom staffer Alice Reynolds who was since appointed to take over as President of the CPUC at the end of 2021.

Newsom’s previous appointee to the job Marybel Batjer resigned without a confirmation hearing after running the agency while it was accused by prosecutors of hampering the Camp Fire investigation waived a $200 million fine for the company’s safety violations and misled the public about it then refused to provide her communications with Reynolds and other Newsom staffers under state transparency laws.

ABC10 sued the agency for the release of those records in a case that’s still pending.

“I think they knew exactly what they were doing” Aguirre said. “To do what PG&E was asking them to do which is to relieve PG&E from any legal responsibility for past and future fires.”

WAS THE PAST WORK FOR PG&E DISCLOSED?

Neither the governor’s office O’Melveny nor PG&E answered when asked whether the firm’s past work for the utility was disclosed before Newsom hired the firm.

Newsom spokesperson Alex Stack said “the lawyers involved [in the work for the Governor] had nothing to do with any prior representation of the company” but PG&E declined to provide a list of O’Melveny attorneys who previously represented the utility.

Without saying whether it did disclose its past work for PG&E O’Melveny said doing so would have been unnecessary.

“There was no… disclosure obligation” O’Melveny spokesperson Chris Reick wrote. “There has never been a conflict arising from our old work for PG&E.”

Reick suggested that ABC10 “reconsider your story.”

His email characterized the work O’Melveny did in the years leading up to the Camp Fire as less “major” than the work it did for PG&E two decades ago adding “there has never been a conflict arising from our old work for PG&E.”

Ehsan Zaffar a legal ethics expert at Arizona State University’s school of law told ABC10 he’d need more specifics to gauge whether the disclosure was necessary.

In general from outside a firm it’s “difficult to assess potential conflicts which is why most firms have in-house conflict check systems and staff” Zaffar said.

O’Melveny did not answer whether it took steps to “wall off” any of its attorneys who had previously represented PG&E from the work the firm did from the state.

Aguirre the attorney fighting AB-1054 says you can picture the conflict by imagining what would have happened if O’Melveny had helped the state create a plan that cracked down harshly on PG&E instead of helping it to emerge from bankruptcy.

“You think PG&E wouldn't raise the issue” Aguirre asked rhetorically. “That there was prior representation?”

“You don’t hire a pro-corporate law firm when you need a pro-victim solution” Aguirre said. “That’s really what it boils down to.”

VICTIMS LEFT SHORT PG&E GETS ‘LICENSE TO BURN’

One of the intended effects of AB-1054 was to help shore up the value of PG&E stock shares a quarter of which were transferred to a trust to pay 68000 victims of PG&E’s 2015-2018 wildfires for the loss of their homes jobs and loved ones.

It hasn’t worked out. PG&E’s stock price has never attained the value victims were told when they were shown the bankruptcy deal leaving victims billions short on funds and waiting years for payment.

“All of that was just wishful thinking” Aguirre said. “You don't need to go to O’Melveny & Myers [Newsom] could have gone to Disneyland and gotten that type of advice.”

“The story of the stock isn’t a very good one” victim trustee John Trotter told fire victims. “Where do we get the money in order to pay you?”



Trotter has since told PG&E’s fire victims that they were “left out” by AB-1054.

Even so the legislation enabled PG&E to keep going.

PG&E has annually been certified as a safe utility by the state under AB-1054 which critics call a “license to burn.”

The certificate entitles PG&E to a presumption that it acted reasonably in connection with fires sparked by its equipment even when state arson investigators find probable cause to believe the utility committed a crime.

If a utility was deemed reasonable its shareholders are protected from having to pay for fire damage out of the money they would otherwise be able to take a profit.

PG&E already budgeted $150 million in protection from AB-1054’s utility insurance fund to cover damage caused by last year’s massive Dixie Fire.

Ratepayers across California will pay into that fund for 20 years under AB-1054 providing half of its $21 billion.

“AB-1054 has not served the people of California” said Woiwode the energy activist. “It's only served to keep PG&E in power and that's been more dangerous for people across the state.”

The Dixie Fire is the most recent to be blamed on PG&E by state investigators.

PG&E faces four counts of felony involuntary manslaughter in Shasta County for the 2020 Zogg Fire.

Preliminary hearings began earlier this year for 33 criminal charges against PG&E for the Kincade Fire sparked by a PG&E transmission line in 2019. PG&E is attempting to reach a settlement with Sonoma County prosecutors.

Under AB-1054 PG&E was awarded a safety certificate after each of those fires.

When asked how that amounted to the stated purpose of the bill he sponsored to hold utilities accountable and promote safety Holden couldn’t say.



“Well I mean I can't explain” Holden said. “I'm not part of doing the investigations and issuing the [safety] certificates.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YW5kYXJkbWVkaWEuY28ua2UvaGVhbHRoL3dvcmstbGlmZS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMDE0NDExODMvYnJlYWtkb3duLWpvYi1ncm91cHMtc2FsYXJpZXMtYW5kLWFsbG93YW5jZXMtaW4ta2VueWHSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFuZGFyZG1lZGlhLmNvLmtlL2hlYWx0aC9hbXAvd29yay1saWZlL2FydGljbGUvMjAwMTQ0MTE4My9icmVha2Rvd24tam9iLWdyb3Vwcy1zYWxhcmllcy1hbmQtYWxsb3dhbmNlcy1pbi1rZW55YQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Breakdown: Job groups salaries and allowances in Kenya,"For public servants job groups and salaries are set and reviewed by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission.

The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC) plans to reconstruct and widen the Northeast Extension (I-476) from Milepost (MP) A53 to A57. The project corridor traverses Lower Macungie Township passing through Upper Macungie Township and ending in South Whitehall Township in Lehigh County.

The existing four-lane highway is 72 feet wide and will be widened and reconstructed to 122 feet wide. This new roadway will accommodate three 12-foot travel lanes in each direction a 26-foot median and 12-foot outside shoulders (see rendering below). The Design Team is currently developing design plans and coordinating studies in support of the environmental permitting process. Below is the anticipated schedule.

As part of this multi-phase project the PTC is advancing construction on the five overhead bridges. The Tilghman Street Bridge (S.R. 1002) is the first bridge and is currently under construction. These bridges must be lengthened to accommodate the wider turnpike roadway before the reconstruction and widening can begin.

The PTC will coordinate closely with PennDOT and local municipalities as final design and construction progress. The goal is not to disrupt traffic if possible.

Oh and they also adore a good belly rub.

They are military working dogs or MWDs and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) trains all Army veterinarians and animal care specialists worldwide at its U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School’s Department of Veterinary Science at Fort Sam Houston Texas. Piedmont Technical College (PTC) Veterinary Technology student Samantha Haag a specialist in the U.S. Army Reserve attended training there for 11 weeks last summer and graduated with an animal care specialist certification. She shared her experiences with her Vet Tech classmates on PTC’s Newberry Campus. She now holds the military occupation specialty (MOS) known as “68-Tango” or 68T.

“68-Tango is the only military branch that supports the Army’s veterinary services mission” Haag said. “The school at Fort Sam Houston is the ground zero basic course for all military personnel responsible for animal handling and care.”

The 25-year-old student who resides in Lexington completed the rigorous 11-week course on Sept. 14. Dogs are the primary focus of training but the school also cares for ceremonial horses some livestock and research animals.

“All of these animals get the very best care” she said. “Working dogs are soldiers’ partners and their very best friends. It’s personal.” In fact about 90% of military handlers adopt their dogs upon retirement.

When she previously served in the U.S. Army National Guard in Minnesota Haag considered a number of MOS options.

“I knew there was a vet program in the Army but it’s very popular and a hard MOS to get” she said.

Consequently Haag decided on a logistics MOS for the four years she served with the Minnesota National Guard before being honorably discharged.

“After moving to South Carolina I saw a job listing for a 68T and spoke to a recruiter” she said.

As a result Haag was temporarily pulled from her Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) status so she could complete the 68T training. Because there was an open position with a U.S. Army Reserve unit at Fort Jackson she joined that unit in October 2020.

“Since I am now certified in the 68T MOS if I choose to reenlist I will keep my MOS of 68T” she said.

Haag had started but not completed a veterinary technology program in Minnesota and she enrolled at PTC in Newberry because of its convenient proximity to her Lexington home.

The course at Fort Sam Houston which was delayed due to COVID-19 was tough and comprehensive. There was so much to remember. Haag was feeling the pressure.

“At times I was overwhelmed and stressed out. We all learned a lot” Haag said. “I would do it again.”

As it turned out Haag graduated at the top of her class receiving a medal as the Distinguished Honor Graduate.

Haag noted that many people are curious about military dogs. She said that the military currently obtains most of its working dogs from Germany but operates a DOD breeding program at Lackland Air Force Base that produces about 10% of the military’s canine soldiers. Efforts are underway to grow that program because purchasing dogs from overseas can be an expensive proposition. About 1600 MWDs actively serve in the U.S. military.

Because every military unit utilizing MWDs can’t have an attached veterinarian or vet tech the military does cross-train members of the medical corps to take emergency life-saving measures when a war dog is injured on the front lines. Just like their human handlers military dogs are considered active duty soldiers and are even given a rank usually equal to or higher than their handler. The status of Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) traditionally has been assigned to military dogs to reinforce the bonded respectful relationship between dog-and-handler. The dogs are Purple Heart recipients and when they die they are buried with military honors as well.

“We don’t leave any dog behind” Haag said. “They are soldiers just like us.”

Just after 8 a.m. several agencies responded to a call about a fire at Summit Storage a self-storage facility located near the 9500 block of W 10th Ave in Kennewick.

Once on scene fire crews said they saw heavy smoke coming from the south side of the first unit.

Cpt. Aaron Bibe with Benton County Fire District #1 said the fire spread to a total of 15 storage units.

Fire officials said there were 37 firefighters on scene and 18 fire engines. Fire crews from Kennewick Fire Pasco Fire Richland Fire Benton County Fire District #4 and Benton County Fire District #1 all responded to help extinguish the fire.



Fire officials contained the fire and the owners have been notified. Firefighters said some of the storage units involved along with the contents inside sustained heavy damage.

Officials said the owner of the complex brought in a tracked excavator to remove items inside the storage units so firefighters could get to smoldering pockets of fire during mop-up activities.

Fire officials reported no injuries.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb2tlc21hbi5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyL21hci8yNy9zdGlsbC1oYXZlLXRvby1tdWNoLW9yLXRvby1iaWctb2Ytc3R1ZmYtbHV4dXJ5LXN0by_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Still have too much or too big of stuff: Luxury storage condo concept taking hold in Spokane region,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2022/mar/27/still-have-too-much-or-too-big-of-stuff-luxury-sto/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb2tlc21hbi5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyL21hci8yNy9zdGlsbC1oYXZlLXRvby1tdWNoLW9yLXRvby1iaWctb2Ytc3R1ZmYtbHV4dXJ5LXN0by_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvdHRzbWVyYy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yNi9saW5maWVsZC1tYXN0ZXItcGxhbi1kcmFmdC1nZXRzLWNoaWxseS1yZWNlcHRpb24tZnJvbS1saW1lcmljay1vZmZpY2lhbHMv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG90dHNtZXJjLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAzLzI2L2xpbmZpZWxkLW1hc3Rlci1wbGFuLWRyYWZ0LWdldHMtY2hpbGx5LXJlY2VwdGlvbi1mcm9tLWxpbWVyaWNrLW9mZmljaWFscy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Linfield master plan draft gets chilly reception from Limerick officials,"LIMERICK — Aspects of the update to the attempt to craft a master plan for development in Linfield village got a chilly reception from not only the township supervisors but even from some members of the committee charged with its creation.

Peter Simone from Simone Collins Landscape Architects the consultant hired to help put the plan together offered up a 69-page presentation to the public at the supervisors’ March meeting and said the effort has so far taken two years to put together. Part of the reason for the delay was the COVID-19 pandemic which limited public gatherings but also “gave us more time to think about things.”

Although the historic village hasn’t changed much over the years there has been an influx in suburban “sprawl” development on the land outside the village said Simone.

That has resulted in more vehicles and throughout the presentation and the public comments complaints about traffic and the roads were dominant; that and “the elephant in the room” — what to encourage at the 190-acre former industrial site known to most as the Publicker site.

Last month developer Tim Hendricks proposed a project that would re-make the Publicker site as a place with self-storage and warehouse uses.

“It will continue to be a negative for the village until it is redeveloped” Simone said. More troubling is the fact that a marketing study showed potential uses that might be preferable — retail office or even senior housing — are likely not economically viable especially when considering the high “penalty costs” of cleaning up the site and making road improvements which could climb as high as $30 million above the purchase price.

Demand for retail and office space likely has dropped even more since the study was done as the pandemic moved more people to “shopping from home and working from home” Simone observed.

Simone said the traffic problem in Linfield is not so much one of volume but of speed and that some of the worst offenders are residents joking “we have met the enemy and it is us.” He said the township’s own traffic engineer’s study showed intersection service levels are good and would not get significantly worse if the Publicker site were developed with housing possibly even high-density housing.

But that idea got a cold response from the township supervisors particularly after they listened to public comments several from some of the committee’s own members.

“I think the two things we reached consensus. One is we wanted more outreach to the people of Linfield — (only 35 percent responded to a survey for the plan) — and two that we didn’t want high-density public housing at Publicker” said committee member Allie Susek.

“At no point did anyone on the committee recommend high-density housing at Publicker” said committee member Bill DeGideo. “This plan comes before you with all of our names on it but it doesn’t really feel like our input was included in this as a whole” he said. “I don’t want to sell this to a developer as something the township wants.”

It doesn’t said supervisors’ Chairman Ken Sperring Jr.

“Not one person on this board is in favor of high-density housing anywhere” Sperring said. “That’s not going to happen.”

“I’m not happy with this plan either” said Supervisor Patrick Morroney who had been on the committee and said he was “removed.” He said “this feels like we’re taking things away from Linfield and we want to improve the quality of life in Linfield not add more traffic to the roads.”

“I’m ticked I’m beyond ticked” said Leonard Miller who said he owns the business where Mane Street Hair Studio is located on Main Street. Truck traffic from Bengal Paper makes the roads in the village unsafe he said adding “somebody’s going to get seriously hurt. It’s ridiculous.”

Several ideas for road and traffic flow improvements are included in the plan draft including building new roads and making space for sidewalks and on-street parking by making some of the roads one-way.

Simone’s presentation also stressed the fact that while “there is quite a lot of open space” in and around Linfield “you don’t have a major riverfront park and to me that’s a missed opportunity.”

The update calls for trying to create a riverfront park at the Publicker site and explores the possibility of transforming the Linfield Sports Park into a kind of village green.

That last idea fell flat with former supervisor Elaine DeWan who is also a member of the plan’s committee and was on the board which purchased that park property. “I don’t want to see recreation activities taken out of Linfield” she said.

Township Manager Dan Kerr and Simone both assured those in the audience and watching online that the idea behind the plan is to “give the township options.” Before the supervisors would re-zone anything a much closer look at the impacts would be examined Kerr said.

“The roadways are the most important thing” Simone said. “There would be no development until the township decides on plans for the roadways.”

Linfield resident Bridget Lightcap said “why can’t Linfield be left alone as the little country village that it is. Why would we want to upgrade to all the fancy Yuppy things you’re picturing up there?”

“We will be revising the plan before we accept it and you will all be able to see what’s proposed before we do” said Sperring.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd2ViYmNpdHkubmV0L2l0cy1vZmZpY2lhbC1mbGF0LWNyZWVrLXRvLWJyZWFrLWdyb3VuZC1pbi1hcHJpbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It’s official: Flat Creek to break ground in April,"Flat Creek Restaurant announces expansion to Webb City

Southwest Missouri-based FC Developments LLC announced the expansion of Flat Creek Restaurant to Webb City which will be built in the growing Centennial Park development on East Road adjacent to the Sleep Inn. The building will be leased to owner-operators Josh Rasmussen and Alan Kram who own and operate Flat Creek restaurants in Republic and Cape Fair.

The new 9500 square foot restaurant will seat 300 guests and have 214 parking spaces making it the largest restaurant in Webb City. Rasmussen anticipates that the new facility will employ up to 100 employees which would make it one of the larger employers in the area. “The City of Webb City is excited to welcome Flat Creek Grill to our community. For many years the dream of creating a destination attraction within the Centennial Retail District has been a priority of the City Council” says Lynn Ragsdale Mayor of Webb City. “Flat Creek Grill and their excellent family style dining will make a great neighbor for the current Sleep Inn and other Centennial District businesses as well as additional coming attractions we hope to announce in the near future.”

The menu will be largely the same as Flat Creek’s Republic and Cape Fair locations focusing on all-American favorites like smoked meats fried catfish and chicken steaks seafood burgers and more. The restaurant will also feature a full bar a private event space for parties and celebrations and catering services. The interior will be decorated with local memorabilia and regional décor adding to the destination-like experience. “Our restaurants have become a destination for a lot of folks because of the quality of our food and the service of our staff and we’re excited to make a new destination in Webb City and serve up our food to a new crowd of people” said Rasmussen.

Concurrent with the new restaurant construction in Webb City the same investor group will also be building a Flat Creek Restaurant in Bolivar Missouri. The project is financed by First State Community Bank of Lebanon designed by H Design of Springfield and a General Contractor will be selected sometime in April.

Groundbreaking is expected to occur in the Spring of 2022 and the restaurant plans to be open sometime in the winter of 2022/2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthbnNhc2NpdHkuY29tL25ld3MveW91ci1rY3EvYXJ0aWNsZTI1OTc4ODUxNS5odG1s0gE-aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAua2Fuc2FzY2l0eS5jb20vbmV3cy95b3VyLWtjcS9hcnRpY2xlMjU5Nzg4NTE1Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Reasonably safe:’ KCQ investigates Kansas City’s 1954 nuclear attack drill,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.kansascity.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Wait until iPhone 14.,"When iPhone 14 launches this autumn it’s expected to offer better 5G performance than its predecessors. The iPhone 13 already offers speedy connections but a new modem in the 2022 version will bring advantages to the next iOS handset.

Chief among these is better connections in areas with weak 5G signal.

Expect iPhone 14 to offer even better 5G

The iPhone 12 from 2020 was the first with 5G. This was provided by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X55 modem. In 2021 came the iPhone 13 with an X60. And 2022 is expected to bring the iPhone 14 with the X65.

The X55 is adequate — if slightly dated — and Qualcomm has since built on its capabilities. The X60 can combine signals from sub-6GHz and mmWave networks to provide better connections. And it uses less power.

And real-world testing shows the X65 already in the Samsung Galaxy S22 provides better performance when the 5G signal is weak. “In extremely low-signal conditions (below -120dBm LTE signal) the S22 units consistently reported better signal strength than comparable S21 models that use Qualcomm’s previous-generation X60 modem” notes PCMag.

As wireless carriers are still building out their 5G networks there are plenty of areas with weak signal.

Other enhancements in the X65 include 10 gigabit per second connections up from the current peak of 7.5 Gbps. And battery drain has been further reduced.

While there has been no definite announcement that the iPhone 14 will use the Snapdragon X65 everyone is assuming it will.

Battle behind the scenes

Given the progression of iPhone modems it should be obvious Apple and Qualcomm have a multiyear deal. But it is one that was made after a bitter legal fight.

That’s why Apple is hard at work developing its own 5G modems. It’s possible the iPhone 14 will be the last to use a Qualcomm one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcmR3YXJlem9uZS5jb20uc2cvdGVjaC1uZXdzLXF1YWxjb21tLXJ1bW91cmVkLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTgtZ2VuLTEtcGx1cy1pbi1tYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm rumoured to launch Snapdragon 8 Gen 1+ in May,"Qualcomm rumoured to launch Snapdragon 8 Gen 1+ in May

""Charging individuals for Covid testing--a basic public health tool is just willful stupidity.""

According toABC News Quest Diagnostics one of the largest testing companies in the country has decided that those ""who are not on Medicare Medicaid or a private health plan will now be charged $125 dollars ($119 and a $6 physician fee) when using one of its QuestDirect PCR tests either by ordering a kit online or visiting one of the 1500 Quest or major retail locations that administer the tests such as Walmart or Giant Eagle.""

The outlet reports the company has already ""begun notifying its clients and partners they can no longer expect to be reimbursed for uninsured claims"" unless new government funding is approved by Congress.

As Common Dreams reported at the time critics slammed lawmakers earlier this month for making a ""choice to extend the pandemic"" by dropping over $15 billion in Covid-19 relief from a must-pass omnibus spending bill after Republicans wanted the funds to be redirected from already approved aid directed toward states.

Citing research published last month in the Journal of General Internal Medicine physician and Medicare for All advocate Dr. Adam Gaffney on Saturday posted a twitter thread detailing how the study showed that uninsured people in the U.S. were more likely to be infected with Covid-19 a statistic he believes is likely still true but much less likely to get tested.

""Even with the federal coverage"" Gaffney said the study he co-authored on the subject ""found uninsured were less likely to be tested despite having a higher rate of test positivity. But this latest shift will only exacerbate such disparities.""

And while the researchers concluded their study by calling for expanded and more robust insurance coverage and access to Covid care for Americans Gaffney bemoaned Saturday that now policymakers are ""going in reverse.""

Responding to ABC News reporting on Saturday Oni Blackstock a medical doctor and founder of the group Health Justice suggested Quest's shift on how it will charge for their testing was an ominous sign:

Eric Reinhart an athropology researcher and a resident physician at Northwestern University also condemned the development.

""Charging individuals for Covid testing--a basic public health tool"" said Reinhart ""is just willful stupidity.""

The news also comes as progressives in the U.S. House on Thursday announced the first hearings since the pandemic began on Medicare for All.

Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) who along with Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) will lead the hearing in the House Oversight Committee on Tuesday said this week that ""Americans deserve a healthcare system that guarantees health and medical services to all. Congress must implement a system that prioritizes people over profits humanity over greed and compassion over exploitation.""",,,,,,,,,
RL,Ralph Lauren Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYWlybWFpbC5uZXdzL2lzc3Vlcy8yMDIyLTMtMjYvdGltZS10by1nZXQtZHJlc3NlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ralph Lauren Talks to Bridget Foley in a Rare Interview,"For decades Ralph Lauren’s show has been a focal point of New York Fashion Week. After a nearly 26-month hiatus Lauren returned to the runway on Tuesday night showing in a gallery at the Museum of Modern Art. The set mimicked his elegantly streamlined New York apartment. Soaring white walls and tailored seating contrasted with the black high-shine floor; windows opened upon faux-skyline views.

Round-the-clock style: Lauren’s models backstage.

“The modernness and the cleanness is where I was going” Lauren said before he showed both his Collection and Purple Label lines. We met at a warehouse space at the Starrett-Lehigh Building in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood where the room bustled with typical pre-show activity from last-minute fittings to final hair-and-makeup discussions.

The event at MoMA felt like a posh at-home gathering for which New York mayor Eric Adams showed up along with among others Jessica Chastain Janelle Monáe Lily Collins Rachel Brosnahan Henry Golding and TikTok stars Wisdom Kaye and Nic Kaufmann.

Tailoring three ways: New York mayor Eric Adams Lily Collins and Janelle Monáe.

The clothes mostly black-and-white were an ode to sophisticated New York via the Lauren lens which is to say aspirational not only in beauty but in serenity and elegant demeanor. The seductive evening looks achieved maximum impact with a minimum of yardage their shapes alluringly lean and body-con.

But as idealized as Lauren’s world is it’s not about dressing for events. In fact he entered the industry in part as a reaction to tony designers’ excessive focus on evening. “When I started in this business everything was about a gown” he recalled. “It wasn’t about you—about people living a life. I saw clothes as living. Call it lifestyle but that was my statement.” Thus this collection also featured plenty of smart sharply cut clothes for day designed he said with “the modernness and sleekness that I feel looks right.”

A gown that delivers a serious dose of glamour.

Modernity is something of a grail for Lauren. Or more correctly to be perceived as a modernist is a grail. For 55 years Lauren has been the architect of a powerful instantly recognizable aesthetic—a philosophy really—triggering such diverse descriptives as “aspirational” “optimistic” “refined” “rugged” “elegant” and “athletic.” But somehow “modern” seldom gets included in the litany. It frustrates him.

He maintains that modernity courses through the Lauren oeuvre manifesting in stylistic timelessness and a level of quality intended to endure. At a moment when all of fashion is tripping over itself to prove its environmental concern and the luxury world now zealously markets making “clothes that last” Lauren has been there in earnest from the beginning. “It was never about fashion. It’s always about timelessness” he said.

In Lauren’s fall ’22 collection the message was clear: it’s high time that we all start getting dressed again.

Nor has it been about clinical brand-building. In fact don’t call the Ralph Lauren company a “brand.” “I hate that word” he offered in a rare invocation of negative language. “It takes away the artistry of what you’re doing. It doesn’t say what the designer really does. It’s not a brand. It’s their life. It’s their heart. It’s their soul. They live and breathe it.”

The results of Lauren’s toil have certainly stood the test of time; he is widely admired by designers and top executives the world over. This apparently includes Bernard Arnault and in a more than casual manner. In February Axios reported that LVMH of which Arnault is chairman and C.E.O. and the Ralph Lauren Corporation have been in discussions about a possible sale of Lauren to the French luxury conglomerate.

Model Vittoria Ceretti captured Lauren’s mood in a tuxedo and baseball cap that gave a nod to Lauren’s home borough of the Bronx.

“When I started in this business everything was about a gown.”

While at the time both sides declined to address the report neither denied it. Now Lauren offered a quick deflection. “I am happy with how this company is running” he said. “It’s independent. That works for us.”

Through the pandemic Lauren stayed off the runway and until recently largely out of the press. He spent his time working away from the office in New York City. Initially that meant Bedford in Westchester County and then he “went where the weather went” to his homes in Jamaica and Montauk as well as the Double RL Ranch in Ouray Colorado.



Yet Lauren bristled at the inference that he is retreating at all from his active leadership role. “I haven’t been away” he insisted. As if on cue a model emerged in a shimmering black sequined tall-drink-of-water gown. “Look at this. Does this look like retreat?”

While out of town Lauren continued his eagle-eyed oversight of the company’s offerings. He designed three rounds of Collection not shown on the runway as well as frequent refreshes of the company’s various other lines. He stayed in constant touch through he says working “with Zoom machines and I mean things I never thought I would be doing.”

“It was never about fashion” Lauren says. “It was always about timelessness.”

What Lauren does and has always done is make clothes for living. He closed his show with Italian model Vittoria Ceretti wearing a feisty hybrid look a tuxedo with items from his collaboration with Major League Baseball—a Yankees cap and baseball jacket its back emblazoned with Ralph Lauren encircling the team’s storied “NY” logo. He loves New York.

While the Florida edition is brand new Innings Festival has been in existence since 2018 taking place in February in Tempe Arizona. To celebrate the return of baseball season organizers wanted to produce a festival that coincides with spring training. For the last four years the two-day concert helped usher in the beginning of spring training for the Cactus League on the west coast. After great turnouts in Arizona the Innings Festival organizers launched the Florida edition to bring attention to spring training occurring for the Grapefruit and Citrus leagues. Thanks to the Major League Baseball lockout which ended earlier this month Innings Festival Florida became more of a celebration than initially anticipated.

As the day-one fans trickled into the ballpark-themed festival grounds We Are Scientists were the leadoff hitters taking over the Home Plate stage. The early crowd got treated to a fun 45-minute set that started the festival on a positive note.

With it being a Major League Baseball-themed festival Canada made sure to be represented as Toronto-based rockers

put on an outstanding 45-minute performance. From the second that the group walked on stage they commanded the audience’s attention and interacted with the crowd getting them fired up for the rest of the day.

Despite former Major Leaguers being on hand actor

was the first celebrity to make an appearance at the festival. The X-Files star brought his folkish-sounding rock band to Home Plate. He may have been a star on the television screen but those who didn’t know any different may have considered Duchovny a bonafide rock star based on his time on stage. Throughout his 45-minute set Duchovny made sure to get the fans involved motioning to them several times fueling the energy-driven performance.

As Duchovny rounded out his performance British rockers

took the Right Field stage and immediately launched into the power-driven song “Smile” from their 2021 album

Blue Weekend

. Those unfamiliar with Wolf Alice quickly became impressed as the band made sure to take a deep dive into their catalog performing all the fan-favorites during their 45-minute set.

followed by playing a chock-full set of hits during their hour-long performance. The band left off with their hit “Futures” before rounding out their performance with a singalong with “Sweetness” and the band’s 2001 breakthrough hit “The Middle.”

The rock sound got a little heavier immediately after Jimmy Eat World played as

opened their set on the Right Field stage. Though politics weren’t a discussion point during the band’s hour set frontman Johnny Stevens came armed with a guitar that read “Battle Fat. F**k Putin.” Highly Suspect let the music do the talking for them speaking just briefly to the Innings Festival audience. The fans on hand didn’t mind it as the rockers ripped through their nine-song performance which included some of their mainstream hits such as “Bath Salts” “23” “My Name is Human” before closing with the band’s first-ever single “Lydia.”

As the sun started to sink the Home Plate stage started to get a little crowded as audience members packed in to watch

. From the opening notes it was clear that the rockers put together a heavy fan-favorite set that included their mainstream hits that lead off with “Nice to Know You.” Throughout the 14-song performance Incubus made sure to incorporate singles from throughout their 20-plus career with tracks like “Wish You Were Here” “Megalomaniac” “Pardon Me” “Stellar” and “Drive” all included in the 75-minute set. With those favorite songs included in their performance it’s no surprise that Incubus received quite the ovation one that required a bow before leaving the stage.

The vibe carried over to Right Field as

brought their rock-reggae-infused sound to the festival. It was clear that the group was having fun on stage and early into their set band members did their best to not only play to the fans but also the photographers in the pit as well.

Lead singer Nick Hexum was hardly stationary during the band’s 70-minute performance as he continuously moved to each side of the stage exciting the crowd. The first loud cheer of the set came early during the band’s second song “Freeze Time” when S.A. Martinez picked up the mic and added his rap lyrics to the track. Throughout their set 311 continued to feed off that energy and it helped that they made sure to splice in their hits including closing their performance with “Down.”

Throughout day one of Innings Festival Florida it was clear who the majority of the crowd was on hand to see –

. Throughout the festival several fans were spotted wearing Green Day apparel. What was funny was seeing the age range present on hand. Several older audience members made sure to wear their vintage T-shirts. Then the younger crowd members came dressed in black dress shirts with a red tie to match the outfit that lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong sported during the 2004

American Idiot

album.

It was fun to see them incorporate their hits across their 30-plus career throughout the band’s set. There was hardly a moment during Green Day’s nearly hour and 50-minute stage time where the crowd weren’t bellowing out the words to the tunes being performed. Some fans even got pulled onto the stage as one fan was able to sing the bridge of “Know Your Enemy” while another just danced along while the group performed “Pollyanna.”

Simple moments like that just helped affirm why fans across all age gaps enjoy listening and coming out to see Green Day perform. Before the night concluded Armstrong thanked the crowd for coming out before closing their set with “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)” while showering the audience in confetti and waving goodbye to the Tampa crowd.

While the music was a highlight during day one Innings Festival Florida did an excellent job changing the pace for fans who were very much in need of it. Fans could showcase their baseball skills by taking swings in either one of two batting cages or seeing what it feels like to make a diving play in the outfield by leaping into a padded landing. Additionally fans could test out their arm accuracy and velocity by throwing a few pitches in one of two mounds.

Former Major League Baseball players were also on hand during the festival. Ryan Dempster brought his podcast Off The Mound to the Left Field stage talking to several former big-league players about the game and sharing stories about their times in the majors. Those same players made time for the fans and were set up at meet stations throughout the festival. Fans could get autographs trade stories and take pictures with some of their favorite players. It certainly made for some memorable moments and an enjoyable first day of the festival. Players who made appearances during day one of the festival included: Tino Martinez Brian Jordan Gary Sheffield David Eckstein Lou Pinella Ray Lankford and Andruw Jones.

Bowl organizers announced on Friday that the Outback Bowl will now be called the Tampa Bay Bowl.

While Outback is no longer the title sponsor Tampa Bay Bowl Chair Rita Lowman said the bowl will continue to support local charities throughout the region.

Courtesy: Tampa Bay Bowl

She added the new name and logo are ""a reflection of our 36-year relationship with the vibrant Tampa Bay region.""

Outback — which is owned by Tampa-based Bloomin' Brands — had sponsored the annual bowl game at Raymond James Stadium from 1996 to 2022. Prior to that it was called the Hall of Fame Bowl.

“We look forward to continuing the Tampa Bay Bowl’s positive impact on college football and the Tampa Bay community both economically and by showcasing our region nationally and internationally"" Lowman said.

The new logo features a sun behind beach waves with two palm trees on either side.

The game will continue to be aired on ESPN and will continue its affiliation with teams from the Southeastern Conference and Big Ten or Atlantic Coast Conference/Notre Dame.

According to the release the game has attracted more than a million tourists and generated an estimated $1.1 billion in economic impact while distributing $164 million to universities.

Raymond James Stadium is also home to the Gasparilla Bowl. It was once known as the St. Petersburg Bowl and played in Tropicana Field. Its last title sponsor was Bad Boy Mowers from 2017-20.

(AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs have signed Ronald Jones to a one-year contract a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press on Saturday adding some depth behind Clyde Edwards-Helaire in the running back room.

The person spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because the deal was pending a physical.

Jones was a second-round pick of the Buccaneers in the 2018 draft who started 25 of the 55 games he appeared in over his first four seasons in the league. Jones’ best came in 2020 when he carried 192 times for 978 yards and seven touchdowns in the regular season then helped Tampa Bay defeat the Chiefs in the Super Bowl.

Jones ran 12 times for 61 yards in the Buccaneers’ 31-9 romp at Raymond James Stadium.

Jones effectively replaces Jerick McKinnon and Darrel Williams both of whom are free agents as the primary backups to the injury-prone Edwards-Helaire in the Kansas City backfield. The team also has tendered a qualifying offer to Derrick Gore but has little else in the running back room at this point in free agency.

The Chiefs have been actively retooling their roster during the offseason especially after dealing three-time All-Pro wide receiver Tyreek Hill to the Dolphins last week in a blockbuster trade for a package of draft picks.

They signed former Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster shortly after the free-agency period opened then signed former Packers wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling this past week. On defense they added safety Justin Reid to help replace Tyrann Mathieu and signed role players such as former Carolina linebacker Jermaine Carter.

The Chiefs are still in the market for help on defense particular at cornerback where they lost breakout star Charvarius Ward to the 49ers in free agency. But they also could plug some of their remaining holes in the draft where they have two selections in each of the first four rounds and 12 overall thanks to the Hill trade and compensatory picks.

The Kansas City Chiefs traded Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins earlier this week. Different conclusions on the decision and subsequent return are conflicting but one thing will remain true: Hill made football fun in Kansas City.

Simply put Hill was a threat to take it to the house any time he touched the ball. He may be the most explosive player in NFL history. Seeing Hill take his game to the next level when Patrick Mahomes took over as starting quarterback was something special. It was a pleasure watching him play football for the Chiefs over the past six seasons.

It was not easy to cut this list down to a list of five but here we go. Below are my top five plays from Hill’s time in Kansas City.

5. Punt return touchdown in season-opener against the Chargers

Hill started his career as a punt returner for the Chiefs his rookie season and took two returns back for a touchdown that year. His return role became less and less as he became a more dynamic weapon in the offensive game plan and getting more play as a starting wide receiver. However in Week 1 of the 2018 season Hill scored the Chiefs' first touchdown of the year on a 91-yard return that kicked off the Mahomes era of Chiefs football with a bang.

4. Huge first quarter ends with backflip into the end zone

Hill had the best single quarter by an individual player in NFL history against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020. 203 yards receiving two touchdowns and one backflip into the end zone were all sights to see. That was as close to perfection as one could get in a quarter of football.

3. Fourth-and-9

The Chiefs were in a battle with rival AFC team the Baltimore Ravens back in the early stages of the team's championship-caliber era. Despite being a game in the middle of the season everyone knew these teams would be in the playoffs and this could be a game that could decide seeding a while later. The Ravens were at a 90% probability of winning the game before this 4th-and-9 play late in the fourth quarter. The Chiefs would go on to win the game in overtime and get the No. 1 seed in the AFC at the end of the regular season.

2. Clutch touchdown in Divisional Round vs. Bills

The Chiefs needed an incredible effort from Hill to beat the Bills in the 2022 AFC Divisional round. 11 catches for 150 yards and one touchdown was the final stat line. Hill nearly took a punt return the distance in a play that set up the beginning of a wild back-and-forth fourth quarter. Hill played a part in the now infamous final 13 seconds of regulation that led the team to overtime. But it was the touchdown with just over a minute left in the fourth quarter that will be one of the final lasting memories of Hill in a Chiefs uniform. His electricity was on full display and fans got one final peace sign from the Cheetah in this highlight.

1. Jet Chip Wasp

The Chiefs' offense had been mostly stagnant through three-and-a-half quarters of Super Bowl LIV. It was third and 15 with 7:13 left in the game with the Chiefs losing to the San Francisco 49ers 20-10. Then the Chiefs dialed up a play to hit their playmaker on a long pass. It was 'Jet Chip Wasp' a play that will live on forever among Chiefs Kingdom. The play turned the momentum in favor of the Chiefs and they closed the final seven minutes of the game on a 21-0 run to beat the 49ers by a final score of 31-20. It was the Chiefs’ first Super Bowl victory in 50 years and Hill and this play played a huge role in it.

This article probably brought about many emotions. As I was writing this and watching the accompanying videos to pair with it I was going through a wide range of emotions. This included sadness happiness thankfulness pridefulness mindfulness some disappointment but most of all gratefulness. It was a treat to watch Hill help transform the Chiefs from a pretty good team that was a playoff contender every year to one that got to four straight AFC Championship games.

Despite Hill moving on to Miami the Chiefs still have a lot of pieces in place to remain a contender. This trade can set them up for the next window in the Mahomes era. The first window of the Mahomes era of Chiefs football has ended but now a new one begins. It’s sad to see such great players leave but knowing there is still a lot of good football ahead in Kansas City is encouraging.

Thanks for the memories Tyreek.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGFuZXRzcG9ydC5jb20vYW1lcmljYW4tZm9vdGJhbGwvbmV3cy9uZmwtbmV3cy1yYW5raW5nLXRvbS1icmFkeS1zZXZlbi1zdXBlci1ib3dsLXZpY3Rvcmllcy1uZXctZW5nbGFuZC1wYXRyaW90cy10YW1wYS1iYXktYnVjY2FuZWVyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ranking Tom Brady's seven Super Bowl victories,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.planetsport.com/american-football/news/nfl-news-ranking-tom-brady-seven-super-bowl-victories-new-england-patriots-tampa-bay-buccaneers on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbGFuZXRzcG9ydC5jb20vYW1lcmljYW4tZm9vdGJhbGwvbmV3cy9uZmwtbmV3cy1yYW5raW5nLXRvbS1icmFkeS1zZXZlbi1zdXBlci1ib3dsLXZpY3Rvcmllcy1uZXctZW5nbGFuZC1wYXRyaW90cy10YW1wYS1iYXktYnVjY2FuZWVyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

I mean it's a seriously bulky card that is comically large... the huge 3.5-slot design sees EVGA putting the 16-pin PCIe power connector on the end of the card. Man I love that... the I/O bracket has also been refreshed but still has the 3 x DisplayPort 1.4 + HDMI 2.1 connectors. All ready for 4K 120FPS and 8K 60FPS displays and TVs of now and the future.

COLORFUL has a few custom GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics cards that it will be unleashing 3 in fact: the BattleAx Deluxe Vulcan and Neptune custom GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics cards. Starting with the flagship COLORFUL GeForce RTX 3090 iGame Vulcan OC -- which looks so damn good -- with a huge 3.5-slot design.

The new COLORFUL GeForce RTX 3090 Ti iGame Vulcan OC graphics card is thick but unlike the EVGA RTX 3090 Ti FTW3 the COLORFUL RTX 3090 Ti iGame Vulcan OC has an awesome LCD display. Just like the RTX 3080 RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 cards in the iGame Vulcan OC family of GPUs.

COLORFUL will also have the even higher-end GeForce RTX 3090 Ti iGame Neptune OC which has a wicked dual-slot design and AIO liquid cooler. The AIO cooler comes as a 2-slot AIO kit with an attached 280mm radiator and dual fans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2NvbG9yZnVsLWlnYW1lLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwOTAtdGktdnVsY2FuLW9jLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQtcGljdHVyZWQtbWFzc2l2ZS1xdWFkLXNsb3QtY29vbGluZy1sY2QtZGlzcGxheS_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vY29sb3JmdWwtaWdhbWUtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA5MC10aS12dWxjYW4tb2MtZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZC1waWN0dXJlZC1tYXNzaXZlLXF1YWQtc2xvdC1jb29saW5nLWxjZC1kaXNwbGF5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Colorful iGame GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Vulcan-OC Graphics Card Pictured – Massive Quad-Slot Cooling & LCD Display,"Colorful's upcoming iGame GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Vulcan OC graphics card has been pictured ahead of its official introduction next week.

Colorful iGame GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Vulcan OC Is Another Thicc Ampere Graphics Card: Features PCIe Gen 5 Connector Quad-Slot Cooling LCD Display

Although the graphics card has already leaked out it looks like retailers have started to stock up for next week's launch and the packaging shows that the Colorful iGame GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Vulcan is ready to ship to its first customers on 29th March. This is a very premium model and likely to fetch a price of over $3000 US so make sure you have your wallets ready if you are eyeing this beast of a card.

As for features the Colorful iGame GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Vulcan OC will be equipped with a revised cooling solution that takes up four slots and will feature an extended heatsink design that will cool the custom PCB design underneath the cooler shroud. The shroud will be equipped with triple fans and the side of the shroud will house a large LCD featuring an 'iGame' splash screen and other use full metrics such as GPU clocks temps frame rate etc. The card will come with a single PCIe Gen 5 connector to boot and will be bundled with a 3x 8-pin to 1x 16-pin connector like every custom RTX 3090 Ti graphics card.

We reviewed the Colorful iGame GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Vulcan OC-V when it launched and which shares a similar design language to the 3090 Ti though the new model is an entirely different beast. We can also expect Colorful to release a limited edition KUDAN variant in the future though it may end up close to the launch of next-gen cards. Colorful will also have its standard BattleAx and the custom-loop Neptune cooling solution ready for unveiling next week too.

One more thing to mention is that there have been reports that the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti won't get a Founders Edition variant. These reports are baseless and NVIDIA will be launching the card in FE flavor though the whole launch is mostly a partner-driven event and as such you'd likely get to see more custom models being reviewed than Founders Edition.

As for pricing the card is expected to be a Titan replacement and the previous Titan graphics card the Titan RTX had a pricing of $2499 US. NVIDIA may or may not announce the pricing but that should give you an idea of where to expect the pricing once the card hits retail shelves.

The RTX 3090 Ti is a new 450W graphics card based on Ampere architecture.

There is a Founder’s Edition of the RTX 3090 Ti. The card presented at CES 2022 will become available for sale. We have some new photos of this new semi-custom design by NVIDIA that will become available though select retail partners as well as NVIDIA’s own official webstore.

The card retains the 3-slot configuration and the size of the original RTX 3090 Founders SKU. The RTX 3090 Ti is the new flagship Ampere SKU featuring GA102-350 GPU and 21 Gbps GDDR6 memory.

This model will also be the first NVIDIA card ever to feature a PCIe Gen5 16-pin power connector. This connector replaces NVIDIA’s 12-pin Molex MicroFit 3.0 plug that could feed up to 300W of power (through a dual 8-pin adapter). It was first seen on RTX 30 series in 2020 but has never been widely used by any custom design. The 12-pin connector remained exclusive to NVIDIA Founders Edition and at least 2 custom models based on NVIDIA reference PCB. In this regard the 16-pin connector should become more popular as we have already seen custom RTX 3090 Ti cards featuring this connector.

According to some initial reports the card just 5% to 10% faster than GeForce RTX 3090 at 4K resolution. There are memory-intenstive games that will see higher gains from the 21 Gbps GDDR6X upgrade but overall the reviewers that we spoke with are not impressed with its performance.

Some custom designs that will be unveiled on March 29 will have a TDP even higher than 450W. For instance the ASUS ROG STRIX OC will ship with 480W TDP and still be adjustable up to 516W. Here it is worth reminding that the maximum power that can be fed through the new PCIe Gen5 power connector and the PCIe slot itself is 525W.

As for the price there are still some conflicting reports. The rumors about pricing that surfaced in the last 24 hours have mentioned $1499 $1999 or even 2399 USD MSRP (that includes Founders Edition).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9jdXN0b20tZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA5MC10aS1mZWF0dXJlcy1xdWFkLXNsb3QtY29vbGVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Custom GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Features Quad-Slot Cooler,"Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti promises to vie for a spot on the best graphics card for gaming when it becomes available in a week or two but this card will require a lot of power and a lot of cooling. Early pictures of GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics cards from Nvidia's partners show massive cooling systems that are 3.5 – 4 slots wide.

Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti reportedly uses a fully-fledged GA102 GPU with 10752 CUDA cores (up from 10496 on the GeForce RTX 3090) mated with 24GB of GDDR6X memory running at 21Gbps across a 384-bit interface. The unit has all the chances to become the world's fastest graphics card but this also means a rather extreme power consumption. Reports indicate that GeForce RTX 3090 Ti will have a recommended thermal board power (TBP) of around 450W. Still some of Nvidia's partners may go as high as a whopping 480W (it is better not to think how much such a board will cost and keep in mind that Nvidia's current GeForce RTX 3090 has a power rating of 350W).

But 450W – 480W or thermal power needs some excellent cooling and with air cooling things get complicated. Nvidia's GA102 is a highly complex GPU and with its 28.3 billion transistors it wants power. But GDDR6X memory with its PAM4 encoding also consumes a lot of power so the card emits vast amounts of heat.

This situation is where rather large cooling systems come into play. VideoCardz has gathered images of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti partners cards (including those from Colorful and EVGA); they are either 3.5 – 4 slots wide or hybrid liquid cooling.

A quad-slot cooling system is without any doubt remarkable. Yet it reminds us of some other graphics subsystems we have encountered before.

The year was 2006 and the battle for the best graphics subsystem between ATI Technologies and Nvidia was raging. It was then possible to increase graphics performance by adding GPUs into a subsystem so both Nvidia and ATI introduced their SLI and CrossFire 2-way GPU technologies. But this was not enough for Nvidia which thought there was some space for ultra-high-end graphics subsystems involving four GPUs.

To make those 4-way SLI possible Nvidia developed its dual-GPU GeForce 7900 GX2 (for PC OEMs for regular users it followed with GeForce 7950 GX2). Quad SLI did not work correctly (yet the interest towards that setup was extremely high) but it set the tone for extreme performance and power consumption.

Nvidia's GeForce 7900 GX2 consumed some 110W of power and required a hefty power supply unit (by the standards of 2006) and two of such cards needed 220W of power. Today a single chip with its top configuration running at high clocks can use some 450W or more. Funny this power consumption with a single graphics processor is comparable to that of four GPUs back in the day.

Then again Nvidia's GA102 is faster and more capable than nearly every GPU designed. So maybe it is worth it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzkzOTQwLW52aWRpYS1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LW1ha2luZy02MDB3LXJlZmVyZW5jZS1ib2FyZHMtcnR4LTQwOTAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia is reportedly making 600W reference boards for the RTX 4090,"Rumor mill: According to industry sources Nvidia has shared its reference boards for the flagship RTX 4000-series GPUs which might be called the RTX 4080 4080 Ti 4090 or 4090 Ti with its OEM partners. It hasn't delivered the GPUs themselves yet but the boards are geared to consume 600W of power.

Several leakers with good track records have recently said that they expect the RTX 4080 or 4090 to have a 600W TBP (total board power). A higher-end model either the RTX 4090 Ti or some special edition card could consume over 800W. But they've also attached several disclaimers to those numbers noting that it's too early for exact details to have been finalized.

Igor's Lab reports that Nvidia has told OEMs to test the reference boards used to help them design their PCBs and coolers at the full 600W. Not every 4080 or 4090 will necessarily consume 600W out of the box but at least some will turbo or overclock into that power bracket.

Igor's Lab received a picture of a reference board from a Chinese OEM and confirmed its authenticity with two other sources (above). One standout feature was the twelve slots for memory modules which indicate that the GPU will have either 12 GB or 24 GB of GDDR6X memory most likely the latter.

It also had an impressive 24 voltage converters up from 20 on the Founder's Edition RTX 3090 PCB (shared between the GPU and memory). It used UPI Semi's UP9512 controllers capable of eight phases so three controllers per phase.

All those converters and modules are fed by one 12VHPWR connector also known as the PCIe 5.0 power plug which can deliver 600W alone. Igor's Lab notes that OEMs are designing PCBs that use the full 600W but as mentioned that's a ceiling not an average. Each 12VHPWR connector will come with an adaptor with four 6+2 pin Molex plugs even though most power supplies don't come with that many cables.

The insiders expect Nvidia to reuse the 3090's three-slot air cooler for the 4080 and 4090. Meanwhile manufacturers are reportedly preparing 3.5-slot air coolers and considering water-cooled solutions similar to what AMD used for the RX 6900 XT LC.

In a potential first the 3090 Ti and 4080 are allegedly pin-compatible meaning they can use the same PCB designs. Igor's Lab speculates that OEMs might be using the 3090 Ti to test their 4080 coolers and PCBs. So the 3090 Ti and the 4080 might share parts.

At the very least the 3090 Ti is the trial run for the 12VHPWR connector. Rumors indicate that the 3090 Ti will consume 400-500W depending on the model a range that looks crazy compared to the RTX 3000-series but tame compared to the rumored figures for the RTX 4080 and 4090.

Two Minnesota neighbors are among those who seek out old beauties instead—and who have amassed staggering collections of classics.

When Lee Anderson bought his first antique boat a 1938 Chris-Craft Resorter in 1985 he named it after his wife Katharine. “When I was a boy my dad had a wooden boat on the lake in northern Minnesota where we spent the summers” says Anderson 82. “I always wanted one. After Katharine I kind of got the bug.”

More from Robb Report

Forty-five boats later Anderson still owns the 19-footer—which he describes as “not terribly valuable” but one he’ll never sell—as well as the definitive collection of vintage North American boats with many valued in the millions. Anderson is now focusing on pre–World War II one-off race boats such as the 1924 Baby Bootlegger which won the American Power Boat Association Gold Cup in 1924 and 1925 and storied models from then rock-star builders including Gar Wood and Hacker and even rarer Canadian mahogany brands. To make the cut a boat must have a history so intriguing that it makes other collectors jealous. “Scarcity is what’s important to me” he says.

Anderson houses 10 vessels in a special wing of his home on Gull Lake Minn. that doubles as a showroom with tracks that lead down to the shore so he can launch them during the summer. He keeps 12 others in the water under canopies. “I don’t like the boats to not be used” he says. “I try to keep them all going every summer.” Anderson is regularly seen piloting two or three different woodies per day around the lake.

On the same chain of lakes lives John N. Allen (the men’s Naples Fla. homes are close by each other too) who also owns one of the country’s largest and rarest collections of classic wooden boats. “I’d see Lee running those boats before anyone else was interested and it kindled my interest” says Allen 67. His first acquisition: a 1929 Gar Wood triple-cockpit in 2001. “That was 29 boats ago.”

Allen’s collection includes the two oldest Chris-Crafts in existence—both dating to 1922—and a 1926 Gar Wood 33-foot Baby Gar called Bolo Babe powered by a V-12 Liberty engine. He’s now restoring Teaser an almost 40-foot-long fast commuter that in 1925 beat the 20th Century Limited train in a race along the Hudson from New York City to Albany. Allen declines to pick his favorite though it might be easy to guess. “Princess Paige is a 1926 Earl C. Barnes named after my only daughter” he says. “It’s the closest thing I’ve ever seen to a jewel box on the water.”

Allen considers himself a steward of the rare treasures. “So many valuable boats have been destroyed over the years” he says. “I take a lot of pleasure in restoring them and moving them into the future.”

The multi-hyphenate is about to release season 2 of Only Murders in the Building (which just premiered a new promo during a commercial break) and has been making rounds during awards season this year most notably at the SAG Awards and Critics’ Choice Awards. But that doesn’t guarantee an appearance at the 2022 Oscars. (Sorry Selenators!)

Selena is not attending the Academy Awards this time around despite her other awards appearances and there’s a good reason for it: She’s not nominated! She doesn’t have a movie out that’s eligible and she’s not presenting or attending with a nominee so it makes sense that she gets a rare (lol get it?) night off from business.

There were buzzy rumors that Selena would host the Oscars alongside Steve Martin and Martin Short (!!!) but that ultimately didn’t work out. (Regina Hall Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes are cohosting this year’s show instead.)

While the Oscars are going down tonight in Los Angeles Selena was most recently spotted in New York City with her new Only Murders costar Cara Delevingne grabbing dinner at Italian restaurant Casa Lever in Midtown.

Even though Selena isn’t making an appearance at the Oscars telecast tonight let’s take a moment to appreciate her 2022 SAG Awards velvet Oscar de la Renta gown and diamond choker:

Physicians are challenged continually to explore other options that may offer solutions for hard-to-treat cases. But questions remain as to which drugs might have indications beyond those that are FDA-approved and which new medications may be worth prescribing despite open questions about their long-term risks and rewards.

Creating successful treatment plans around the off-label use of biologics and new medications provided the focus of a session conducted at the American Academy of Dermatology’s 2022 Annual Meeting by David Rosmarin MD FAAD clinical investigator and vice-chair for research and education at Tufts Medical Center Boston Massachusetts in collaboration with Adriane A Levin MD FAAD director of the atopic dermatitis program at Brigham and Women's Hospital and an instructor in dermatology at the Harvard Medical School both based in Boston Massachusetts.1

The speakers highlighted strategies for optimizing the delivery of appropriate treatments for individual patients’ needs. Their review of the literature on off-label biologics use and new medications centered on TNF-alpha inhibitors anti-IL-17 antibodies anti-I-L23 biologics dupilumab (Dupixent; Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) and apremilast (Otezla; Amgen).

“Unfortunately it takes a lot of money and a lot of resources for a company to get an indication for medication” Rosmarin said. “So a lot of the time the uses for medications aren’t consistent with the label.”

Dupilumab is one example he said. “It’s currently approved for atopic dermatitis (AD) asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis” he noted. “But we see that it works with other conditions such as hand eczema or allergic contact dermatitis and patients who have HIV pruritis.”

There have also been recent studies which showed the drug’s effectiveness in treating chronic spontaneous urticarial and prurigo nodular as well according to Rosmarin.

“Some other inflammatory disorders where it can be used include alopecia areata and Grover’s Disease” he added. “Some evidence shows it can be combined with other psoriasis biologics if a patient has both psoriasis and atopic dermatitis simultaneously” Rosmarin added. “It’s been used very recently for some rare genetic syndromes such as Hailey-Hailey disease Job’s syndrome and Netherton syndrome. Those are all exciting uses.”

Dupilumab is gaining some traction in bullous pemphigoid an autoimmune blistering disorder occurring mostly in the elderly that in Rosmarin’s view lacks adequate treatments. He also noted recent cases in which this medication improved outcomes for patients with epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa and pemphigus vulgaris.

“So there has been a lot happening with the use of dupilumab for blistering disorders but the most evidence in the blistering space has been with bullous pemphigoid” Rosmarin said. “Currently there are case series regarding its efficacy in blistering disorders. In a case with 13 patients at least 12 had some clinical improvement with a little over half having complete clearance of both their blisters and itch: 75% having complete resolution of blisters and 85% having some improvement in their itch. Many responded quite rapidly.”2

Dupilumab is also now being tested in a phase 3 program (Liberty-BP NCT04206553) for an indication in this but that study will be a few years away he added.

“A lot of this is very new literature and some of it is not well-known. However it’s important to know because sometimes we are faced with diseases where we need more options” Rosmarin said. “We want treatments that are effective as well as safe for our patients and knowing about these alternative uses allows us to provide them to patients and help them get better.”

He added that most dermatologists will be faced with these rare cases at some point in practice and knowing about these solutions better prepares them for their treatment plans.

Turning to apremilast an oral small-molecule phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor with a multilevel immunomodulating mechanism of action Rosmarin catalogued its on-label uses in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis active psoriatic arthritis in adults and Behcet’s disease.

“In terms of other uses though there are case series of it being used for pyoderma gangrenosum hidradenitis suppurativa seborrheic dermatitis and also one of my favorite uses in lichen planus” Rosmarin said.

He pointed out other possible additions to the seborrheic dermatitis armamentarium: topical roflumilast foam (ARQ-154; Arcutis Biotherapeutics) now in phase 3 trials (Stratum NCT04973228) and topical crisaborole (Eucrisa; Pfizer) another PDE4 inhibitor that has been used off-label for treating this skin disorder.

“In terms of lichen planus there are some patient cases demonstrating that apremilast can improve outcomes and there’s also some evidence about the use of anti-IL-17 anti-IL-23 biologics for lichen planus as well” Rosmarin said.

Anti-IL-17 is approved for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and psoriasis within the dermatology space. Secukinumab’s (Cosentyx; Novartis) safety tolerability and efficacy were studied in a recent Phase 3 trial (NCT01989468) although results have not yet been published Rosmarin noted. “Physicians also look to IL-17 for dissecting scalp cellulitis” he noted.

Similarly for IL-23 there was a case for pyoderma gangrenosum which Rosmarin noted can be a challenging disease to treat.

“The goal is for people to understand better the mechanism by which these medications work so we have a broader view on how to treat some of these off-label diseases” he said. “We want to understand their actions so we can think about them as more than just for their label.”

The results indicate improved response rates and hair growth among trial participants said Brett King MD PhD an associate professor of dermatology at the Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven Connecticut. He is the lead author of the analyses and presented the research.

King presented 36-week results from the clinical trials at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 2021 Annual Meeting. The same results were also published March 26 2022 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

""Every bit of data we've had is hugely important"" King said in an interview with Medscape Medical News. ""Every time we add 16 weeks of data across hundreds of patients we are making a huge step forward toward the goal of FDA approval for a medication for alopecia areata.""

All patients enrolled in the two trials called BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 had severe alopecia areata defined as a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score of ≥ 50 meaning 50% or less scalp coverage. The score ranges from 0 (no hair loss) to 100 (complete hair loss). The primary endpoint was a SALT score ≤ 20 (80% scalp hair coverage).

The researchers pooled data from both clinical trials with a combined enrollment of 1200 for the 52-week results presented at the meeting. The placebo group stopped at 36 weeks and these patients were randomly reassigned to either the 4-mg or 2-mg once-daily baricitinib treatment groups.

At baseline patients enrolled in the trial had a mean SALT score of 85.5. After 52 weeks 39.0% of patients who received 4 mg of baricitinib had at least 80% scalp coverage. Of this group nearly three out of four (74.1%) had at least 90% scalp coverage or a SALT score ≤ 10.

In patients who received 2 mg of baricitinib 22.6% had a SALT score ≤ 20 (at least 80% scalp hair coverage) at 52 weeks and two thirds of that group (67.5%) had at least 90% scalp hair coverage at 52 weeks.

Comparatively at 36 weeks 35.2% of participants in BRAVE-AA1 and 32.5% of participants in BRAVE-AA2 receiving 4 mg of baricitinib had at least 80% scalp coverage. In the group taking the lower dose 21.7% and 17.3% of patients in the BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 trials respectively had achieved at least 80% scalp coverage at 36 weeks. (These percentages differ slightly from the NEJM article because of a different analysis of missing data King said. For comparison of both 36- and 52-week results the percentages from the EADV are used above.)

The results indicate that 5% more patients reached the primary endpoint in the additional 16 weeks of the trial King said.

Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition where immune cells attack hair follicles causing the hair to fall out and is associated with emotional and psychological distress.

""Many underestimate the impact of this autoimmune hair loss condition"" Adam Friedman MD professor and chair of dermatology at George Washington University Washington DC told Medscape Medical News. He was not involved with the trial.

""The burden of the disease which certainly is an emotional but also physical one definitely needs to be addressed with indicated FDA-approved drugs"" he noted which is the goal of these trials.

Any hair follicle can be attacked but they are rarely destroyed so hair can regrow. The BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 trials focused on scalp hair regrowth.

Eyebrow and eyelash growth secondary outcomes also improved between 36 and 52 weeks in both groups calculated using the proportion of participants who had achieved full regrowth or regrowth with minimal gaps. At 36 weeks about 31% to 35% of patients who received 4 mg of baricitinib regrew eyebrow and eyelash hair. By 52 weeks more than two out of five patients regrew eyebrow (44.1%) and eyelash (45.3%) hair.

""It's a fantastic achievement and a major step forward in alopecia areata especially for patients with the most severe and refractory cases"" said Arash Mostaghimi MD MPH the director of inpatient dermatology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) in Boston Massachusetts. Mostaghimi is on the advisory board for Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) which manufactures baricitinib and BWH was one of the clinical sites of the trial.

While dermatologists have been aware of how JAK inhibitors can affect hair regrowth in patients with alopecia they have been using these drugs off-label Friedman said. Therefore the drugs are expensive and more difficult to access.

These trials provide ""data that proves the efficacy and safety of [baricitinib] under the umbrella of the FDA portal"" he added which will hopefully lead to an approved indication for alopecia areata so it can be more accessible to patients.

Adverse events at 52 weeks were consistent with data from 36 weeks which found that none of these adverse events occurred in more than 10% of participants. The most common adverse events were headache acne and increases in muscle-related blood markers.

In February 2022 the US Food and Drug Administration granted priority review for baricitinib for the treatment of severe alopecia areata. Lilly expects a regulatory decision by the end of the year they said in a press release.

Lilly provided funding for the BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 trials. King has reported financial relationships with Aclaris Arena Pharmaceuticals Bristol Myers Squibb Concert Pharmaceutics Dermavant Lilly Pfizer Regeneron Sanofi Genzyme and Viela Bio. Mostaghimi has reported serving on an advisory board for Lilly. Friedman has reported no relevant financial relationships.

Bonnie Laura Sperling

Chandler – Mrs. Bonnie Laura Sperling (née Scott) passed away peacefully surrounded by her family at home in Chandler Arizona on March 19 2022 at the age of 78. The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease.

Bonnie was born on May 31 1943 in Newark New Jersey to James and Laura Scott. She was raised in Allentown Pennsylvania by her mother and stepfather Ellis Werft after her father was killed in World War II. She graduated from Allen High School in 1961 and met her future husband Michael shortly after moving to Kentucky with her best friend Doris. Bonnie and Michael moved to St. Louis Missouri and were married in 1965. They moved a few times to be near family before settling with their three children in Tempe Arizona in 1980.

Bonnie held several staff positions at Arizona State University providing services directly to students finally retiring from academic advising in the College of Fine Arts in 2002. She enjoyed traveling and spending time with her family and friends. Bonnie could be counted on to support those in need friend or stranger and was an ally for the marginalized and underrepresented. She was an avid reader and crocheted and knitted. Baby blankets were her specialty and a small stash remains for future babies and grandbabies of her friends and acquaintances.

Bonnie is survived by her husband Michael; daughters Jaime and Rianna; son David; daughter-in-law Lee Ann Bohn; and granddaughters Amelia and Sophia.

A memorial service was held March 27 2022 at Green Acres Mortuary in Scottsdale AZ.

Are you interested in adding some ASX growth shares to your portfolio? If you are you may want to look at the ones listed below.

Here's what you need to know about these growth shares:

Breville Group Ltd (ASX: BRG)

The first ASX growth share to look at is Breville. It is a leading appliance manufacturer behind a range of brands that have been resonating extremely well with consumers for many years. Together with its ongoing investment in research and development and its global expansion this has helped drive solid sales and earnings growth over the last decade. The good news is that this is that Morgans expects this to continue in the future. The broker currently has an add rating and $32.00 price target on its shares.

Hipages Group Holdings Ltd (ASX: HPG)

Another ASX growth share to look at is Hipages. It is a leading Australian-based online platform and software as a service provider connecting consumers with trusted tradies. At the last count there were over 30000 tradies using Hipages' platform. This has been bolstered further with the recent acquisition of New Zealand rival Builderscrack. This gives Hipages access to a NZ$26 billion total addressable market and 4000 active tradies. Goldman Sachs is a big fan of Hipages. It currently has a buy rating and $3.60 price target on its shares.

A final growth share to look at is ResMed. It is a sleep treatment focused medical device company which has been tipped to continue its growth long into the future. This is thanks to its world class products significant and growing market opportunity and its increasingly important digital platform. The latter has seen ResMed develop a patient-centric connected-care digital platform which is addressing the main pinch points across the healthcare value chain. Morgans is very positive on the company's future. It has an add rating and $40.46 price target on its shares.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The next development in Seth Rollins' path to WrestleMania has emerged and it's in the form of a text message from Vince McMahon.

""Someone from my office is going to be reaching out to you to set up a meeting at corporate headquarters"" the text read. ""I want you in my office at 9 a.m. on Monday.""

Following his loss to AJ Styles via DQ on last Monday's RAW Rollins grabbed the microphone and stated ""this is bullsh-t"". He then claimed that next week's RAW won't happen unless he gets what he deserves – a WrestleMania moment. The fans in attendance at the Allstate Arena chanted ""Cody"" in response as Rollins continued to kick over the barrier tear up the apron flip over the announce table and rip off the ring post covers.

With this Monday being the go-home edition to WrestleMania 38 it is believed that another piece of the puzzle will be put in place leading to Seth Rollins vs. a returning Cody Rhodes. It's been rumored for months now that ""The American Nightmare"" was returning to WWE and the news was essentially confirmed by reports from PWInsider and AEW's Chris Jericho.

Adam Pearce would chime in on the post of the text message as well encouraging Rollins to talk about the meeting when they're at the WWE Live Event tonight.

""Let's chat about this tonight in Kitchener"" Pearce wrote in response.

It's easy and will only take a moment.

Manager Neil Souter and shop assistant Carolyn Thomson by the new dementia screen in the restaurant at James Pringle Weavers in Holm Mills Shopping Village in Inverness.

A HIGHLAND clothing store has introduced a special screen aimed at helping customers with dementia.

James Pringle Weavers in Holm Mills Shopping Village has installed the hi-tech device which aims to provide a calming atmosphere.

Staff at the shop raised the money to buy the RemPod which aims to evoke memories of years gone by and it is now in place in the café.

It looks like an old fashioned railway carriage complete with a table and four chairs and has items such as tea cups and saucers and a newspaper – while the screen shows the passing countryside seen during a rail journey.

Manager Neil Souter said the idea first came to him after he spoke with a woman whose husband had dementia who worked with Alzheimer Scotland.

He said the RemPod came up during the course of the conversation – they were first featured on the TV show Dragons’ Den and the product was backed by both Peter Jones and Deborah Meaden.

“I thought it was a fantastic idea” he said. “Two members of staff have fathers with dementia.”

Mr Souter said members of staff decided to raise the money for the screen.

He said some of their customers were of an age where they were likely to suffer from the condition adding: “I thought it would be good for the store.”

Money was raised in a number of ways such as fashion show events and they also received a £500 donation from the Caring and Sharing charity.

Staff made masks which they sold to boost funds and from January 2020 they raised a total of £2700 over a period of 18 months.

Mr Souter said: “The idea is that people can come in with a family member with dementia and sit in the carriage.

“It’s a calming influence for them.”

He said he was thinking of offering bookable half-hour slots which should be enough time for them to enjoy the facility.

Prince William and Kate undertook an eight-day tour of Belize Jamaica and the Bahamas in celebration of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee; all three countries are Commonwealth nations where Her Majesty serves as monarch and head of state.

Kensington Palace said that the royal pair were ""very much looking forward to the visit"" ahead of the trip and they certainly appeared to be having plenty of fun. ""As with previous overseas visits the duke and duchess have asked that this tour allows them to meet as many local people as possible"" the statement continued. ""Over the course of their time in the Caribbean their Royal Highnesses will meet a wide variety of groups including children young people and families frontline workers service personnel leaders from government business and the charity sector as well as inspiring conservationists and the early years workforce.""

While the royal couple were met with ceremonial welcomes and celebratory events throughout their trip there were also protests from republican citizens and anti-monarchists calling for an official apology for British colonialism and slavery reparations. Prince William subsequently expressed his ""profound sorrow"" over ""abhorrent"" slavery during a speech given at a state dinner in Jamaica.

""The strength and shared sense of purpose of the Jamaican people represented in your flag and motto celebrate an invincible spirit"" he said. ""It is this same spirit that spurred on the Windrush generation who came to the United Kingdom to help rebuild after the Second World War. We are forever grateful for the immense contribution that this generation and their descendants have made to British life which continues to enrich and improve our society.""

Below we round up highlights from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Caribbean trip.

But there can be no doubt that the past 10 years have seen conversations around the British monarchy’s position on the world stage significantly shift. In November 2021 Barbados became the first country in almost 30 years to remove the Queen and replace her with a President. And discussions over apologies and reparations from Britain and other countries over slavery have intensified with 2013 seeing the creation of the CARICOM Reparations Commission to establish the “moral ethical and legal” case for reparations by governments of “all the former colonial powers.”

It was against this backdrop that Prince William and Kate jetted into the Caribbean to tour Belize Jamaica and the Bahamas for eight days. Before it even began the trip faced questions about timing given events in Ukraine. Royal aides said they were keeping a close eye and may adjust their program accordingly when asked about the decision to go ahead with the celebratory trip.

“The Duke and Duchess are very much looking forward to visiting the Caribbean region during the Platinum Jubilee year and having the opportunity to thank communities…for the support they have shown Her Majesty throughout her seventy-year reign” Kensington Palace said. Elsewhere the visit was more blatantly described as a “charm offensive” to “shore up support” for the monarchy in the region.

However before the couple even touched down there were significant holes in the ‘winning them over’ narrative. “William and Kate in Tour Storm” was the Daily Mail headline the day the couple arrived. The story followed up worldwide centered on a protest from residents over their dispute with a charity William supports and the fact the trip organizers had not got permission to land the royal helicopter on their football field. A visit to the Akte‘il Ha cacao farm in Indian Creek was hastily canceled and the royals appeared at a different chocolate farm full of smiles. But it turned out that the small protest was just a glimpse of the controversy their trip would ultimately attract.

As the Cambridges posted pictures and videos on their social media accounts of them diving in Belize’s barrier reef alongside breezy messages with plane and flag emojis a bigger debate about the visit was beginning to rage. Protestors outside the British High commission in Jamaica handed over a letter signed by a group of 100 prominent individuals from Jamaica's Advocates Network calling for an ""apology and recognition of the need for atonement and reparations."" The letter also said ""We see no reason to celebrate 70 years of the ascension of your grandmother to the British throne because her leadership and that of her predecessors have perpetuated the greatest human rights tragedy in the history of humankind.""

Protests during royal visits to the Caribbean are nothing new but this tour felt like a turning point. For the first time images of glamorous royals smiling in the sunshine while observing and sampling local life did not overshadow dissenting voices about monarchy and colonialism. There were many fantastic images and positive encounters with the couple attracting frequent crowds and praise from those they spoke to. But it was the protests not the pleasantries that took center-stage. A tour designed to increase ties ended up becoming a catalyst for a brighter spotlight on those calling to sever them.

This was never more apparent than when the royal couple met Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness and his wife Juliet on their arrival into Kingston. As the cameras were rolling at the start of the meeting the Prime Minister said clearly that the royals’ presence allowed “unresolved” issues to be “put front and center” adding that Jamaica was “moving on.”

At that time William said very little at least not while the cameras were there. But later that night he made a long speech in which he most notably directly addressed the “appalling atrocity” of slavery. “I want to express my profound sorrow” he said. “Slavery was abhorrent And it should never have happened.”

But if the Prince and those who had drafted and approved his speech had thought that these words would earn him praise they were mistaken. It was widely noted that his comments fell short of the apology requested. “This ‘tone deaf’ statement echoes the well-crafted words of his father. It does not rise to the level of the formal apology that we deserve” the same Advocates Network spearheading the protest over the visit told The Independent in a statement.

As the tour progressed it became increasingly clear that moments intended to show the royals as empathetic and in touch were sparking the totally opposite reaction. When William and Kate greeted cheering children by a football pitch who were standing behind a wire fence in Trench Town the resulting imagery created a deeply uncomfortable look for the monarchy as it instantly went viral. And when they deliberately recreated the Queen and Prince Philip’s journey on a Land Rover from decades ago the wistful nod to a bygone era struck an odd tone in a country looking to move forward not back.

By the time the couple jetted out of Jamaica the narrative that the trip was a disaster was well and truly entrenched. One Washington Post article headlined it as “cringeworthy.” A journalist for the Daily Mail declared herself to be “dying of embarrassment.” And a BBC royal correspondent traveling with the royals wrote of the “curiously disorganised” visit commenting “Times have changed. The Royal Family have in the past been pretty good at changing with them. But not on this tour.” As the couple emerged on Friday in The Bahamas to pouring rain it was hard not to wonder whether even mother nature had decided to join in.

The question of whether the Cambridges could have avoided such negative reactions if things had been done differently is an interesting one. There is no doubt that steering clear of the optics of certain images could have spared them significant criticism. But right from the beginning something did feel different about this trip. When so many focused on what was in reality a small protest in Belize it felt like there was a global recognition that these were the issues that should be amplified during a visit to Caribbean realms at this time.

Whenever Buckingham Palace is asked about other countries retaining the British monarch as head of state they give a stock answer that this is “a matter for the people of [whatever country is in question].” While some might say that a charm offensive trip can only be viewed as an attempt retain the status quo one only has to look at how the Queen responded to Barbados becoming a republic to see the grace with which the institution will let go. “On this significant occasion and your assumption of office as the first President of Barbados I extend my congratulations to you and all Barbadians” the 95-year-old Queen said in a message as her son and heir was sent to represent her as she was removed from her position.

This sentiment was reinforced by her grandson in his final speech before departing The Bahamas. “We support with pride and respect your decisions about your future. Relationships evolve. Friendship endures” the Prince said. If the tour had indeed been designed to secure the monarchy’s future in the region it had ended on an admission of defeat. But one senses that these may well be the words that William was the happiest to be able to deliver throughout the entire trip.

Prince Charles’s visit to Barbados last November saw him arrive in the country as its future head of state and leave with a completely changed status. In contrast Prince William departs The Bahamas today on the same footing on which he arrived—as a Prince of the realm and its future king. Who knows when he and Kate will be back but it appears increasingly likely that by the time he is some realms in the Caribbean will have followed Barbados’s lead to see through the process of changing their head of state. Jamaica has made their intentions very clear and following the royal visit Belize has also signaled its desire to do the same. Ten years ago the then Jamaican Prime Minister declared “time come.” The biggest thing this trip has highlighted is the fact that now it really has.",,,

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vaGFtbWVyLW11c2V1bS1hbm4tcGhpbGJpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Who's Who of L.A.'s Art World Bids Farewell to a Champion,"The actor Owen Wilson chatted with the artist Ed Ruscha.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S.F.'s Valencia Street merchants endorse replacing center bikeway with protected side-running lanes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/s-f-valencia-street-bicycle-lane-19442272.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

MyTopDog an online education platform recently collaborated with CloudSmiths to improve and optimise their e-learning system.

MyTopDog is the biggest online education platform in South Africa. Its 3.5 million students are offered a customised learning and support programme as well as the renowned CambriLearn online education platform which prepares students for Cambridge International qualifications.

The education company was “positively astounded at CloudSmiths’ ability to optimise their communication and learning system” says founder of MyTopDog and CambriLearn Ryan Swartzberg. We weren’t really looking to address particular challenges but when a friend at CloudSmiths explained what it does I was blown away by how much easier life could be.”

Previously students received assignments by e-mail; now they are able to interact via a digital platform. The learning portals for MyTopDog and CambriLearn are built on Heroku part of Salesforce which provides each group of users – students teachers and parents – with their own portal through which they can access their customer dashboard.

Learners are able to consume content attend lessons and interact with each other via the MyTopDog community. Teachers have their own set of tools according to their roles and parents can log in to track their child’s progress monitor attendance and view feedback on assignments. Assemblies and parent evenings are co-ordinated with the Salesforce native app EventSpark to ensure these events run smoothly. Swartzberg reports that the changes are “breaking down silos between teaching and sales so we can operate more like a school and less like a business”.

“Our feedback is 99% positive” says Swartzberg. “And as the platform captures more data the company is getting smarter about understanding the impact of various interventions on learning outcomes. Salesforce is helping us tie our data together from a teaching perspective to make smarter decisions.”

Jason Timm CloudSmiths’ CEO says the journey with MyTopDog is revolutionary for the education company. “Looking ahead with its new and evolving platform MyTopDog and CambriLearn can recruit the best teachers and empower them to work from anywhere. Expanding syllabuses will be a simple process. Teachers will be able to add more grades and also offer additional support to parents on issues that affect their child’s academic development.”

By offering more flexible and personal learning from anywhere Swartzberg is leading the way to promote equality and make high-quality education more accessible which is an exciting prospect when it comes to shaping the future of work in South Africa.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzI3LzMtZG93LXN0b2Nrcy10dXJuLTMwMDAwMC1pbnRvLTEtbWlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Dow Stocks That Can Turn $300000 Into $1 Million by 2030,"These well-known profitable and time-tested Dow components can make you a millionaire by the turn of the decade.

In two months the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 0.46%) will celebrate its 126th ""birthday."" Since its founding in May 1896 it's evolved from a 12-stock industrial-dominated index to one that now houses 30 highly successful and diverse multinational companies.

It's also an index full of stocks that have a rich history of making patient investors money. Over the next eight years three Dow stocks stand out as having a good chance to outperform their peers. If you invest $300000 into these Dow components now they have the tools and intangible needed to potentially make you a millionaire by 2030.

Salesforce

The Dow stock I feel most confident about increasing in value by 233% over the next eight years is cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software solutions provider Salesforce.com (CRM 0.72%). Salesforce has averaged an annual gain of nearly 27% for shareholders since March 2005. In other words it doubles on average every 2.7 years.

CRM software is used by consumer-facing businesses to enhance existing customer relationships and boost sales. Some of the more common tasks businesses utilize CRM software for include overseeing online marketing campaigns handling product and service issues and running predictive sales analyses. The latter can be particularly helpful in determining which clients would be likeliest to purchase a new product or service.

As you might have guessed CRM software is geared toward the service industry. However it's made inroads in the financial healthcare and industrial sectors in recent years. CRM software is fully expected to offer low double-digit annual global growth potential through at least mid-decade if not beyond.

Salesforce slots in as the undisputed No. 1 of global CRM spending. According to a report from IDC Salesforce accounted for almost 24% of global CRM spend in the first-half of 2021. By comparison its four-closest competitors in market share didn't even add up to 20% on a combined basis. Salesforce is the go-to CRM solutions provider and is unlikely to cede significant share anytime soon.

It's also a company that's benefited immensely from inorganic growth. CEO and founder Marc Benioff has made a number of amazing acquisitions including MuleSoft Tableau Software and Slack Technologies. These deals not only expand the company's sales channels but they allow Salesforce to reach a broader audience of small-and-medium-sized businesses with their ecosystem of solutions.

Benioff is forecasting a near-doubling in full-year sales by mid-decade ($50 billion in fiscal 2026) making Salesforce the fast-growing Dow component investors should want to own.

UnitedHealth Group

Another Dow stock that can turn a $300000 investment into $1 million by 2030 is insurance and healthcare solutions giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.39%). Over the past 25 years UnitedHealth has averaged an annual return of around 19%. If we include dividends this average annual return jumps to about 20%. This means the company has been doubling investors' money on average every 3.6 years.

UnitedHealth is probably best known for its insurance segment. Even though health insurance tends to be a relatively slow-growing operating model it's very profitable. Insurance companies are typically able to pass along higher premiums to counteract rising costs.

Aside from strong premium pricing power UnitedHealth can continue to benefit from the existence of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)(sometimes referred to as ""Obamacare""). Despite the ACA requiring insurers to accept people with pre-existing conditions it also encouraged a lot of healthier people to purchase insurance as well.

However the real growth driver for UnitedHealth Group is its healthcare services subsidiary Optum. Optum has three segments of its own which provide everything from pharmacy prescription refills to data analytics and software to healthcare organizations. Optum has consistently grown faster than the insurance segment and it generally produces higher margins too. Thanks mostly to Optum Wall Street's consensus estimate calls for UnitedHealth to grow its full-year sales from $287.6 billion in 2021 to more than $497 billion by 2026. That's incredible sales growth for a megacap company.

At its current growth trajectory I believe UnitedHealth Group has the potential to more than triple its earnings per share by 2030 to north of $60 which in turn should send its shares a lot higher.

Visa

A third and final Dow stock with the ability to turn $300000 into $1 million by 2030 is payment processor Visa (V 1.56%). Over the trailing 14 years Visa has averaged an annual total return including dividends paid of around 21%. This means it's doubled investors' money on average every 3.4 years.

The most logical reason to buy Visa is the company's cyclical ties. In short it does well when the U.S. and global economy are expanding and it struggles a bit during recessions when consumers and businesses don't spend as much. The thing is recessions typically last for a few months or a couple of quarters whereas periods of economic expansion are usually measured in years. Visa is the type of company that allows patient investors to take advantage of the natural long-term expansion of the U.S. and global economy.

But let's be clear it also doesn't hurt that Visa controls a majority of credit card market share by network purchase volume in the U.S. -- the largest market for consumption in the world. Between 2009 and 2018 no payment processor saw a bigger jump in U.S. network purchase volume share than Visa. In fact Visa's 53.1% share in 2018 was 31 percentage points higher than its next-closest competitor.

Additionally Visa has a long runway with which to expand its payment infrastructure. It can do so via acquisition as it did with Visa Europe in 2016 or it can organically push into underbanked markets such as the Middle East Africa and Southeastern Asia. With much of the world still reliant on cash for transactions Visa looks to be sitting on a multidecade opportunity.

Lastly take into consideration that Visa purely acts as a payment processor and not a lender. Although lending would allow the company to reap the rewards of interest income and fees during long periods of economic expansion it would also expose it to loan delinquencies during recessions. Not lending means not having to set aside capital to cover delinquencies. This is why Visa bounces back quicker than virtually all other financial stocks following a recession or economic contraction.",,,

The correct answer as it has been since her historic yellow diamond moment in 2019 is Tiffany & Co.

The partnership between the house founded in 1837 and the House of Gucci star has meant that we all get to see some of Tiffany’s high jewelry masterpieces—often on view only to press and private clients—on the red carpet. And recently it has also meant that the genius of Jean Schlumberger a revolutionary designer for Tiffany is on full display.

The maverick Frenchman who began at Tiffany in 1956 and who created iconic designs such as Bird on a Rock and the enamel bangles called the Jackie bangle after the First Lady who loved them has experienced a renaissance since LVMH acquired Tiffany in 2021 and Lady Gaga on the red carpet has been an important part of that. See her Schlumberger necklace at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. And note that emerald and diamond bracelet she wore at this years BAFTA’s.

Her Oscar 2022 jewelry was no exception. The House of Gucci star chose classic platinum and diamond pieces highlighting the Tiffany expertise around the stone and their deep archive.

Is revenge jewelry a thing? If so it is best served as a Tiffany diamond necklace with expertly cut square stones a flower cluster bracelet and earrings with both yellow and white diamonds. She wore the jewels to the Elton John party prompting some to wonder if there would be a Lady Gaga Oscars moment. Prayers were answered when she—in her Tiffany diamonds—presented the final award of the night. Bonus: she added new earrings post Elton John party.

NOW,ServiceNow,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vam9zaGJlcnNpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy9oci10ZWNobm9sb2d5LW1hcmtldC1kaXNydXB0ZWQtZW1wbG95ZWUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1pcy1ub3ctdGhlLWNvcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HR Technology Market Disrupted: Employee Experience Is Now The Core,"For decades companies have embraced HR technology by starting at the “core.” This “core” was always considered the payroll system HRMS (employee system of record) and foundational infrastructure often called HCM.

Companies select these Core Systems first spend millions to tens of millions of dollars to implement them and then they “lay other tools on top.” These core systems of record are considered to be architectural: they form the basic fundamental architecture for the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on employee applications systems and tools.

Well I would like to argue that this has now changed. While core HCM systems are necessary to run a company they are no longer the center of gravity they once were. The layers on top which I describe as the Employee Experience and Talent Intelligence Systems are even more important.

Bear with me as I try to explain.

If you go back to the 1970s and 1980s world of tech the biggest innovation in IT was the invention of ERP. ERP or Enterprise Resource Planning was an effort by pioneers like SAP and others to integrate financials manufacturing supply chain and other back-office systems into one end-to-end solution.

The idea of ERP which is now well understood is that companies need an integrated set of financial and operational systems to manage products suppliers vendors financials and results. These systems which are now widely sold by Oracle Workday SAP and hundreds of other vendors became the “financial and operational backbone” of our companies.

And this all worked. In those days when most businesses sold products and services in an industrial model we needed to know how many widgets were involved in each assembly how much each one cost and what supplier provided it. So every major corporation from oil companies to auto manufacturers embraced ERP.

Later software vendors tried to apply this model to HR. Pioneers like PeopleSoft realized that the ERPs were simply not handling HR and employees well so they created a market for HCM.

Initially HCM was all about payroll employee record keeping and job architecture. So we implemented these things and modeled our companies around the hierarchy. But despite the best effort of ERP vendors the HCM system wasn’t enough. Why? Because the original ERP model was not designed for people.

A bolt or assembly has a fixed cost and while it may depreciate its value doesn’t change over time. People by contrast are constantly growing and changing so we needed a system that could manage skills career paths succession plans and all sorts of mushy non-linear investments in people. A person is not like a widget and a job is not a product: we can’t just put a “cost” on them so the ERP model for HCM did not work well.

So what has happened? Vendors and buyers started to layer all sorts of value add tools on top. Learning management systems applicant tracking systems assessment systems and now skills inference and employee engagement tools. None of these really had a “home” in the ERP so they each became independent systems of record.

Where did that leave HCM the core system of record?

HCM Was Built On An Industrial Model

Well the solution stack has changed. The HCM system since it tends to treat employees and jobs as objects is built on job families (ie. Finance IT sales) hierarchical job levels and tens of thousands of job titles job descriptions and job competency models. The concept of a “project team” a “part-time worker” or even a “contingent job” did not quite fit.

And it gets even more complicated. When you move into a new country undergo new regulatory rules or acquire a company you end up with another system. So today as we proliferate these systems companies have business rules and job architectures all over their company.

Ideally we’d like to have a single “system of record” but in reality the data is in multiple places. Few companies have a good view of their contingent or gig workforce. (Workday recently acquired VNDLY to help customers address this challenge.) Most companies have lots of job descriptions and job titles that are no longer used. And almost every company has too many job levels lots of cross-domain teams and projects that aren’t in the system and unending challenges figuring out things like skills progression career mobility and other “non-linear things.” Each of these new objects sits in another system making the real “core” a network of applications.

By the way these “non-linear” assets are the most important of all. While it would be nice to know how many people we have (which itself is not always easy to find out) it’s far more valuable to know what skills we have how much expertise we own and how our people are moving progressing and performing at work. None of this “squishy stuff” was designed into ERP so we have to either buy other tools or find a system that is addressing this with their architecture.

Of course Workday SAP and Oracle are working on this: they each have skills clouds career tools journey platforms and emerging inferencing engines. Workday has more than 1100 customers using its skills cloud and acquired Peakon in 2021 as part of the company’s EX strategy. SuccessFactors HXM is built on a new people model and is now embracing a new People Model that includes mood learning styles and other personal growth characteristics. And Oracle HCM Cloud is built on skills at its core.

And this precisely is my point: the HR tech market has changed. The layers on the top (the Employee Experience and Talent Intelligence Systems) are now the core.

Now I regularly meet with Workday Oracle SAP and many HCM providers and I am in no way minimizing the importance of what they do. Their systems play a vital and essential role in business and every company needs an HCM to operate. But most of the value-add over the coming years is taking place at the top of the stack.

Some Client Examples

Let me give you some examples.

The first company I want to mention is DHL which has more than 700000 employees in hundreds of companies. They like most global companies have an enormous patchwork of back-end systems for local company payroll and benefits. But what the company needs most is a modern employee experience platform for drivers operators distribution agents and professionals. They are building this on a platform called Staffbase which is a modern EX communications platform. Other vendors in this space include ServiceNow Applaud Microsoft Viva and a new breed of “deskless worker” ex platforms like Workjam Yoobic and others.

Now that they have this EX layer defined they’re moving down the stack from the top looking at employee survey platforms journey management and other EX tools to build from the top down. None of this work impacts the core HCM system.

The second company I want to mention is a large global electrical systems manufacturer who does business in more than 30 countries. They have more than 15 different HCM systems around the world many based on Oracle. They each process local payroll local regulatory compliance and handle local staffing needs. The CHRO is looking for a better data analytics solution an integrated EX platform and a series of new applications for internal mobility skills development and career planning. Their original thought was to replace all these back-end systems with a whole new platform.

After exploring their needs in detail we all came to the conclusion that they really don’t need an ERP replacement they need a global data warehouse a global skills and mobility system and then a standard set of EX tools for employee access portals and support. While at some point they will want to upgrade the core HCM systems their real needs wouldn’t be served by that approach and they can save lots of money focusing at the top of the stack.

The third example is a big SuccessFactors customer in Asia. This company which operates in raw materials and distribution also has a mixture of on-premise and cloud systems and lots of local payroll in different countries. They also asked us whether they should consider a massive vendor change or possibly upgrade to all new features of SuccessFactors. The final decision which has been recommended by us and their systems integrator consultant is not to replace anything but rather to upgrade the SAP technologies over time and focus their new investments in EX.

And let me add one more. When we were at Deloitte we did a lot of work with Delta Airlines. They like most airlines have a massive investment in legacy systems. When Delta needed to redesign its entire customer and employee experience they didn’t replace these systems. They built one of the world’s most innovative apps connecting to legacy systems on the back end. This is the lesson for all of us: if the user is not happy it doesn’t matter how elegant the back-end system may be.

Employee Experience and Talent Intelligence Is The New Core

I don’t need to tell you how fast the EX platform market is growing. In only one year Microsoft Viva has attracted more than 1000 paying customers and vendors like ServiceNow Applaud and Workjam are growing like crazy. Every company is standardizing messaging on Teams Zoom Webex or Slack and most new employee solutions have to plug into these systems. Workday Everywhere for example is Workday’s program to deeply integrate with these tools.

One client Colgate told me their new HR Tech strategy is based on a vendors’ ability to integrate with Google Workspace which is their primary employee toolset. It doesn’t matter to them what the back-end looks like – it only matters how well it integrates into the employee’s platform.

In the Talent Intelligence area the market is similarly white-hot. Vendors like Eightfold Gloat Beamery Fuel50 Hitch and technologies like Skyhive and Techwolf are being snatched up as new core systems for skills careers and AI-powered growth. And the learning experience vendors (Degreed EdCast Viva Learning and others) are becoming essential to every company.

By the way the stock market understands this. Look at the relative price charts for the three major ERPs (Workday Oracle SAP) vs. ServiceNow (a leader in EX). These are all sophisticated technology companies each run by excellent management teams. They’re just in different markets.

One More Piece of Evidence: Our HCM Research

Let me conclude with one more piece of research. In our HCM Excellence studies which detail HCM implementations across all the major ERP providers we found one particular finding. The companies that had the most success with large HR Tech projects focused on employees first technology second. They clearly defined their employee and management needs their new talent practices and cultural goals and the data they wanted to capture. Then they sat down and built the stack from the bottom up or top-down.

We also found that these companies looked at new HR Tech as part of a business transformation not as an IT or technology project. They focused on their new business models their new operating models and their new HR and talent practices first then looked at the technology as an enabler of these goals.

What Does This Mean To HR and IT?

The bottom line is simply this: the center of gravity has shifted.

HCM and ERP systems remain essential to running your company but the new center of gravity has shifted. My research shows that HCM/ERP systems tend to last 8-12 years and then often the vendor’s architecture or business has been disrupted. If your problem is a lack of consistent data or poor career experience for employees in most cases you’re better off fixing the implementation you have and focusing your dollars on the upper layers.

We have launched a series of HCM Excellence studies with case studies on Workday Oracle and SAP implementations. Talk with us about our membership and we’ll be happy to share more.

Long-term returns are determined by a few key traits and investors should focus on them. Stocks with unique potential usually have exceptional growth catalysts and wide economic moats. These three stocks all have clear avenues for rapid growth along with sustainable competitive advantages creating serious long-term upside.

1. Veeva Systems

Veeva Systems (VEEV -0.15%) is the cloud software leader for the life sciences industry. Its list of more than 1200 customers includes pharmaceutical companies biotechs research organizations and device manufacturers. They range from early-stage drug candidates to the largest enterprises in the world -- almost all of the 20 biggest pharmaceutical companies are Veeva customers.

Veeva's suite of products is vital to various stages of the lifecycle of business in its target industries. Customers rely on the software during development and clinical trials for data collection management reporting analysis and regulatory compliance. Veeva is also an important vendor for sales and marketing functions with customer relationship management software and data analytics tools.

The company has a wide economic moat which is key to its long-term investment narrative. Its dominance of the life sciences niche helps protect it from competition from more generalized players such as Salesforce.com or any smaller disruptors with the same industry focus. Veeva has clear evidence that its customers are finding value in its services and expanding their relationship with the company. Its retention rate on subscription revenue is 119% and the average number of products per customer rose from 1.71 to 2.71 over the past five years.

On top of that Veeva has every chance to outpace the market in growth. Its revenue expanded 26% in the most recent fiscal year. The life sciences industry is outpacing global economic growth which should translate to more opportunities for Veeva. The company can build on that by layering in new products for existing customers. There's also the long-term prospect of expanding to adjacent markets though that would come with its own set of new challenges and expenses.

It's not a cheap stock with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio around 50 but that's not expensive enough to stop growth investors who are in it for the long haul.

2. ServiceNow

ServiceNow (NOW 1.38%) offers cloud-based software that automates workflows and other business processes. Its customers can unlock productivity from employees and achieve better efficiency across their entire organizations. That's an obvious value proposition and ServiceNow has an especially strong presence in the IT operations realm -- that's a great space to occupy as the digital transformation trend continues to dominate the business world.

The company has nearly 1400 customers with annual contracts surpassing $1 million -- that's a great sign for long-term stability. The company boasts a net retention rate around 125% proving its ability to keep its customers and build on those relationships with additional services such as HR customer service and other administrative functions. High switching costs and deep relationships are important elements of an economic moat and they're a shield against competition.

ServiceNow has publicly disclosed its goal to surpass $15 billion in annual revenue by 2026 which requires 20% annual compound growth. It certainly seems possible for the company which smashed its own guidance by growing 29% in the most recent quarter. It also reported nearly 30% growth in ""current remaining performance obligations"" which is a strong indicator of short-term sales growth.

The stock is expensive with a forward P/E ratio of 76 and a price-to-sales ratio near 20.

It's no surprise investors have to pay a premium for that upside potential but make sure you're prepared for the risks and volatility inherent in stocks with premium valuations.

3. Home Depot

Home Depot (HD -0.16%) leads the home improvement retail market. The long-term upside proposition here is a bit different from the growth stocks above.

Home building has strong long-term catalysts in the U.S. Since the collapse of the housing market nearly 15 years ago there have been over five million more households created than new homes built.

This problem has been further complicated by mass relocations and urban flight throughout the pandemic. It's an especially acute problem for lower-income people and families who are being priced out of their hometowns.

Rising interest rates input price inflation and overall economic uncertainty are creating some negativity around home-builder stocks right now but these are all temporary issues. That's nothing new for this cyclical industry. Ultimately the massive housing deficit should be a long-term catalyst for both home builders and their suppliers for at least a decade. Home Depot benefits in general from construction and people moving -- that impact should be even greater after the company reacquired contractor supply business HD Supply in Nov. 2020.

This is a chance for value investors to zig where others zag. Home Depot could have a rough few quarters coming up and the stock is taking a beating. However the company won't be going out of business. You can enjoy a 2.4% dividend yield while you wait for long-term cash flows to push Home Depot's market cap higher.",,,,,,,,,

LOUISVILLE Ky. — Imagine walking through aisle after aisle of display booths and seeing multiple signs that say in so many words “We want you bad.” But it’s not the same “We want you” with Uncle Sam’s finger pointing straight ahead.

That was the scene at the Mid-America Trucking Show here the first one since 2019 where all the endless online and radio advertisements from trucking companies looking for drivers come to life. There may be 100000 carriers in the U.S. so they clearly aren’t all here recruiting drivers. But it sure seems that way.

In interviews with recruiters on the floor of MATS the growing softness in the trucking market and the signs that rates are headed down show no sign of trickling down to the recruiting wars. One by one recruiters staffing their company’s booths all told FreightWaves the same thing: the market is as tight as ever.

“Everybody is busy and everybody is making money” Corey Huey a recruiter at Bruce Oakley Inc. said.

FreightWaves discussed the recruitment market with a cross-section of companies. Oakley for example is a specialized hauler of dry bulk products such as grains or scrap metal. Huey said that possibly because of the unique nature of what the company transports “we haven’t seen much of a change yet. It is a tough market out there.”

And Oakley’s model is different in that it only brings on owner-operators with their own trucks. But the model can bring on a new owner-operator as well; Huey and his colleagues Harrison Herrell and Kent Childers discussed a driver for Oakley who came on as an owner-operator by buying a used truck and then did well enough to move into a new truck. They noted however that the time between the new truck being ordered and it arriving – fairly recently – was a year.

(Huey also noted that Oakley had two owner-operators in California where the AB5 law on independent contractors has been blocked from implementation in trucking but still looms as something that could eventually have a vast impact on ICs in the state. One of the two drivers was “de-leased” by Oakley trying to get in front of any AB5-related issues; a second moved out of state.)





The estimate on what some of the Oakley drivers are making was significantly higher than an important annual number released at MATS: the ATBS estimate of what the average owner-operator made in 2021.

ATBS is a financial services and accounting firm that services tens of thousands of independent owner-operators. As a result it handles a lot of tax returns. With most of those returns now completed ATBS executives said in a presentation that the average owner-operator last year made $72000.

ATBS CEO Todd Amen had already signaled last year that the average for 2021 was likely to be in excess of $70000. For the first six months of the year Amen said the average was $70310 a gain of $6530 for the 12 months.

But given the unique nature of what it is hauling the Oakley recruiters said many of their drivers are making $250000 to $300000 per year with one husband/wife team making more than $400000.

Michael Martin is the driver recruiting specialist for paint manufacturer Sherwin Willliams (NYSE: SHW) and while Oakley may be looking for owner-operators to lease on to the company Martin is looking to hire company drivers.

Michael Martin driver recruiting specialist at Sherwin Williams at the company’s booth at the Mid-America Trucking Show.

He said he’s got about 950 drivers now. And while Sherwin Williams does use owner-operators to move its product to market Martin said Sherwin Williams is looking for 200 more company drivers.

Martin provided that number when asked if the paint manufacturer was looking to expand its use of owner-operators. “We’re going in the opposite direction” he said citing cost control and what his company sees as better service from company drivers as the reason for the push to bring in more employees.

The average company driver is making around $98000 to $100000 Martin said. That may be less than the specialty drivers at places like Oakley but Martin noted that they have full benefits. Base rates at the company are between 66 to 72 cents per mile Martin said depending on the region.





And how hard is it to get those drivers? “It’s as competitive as ever” Martin said. “COVID did a doozy on us and we’re having to adjust.”

Sherwin Williams’ most recent pay increase was at the end of 2021 “and we are constantly reevaluating.”

Stop by a company’s booth and you’re likely to find a difference in pay approaches every time. As Oakley’s Huey said you need to make apples to apples comparisons. But it can be tough since everybody has a different structure in part because they are not all in the same business.

Reefer carrier WEL Companies runs half owner-operators and half employees. When FreightWaves stopped by its booth the employee recruiter had stepped away so the pitch was all about being an owner-operator.

Its pay package is a percentage: 70% of the load according to Dylan Keester director of contractor services.

He said the average gross to the contractor is $218000 — touted on its banners at the booth — which comes from the payment being 70% of the gross.

Greg Mumme (lEFT) and Dylan Keester at the WEL Companies booth at MATS.

Keester said he’s been in the recruiting business for 12 years and “I’ve never seen it as tight as this. There is no easing at all.”

Each of the companies visited on the floor was asked a version of the same question: with more than 100000 new authorities issued by FMCSA last year has that provided a visible new supply of drivers? There wasn’t a single affirmative answer.

Averitt Express its booth drowned in the red color of the company that is known mostly as an LTL carrier was recruiting for all its operations but with a focus on its regional truckload activities according to Ken Chrisman recruiting leader at the conference.

And sitting on its booth’s front table was a highly detailed sheet spelling out its current pay packages.

Starting pay for dry van no hazmat: 52 cents per mile. Starting out and driving flatbed: 57 cents per mile. A $69 per diem. $20 per hour detention paid after two hours. Annual profit sharing of $2391 to $2621. And those were just a few.

Chrisman touted some of the company’s dedicated customers like Cracker Barrel and the Alabama plant of Mercedes Benz as being a strong attraction to potential drivers. And he said Averitt believes its retention rate is high.

Maybe it is. But as the action on the floor of MATS showed any signs of slowdown in the freight market is not being met by a relaxation of efforts to put more drivers behind the wheel.

Troy Driver 41 of Fallon Nev. stands accused of kidnapping with regards to the March 12 2022 disappearance of 18-year-old Naomi Irion according to the Lyon County Sheriff’s Office. She was last seen alive in surveillance footage from a Walmart parking lot in Fernley Nev. just after 5:00 a.m. on the day in question. In the video according to law enforcement Irion can be seen sitting in the driver’s seat of her parked car. The missing woman is believed to have been waiting for a shuttle to take her to work at a nearby Panasonic factory where she was employed in the battery manufacturing department.

In the surveillance footage the victim’s car can be seen parked for awhile. A man wearing a grey hoodie jeans and a mask can be seen circling the parking lot before getting inside. The car then drives off with both the missing woman and her alleged kidnapper inside.

“[S]he was abducted by a nondescript male who entered the driver’s seat of her vehicle” the FBI wrote on a wanted poster about her case. “Three days later Naomi’s vehicle was located next to the Sherman Williams Western Emulsion Plant. Naomi has not been located.”

The name of the latter facility appears to be a misspelled reference to the Sherwin-Williams Western Emulsion Plant in Fernley Nev.

In the Walmart footage the man can be seen walking up to the parking lot from the direction of a dirt lot according to comments made by Irion’s brother during a recent press conference. The suspect circles her car several times before finally forcing his way in Casey Valley said.

“We are out of time” her brother said during the press conference as family members pleaded for the public’s help last week. “And it is so critical right now. Just anything that you know. Or heard. Or thought of. It needs to be reported.”

Driver was arrested on Friday March 25 2022 according to the LCSO. The suspect’s truck was also recovered by sheriff’s deputies “and it has been impounded and taken into evidence” a press release says.

In an earlier press release the LCSO said the suspect’s pickup truck “was possibly involved” in the abduction but did not elaborate.

According to Reno ABC affiliate KOLO the LCSO previously identified a “witness vehicle” and occupants thereof who were also seen on the surveillance footage. That vehicle is a four-door sedan that appears to enter the parking lot just minutes before Irion’s car leaves. In the footage the sedan appears to be parked for awhile with its headlights on. At one point the suspect walks directly in front of it.

Until Friday the sheriff’s office had described Irion’s missing status as “suspicious in nature.” The Associated Press learned Friday night that the department was now investigating the incident as a kidnapping.

“The FBI has changed their flyers to refer to it as a kidnapping” Melissa Thomson the LCSO’s dispatch shift supervisor told the wire service.

Additional details about the investigation are scarce and the most recent press release which links Driver to the investigation is a terse five sentences long.

According to the LCSO several law enforcement agencies were “actively searching for Naomi” as of Friday afternoon.

“This is life or death for my sister life or death” Irion’s sister Tamara Cartwright said during the aforementioned press conference. “You need no one’s approval before calling law enforcement. This is life or death for a beautiful and fun and amazing sister daughter and friend.”

Vermilion draws customers with fragrances decorations,"Visiting Swan Creek Candle Co. is like entering another world full of alluring fragrances and beautiful decorations.

The staple business is located at 681 Main St. in the downtown district of Vermilion.

The candle shop brings joy to not only local people but tourists alike according to owners Nick and Cheli Polito.

While the candle shop represents Swan Creek Candle Co. it is an independently owned shop the Politos said.

Prior to 2017 the Swan Creek Candle Outlet store in Vermilion was owned and operated by Swan Creek Candle Co. Nick Polito said.

Swan Creek Candle Co. is a division of Ambrosia Inc. an Ohio corporation that has been selling wholesale to the gift industry since 1978.

After more than a decade as a cornerstone business of the downtown district the company made the difficult decision to close its Vermilion location in 2016 he said.

As it turns out the company’s decision not only presented a unique opportunity for Swan Creek Candle Co. but also to the Politos as they transformed the store into the first and only of its kind Polito said.

The Politos became licensed to sell the company’s products under their own name.

As of January 2017 Swan Creek Candle Vermilion became locally owned and independently operated as the first Swan Creek Creek Candle-licensed store in the country a unique step for both the Politos and the company.

“It means that we are Swan Creek Candle in storefront but as a business we are an independent wholesale customer of Swan Creek Candle Co. and we proudly carry only Swan Creek Candle brand candles and wax products” Polito said.

The candles are made in Ohio from pure soy wax to create a “clean burning lead-free paraffin-free” product that produces a greater amount of fragrance he said.

Currently when a customer walks in the front door they are greeted by a wide array of spring and Easter decorations and merchandise.

Cheli Polito is the mastermind behind the tasteful intriguing one-of-a-kind colorful displays.

“I will toot my wife’s horn” Nick Polito said. “She is so meticulous. She spends hours and hours curating a collection in the store.”

“It’s just something that’s always been a passion of mine” Cheli Polito said.

She recalled she started as a youngster decorating her mother’s home at the age of 15.

“I figured I’d go into interior design but I ended up studying classical theatre in London” Cheli Polito said.

Regardless Cheli Polito’s talent is evident in each of the unique displays in the store.

“We are a team and we each have a role to play” she said.

Nick Polito takes care of the candle ordering and other administrative duties while Cheli Polito handles the decor and design of the store.

“Vermilion loves this brand” Nick Polito said.

With 75 fragrances to choose from customers often comment on how enjoyable their shopping experience is they said.

“People say to us all the time ‘This is my happy place’ or ‘I love coming in here'” Nick Polito said. “We are a real destination for gifts.”

In addition to the in-store goods the Politos offer curbside pick-up.

Mizuho the third-largest bank in Japan wants to get 1000 families on board with its wealth unit by this time next year.

Currently there are 600.

The growth is likely to come from loans for startup companies whose equity holdings have seen boosts in value following initial public offerings but whose cash income is still just modest.

Masayuki Sakai general manager of the bank’s wealth management strategic project team said in a recent interview that there are many people who don’t own their homes and many need cash for business expansion and investing in other ventures.

“We would like to respond to their funding needs in a timely manner” he said according to the report.

He added that around 90% of profit in wealth management comes from business owners and its main clients are families with over 3 billion yen or $25 million in assets.

This push into wealth management Bloomberg writes shows that there’s more competition as of late in the market. Mitsubishi and Sumitomo Mitsui have also positioned their businesses strategically lately with ultra-low interest rates cutting into profits from traditional lending.

Mizuho also recently led a group investment of around $200 million in Vietnam’s M_Service which operates the MoMo app.

Simon 50 who wears the red-skivvy in the much-loved Wiggles has told the Daily Telegraph that their seamless live act is like a heavy work-out and keeping fit is a way to deal with the pressures of performance.

It's how he says 'I take care of my my mind...exercise has always helped with my anxiety or stress' he said.

He said that the group who currently have their first number one album on the ARIA charts have taken a punishing workload of weeks long touring performing up to four shows a day.

Key to keeping up the pace on live numbers like Hot Potato or Fruit Salad says Simon is good self-care.

'I always think that the food is about 80 per cent of my body's help and well being and exercise is 20 per cent' he said.

If he's not eating healthy Simon says he ends up feeling sluggish and that creates a knock-on effect.

'It makes it harder to get up get moving and to exercise.'

What Is Snapchat's Snap Map?

Snapchat Snap Map is an interactive map you can use to share your location with friends. You can also see friends when they share their location with you. If your friends have integrated their Bitmoji account with Snapchat their Bitmoji characters appear on the map at their location.

What Is Snapchat Live Location?

While you can see friends' locations on the Snap Map their location only updates when their Snapchat map is open and you only have a general idea of where they are. But if you want to allow a friend or family member to track your specific location use Snapchat's Live Location feature.

With Live Location navigate to a friend's profile and give them real-time tracking access to your location for 15 minutes an hour or eight hours. You and the friend can monitor your location status in a chat window.

Live Location is meant to be a ""buddy system"" to give you and your loved ones peace of mind when you're on the road heading out on a date or if you're meeting up and they need to know precisely where you are. For privacy reasons you can pause the location tracking at any point and the other person won't be notified.

Lorraine Kelly has shared a sweet black and white snap with her mum for Mother's Day.

The 61-year-old ITV presenter posted the lovely photo on social media showing herself as a youngster with her mum on the 'Costa Clyde'.

Anne 80 still lives in East Kilbride where Lorraine grew up and has been a huge inspiration to her daughter throughout her career.

Lorraine shared the sweet snap with the caption: ""Love this pic of mum all glam on the Costa Clyde. Happy Mothers Day""

(Image: Instagram)

Last year Lorraine gave a touching tribute to her mum in the Sunday Post admitting that Anne watches her show every day.

“Mum is so proud of me” Lorraine said.

“But like all mums she tells the truth. She watches the show every day with her cup of tea and we always catch up on the phone after.

“She’ll often say ‘why didn’t you ask this question?’ or ‘I liked that dress’ or ‘I didn’t like your outfit today! She isn’t scared to say what she thinks. But I welcome that. I value her opinion.

“My mum is amazing” Lorraine continues.

“I just can’t imagine life without her.”

Fans absolutely loved the ITV host's Instagram post for her mum with many taking to the comments to say so.

One wrote: ""Nowhere beats Costa Clyde  happy Mother’s Day to you Lorraine & your beautiful mum""

Another said: ""Spit of you now Lorraine. Our mums always looked glam in the old photos.""

""That photo is so cute. Your mum looks very glam."" commented another.

A fourth penned: ""Wow what a beautiful photo your mam so glam loved that style. Your very like your mother. Happy mothers day.""

A fifth said: ""Happy Mother’s Day on the beautiful Costa Clyde!!!!!.""

The Irish actor took to his Instagram Stories on Saturday night to share a photo of him and Alyson hugging as she held a confetti cannon which reveals the gender of a baby.

A sign behind the couple reads: “He or She what will the baby be…”

In the snap the couple are surrounded by pink blue and gold balloons and blue confetti is seen flying in the air.

Barry captioned the photo: “I don’t know why others have there opinions. WE ARE HAPPY HERE.”

Goss.ie has contacted Barry Keoghan for comment.

Barry was first linked to Alyson in February 2021 and the couple went Instagram official in September.

The couple recently sparked engagement rumours after they jetted off on a sun holiday together last month.

Barry’s relationship with Alyson came after his split from his longtime girlfriend Shona Guerin.

The former couple met on a night out in Shona’s hometown of Killarney back in 2017 and in recent years they were living together in Los Angeles.

But in summer 2020 fans noticed Barry and Shona had unfollowed each other on social media sparking speculation they had split.

The pair never publicly addressed their break up."

Tom Cody / Project^

In the fall of 2020 just after the Almeda Fire had devastated the Rogue Valley Tom Cody traveled through the burn zone. Driving along Highway 99 he witnessed block after block of destruction — homes businesses apartments and RV parks reduced to ash and rubble. Cody founder and managing partner at Project^ a Portland-based real estate development firm felt compelled to help rebuild.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

If all goes according to plan his new apartment development will break ground in Medford this summer. But MOSAIC is no ordinary construction project; instead the 148 units will be built in a modular factory then trucked to the site. The project is being funded in part by a state initiative aimed at helping communities recover from the Labor Day fires of 2020. It’s also an experiment aimed at tackling multiple issues at once: rising material costs a severe shortage of construction labor and an urgent need for housing for working families and fire victims.

The devastating fires that torched off in September 2020 destroyed over 4000 homes in at least nine Oregon counties. Between the Almeda and South Obenchain fires Jackson County suffered the worst impacts. More than 2300 dwellings were lost many of them manufactured homes and RVs.

“The fires burned through where our most vulnerable populations live: retirees older people Latinx and working people” says Rep. Pam Marsh D-Ashland who represents southern Jackson County. “Where we are now is an example of climate injustice.”

The fires exacerbated what was already a dearth of affordable and workforce housing in the Rogue Valley.

Housing for the ‘missing middle’

Through the governor’s office Cody learned about the state’s push to find innovative ways to deliver new projects quickly including modular prefabrication. He was already developing a modular apartment project for Bend — a first for his company — so he decided to apply the same concept to a new wildfire relief project in the Rogue Valley.

“My attitude is it’s always easier to talk about something if you have a case study” says Cody.

He started looking for land for the development initially focusing on those in the burn zone. Soon Cody learned about an undeveloped 7.5-acre property owned by Ivanko Gardens Apartments. Last spring Project^ purchased the property a long narrow parcel tucked between a residential neighborhood and an apartment complex in northeast Medford.

In June of 2021 the Oregon Legislature approved a $600 million dollar package which included $150 million for wildfire recovery housing supply and land acquisition. As part of that funding then-Rep. Brian Clem D-Salem chair of the House Special Committee on Wildfire Recovery championed an initiative called Oregonians Rebuilding Oregon.

“The original idea was to provide temporary shelters for fire victims that could be repurposed possibly for those experiencing homelessness” says Clem. The initiative would also create economic activity in the state by requiring the units to be built by Oregon companies and labor and possibly use lumber salvaged from burned roadways.

Marsh who also served on the House committee thought the MOSAIC project was a “perfect fit.”

“It’s really hard to develop workforce housing in the Rogue Valley” says Marsh. Subsidies and incentives are not available for projects in the “missing middle” between affordable and market-rate housing. From a developer’s standpoint it’s hard to make them pencil out.

Project^ negotiated with Oregon Housing and Community Services on the terms of a $10 million loan which was offered at 0% for the first 24 months and 1% thereafter. In exchange 100% of MOSAIC’s apartments must be marketed as workforce housing. The units will be available to those who earn at or below 120% of area median income and rates will be set so households don’t pay more than 30% of their income on rent.

“We wouldn’t be doing MOSAIC in Medford were it not for OHCS” Cody says.

Another stipulation is that the units must be built in Oregon. Cody is negotiating with a company in Klamath Falls called InteliFab to produce the structures. If all goes according to plan says Cody MOSAIC will cost 30% less and will be built 40% faster than a conventional multifamily project.

Prefab solution?

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

Prefabricated modular construction or “prefab” can save both time and materials says John Mick owner of InteliFab. The modules can be framed while the sites are being excavated and concrete foundations poured and work can carry on without weather delays. Extensive preplanning can also help managers catch errors before construction begins.

MOSAIC will consist of nine three-story buildings and will include one two and three-bedroom floorplans. Amenities such as kids’ play areas will be tailored for working families. The project will be built to Earth Advantage Platinum a green building standard that addresses five “pillars” of sustainability: energy health land materials and water.

Modules are built using conventional light-wood construction methods and while machines supplement human labor the process in not so different from site-built construction says Mick. “The biggest difference an employee sees is that they are less impacted by weather and their job is always in the same place.”

Modular methods also reduce the carbon footprint of construction says Cody in part because building material deliveries to the site are drastically reduced.

Going modular can also potentially speed up the permitting process. While projects must seek land use approvals and permits for site improvements from the local jurisdiction most of the building permitting happens in the factory at the state level. Oregon also offers a “master permit” for prefabricated construction.

“If you get permitted for a particular building you can use it on multiple sites” explains Cody. Project^ intends to use module plans approved for the Bend project in Medford. Modular construction also offers flexibility says Cody. Once cranes swing the factory-built modules into place on site siding and roofing will be installed selected to best fit the character of the neighborhood.

The need to innovate

There is great demand for housing across the state especially affordable and workforce housing says Greg Wolf executive director at Oregon iSector a nonprofit that supports public-private partnerships that are addressing various community challenges.

“We really have a serious problem here in Oregon” says Wolf. “We’re tied for last in having [the] worst housing deficit in the country.”

According to Wolf Oregon underbuilt 150000 homes between 2000 and 2015 and the state must build at least 29000 units a year just to keep up with demand. A severe labor shortage gaps in the supply chain and growing homeless population are worsening the crisis.

In some regions the housing shortage is directly impacting economies says Wolf. On the coast for example while vacation rentals proliferate people in service industries like teaching and firefighting can’t afford to work and live in their communities.

To tackle these issues the Oregon iSector’s board of directors is spearheading an effort called the Housing Innovation Partnership which launched late last year. Composed of representatives from public private and civic organizations from across the state its main objective is to identify innovative approaches that help build housing more quickly and affordably. Marsh and Megan Loeb senior program officer at the Oregon Community Foundation are co-convening the effort.

Working groups have formed to tackle different issues—financing models and modular housing for example. Cody is part of a group studying incentives that could help make workforce housing projects viable. Ultimately the partnership will develop an “innovation agenda” they can present to the Oregon Legislature in 2023.

Several promising ideas are already cropping up. The Port of Portland for example is exploring the possibility of building a modular housing manufacturing facility that utilizes cross-laminated timber panels. These strong but lightweight panels are composed of layers of solid wood that are glued together. They can be made from small-diameter trees including those thinned to improve the health of Oregon forests.

In Eastern Oregon the towns of Lakeview Burns and John Day are partnering in a new intergovernmental agency aimed at spurring new housing in part by utilizing 3D-printing technology to build foundations and walls. A lack of quality housing stifles economic development in these towns but they lack the labor to build enough new housing quickly. By teaming up they hope to garner enough resources to build 100 houses in each community over the next five years.

A test case in Medford

Back in Medford MOSAIC will be a test case to see if alternative construction methods can get units on the ground more quickly. Cody hopes the project can break ground this summer but it will depend on scaling up a manufacturer like InteliFab to build the boxes.

“There’s currently no modular builder or factory in Oregon that is capable of building the modules yet we have this state requirement [to build them in Oregon]” says Cody. “That is our biggest challenge right now.”

InteliFab is in the process of shifting its operations from panelized construction to modular prefabrication. To that end the company has enrolled four current and two new employees in a 12-week basic construction skills course at Klamath Community College (KCC). WorkSource Oregon will reimburse InteliFab for half of the cost of tuition. Employees will see a wage increase once they complete the course.

“We have to start doing something different on the housing front” says Marsh who wrote a letter urging the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission to provide grant funding for KCC’s training program. “If we keep just swinging hammers we’ll never get ahead.”

At the north end of the walk sits a small brick storefront with a yellow wooden board that reads “OPEN Makanda Trading Company.” On the sign an arrow beckons to the door.

Up the concrete steps and past the large flower beds that line the walkway the door has a golden Masonic Square and Compass and a copper pyramid with the All-Seeing-Eye of the Freemasons laid in gold.

Upbeat cultural music and the smells of homemade soaps incense and earthen metals fill the air when one walks through the door. Shelves tables and cabinets are placed throughout the store. Each jam packed full of unique rocks handcrafted wood and metal works and crystals of all kinds. Customers mill about the store picking up various items to inspect and show to their fellow shoppers.

Behind the counter a bearded man opens a rectangle box that houses a ceramic pig with the different cuts of pork painted on its body. The man’s blonde-white hair is pulled back in a bun and his fingers deftly open the box with the skill of an experienced business owner. He softly bobs his head to the music as he works.

This man is Brian Beverly the sole proprietor of Makanda Trading Company. He has owned and run the store for 21 years since he graduated from Southern Illinois University Carbondale.

“Three days prior to graduating a neighbor asked if he could see the amber I had brought back from Mexico” Beverly says.

As the neighbor went to leave Beverly showed him the silver and ceramics he had brought back from his travels as well and the man asked if he wanted to open a shop on the Makanda Boardwalk.

“And I was like ‘Ok’ I mean I had a degree in anthropology where was I going to work? Walmart?” Beverly jokes.

When Brian was 5 years old his uncle took him to arrowhead hunting for the first time. Beverly fell in love with the hobby and the history behind it. This love developed into a love for rock collecting and a passion for collecting anything he found fascinating from his travels.

“I first went abroad when I was 14” Beverly says. Since then he has been to over 50 countries buying and collecting items to bring back to the Makanda Trading Company.

The process of acquiring these goods is similar but each country offers unique challenges to getting these goods and getting them back to the United States to be sold to excited customers. Beverly peruses markets usually held on Wednesdays or Saturdays to buy goods from street artists and artisans. Other times and in other countries he attends festivals. Sometimes they are held for seasons sometimes for holidays and sometimes just to have a festival but all these events have one significant aspect in common: goods can be bought.

“I’ve sat on the back of a scooter and taken way out to remote villages to buy stuff” Beverly says. “You just never know where it’s going to be at.”

On weekends two twins work at the shop. Quinn and Aidan Tunison both 19-year-old men stand over 6-feet-3-inches tall with long wavy hair and a vested interest in the shop and its goods.

“We basically grew up on the Boardwalk” Quinn Tunison says as he carefully straightens a group of golden handcrafted ceremonial knives in a display case.

Quinn Tunison has worked for Beverly at Makanda Trading Company for two years. His brother Aidan Tunison started around eight months ago. As children they spent a lot of time on the Boardwalk and in its many unique shops. Their mother who also has a passion for collecting rocks and other goods Beverly sells sparked the interest in her boys for collecting as well. Through this constant exposure and interest in the store and its owner the twins secured their positions at the Makanda Trading Company.

“Brian has been to about 55 countries to gather all the items here in the shop” Aidan Tunison says sweeping his right hand over the display cases and shelves. He pushes a lock of hair behind his ears. “And he’s been here on the Boardwalk for over 20 years.”

Both twins love their job and respect their employer’s work to bring such a unique store to this community.

“It is a very coveted job” Quinn Tunison says with a smile. His brother nods in agreement. “It is a very unique place and Brian definitely brings an aspect to this community that no one else can.”

But bringing these cultural experiences back to the store to sell is not always easy. Beverly has had things “disappear” through customs agencies and other times had goods flat out stolen from him. He even has had run-ins with the police.

“In Laos it is illegal to package ship and sell Buddha (statues) for decorations” Beverly says shaking his head in slight frustration recalling the experience. “Which is strange because they’ll sell them to tourists who do the same thing and that is fine. But you can go to prison for it!”

On this particular trip to Laos the Laotian police approached him and informed him of this law. When they stepped away Beverly made his “escape.”

“So I walked- no actually I moved very quickly- down to a boat and went to Vietnam” he says.

Vietnam had no such laws prohibiting Buddha from being packaged and sold and pretty soon Beverly was back in the United States with authentic Buddha statues to sell to his customers.

“I don’t want to say smuggling but I guess it was smuggling” Beverly said with a shrug.

Beverly has had people from all over in the shop.

“I’ve had Japanese tourists German tourists and a huge Polish family- I’m talking like 100 family members- come through here before” Beverly says taking a handful of assorted nuts from a small bowl on the counter.

The door opens and he says hello to a mother and daughter who enter the shop. He asks them where they are from as he always does when customers enter.

“I’m live here but my mother is from the Chicago suburbs” the daughter says.

“Which one?” Beverly asks. The mother answers and Beverly informs her that he is from Joliet Illinois. They have a brief chat about Joliet as well as the local area and some of its history.

Beverly studied anthropology at SIU and he earned a scholarship to travel to Mexico City while in school and can speak Spanish. He has picked up on other languages in his travels but just enough to be able to trade with vendors in the countries he finds himself in.

“I usually stay for 1-3 months in these countries and pick up enough of the language to ask for wholesale reductions stuff like that” Beverly says with a nod. “But once I come back it all goes away until I travel again.”

Today’s goods in his store are varied from expertly carved water buffalo bone and statues of Ganesh to exotic tapestries and tie-dye shirts. But the store initially started with items that Beverly himself found particularly interesting. He has a passion for rocks and crystals because of their uniqueness and natural beauty which he finds amazing. To him the rocks are like baseball cards each is unique and others are extremely rare.

“Some are super rare- like a Mikey Mantel or something- and some are more desirable like your Jordan cards.” Beverly says. Pointing to a basket on the counter he continues “For here the Jordan cards would be like local fluorite there was mines here until the 90s and people just love it.”

The rocks in the bowl are varied in size and shape. The fluorite is no longer mined locally and has become rare all over. If one can find blue fluorite which is extremely rare they could sell it for a very pretty penny.

“These pieces can sell for 3-4 thousand dollars” Brian says. “And of course I cannot get any of it” he chuckles.

Beverly has a deep passion for all things culture. He loves languages beliefs religions foods dances customs and music. Every year a music streaming platform called Spotify complies data on each user to curate specific playlists for their listeners as well as provide them with an overview with specific percentages of each listener’s year in music. Last year he was in the top 1% of listeners who listen to the most varied types of music on Spotify.

A short stocky man with heavy metal earrings and piercings all over his face enters the shop. He is a regular and the man explains to Beverly that he is moving into a Pagan temple in Metropolis Illinois. At this statement Beverly asks if he would be able to come to visit sometime to see how the temple operates and study their customs. Brian grabs a notebook and jots down the information as the man explains how he can do this. After the man leaves Beverly sits down in a computer chair behind the counter.

“When I hear something like that I just have to learn about it” he says with a smile. “These kinds of things are just so cool and I don’t want to just read about it I want to experience it.”

The original purpose of the Makanda Trading Company was not simply for Beverly to pursue his passion for culture but to bring the world and its culture to Makanda and the surrounding communities. He wants people who enter his shop to leave with an authentic item that they otherwise only could have gotten if they had made the trip to its place of origin themselves.

Beverly has received some criticism for selling the goods he found on his travels. But he said he has no ill-intentions behind his shop or the things he sells.

“Sometimes now people are limiting things” he says. “Like ‘You can’t appropriate culture.’ I’m not even sure I know what that means. It’s good to be conscience of what you’re doing but I’m trying to spread different cultures and ideas and make people be worldly and more so than just in their heads.”

The shop can provide precisely the type of items to pique one’s interest in learning about the world and the people who live in it. The Makanda Trading Company is absolutely a gem much like the ones sold in the shop for people to discover and start a flame inside to learn about the world uniquely.

“Like Quinn said he brings an element of the world to the area that no one else can” Aidan Tunsion says.

This tiny cultural portal to the world is open seven days a week from 10-5. One will walk through the Masonic Emblemed door into a treasure trove of wonders and stories that people can only experience in the countries they came from or right here in the small village of Makanda Illinois.

Five tech companies in Guangzhou - including GrowthEase a business technology services provider under video gaming giant NetEase and browser game publisher 37Games - on Friday established the Guangzhou Metaverse Innovation Association in the city's tech-centric Nansha district according to a report by the Nanfang Daily the official newspaper of the Guangdong provincial committee of China's Communist Party.

That alliance aims to serve as Guangzhou's first salvo in the race to build China's metaverse ecosystem while enabling the southern city to accelerate development of its digital economy according to the report. The metaverse refers to an immersive virtual world where digital representations of people can interact with each other like they do in real life.

Nansha one of 11 districts in Guangzhou is home to the biggest of the three pilot free trade zones in the Greater Bay Area. There are more than 300 artificial intelligence-related companies in the district 10 of which are either listed on the mainland or in Hong Kong according to official data.

The Guangzhou Metaverse Innovation Association sets an example on how private enterprises and local governments can collaborate in emerging technologies according to Wang Guilin director of the city's Science and Technology Bureau.

Following its establishment the association now counts 23 Guangzhou-based tech companies and research institutions as well as Chinese AI speech recognition tech giant iFlyTek which is based in Hefei in eastern Anhui province.

Founding member 37Games and GrowthEase parent NetEase did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.

Story continues

GrowthEase provides streaming technology support for the avatar-based concerts and conferences hosted on NetEase's virtual events platform Yaotai which presented the Hong Kong stock exchange listing ceremony of music streaming unit NetEase Cloud Village last November.

Shenzhen-listed 37Games plans to ""keep exploring the metaverse-related businesses"" and ""continue to accumulate key technologies"" in 2022 according to co-founder and president Li Yifei during the company's annual meeting in January.

The new metaverse alliance in Guangzhou reflects how the concept has become increasingly popular with Chinese technology companies and a growing number of investors. This enthusiasm is reflected in various enterprises that have linked their businesses to the concept while books about the metaverse have become bestsellers.

At the recent ""two sessions"" the country's largest annual gathering of lawmakers and top political consultants a number of delegates published proposals on how China should embrace and regulate the metaverse.

The number of metaverse-related trademark applications in China already reached 16000 in the first two months of the year double the number recorded the previous two months.

Still the enthusiasm for the metaverse contrasts with recent warnings about the potential risks in this new field. In February the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission warned the public to stay alert to illegal fundraising schemes and scams related to the metaverse.

Before Guangzhou's initiative top-tier Chinese cities such as Beijing Shanghai and Shenzhen already made the metaverse part of their development plans. Other provincial capitals such as Wuhan in central Hubei province and Hefei have also made commitments to metaverse development.

Orlando International Airport is the most popular airport to fly into and Disney has a partnership with Southwest Airlines.

What's Happening:

Southwest Airlines recently announced a new ticket option that is coming soon.

They announced they will be adding a new fair category and the new ticket will be a step up from the airlines' low-cost tickets.

The new fair option is called Wanna Get Away Plus. This will offer passengers additional perks like increased rapid reward points and eight points per dollar with the ability to transfer eligible unused flight credits to another customer.

In addition to that Southwest will offer customers with Wanna Get Away Plus a seat on a different flight on the same travel day with no extra charge. That is if a seat is available between the same cities or on same-day standby if flights are full.

According to the Washington Post

The Anytime category will receive perks like Priority Lane access and early bird check-in.

If you're wondering what the least expensive tier is It's The Wanna Get Away category and this will not change.

Southwest has not shared when this category will be offered but guests can find a full list of features on their website.

The woman blames a recent gastric bypass surgery.

Vyvianna Quinonez Woman Who Assaulted Southwest Airlines Flight Attendant Faces Longer Prison Term After New DUI Arrest

28-year-old Quinonez shocked the world after video showed her punching a Southwest Airlines flight attendant with a closed first on a flight to San Diego over a mask dispute (the flight attendant had told Quinonez to return her seat to the upright position stow her tray table and put on her mask prior to landing). Three of the flight attendant’s teeth were damaged two of them requiring crowns. She also needed stitches for a deep cut and suffered bruising.

With video evidence clearly implicating Quinonez she “admitted that she stood up and assaulted the flight attendant by punching her in the face and head with a closed fist and grabbing her hair” pleading guilty to assault.

That was on January 7 2022. But on January 16 2022 she was pulled over by California Highway Patrol after being observed driving erratically. She admitted to the officer that she had consumed a couple drinks blaming her disorientation on a fight with her boyfriend and a recent gastric bypass surgery which left her more prone to getting drunk.

Prosecutors were not amused telling the Sacramento Bee:

“However Defendant told pretrial services that her doctor informed her that ‘if she drinks alcohol her blood alcohol concentration may rise abnormally due to the small size of her stomach.’ “Given this warning by her doctor Defendant should have been especially careful about the possibility of driving while intoxicated.”

An arrest warrant was issued and on February 15th she was served the warrant and placed under the custody of U.S. Marshals.

Her sentencing hearing has now been re-scheduled to May 27 2022. She remains locked up.

Quinonez faces a maximum fine of $250000 and up to 20 years in prison. Having violated the conditions of her parole just a week after her plea agreement she potentially faces a harsher sentence even if only the assault charge remains due to a judge’s discretion in setting the penalty.

CONCLUSION

A part of you must feel sorry for a woman who may have ruined her life through a series of poor decisions. But her failure to abide by plea conditions and the absolutely brutal assault on a flight attendant merits in my view an extremely harsh punishment (within the statutory limit) that hopefully will serve as a chilling reminder to others not to assault flight attendants.

Apart from trained staffing Airlines are always dependent on robust infrastructure and Southwest Airlines has done it right by investing in a major infrastructure to support it's long-term vision for its Denver operation with the opening of a new Technical Operations complex at Denver International Airport (DEN).

Price tag of the infrasturucture is $100 million  located on the north side of the Airport  spread over a 130000 square foot area  and the project got accomplished within a time period of three years !

The project includes a large aircraft maintenance hangar and room for offices training and warehousing to support the carrier's Technical Operations Team.

Southwest says  the Infrastructure represents Southwest's continued commitment to Denver by bringing more job opportunities to the community.

The Technical Operations Hangar located on the north side of Denver International Airport (DEN).

The $100 million hangar will be the solution for overnight maintenance activity of Soutwest in the Airport.

Prior to this Southwest depended on its competitors’ hangars to carry out the unscheduled maintenance at DIA.

Southwest is one of the largest employers in the city with nearly 5000 People based in Denver.

""As we continue to grow and welcome more Customers at Denver International Airport we're laser-focused on the work that happens behind-the-scenes that enables us to provide a great Customer experience"" said Mike Van de Ven Southwest Airlines' President & Chief Operating Officer.

The disruption and uncertainty however create opportunities.

Those were among the key takeaways from an air development workshop held last week at Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport/Adams Field.

The pandemic turned the industry ""upside down"" said Joseph Pickering principal at Mead & Hunt a global consulting firm. The former Delta Airlines executive is the business unit leader for the consulting firm's air service consulting group.

""We experienced a shock event unlike anything else"" he told members of the Little Rock Municipal Airport Commission and airport executives. ""In the past we've had recessions other minor blips along the way. 9/11 looking in the rearview mirror looks minor compared to what we had now.""

Passenger traffic fell to levels not seen since the 1990s while airlines offered just ""minimum service"" as part of an effort to keep the economy going while much of the nation was ""locked down"" in an effort to halt the spread of the covid-19 virus.

One immediate impact of the pandemic was the loss of business travelers. They represent an outsize portion of airline passengers because they travel frequently and often pay premium prices for their tickets.

""I had one airliner planner tell me that the state of Florida early on in the pandemic single-handedly kept the industry afloat because people wanted to get out eventually"" Pickering said. ""These leisure destinations were benefiting more so than the typical business markets.""

Since demand for airline products fell so did profitability which led to cutting costs. Airlines were unable to reinvest in new aircraft and offered early retirement packages to employees including pilots their most expensive labor cost Pickering said.

Once demand began returning the airlines no longer had pilots in place to meet it. Now fuel costs are rising and business travel hasn't returned Pickering said.

""We've got this perfect storm"" he said. ""We've got lack of business travel we've got crew shortages fuel increases disruptions going on in economies around the world. And fewer airplanes as well.""

All that disruption and uncertainty has left smaller cities with reduced service. Delta Airlines for one has pulled out of Fort Smith Regional Airport. American Airlines still serves the airport.

Other destinations such as Myrtle Beach and Key West are fully recovered according to Pickering.

""Little Rock is somewhere in between"" he said.

Margaret Muir was one of two executives from American who spoke at the daylong workshop.

Little Rock has service to five of American's 10 U.S. hubs: Chicago Dallas Charlotte Miami and Washington D.C.

""You can see where we're arranged our service from Little Rock -- we connect east and west and north and south -- so lots of options for the Little Rock passenger who is trying to get just about anywhere in the country"" said Muir senior manager for network planning at American.

These days she said Clinton National is performing pretty consistently to and from the American hubs in Dallas and Charlotte.

""Because you can connect anywhere at these hubs they tend to hold up better"" Muir said.

The Chicago hub is impacted by winter weather Miami weekend service hasn't been strong ""so far"" and the D.C. hub has been slow to recover but the airline sees some ""signs of strength"" she said.

Given all the challenges American and the rest of the airline industry faces Muir said it will be difficult to expand service at Clinton National.

The airline looks at a number of metrics to weigh new service she said. They include how a new route would fit into overall strategy the demand for the new route and how valuable is that demand would it stimulate demand and last but not least the opportunity cost.

""You are going to have the take the plane from somewhere"" Muir said. ""We don't have a plane sitting waiting to be deployed to a new market. Instead it was already doing something. What are the opportunity costs of moving from an existing market to a new market?""

And keeping the service Clinton National already has she said requires the airport to keeps its costs low which it already does; keep the airline informed on changes in the market that could impact service such as company expansions or relocation to the city; and tell the airline what customers are saying about routes and schedules.

Bryan Malinowski the top executive at Clinton National expressed worry that not all travelers will return.

""Airlines are telling us that the leisure travel is back but only about 50% or less of the business travel"" he said. ""I think that's an important point to echo.""

Pickering pointed to other cities and their efforts to retain or stimulate demand including using federal pandemic relief funds which can be used to subsidize airline routes because they can qualify as economic development or tourism.

""Air service checks both of those boxes"" he said.

Last year the Tulsa County Board of Commissioners allocated up to $3 million in federal covid-19 relief funds to a local group to incentivize nonstop flights from Tulsa to major U.S. cities. The group has a goal of raising $15 million in public and private money to fund the effort.

American Airlines then announced announced that it will add year-round nonstop service from Tulsa International Airport to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington D.C. and Miami International Airport beginning in November.

Pickering warned that the incentives aren't a guarantee.

""Incentives help put you over the finish line"" he said. Airlines ""won't go into a market that they know is not going to work."""

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.41%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

Metric Q1 2024 Q1 2024 Analysts Estimate Q1 2023 % Change Adjusted EPS $0.56 $0.55 ($0.41) N/A Revenue $3.87 billion $3.83 billion $3.93 billion (1.5%) Gross margin 28.6% N/A 21.2% 7.4 percentage points

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives.

The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

facility exit and re-configuration costs of $10.0 million. In 2023 transfers and closures of targeted manufacturing sites including Fort Worth Texas

and Cheraw South Carolina as previously announced in March 2023 resulted in accelerated depreciation of production equipment of $17.0 million

and non-cash asset write-downs of $42.2 million (predominantly tooling raw materials and WIP).











3 Strategic Sourcing & Operational Excellence costs in 2023 primarily relate to third-party consultant fees to provide expertise in identifying and

quantifying opportunities to source in a more integrated manner and re-design in-plant operations following footprint rationalization developing

a detailed program and related governance and assisting the Company with the implementation of actions necessary to achieve the related objectives.











4 Acquisition & integration-related costs primarily relate to the MTD and Excel acquisitions including costs to integrate the organizations and

shared processes as well as harmonize key IT applications and infrastructure.











5 Includes deal-related costs net of income related to providing transition services to previously divested businesses.











6 The $25.5 million pre-tax asset impairment charge in 2024 related to the Infrastructure business.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

In no way am I bashing the international coffee chain. This is more about how impressed I am with the patience of those who waste daylight in the drive-thru. Dramatic I'm aware but if you've ever waited for a ""Vente Mocha-Loco Drizzle"" or whatever you know exactly what I'm talking about.

Every time I pass the Route 6 location in Dartmouth there are never just a couple of cars in line no matter what time of day it is. The same goes for Fall River's SouthCoast Marketplace location which is worse. The shopping center alone is always bustling with people running to Market Basket or grabbing a bite to eat at 110 Grill. Add the ever-popular Starbucks to the mix and you have yourself a recipe for traffic and stress.

One of my favorite memes to come out of 2022 so far is the one that claims people who complain about gas prices are the same people who will idle in a Starbucks line for over a half-hour just to overpay for a cup of coffee. I mean it's not wrong.

I turned to my Facebook page asking people what their wait-time threshold was in a drive-thru. I was curious to know how long people are willing to wait for a gourmet coffee or pastry.

Out of 70 people the average answer was 28 minutes.

The longest someone waited according to the informal survey was 52 minutes (absolutely insanity). The shortest amount of time someone would be <em>willing</em> to wait is 15 minutes. I suppose once you're in the line you're committed.

This just goes to show that whatever Starbucks is doing they're crushing the game.

Many said they prefer the call- or order-ahead method on the app because it's quicker but then also admitted it's taken upwards of 25 minutes upon arrival before getting their order.

It's a hard pass for me but for you avid Starbucks fans I salute you and your patience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZnR2b2ljZS5vcmcvaW50ZXJ2aWV3LXN0YXJidWNrcy13b3JrZXJzLWluLWFzdG9yaWEtcXVlZW5zLWpvaW4tdW5pb25pemF0aW9uLXB1c2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interview: Starbucks Workers in Astoria Queens Join Unionization Push,"Left Voice interviews two Starbucks workers who recently filed for a union at their store on Astoria Blvd in New York City. This is part of a wave of one hundred and forty stores in twenty six states petitioning for union elections. You can follow and support Astoria Starbucks workers on Twitter or Instagram at @astoriablvdsbx.

Mike: To start could you guys tell me about yourselves your names or what your positions are at Starbucks how long you’ve worked there and when you first recognized you needed a union?

Kevin: Hi I’m Kevin I’m a barista at Starbucks. I’ve been there now for about two and a half years. I started not long before the pandemic. If I had to say when I thought we needed a union it was during the pandemic. During the point where we reopened and we were mobile orders only was really hectic. It was a mess in terms of the number of customers amount of orders short staffing numbers all that kind of stuff. And that’s definitely when I was like “This is not right you know?”

Josue: Hi my name is Josue. I’m a shift supervisor at the Astoria location and I’ve been a partner for about five years now. I was away for about six months just because I graduated college and I was trying to pursue graphic design. It wasn’t for me and I just really missed the kind of connections and the way we get involved with customers at Starbucks so I felt like I had to go back. But during the pandemic it was very hectic. Kevin had a lot of good points. It was really a struggle. It was not the same as before. Starbucks management always never really listened to us and specifically during COVID times it was much much worse. There was no connection. We would voice opinions and it just wouldn’t matter. For me specifically the moment I knew we could win a union was really really recently just because our store closed down for two weeks. And me and my team we didn’t get to see each other. We only saw like three or four other coworkers at different stores. And in that time I really got to experience the way other stores function and saw the relationship partners have with their managers. It was really eye opening. It was shocking like the way that no one trusts each other like the way we trust each other at the Astoria Boulevard location. And coming back we were all so excited to see each other. And that’s when I figured that it’s kind of up to us to start something ourselves. I thought: if we can trust each other this much we know we can start something.

Mike: You both touched on the working conditions during the pandemic. What were those like? I know anytime I come to Starbucks I’m watching you all flip cups to each other and go back and forth. It seems pretty damn intense. It seems like you really have to be on your game to make sure that everything is functioning the way it is. So the idea that things could get more intense during the pandemic could you talk a little bit more about what those working conditions were like during the pandemic? How was staffing? How hectic was it?

Josue: During the peak of it all it was very much a lot of responsibility because you don’t want to let down your community our customers. They know our names like they know what we do on the side besides Starbucks and they literally come up to check up on us. Our customers basically become your friends your family. And during the peak we had so much extra responsibility especially with our partners and you don’t want to let your community and your partners down. We have 30 minute timers. Every 30 minutes we have to wipe down every high surface area table. All door handles the bathroom everything and we still have to do all that with the same amount of employees. We don’t get extra help. And we have to worry about the health department coming in or someone else coming in to check up on us and that everything is signed off. As a supervisor I feel that pressure on top of me. Because it’s like it’s up to me like I have to make sure that I give my best possible self so that the community feels safe and partners like Kevin feel safe.

Kevin: I agree with Josue we had just a lot of extra responsibilities and we weren’t trained for this kind of thing. You know I took the job I knew I’m going to make coffee. I know I got to clean things whatever that’s the job. But then having all those additional responsibilities keeping an eye on cleaning high-touch surfaces. Later on there’s checking people making sure people are wearing masks on top of what are already a lot of general responsibilities while also having in the back of your mind there’s a pandemic going on. I don’t want to get sick or something. And there’s no social distancing at work with what we’re doing. Spaces are too tight so it’s like there’s a lot that was put on to order and then on to frontline supervisors. It was a lot.

Mike:To clarify when you say partners that means like a partner is somebody separate than a shift supervisor?

Josue: Partners are just what we call employees at Starbucks. Just because we’re also given stocks in the company. So they like to refer to us as partners so that we all feel like on the same level.

Kevin: Yes key is so we “feel” that way. But we aren’t all on the same level so…

Josue: Yeah right but we know that it’s not so.

Mike: It’s interesting that the “partners” terminology is used whereas I’m sure the amount of stock that that either of you even if you combine your stock compared to the amount of stock that the top top level of Starbucks has they’re not necessarily comparable. But that term partner almost makes it sound like it’s an equal relationship.

Kevin: Yeah on paper or to the highest levels of Starbucks we are they call us that but you know is it actually?

Mike: Yeah yeah. Ok so then the next question is what would a union mean for Starbucks for Starbucks workers at your location?

Kevin: Well it would mean that those who work in the store will be able to have a say in how things work. We work there we’re on the floor. We deal with everything that comes down on us as opposed to like you know someone way above us is deciding. Managers may say “Hey your store gets X number of hours and this many people based on whatever metric.” We have no control over that; we are just supposed to deal with it. But in forming a union it gives us a say it makes us more equal in that regard. It will be us together at a negotiation as opposed to just dealing with this and I think that’s really important.

Mike: I’m wondering if you’ve seen any retaliation to unionizing efforts thus far either before you officially filed or after?

Josue: Nothing much has happened but before our manager did mention a few things to us that did seem out of place. He asked some really vague questions that we weren’t really sure about. We did hear that in Manhattan they started posting up anti-union messages and we have been wondering when this is going to come to our store. But right now we’re just waiting to see. We have so much support from the community though. Our customers are coming in often people we’ve never met before. So we’re hoping that the level of support we have kind of deters management from messing with us.

Mike: I had read that Starbucks workers in Denver’s East Colfax Starbucks went on strike recently. They were protesting the unfair labor practices in retaliation to their efforts in unionizing the store. I’m wondering if either of you have thoughts on that?

Kevin: I came across that on Reddit I believe and saw that they had walked out. And you know I would say I thought “Right on!” We’re aware of what’s going on in our store a lot of us are aware of the Buffalo store and maybe some other stores working to unionize. So to see that showed that workers recognized these working conditions are a problem and aren’t going to stand for them.

Josue: So we’re in talks with Starbucks United and we’re actually trying to start a few things with other stores but nothing is concrete. We’re constantly in communication with them and we’re trying to find multiple ways of helping all the other stores because thanks to social media we’re talking to people from other states. We see what everyone is going through and notice how many people from different stores around the country have the same exact issues other people are going through. We’re hoping that we can grow something larger from here and other stores that are pushing to unionize.

Mike: You mentioned that these struggles are similar in that a lot of people are going through similar circumstances at different stores around the country. And now we’ve seen this wave of unionizing efforts at Starbucks which is really all over the country with one hundred and forty stores in twenty six states petitioning for union elections. More recently the previous CEO Kevin Johnson has stepped down and the new anti-union CEO Howard Schultz is back. Now to me it seems like the reaction from the top of Starbucks is “We need to retake over the reins here and figure out how to stop all these stores trying to unionize.” And I’m wondering what you guys think. Do you think that Starbucks leadership is threatened by this unionization effort that we’re seeing?

Josue: They should be scared. They should be. We’re obviously the people that are stepping up. Care about each other. We knew from the very beginning this was not completely about us it’s about everybody around us. We’re just the spark. That’s all it is and we’re hoping that everyone else can become brave and strong enough to stand up. It’s obvious that something is wrong. And if Starbucks leadership’s intention is to try to control us or try to put us down they’re going to have a hard time. They really are. Speaking of our store as an example we hang out after work all the time. We truly truly care about each other. And if they think that some change in leadership is going to affect anything we have each other’s back. So we’re not scared of anything. We’re not worried. And we know we got each other and are going to keep this momentum going.

Kevin Damn right.

Mike: I have one last question…..I don’t think this struggle against poor working conditions is limited to a struggle at Starbucks; around the country workers are rising up. So for example education workers in Minneapolis have been on strike for about three weeks. They’re demanding increased wages smaller class sizes. They’re demanding support and retention of BIPOC teachers. They’re also demanding increased mental health support for students is in a city where George Floyd was murdered which was the epicenter of those protests that we saw two summers ago. So I’m wondering how you see your fight for a union tied to other workers like these fighting for better working conditions?

Josue: In the first weekend that we started announcing that we were trying to form a union customers showed up to show support from all over. While I was working many expressed to me how they were also going through similar issues. And 90 percent of them told me that they were so inspired by us just on that one day that they wanted to start a movement. They’ve been thinking about it they were saying how they don’t have proper working conditions and see the pressures that workers like us take. All of the pressure we take all of the hard work and we’re expected to meet sales demands or this or that. Everything is just thrown on top of us and we deserve to have a voice. So in order to push back it means organizing like we are or other workers are. So yeah I see that as the connection.

Mike: Thanks so much for this interview. How can our readers support you all both at your specific location in Astoria and then do you have thoughts of how our readers can support other Starbucks workers that are struggling together?

Kevin: I would say like if you’re local to us come to our store for your coffee order with “union strong” as the name. Just coming to our store and doing that shows support to us. And whether you’re local or not local just spread the word in any way possible on social media between friends or coworkers. Just anything like that helps.

Josue: On Monday we went live with our Instagram on our Twitter. So if people want to follow us it’s @Astoriablvdsbx. We post there regularly. We really just want to keep everyone informed that way through social media. Another definite way is what Kevin said… and customers keep coming in. They don’t order like sometimes they’ll just order water and they put their money in the tip jar for us where it counts. And they just give us words of encouragement which really helps a lot. We’ll be getting destroyed making all these drinks and customers will just hang around wait when it’s slow then come up to us and give words of encouragement. They’ll come to just show support and ask for a cup of water or a small coffee or green tea. They’ve been ordering the simplest drinks to make because they know it’s not a huge workload on us. Besides that anybody can help in various ways. For example I’ve had three customers yesterday come in and offer us spaces to meet or try to give us connections like “Hey I have this equipment if you need it? Are you guys going to do a photoshoot somewhere? Would you guys be interested in doing videos for social media?” Or they come to give tips of where other workers are organizing if we want to meet with them. So literally if you can just stop on by words of encouragement anything helps. But definitely follow us on Instagram and Twitter and share the things that we post if possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvdGhlLXN0YXJidWNrcy1jZW8tY2hhbmdlLWFuZC10aGUtYmlnLXRvcGljLWJvYXJkcy1zdHJ1Z2dsZS13aXRoLmh0bWzSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wMy8yNi90aGUtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWNlby1jaGFuZ2UtYW5kLXRoZS1iaWctdG9waWMtYm9hcmRzLXN0cnVnZ2xlLXdpdGguaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The abrupt Starbucks CEO change reveals a big topic boards struggle with,"The recent news out of Starbucks that Kevin Johnson will be stepping down as CEO on April 4 and founder Howard Schultz will again be leading the company puts the critical process of CEO succession planning back into the spotlight.

Selecting the right leader for an organization is arguably the most important job of a board of directors. Mellody Hobson the independent chair of Starbucks ' board said directors knew of Johnson's desire to step down a year ago and that a new CEO would be in place by the fall.

Even the most innovative strategies or the best financials are not enough without the right leader at the helm. Now changes in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic coupled with rising stakeholder activism are reshaping succession planning. The ability to manage rapid digital transformation flexible and remote schedules and the overall changing nature of work means boards are having to rethink the skills they're looking for in a top leader.

Directors are also needing to replace CEOs more often during their own board tenures. In 2020 56 S&P 500 CEOs resigned an increase of 30% over the prior decade according to data from executive search firm Spencer Stuart. Of those who quit in 2020 20% did so under pressure up from 13% a year earlier.

Yet too often boards are caught unprepared when a CEO retires steps down or is forced to leave. ""If you believe that the primary responsibility of the board is getting the right leader in place and it is then a company should never be caught by surprise when a CEO has to be replaced"" says Maria Moats leader of PwC's Governance Insights Center. ""There should always be an emergency plan in place.""

One of the reasons why succession planning often turns out to be such a painful process she says is just simple human nature: it can be an uncomfortable conversation.

Talking to a newly installed CEO about the process of replacing him or her is not what most board members relish about the job. A PwC survey shows that the single biggest reason why directors struggle with more timely and effective succession planning is because the current CEO is performing as expected and therefore there's little urgency to focus on the process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jaGluYS1jb2ZmZWUtbWFya2V0LXN0YXJidWNrcy1mZW5kaS1tYWlzb24tbWFyZ2llbGHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Luxury Brands Wake Up to the Booming Chinese Coffee Market,"Starbucks has been embroiled in controversies from inappropriate staff manners to price hikes. Whether it will retain the lead in the Chinese coffee shop market remains a heated discussion. Meanwhile domestic chains such as Luckin Seesaw and Manner have seen rapid development and gained financial injections from investors.

Due to the sector’s rapid expansion everyone now wants a piece from the action — including “outsiders.” China Post opened its first coffee house named “Post Coffee” on Valentine’s Day. A few days later Goubuli a long-established food firm from Tianjin formally established a company named Gao Leya Coffee Food (Tianjin) Co. Ltd.

As the industry has become more competitive and sophisticated leading high-end players are also diving in like Blue Bottle Coffee which opened its first store in the mainland last month. Given such developments how did this vast market come into being? And how have luxury brands leveraged this opportunity?

In 1999 Starbucks opened its first Chinese store in Beijing. With the goal of building its brick-and-mortar outlets as “The Third Place”(Starbucks is a third place between home and the workplace where people can relax) the company ran at a heavy loss for nine years in China. After much time and effort it has managed to establish a high-end and professional image in China and retain its leading position in the country’s premium coffee trade.

While the mainstream had remained untouched until Starbucks’ Beijing debut the brand Luckin played a significant role in warming up the coffee sector and making the drink a habit around the country. Since 2018 Luckin has focused on its store expansion and consumer subsidies. Declaring its intention to “educate the market with 1 billion CNY” (157 million) the retailer has successfully become the number one alternative to Starbucks.

In this Luckin has done an excellent job. According to Euromonitor in 2018 the average consumption per capita in the Chinese mainland was 4.7 cups. This number rose to 9 in 2021 as reported by Deloitte’s White Paper on China’s Fresh Coffee Industry. More importantly in the first- and second-tier cities where the drink has become a habit for many an average of 300 cups of coffee are consumed per year which is as many as those in a more sophisticated coffee market. Coffee is no longer just trendy — it’s a part of the daily routine.

With changes in the diet of Chinese consumers and the increasing popularity of the beverage the local coffee business is now experiencing accelerated development. According to iiMedia Research the industry was worth 60 billion (381.7 billion RMB) in 2021 with an estimated 27.2 percent yearly increase. In 2025 the market value is expected to reach 157 billion (1000 billion RMB).

Last month Blue Bottle Coffee also known as “the Apple of coffee” officially entered the Chinese arena. According to local media on the day of the opening people were spending as long as six hours queuing while scalpers were reselling a 6.5 (42 RMB) iced latte at 15.7 (100 RMB).

As a pioneer of “the third wave coffee” (which refers to a movement in marketing that emphasizes high quality) Blue Bottle Coffee will inevitably find itself facing competition with the artisanal brands that have been in the mainland for years including % Arabica Peet’s and Starbucks. Their target customers: loyal coffee lovers who are less price-sensitive and attach great importance to the quality of beans and coffee house vibes.

And then there is an altogether different group of consumers — those who simply cannot live without it.

Modern city life means that most young adults find themselves in need of caffeine first thing in the morning. In the first- and second-tier cities that used to be ruled by Starbucks their concept of “The Third Place” has been taken over by other coffee houses or commercial spaces.

“The fast-paced lifestyles the pressure from work and the convenient food delivery service of the big cities in China have led to the white-collar’s demand for the cost-effective grab-and-go coffee” said Amber Wu marketing strategist at Emerging Communications. “As a result domestic coffee companies like Manner came into being and became popular.”

In 1998 Armani opened its first Saint-Germain Emporio Armani Caffè & Armani/Ristorante making it the first luxury fashion label to tap the drink. Not long after that brands such as Louis Vuitton Dior Chanel and Gucci jumped into the business opening cafes around the world.

In China in addition to opening coffee shops such as The Tiffany Blue Box Café and Burberry Thomas’s Café high-end fashion brands tends to create pop-up shops and events to engage with its consumers — particularly in the post-epidemic era — many of which involve coffee. For example Prada landed its pop-up store “Prada Garden” at Jiya Gathering a coffee house on Wukang Road Shanghai and Louis Vuitton turned the Yuyuan Shopping Center (which houses cafes art galleries and fashion stores) into a pop-up store. In addition while releasing its winter sports capsule collection FENDI presented its new pop-up space and FENDI CAFFE at Changbaishan International Resort a skiing destination located in northern China.

Moreover many luxury brands are trying to reach a wider audience by collaborating with local coffee houses like the pop-up event co-organized by Louis Vuitton and Manner at the Qixi Festival in Sanlitun Beijing and the pop-up store of perfume and coffee jointly created by Maison Margiela and Seesaw Coffee. These colorful pop-up events capture the attention of young people. On Xiaohongshu it’s very common for pictures of coffee mugs with luxury logos to get hundreds or even thousands of likes.

In October 2020 Maison Margiela teamed up with Seesaw Coffee for a pop-up store in Shanghai.

“Coffee has become a part of the office culture. Apart from the taste and how it keeps people energetic coffee represents a kind of consolation when people are working overtime so the luxury brands are now taking advantage of the image of coffee to become more approachable and emotionally connect with the young white-collars” said Wu.

Today Starbucks no longer serves as an important informal public gathering place (at least not in the way it used to) and the attention of the younger generation has been diverted to the endless stream of collaborations. On Xiaohongshu you can easily get hundreds or even thousands of likes by posting coffee mugs with luxury brand logos. The colorful pop-up activities of luxury brands have attracted the attention of the younger generation and the luxury value behind the brand has been injected into cup after cup of coffee. By helping young people create rich and fresh social currency luxury brands can achieve brand communication that keeps pace with the times."

This week we take a look at the high school that has produced the most out-of-state Buckeyes with nine: St. Thomas Aquinas. Since 2013 four Raiders have played for the Buckeyes with three of the four becoming first-round NFL draft picks.

(1970-2021)

Since 1975 St. Thomas Aquinas has been coached by three men: George Smith Rocco Casullo and Roger Harriott. All of them have won state championships as the Raiders’ coach.

Hundreds of Raiders have made their way onto college rosters to continue their football pursuits with many making it to the NFL. Ohio State has been one of the beneficiaries of the talent the Raiders have developed.

Notable Buckeyes from St. Thomas Aquinas

S Nate Salley (2002-05)

Salley was a freshman on the 2002 national championship squad. The athletic defender was a key contributor on special teams for the school's first title team in 34 years.

The safety finished his Ohio State career with 181 tackles two interceptions 2.5 tackles for loss 16 pass breakups and a memorable block against Michigan State in 2005.

The Buckeyes were trailing the Spartans 17-7 near the end of the first half when Salley struck. He came hard off the left side of the offensive line unattested and blocked John Goss' field goal attempt. Ashton Youboty scooped it up and scored on a 72-yard touchdown return.

Salley's spectacular play led to this classic John L. Smith halftime interview:

As a freshman Salley was also on Jim O'Brien's second-to-last basketball team at Ohio State He played in 10 games scored eight points and grabbed four rebounds during his only season on the basketball court.

At St. Thomas Aquinas Salley tallied 76 tackles and blocked eight kicks during his senior year. He also won a state title on the basketball team as a junior and was the state long jump champion as a senior.

DE Joey Bosa (2013-15)

Bosa was a Freshman All-American in 2013 then became the 27th Buckeye to be a unanimous All-American in 2014 when he was the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year and an instrumental player in the Buckeyes' national championship season.

Bosa ranks in the top five in Ohio State history of the following defensive categories for a season and a career: Tackles for loss (50.5 career 21 in 2014) quarterback sacks (26 13.5 in 2014) and quarterback sack yards (177 96 in 2014).

The San Diego Chargers selected Bosa with the third pick of the 2016 NFL Draft. He was named the Defensive Rookie of the Year and has received four Pro Bowl nods during his six years in the NFL.

During his junior and senior seasons at Aquinas Bosa recorded 19 sacks and 51 tackles-for-loss. His dominating presence on the line helped guide St. Thomas to the 2012 Florida state title. Bosa was an Under Armour All-American and two-time All-State player in high school.

DE Nick Bosa (2016-18)

Following the departure of Joey after the 2015 season Nick kept the Bosa train rolling at Ohio State when he arrived in 2016. The younger brother known as “Little Bear” had his Buckeye career cut short due to core muscle surgery in the fall of 2018.

Bosa made the most of the 30 games that he played in. Despite making only 10 starts he racked up 77 tackles 17.5 sacks and 29 tackles for loss over those 30 contests.

Bosa's sophomore year was his most productive. He earned All-American and All-Big Ten honors and was named the Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year after he recorded 34 total tackles with 16 tackles for loss 8.5 sacks two pass deflections and a forced fumble.

The San Francisco 49ers selected Bosa with the second overall pick of the 2019 NFL Draft making him the highest drafted Ohio State defensive end at the time. Through three seasons in San Francisco Bosa has been named to two Pro Bowls and was the Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2019. He likely would have made a third Pro Bowl if he hadn't torn his ACL in the second game of the 2020 season.

Bosa started all four of his seasons at St. Thomas Aquinas and won state titles in 2012 2014 and 2015. His dominance on the field was recognized by all of the recruiting services as 247Sports ranked him as the No. 1 defensive end of the 2016 class. Bosa was a two-time Florida All-State player getting the recognition after his sophomore and junior seasons. A knee injury after the eighth game of his senior year prevented him from earning All-State honors for the third time.

CB Damon Arnette (2015-19)

The talented defensive back played 38 games over his last three seasons with the Buckeyes. During that stretch Arnette racked up 140 tackles five interceptions and broke up 22 passes.

Following his redshirt junior season Arnette contemplated leaving Columbus for the NFL but opted to return after a conversation with Cris Carter who was one of his coaches at St. Thomas Aquinas. The decision to return proved to be beneficial as he improved his draft stock. In the third game of the 2019 season Arnette intercepted a pass from Indiana quarterback Peyton Ramsey at the Buckeyes' 4-yard line and returned it 96 yards for the score. The pick-six was a first for Arnette and it is the fourth longest interception return in Ohio State history.

Arnette was selected by the Raiders as the 19th overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft. His career is currently in limbo however after he was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon in January.

St. Thomas Aquinas won two state championships with Arnette on the team. During his senior season he snagged three interceptions broke up five passes and collected three sacks. Arnette's play captured the attention of Ohio State and he flipped to the Buckeyes from South Carolina just before National Signing Day in 2015.

More about St. Thomas Aquinas

Established in 1926 St. Thomas Aquinas High School was created by the Dominican Sisters of Adrian Michigan and was originally named St. Anthony High School. Just over two decades later the name of the school was changed to Central Catholic High School. The new name lasted nine years until a second Catholic high school arrived in Fort Lauderdale. At that time Central Catholic became St. Thomas Aquinas.

The Raiders compete in FHSAA Class 7A District 14. They went 14–1 and won their third straight state title in 2021. St. Thomas won its first state championship in 1992. The program also won titles in 1997 and 1999. A 15-year span of dominance for the Raiders began in 2007. STA has collected 10 state championships in the past 15 years.

Across all sports Aquinas has won 114 FHSAA state championships. The girls' soccer team has a school-high 15 state titles. The girls’ track and field team is second holding 14 state championships with the first title coming in 1998. Other girls’ sports with multiple state championships are cross country golf softball swimming tennis and volleyball.

The boys of St. Thomas have also dominated. The football team leads the way with 13 state titles but baseball cross country lacrosse soccer swimming tennis and track and field have also claimed multiple first place trophies.

Coaching legends George Smith and Roger Harriott

For 34 years George Smith roamed the sidelines for St. Thomas Aquinas. He transformed the program into a powerhouse when he became head coach in 1975. Over the years Smith won 361 games six state titles 24 district titles and was state runner-up seven times.

With that kind of success comes numerous awards. Smith was named the National Coach of the Year by ESPN Schutt and USA TODAY in 2008. In 2010 the National High School Athletic Association gave him the honor of National Coach of the Year. Smith is also a member of numerous halls of fame including the Florida High School Athletic Hall of Fame.

Nate Salley Joey Bosa and four other Buckeyes played for the legendary coach. Following the 2010 season Smith hung up his whistle and retired from coaching St. Thomas Aquinas.

Current coach Roger Harriott was an All-Broward County running back for the Raiders and Smith between 1991 and 1994. Following a playing career at Boston University and Villanova he ultimately made it back to his alma mater.

Harriott has excelled since taking over as the Raiders' head coach in 2015 taking the program to an even higher level of success. Harriott and St. Thomas Aquinas have won five state titles during his seven years as head coach.

In July Harriott shared how his program prepares players for all facets of life during an interview withh FNF Coaches.

“We have a standard of Faith-Family-Tradition-Excellence that we represent here” Harriott said. “Our guys do a great job. We provide different opportunities to create an environment of love respect and admiration. As a result they move on and do some pretty extraordinary things in life.

“They realize that the adversity they face is healthy. It’s an opportunity to get motivated improve and continue to give their best effort. As a result they realize that if they want something in life they have to take it. It won’t be given.”

Other famous alumni

In addition to the nine Raiders who have gone on to play football at Ohio State several other athletes from St. Thomas Aquinas have also gone on to achieve success in the collegiate and professional ranks in recent years.

Michael Irvin starred at Miami and played for the Dallas Cowboys from 1988-99. He won three Super Bowls with Dallas was named to the 1990s All-Decade Team is in the Cowboys’ Ring of Honor and is a Pro Football Hall of Famer.

Geno Atkins was named to eight Pro Bowls and made the 2010s All-Decade Team during his 11-year career with the Cincinnati Bengals. He played college football for Georgia and was named Florida's Defensive Player of the Year as a senior at St. Thomas Aquinas.

Jason Dufner spent the first 11 years of his life in Cleveland but later moved to Fort Lauderdale and attended St. Thomas Aquinas. He has won five PGA tournaments including the PGA Championship in 2013.

Chris Evert won 157 singles and 32 doubles titles during her Hall of Fame tennis career. The Fort Lauderdale native won 18 Grand Slam titles and is a seven-time French Open champion. She also played in a record 34 Grand Slam finals.

Forget for a minute the 19 years he spent as a Baylor assistant before finally getting his big shot with the Wildcats. Other than the length of his tenure with the Bears that part is not highly unusual.

No the fact that Tang got in the coaching profession at all is what makes his story so intriguing.

He was born in Trinidad and lived in St. Croix U.S. Virgin Islands until the age of 10 when his family moved to Texas. And while he played high school basketball by his own admission his talent did not match his love for the game.

""I wasn't very good"" he said. ""But I got better. I kept improving.

""I was extremely passionate about the game. Because I saw how much I improved it let me know like these guys have more talent in their pinky than I have in my whole body. And if I could improve at the level that I improved at then I feel as talented as they are if they're willing to put the work into it and I'm willing to give them the road on what to work on (they could succeed).""

Planting the coaching seed

Tang went off to North Central Bible College — now North Central University — in Minneapolis on a bible school scholarship with no intention of continuing his basketball career. Then a coach saw him shooting around in the gym one day and convinced him to try out for the team.

""It was the first time in my life anybody asked me to try out for a team"" Tang said. ""I made the team. I didn't play a lot but I made the team.""

It was there that Tang first entertained the thought of becoming a coach.

""Because of my experience in high school when I got to college I listened to the stories of some of my teammates who would talk about their high school coaches"" Tang recalled. ""And I said 'I want to be a high school coach because I want kids to have a great experience and understand that they can get better and improve.'

""I used to watch Rick Pitino tapes (on) player development. I never wanted a kid that I coach to leave and say 'Man my high school coach didn't do this.' I wanted them to have the best high school experience they could have.""

Funny thing was that epiphany notwithstanding Tang's road into coaching still involved several more twists and turns.

First of all he dropped out of college.

""Some of it was finances. Some of it was immaturity"" Tang said. ""That's why I can speak to these guys about the importance of developing good habits at a young age.""

A foot in the door at Heritage Christian

He did go back to school and played junior college basketball for a year before returning to Texas to go to work. That's when a position opened at Heritage Christian Academy near Houston and he landed the job as head coach — without the benefit of a college degree.

""I've been coaching ever since"" Tang said with a smile.

He quickly built Heritage Christian into a Texas powerhouse winning four state championships before taking the program national over his last three years.

With his team competing at a national level it brought college recruiters to Heritage Christian which in turn gave Tang an up-close look at the college game from a different perspective.

""It allowed me to develop relationships (and) to figure out what kind of guys that I wanted to work with and didn't want to work with"" he said.

Baylor comes calling

Enter Scott Drew who had just been named head coach at Baylor in 2003.

Drew met with Tang and the two immediately hit it off. But it took a dinner at Tang's home to convince Drew to hire him for his coaching staff.

""One thing my dad always said is you get to know someone when you go to their house (for dinner) so he said going to see coach Tang and spending time with his family was a great idea"" Drew said.

Of course Tang's track record at Heritage Christian played a role as well.

""The first reason I hired him is he was at Heritage Christian High School and built it into a powerhouse and they didn't have best facilities (or) resources"" Drew said. ""And he was able to transform and change that.

""And several people that I respected talked very highly of him. And then when I had a chance to meet him … he's a great guy. He's an outstanding husband and brother. Role model. Great Christian man (of) high character and great energy.""

But there was still a hitch. Tang for all his success had never completed his college degree.

Drew with the approval of his administration still hired Tang on the condition that he work to get his degree while still working full time at Baylor.

""He stopped (college) because he needed to support his family and his degree was very important to him"" Drew said. ""I respected him for wanting to do it and I know the importance of it.

""And he said 'It's not going to interfere with work' and I think he worked like all of us those first few years on five six hours of sleep only he probably just got four because the last two were spent studying.""

Tang finished up his last 70 hours or so online and through Baylor and in 2007 got his bachelor's degree from Charter Oak State College.

Looking to leave a legacy at K-State

Fast forward to 2022 and here he is the 25th head coach in Kansas State's storied basketball history. He's also the Wildcats' first Black head basketball coach and the fourth in any sport at K-State. It's his first head coaching job at the college level.

""That actually gave me goosebumps when someone that I'm really close to called to tell me about it as I was trying to research the job"" Tang said. ""But my dad is half Black and half Chinese my mom is Indian I was born in Trinidad I was raised in St. Croix (and) I grew up in Texas. I lived in Minnesota for a while.

""I've got a little bit of everything in me so that is pretty cool.""

But that in and of itself is not enough Tang added.

""It's pretty cool to be a part of history and be able to leave a legacy for my kids but I've got to make sure that it's a great legacy"" he said. ""So we've got to get players and we've got to win.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3RvbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yNy9zdC1qb2hucy1wcmVwLWVuZHMtdGhlLXNlYXNvbi1hdG9wLXRoZS1ib3N0b24taGVyYWxkLWJveXMtaG9ja2V5LXJhbmtpbmdzL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3RvbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yNy9zdC1qb2hucy1wcmVwLWVuZHMtdGhlLXNlYXNvbi1hdG9wLXRoZS1ib3N0b24taGVyYWxkLWJveXMtaG9ja2V5LXJhbmtpbmdzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. John’s Prep ends the season atop the Boston Herald boys hockey rankings,"St. John’s Prep was 52 seconds away from having its season ended at the hands of upset-minded BC High.

Still as has been the tradition for a few years I wanted to share some background perspectives on running STH. Since the beginning of STH I have always treated this as a resource for our users and so part of that I believe is also sharing behind-the-scenes looks at how I am steering the site. Today we are going to get into my Q1 struggle.

STH Q1 2022: What is STH?

This is perhaps the most meta-question one can ask and I think it is highly deserved in Q1. Personally I have been struggling with how do we define STH going forward. Traditionally we have been considered “press” by many companies. Over the last few years that has become a more challenging classification and I thought I would just explain why.

In the industry there are basically a few types of outlets that deliver information from organizations to audiences. I usually use the categories of press analyst “white paper house” and influencers in the data center IT realm. Here is my quick breakdown:

Press – The general model is that companies and industry organizations send news via a press release (PR.) News sites generally take the PR and either wholesale repost it add a few lines to a press release or write an original copy covering the press release. This can also include things like interviews. Most of the activities for traditional “press” one can write a story over a cup or two of coffee without ever leaving a chair in the world of Zoom.

Analysts – Generally these are folks that are retained by companies to provide third-party perspectives that will be placed in other media outlets. They also often do paid engagements for specific activities such as white papers or video work.

They also often do paid engagements for specific activities such as white papers or video work. “White paper houses” – Traditionally these have been white papers but now they can be videos or other collateral. These firms usually do a sponsored piece to show that one company’s offering is better than another company’s offering. Usually distribution for these is the responsibility of the sponsoring company.

These firms usually do a sponsored piece to show that one company’s offering is better than another company’s offering. Usually distribution for these is the responsibility of the sponsoring company. Influencers – Generally these are folks who have large followings on social media that are paid to present points of view to their audiences. There are many different ways that support is provided but that is the general model.

Our big challenge these days is our alignment between a press classification and what we actually do. I am going to use the Inspur NF5280M6 review as one example. Here is the video for that:

Also the recent AMD EPYC 7003X Milan-X launch piece is another good example (video here but let us save the embed space.)

A Process to Make STH Content

In our normal article where we have a video involved we have to:

Arrange to get a product from whatever source Receive the product and unpack it Validate the test part/ system’s operation Test the part/ system Do photography of the part/ system Capture B-roll of the part/ system Capture the main talking head video and audio Edit the video Write a piece for the STH main site Edit the written piece Publish on the STH site including adding metadata and pushing out the review Publish on YouTube including adding metadata and linking that elsewhere Decommission part/ system Pack and ship part/ system

Even after that entire 14-step process we are not including indirect background work. This also assumes that there are no troubleshooting or other steps involved in the process. For example with the EPYC 7773X piece we had to remove the old CPUs update the BIOS/ firmware of the test system and attend a morning to evening briefing on the chips as well. There is background prep work like maintaining a lab to test in having tests maintaining data maintaining applications and even just the site itself and so forth. Even after that we have not discussed using the forums the comments section (main site and YouTube) and social media to take and discuss questions. I am clearly missing a few steps but hopefully this shows the point here. Folks sometimes ask why we do not have full reviews with videos every day the above is the exact reason.

Facilities have become such an important part of the process for us as well. We have tested many 4x and 8x GPU systems over the years and with the next generation NVIDIA DGX H100 we will have single systems going over 10kW. 700W is not an upper limit for accelerators in the near future and I fully expect a high-end 2U dual-socket “average” server will be a 1.5kW box by the end of 2022. We also will need to invest in liquid cooling for our lab. Facing a 5-figure power bill keeping the lab going was a big reason for the move to Austin.

Is STH Traditional “Press”?

Given that general outline our challenge is that many in the industry treat us as “press” where a PR is sent and is wholesale reposted by thousands of sites in an automated fashion. That is why we always write our own news pieces and why I am very selective of what the team covers. Typically there is an industry of editors that works to tailor press releases and reporters that will come up with unique angles. Again there are interviews and unique musings about developments but generally this is very low cost content to create.

The “reviewers” that are press are largely a holdover before there was a concept of an “influencer”. There is also a fairly between most of the products we cover that are B2B versus most “review” press sites that are focused on B2C products. B2C review sites are usually geared towards buyer’s guide best of and our top-rated is now the cheapest ever on XYZ shop in order to generate affiliate revenue. In some organizations that focus on B2C segments reviewers are press but the intention is to drive huge traffic and get affiliate sales that can be 80%+ of a site’s revenue. B2C products that have large audiences have a simple formula because they can be sent a product or buy one review it and drive sales. On a 2% commission it is easy to drive 50+ sales and generate profits. This is a formula many influencers use today but it originated on the press side.

We are calling this “Press” because the term “media organization” gets very close to “publisher” and once there are multiple publications things get murky fast. Instead we are going to focus on the world of B2B publications we normally see grouped as “press” in what we cover.

Being very clear my little formula of “make a site that I would want to read” is expensive but it is also good. STH dwarfs the rest of the traditional hands-on review media in the data center and not usually by a 2:1 ratio in terms of page views but more like a 10:1 ratio or more. STH size-wise is more like a good size consumer/ gaming site even though we have virtually no demographics before folks enter the workforce. I do not want to read vendor-written content that is paid to be reposted on a site and is trying to look native even with a few disclaimers so I make it a rule that we will not post that stuff. We have lost advertisers for it (Albeit only temporarily because folks always come back due to the ROI they get advertising on STH.)

For the past few years we have had an external marketing firm handle all of the ads on STH. I think we have removed just about every non-STH-served ad that gets displayed on STH. It has been a rough process or a VERY rough process but we have done it. If you look at STH ads today and see server vendors not random fill ads we lose a few thousand dollars every month from the decision that I made that I would rather show white space rather than fill ads. Also at least once a day a firm asks if we can do auto-play video giant overlay or something of that nature. I told the external marketing firm: no. While this has been a tough process to get to where we are entering Q2 2022 it is about building a site I would want to visit as-is without ad blockers.

Generally the “press” model relies on advertisers to buy space and support a site (or affiliate revenue but that is less on the B2B side.) The way this model is set up is that (generally) a press site takes a PR reposts it with or without any additional insight. This usually costs only a few dollars even if a human is involved in writing a few sentences. If that post can get 5000 page views and sites can put 6-10 ads on a page with a 50% ad-block rate it generates 25000 impressions and maybe $20-100 in revenue. Paying $10-20 and having $20-100 come in is a simple model and lends itself to automation to lower the costs and increase throughput.

Just for some context if you are running a site with <2M-2.5M page views/ month it is very hard to sell direct advertising. If you cannot deliver $1-10M+ of advertising a quarter/ year it is almost impossible to sell direct advertising to large vendors because they do not want small advertising contracts because you are too small. STH is large enough to have an external firm sell direct advertising but we frankly cannot sell $10M of inventory a year. This behavior has led to publisher consolidation with companies like Future having huge amounts of ad inventory to sell to large companies but it also means individual sites lose control of the pervasiveness and invasiveness of ads. Although if any company wants to spend $10M/ year please reach out to the ad sales folks and I am sure they will sell you every banner that is on STH for the year. Even with that we will still only have the same ad spaces and guidelines we do today because I am not working on a site I would not want to visit as-is without ad blocks.

Also just as another behind-the-scenes insight we now have data on even the news pieces that Cliff writes for us (he actually writes articles based on news not just copy/paste reposts) versus our review content. Pageviews are much higher on reviews over time than news pieces.

The #1 challenge I face is PR folks asking why we will not cover something that they want to put out. My basic response is that if we just copy/paste a press release we will get no traffic and it is only there for historical posterity. Plus as a site I want to read there is no need for STH to copy and paste a press release. Search engines are good enough I will find the company’s release anyway.

From time to time we do interviews and we will cover launches but our main focus is always on being able to actually show hardware.

The press model is very different than what we do with hands-on reviews (or touring data centers.) Hopefully our readers understand that there is a different level of effort involved in reposting a press release with automation and flying somewhere doing something like this:

Also that is why you see fewer third-party press release videos. Video is more expensive to produce and slower to consume so other than a few bots press releases generally do not have a direct answer in video.

Is STH an Analyst Firm?

Some companies now in the industry see us more as “analysts.” The reasoning is that we do not just re-post press releases. At this point STH is probably more in the spirit of an analyst firm in terms of creating unique content (not re-posting news.) We also do not have annual retainers. Annual retainers are similar to what you would see in the legal profession for example. We do not pre-share pieces with vendors even if they are sponsors of STH and buy ad space. I see the ads so I know who is running ads but to STH we just get lump sum monthly payments from the external marketing firm so I do not know all of the details like the magnitude of the ad buys.

This structure is not what an analyst would use but I think it is still important for STH and the integrity of the site. STH will create content. Companies have an avenue (albeit indirect through ads) to support us. It is however going to be content that the STH team wants to make and it will be made so as not to offend my first principle of “would this be a site I want to read?”

Analysts also do behind-the-scenes work like messaging testing providing feedback before information or new campaigns go public. There is certainly more to it than just getting information out but STH is focused on the distribution side.

The other challenge with the “analyst” role for us is also distribution. Most analysts need to use other sites to reach audiences. At STH we have our own distribution that reaches a relatively huge audience on the written side and is growing on the video side. Of course if we did content on phones games cooking or music we would have a larger audience but about the furthest I am willing to go into that realm is network switches. My general theme is that what goes in or runs from a rack somewhere.

Is STH a White Paper House?

“White paper houses” have one aspect I admire. Some of these firms do absolutely awesome testing. Usually the awesome testing gets packaged in a document that the sponsor reviews and crafts. That usually means that the great testing gets significantly slanted towards the sponsor before publication. Frankly these firms have much larger budgets than we do and can spend weeks with a team on a piece.

The other challenge is that these “white paper houses” have limited distribution. Everyone knows that the awesome testing will be presented in a view favorable to the sponsor so it erodes trust and audience.

Just for some perspective we recently had a large networking vendor tell us that they usually use one of these “white paper houses” to do testing so there was no point in having reviews on STH since the existing company does better testing. My simple reply was “sure but you are spending $50-75K on that whitepaper and then you have to pay to have folks get it out to a small audience.” The fact is we still run on a relative shoestring budget and if we had $50K to work with on each piece we would have awesome testing as well. On the flip side my 2022 charge is that for any piece that we do video and/or web I expect to get no fewer than 10000 views. We may not hit it with every piece but that is the goal right now so I say no to anything I do not think will interest at least 10000 people on the STH main site or on YouTube. Those do not include the fact that we have many thousands of people on our weekly newsletter that I sit down and send every Saturday.

There are also websites that are out there in the enterprise IT space that have comparatively small audiences and are directly supported by vendors and allow vendors to pre-read and edit work before publication. Perhaps the majority do. Often these smaller sites get huge sums on the back-end for consulting work and yet present themselves as “press”. I think they are struggling with this model as well but do not have the audience for direct ad sales. Disclosures are weaker here but many of these sites are really “white paper houses” with limited distribution.

Given STH is designed to be hands-on like many “white paper houses” but with editorial independence and distribution behind it we do not fit in that model well.

Is STH an Influencer Shop?

“Influencers” and let me first say there is a huge range here typically are supported directly by companies they work with. With influencers there is a tacit agreement that vendors will provide support in exchange for driving an audience to a solution. We have already mentioned the affiliate model but one can see how influencers and traditional “press” organizations that rely on affiliate sales are similar.

I will just say there is a very popular WiFi switch and even now site security vendor that targets the SMB space. They sent an influencer NDA in order to review products. I was absolutely shocked when I read it. It gave the right to pre-review content and even restricted how we would work with other vendors. This was in exchange for getting “free” product to review. At first I was in complete shock thinking how could anyone sign this? I went to the company’s legal team and they were set that this was the standard one that influencers sign. It 100% makes me think less of many of the “reviews” of the company’s product on the Internet that are almost always glowing.

My response to this influencer NDA was simply that as an established site we never sign these types of agreements and that if we wish to cover the company’s products I would rather purchase units and have legitimate independent reviews than have those terms.

So now we are going to have an honest review series of the company’s products including switch products.

Influencers often now flock to video platforms that have their own traffic generation algorithms. What is very interesting for STH is that our overlap of STH readers to YouTube viewers is usually around 1-5%. This surprises a lot of folks but they are basically running as different audiences. Some may have noticed we have had experiments where we do not link the STH YouTube piece to the main site article or we delay linking. We also have experimented with publishing the video before the main site article just to validate. Effectively STH’s YouTube and main site readers are different audiences. Neither demographic has folks under 18 (usually <18 is 0.3% or less of our traffic) but YouTube is more slanted to a younger audience in our target 25-55 demographic.

In many ways though the “influencer” model actually would fit STH well. Most companies do not have minimum spends in the million-dollar range for influencers. It also would provide a direct avenue to be able to support STH. Remember we have huge power bills and running a lab to actually test gear that was up to 5kW in this generation and going up from there is not negligible. Most vendors in the industry already support STH because we need to keep the lab running even between server release cycles. The fact that STH is nearing 13 years old and the data center lab has gone from one rack in September 2015 to many racks now expanded into the fourth facility means folks understand what we do. The few companies that do not support STH the real challenge is that we cannot handle large advertising sums to hit their minimums.

Overall I actually think that the influencer model may work best for STH but it would be a huge shift and I am not willing to give up editorial independence.

So What is STH in 2022?

In a few weeks STH will turn 13 and there is no way that I could have predicted something that was a hobby would turn into my full-time work. Starting with my 2022 principles:

I will not give up the editorial independence of STH. Full stop.

We will always put our readers first taking a view of “is this a site I would visit if I knew all of the inner workings?”

We will continue to grow the main site and the YouTube channel. I want the YouTube channel to hit 100K subscribers this year and get to be >10% of the monthly views we get on the main site. (Subscribe now if you have not!)

I will continue to use the filter that every piece on the STH main site should have a 3+ minute average page view and at least 10000 views. If I do not think a piece can get that I will not greenlight it. That means no wholesale reposted press releases or vendor-written pieces.

We need to ramp facilities higher power servers coming in the late Q3 or Q4 2022 timeline and beyond. Hands-on testing is a crazy idea in 2022 but it is very important to what we do.

We are going to continue being ad-supported but I have said no to video ads margin ads that you click on when scrolling pages and so forth.

We also need to grow the team.

STH is bad at being press because I do filter to try getting only the most impactful piece online that we can every day. Our readers do not have unlimited time so I heavily curate with the team. Hands-on reviews are still a staple so we spend a lot to do those instead of inexpensive to produce pieces like press releases and interviews. A good press outlet would do the opposite of what we do and I have been told this by many publishing veterans.

STH is bad at being an analyst because we do hands-on with hardware and have our own distribution channels with audiences. Conceptually I do not have an issue with a company paying for STH’s time or supporting our lab but the line is clearly drawn at buying our thoughts. Those are not for sale. For example I sent a pre-read of this to Dr. Ian Cutress who was previously at Anandtech but is now an Analyst with More than Moore since he has operated in many of these realms. He gave insightful feedback that was incorporated into bits of this but what is here is ultimately how I want to frame the environment instead of being framed by any third party. A lot of what we do though can be considered in line with what analysts would do.

STH is bad at being a “white paper house” because we cannot do the same level of testing just due to budgetary constraints.

STH is bad at being an influencer organization because we like to maintain editorial independence. Sometimes we see bad things and we explicitly call them out because it is the right thing to do. Pieces that traditional influencers/ smaller sites in domains will not post would be like Lenovo Vendor Locking Ryzen-based Systems with AMD PSB Dude this should NOT be in a Dell Switch or HPE Supercomputers and Discussing Low WD Red Pro NAS Hard Drive Endurance Ratings. The reason many sites that should have figured out and told those stories did not is that they are impacted by the conflict of doing right by users with their revenue from companies. I firmly believe we need to try to do what is best for our readers and that is what drives STH’s growth. We need support from vendors to operate but they cannot pay to control my thoughts. Frankly they do not have the budget for that. I do recognize that is a privilege I have but it is something that makes STH unique in many ways.

In summary we really do not fit into buckets and that is a big problem. It makes it difficult to interface with companies that have PR departments analyst relations departments influencer relations departments and technical marketing teams. We span all four in some respects yet do not fit neatly into any of them.

With that the big question is: which bucket should we be in when discussing STH? Maybe my answer is changing. STH has been around for long enough that maybe the answer is whichever fits so long as we do not compromise on our key principles.

My question may sound guided by “wokeness” by some but can STH declare it is “non-binary”? I think we have a direction and we have an identity in the industry for STH. At this point can we be part press analyst white paper house and influencer without solely picking one bucket? Even companies in the industry treat us as some combination of all four. At this point I struggle with seeing how we fit in one bucket and the best STH frankly does not. We are unique in the industry and part of that is by stubbornly saying we are not solely one of the above.

Final Words

This quick letter is now going to be a 4000-word essay. Perhaps the underlying message is that there is someone and a team behind STH that is driving a vision of an independent site that does high-end data center reviews (along with fun segments like edge networking and 1L corporate desktop PCs.)

We are far from perfect. We constantly make mistakes and try to do the best we can. When NVIDIA sponsored the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti giveaway it took some time to do some soul searching on actually doing a giveaway (that I do not like because I do not think they build “real” audiences) and getting something useful to our readers that is in high demand. Little struggles like this I have every week. At the same time I want folks to know that what they read on STH see on our YouTube and get every week in their newsletter inboxes is created by people not just a mindless press release re-posting bot. Our readers deserve better.

“It’s kind of hard to imagine it yet. I don’t think for most of us it feels very real. It’s more like a long weekend and we haven’t seen him yet"" said Bev Dawson a Clouatre family friend.

MTN News / Mitch Lagge Clouatre family friend Bev Dawson speaks with MTN News in Livingston on Sunday.

Clouatre was out hiking with a friend on Thursday when the two separated temporarily and Clouatre never made it back to their designated meeting place. Search efforts were started that night and authorities found Clouatre's body the next day.

Bev Dawson is a regular hiking partner with Craig’s wife Jamie who is now responsible for raising the family’s four kids ranging in age from 14 to nine.

Other than being an avid outdoorsman who hiked hundreds of backcountry miles Dawson said Clouatre was a force of positivity throughout the region delivering food to restaurants from Cooke City to Wilsall and all over Livingston for Sysco before getting another food distribution job with Shamrock Foodservice more recently.

“His trademark would be his smile and the way he brought light to people. Always positive even when things were in the dumps for him he boosted the folks around him and that’s a huge thing to do without"" Dawson said.

This isn’t the first time the Clouatre family has dealt with tragedy. The community rallied around the family in January 2020 when their Livingston home was demolished in a fire. They just moved into a new place about nine months ago.

“It’s really important that people remember them. Jamie is on her own now with those kids and she’s going to need a lot of help for a long time coming"" Dawson said.

While Craig worked Jamie was able to stay at home and homeschool their four kids. Now that might have to change Dawson said.

A GoFundMe account has been set up to benefit the Clouatres that has so far raised $67000 of its $75000 goal as of Sunday afternoon. Click here to visit the page. An account for cash and check donations has been set up at American Bank in Livingston. If you donate make sure to note the money is for the Clouatre family.

While the pain from the loss is still raw Dawson said she hopes other people won’t be afraid to spend time outdoors.

“All of my people and Craig’s people are outdoor people. We’re going to continue to be out in the wilderness. It fuels us. It feeds us. It’s like air and you have to breathe it. I’m sure we’re all going to be extra loud in the woods and maybe we’ll curtail the places we go or going along. But I know it’s not going to stop anybody I know from going out"" Dawson said.

P.H. Hanes founder of the textile mill that would eventually become HanesBrands came up with it in the 1920s. That allowed him to use adverts in publications across America to deter distributors from gouging buyers of his knitted under garments. Even today many American shopkeepers hew to manufacturers’ recommended prices as much as they would love to raise them to offset the inflationary pressures on their other costs. A growing number though resort to more sophisticated pricing techniques.

A seminal study from 2010 by McKinsey a consultancy estimated that raising prices by 1% without losing sales can boost operating profits by 8.7% on average. Getting this right can be tricky. Set prices too high and you risk losing customers; set them too low and you leave money on the table. Retailers have historically used rules of thumb such as adding a fixed margin on top of costs or matching what competitors charge. As energy labour and other inputs go through the roof they can no longer afford to treat pricing as an afterthought.",,,,,,,,,

The Los Fresnos Rodeo Committee announced the grant Thursday during an impromptu ceremony celebrating the grant as a big boost to the Los Fresnos economy the Los Frenos PRCA Rodeo and the county fair and livestock show.

“The Hometown Grant from T-Mobile is truly a blessing for the Los Fresnos Rodeo. The grant will allow us to make improvements to the grounds that will help us reduce expenses and allow us to have more events during the year that bring families together in our area” Larry Cantu Los Fresnos Rodeo chairman said.

“As many of you know we had a fantastic rodeo this year three days of sold-out performances that brought many families from throughout our community the county and the Rio Grande Valley to Los Fresnos” Cantu said. “We pride ourselves on having a family fun event that helps us raise funds toward scholarships for graduating seniors not only in Los Fresnos but for our graduating seniors throughout Cameron County.”

He said the scholarship process had already started for the coming year and that the rodeo committee had recently approved 20 scholarships of $1000 each for this year’s graduating seniors. In addition the rodeo donated funds to the Los Fresnos Little League and the Leo Aguilar Foundation.”

Los Fresnos was one of 25 communities nationwide chosen by T-Mobile to receive the Hometown Grants awards for smaller communities to make infrastructure and other improvements.

Hector Vargas a T-Mobile representative in the Valley said the grant was in conjunction with T-Mobile’s commitment to upgrade its wireless network to 5G which he called the future of internet connectivity. He said the Los Fresnos area is already largely 5G with 5G connectivity stretching east to Port Isabel South Padre Island and Raymondville.

Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino said the grant would improve the quality of life for Los Fresnos and Cameron County residents.

“This grant will assist with building a new and permanent stage where more performances concerts events and fun activities will take place and be enjoyed by our children families and all the communities in Cameron County and South Texas. We’re very excited to hear about this awarded grant in Los Fresnos — a small town with a big pride — in bringing a great rodeo year after year. Thanks T-Mobile and congratulations to our rodeo” Trevino said in a statement.

During the ceremony Cantu credited his mother Mercedes Cantu with helping lay the groundwork that eventually led to the Los Fresnos Rodeo as it is today and to Thursday’s announcement.

Mercedes Cantu present at Thursday’s ceremony is a founding member of the Los Fresnos Rodeo Committee and it’s only female past president said Darlene Pederson the committee’s current associate director.

After the ceremony she sat under a tent set up for the event talking to Los Fresnos area Cameron County Commissioner David Garza and Mercedes Cantu. She said finding out about the grant made her proud of Los Fresnos and its rodeo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90ZWNoL2NvbHVtbmlzdHMvMjAyMi8wMy8yNy81LWctYW5kLWNhcnMtd2hhdC10by1leHBlY3QvNzE2Nzc3ODAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5G and cars: What can high-speed internet do for your ride?,"Bob O'Donnell

Special to USA TODAY

After years of innovation in the world of smartphones PCs and tablets there is a new tech gadget leader: the car. In fact key chip companies that have powered those devices for years – including Nvidia Qualcomm and Intel’s Mobileye division – are now putting some of their most advanced technology efforts toward the automotive market announcing carmaker partnerships at a dizzying rate.

Cellular connectivity has also been an important driver in the evolution of cars for many years now having been used to deliver everything from map updates to emergency services to over-the-air car feature updates. (This is a fact that owners of some older cars may have only recently painfully discovered when AT&T recently shutdown its 3G networks. T-Mobile and Verizon are soon to follow on that front.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMjcvdXMvbW9iaWxlLWhvbWUtcGFyay1vd25lcnNoaXAtY29zdHMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investors Are Buying Mobile Home Parks.

But just six months after she moved in the plot of land and all of the stability and comfort that came with it seemed suddenly ripped out from under her.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Representatives from T-Mobile presented Selma Mayor James Perkins Jr. with a check for $49050 in a ceremony held Thursday afternoon at Riverfront Park.

The money comes from T-Mobile’s Hometown Grants an initiative where the company pledged to donate $25 million to support small towns across the United States in the next five years. Each quarter the company selects 25 small towns to provide funds meant to spearhead a variety of community development endeavors.

“On behalf of the City of Selma I acknowledge being the recipient of this grant” Perkins said. “We’re just proud to be one of 25 communities that T-Mobile has chosen to assist with this kind of community quality of life grant. We thank T-Mobile for its commitment … I would hope many other corporations would follow your model your lead and do the same thing.”

Danard Watts Rural Market Manager for T-Mobile presented the check to Perkins.

“T-Mobile wants to be part of the community and help small towns thrive” Watts said.

Perkins said T-Mobile can know for certain the City of Selma will put this grant to use upgrading facilities at the park.

“There’s a lot of great work that we can do with this” he said.

Dr. Denisha Hendricks spoke about how the grant money would be used.

“This grant was specifically used for the enhancement of Riverfront Park” she said. “It’s going to include things such as trash receptacles picnic tables and shade awnings. There’s going to be some enhancements to the Evans Building utilizing the outdoor space of the George Evans Building.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5leHRwaXQuY29tL25vdGhpbmctY2FybC1wZWktaHlwZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nothing's Carl Pei has reeled us in and he better live up to all his hype,"Nothing the new brand of Carl Pei the ex-manager of OnePlus is a bit like the new NFT trend on the tech market. But behind the hype business the imperative to meet very high expectations and keep crazy promises are starting to be felt. Come on Carl stop blowing smoke here.

I've been back from vacation for less than a week and here I am already scribbling yet another rant. This time I'm going to vent a bit about Nothing and the non presentation of the Nothing phone (1). It's undeniable that Carl Pei has succeeded - brilliantly - in turning the brains of many people in the tech industry. He matrixed us as the young people would say (of which I'm still part for at least the next two years).

Building on his past successes with OnePlus while making a lot of money but really a lot of money in terms of marketing Nothing knows perfectly how to maintain his cool factor. It's a bit like the new kid on the block who pretends to be too stylish without even trying. But this hype business essentially fed by the confidence of fans who ""invest"" in this brand image is not a sustainable model.

Nothing needs to stop talking and start showing something concrete. That 20-minute keynote to tell us that they are going to announce something in a few months and that it's going to be super cool I mean c'mon!

Come on Carl show me Something Anything

We come back to my parallel with NFT in the intro although it's a bit crude and partially inaccurate. Nothing at the moment has only one product in its catalog: a pair of true wireless headphones. When you hear Carl Pei say in the quietest of terms that his company aims to be ""the most compelling alternative to Apple in regards to ecosystem"" you rub your ears (yes your ears).

People who like me I admit are hyped about Nothing are hyped because of the concept of ambient organic technology that integrates seamlessly into our environment and daily lives is fascinating. But we're talking about a potential not something concrete. Everything depends on the confidence of investors and their faith in Nothing's ability to deliver.

And I'm not talking about the big money that injected 70 million dollars into Nothing during its last fundraising round earlier this month. No I'm talking about you and me the consumers who believe in the concept or at least hope it will come to fruition. As with NFTs this projected value this confidence is extremely fluctuating and as soon as Nothing starts to be a bit more boring a bit less cool the hype might fade.

During MWC 2022 before Nothing ""announced"" its phone (1) I had a conversation with Akis Evangelidis Nothing's co-founder and marketing director. And I found a lot of the language used during this interview in Carl Pei's keynote this week.

""It's a little frustrating for us because we had to wait a year until we could say what Nothing really is. It was a matter of finding the right balance. For us the vision of Nothing is much broader than just an audio brand."" Carl Pei came out with almost exactly the same thing. But the fact is we still don't know what Nothing really is.

That's all Nothing has shown of its phone (1) so far / © Nothing

We really don't need a new OnePlus please

However the comparison with NFT stops pretty quickly since I don't think Nothing is a pump and dump absolutely not. In that case we would talk about manipulating a market by artificially inflating the value of an asset (here the Nothing brand) with false statements.

This is a very common practice with NFTs or altcoins that are hyped by influencers and lose all their value after their creators sell all their shares and make a ""rug pull"" aka they spin-off to the UK (well Nothing is based in the UK but that doesn't mean anything).

No we know that Nothing will indeed present its smartphone this summer. The manufacturer made a whole keynote to announce it. And the Nothing Ear (1) sold like hotcakes (400000 units). They didn't really reflect the revolutionary concept that the brand wants to carry in my opinion but it was a product with an excellent quality/price ratio and that worked very well.

Affiliate offer Nothing ear (1)

In fact the brand borrows many elements of its product strategy from OnePlus at its peak. The first phones of both brands have very similar names OnePlus One and Nothing phone (1). Nothing offers competitive prices like OnePlus which practically invented the concept of flagship-killer. We can also note a work on the design to make it iconic and very calculated marketing mainly based on earned media (basically indirect advertising the more people are hyped the more they talk about the brand and give it free advertising like me with this article).

However I think or at least I hope that Carl Pei has learned from his experience at OnePlus. Nothing has clearly more ambitions than OnePlus and above all the brand is independent unlike OnePlus which is more and more involved in Oppo's catalog.

But like OnePlus Nothing has a vocation to become mainstream. How to remain the cool niche brand when you become a big player? Here again Akis Evangelidis was a bit on the fence when I asked him the question at MWC. ""There is no conscious decision to be niche we want to make a product that we are passionate about. From there what happens if we sell millions or billions of them only the market will tell and judge us.""

At least Nothing has the merit of being independent and Carl Pei has a free hand to implement his vision / © NextPit

A transparent design is not enough

My biggest fear is that so far Nothing still hasn't managed to explain how the concept of ambient technology will translate into products concretely. Because transparent headphones or smartphones are fine for five minutes but not enough. What is going to make Nothing's ecosystem more organic and ambient than others? If it's a slightly faster Bluetooth pairing between the earbuds (1) and the phone (1) I'm going to seriously bitch about it.

I know I'm bitching before I've even seen the phone (1). But it's been a year that we've been hearing about ambient computing I want to see more. Aki Evangelidis made me dream by telling me the starting idea of Nothing. ""The idea is that you get up in the morning you have your coffee and you have some aggregated content on the table that you can look at. Then you go into the bathroom to brush your teeth and that content follows you you can see a sleep report with the info measured by your connected bed and it's all done like nothing [got it?] happened.""

But all of this is a very long-term vision as the executive told me. For now the focus is on design and user experience. The Nothing phone (1) should also inaugurate Nothing OS the Android overlay of the manufacturer supposed to lay the foundation stone of this ecosystem more open and interoperable. ""We already have the ecosystem we just need the right UX to connect us to that ecosystem in a more intuitive way.""

Regardless Nothing still has everything to work with. The concept has a lot of promise and the company seems to want to do things right by starting out on a solid foundation both financially and ""philosophically."" I can't wait to see what the Nothing phone (1) will do but I'm convinced that this hype strategy is far too ephemeral and volatile to be viable in the long term.

I wish Nothing to succeed in consolidating its brand image by offering us quality products at fair prices. I don't care if they are transparent or not sold in limited series and payable in BTC. So this is what it means to be a boomer?"

Companies with high profits and revenue per employee are presumed to be the most successful. Alphabet Microsoft and Meta Platforms owner of Facebook are such companies. These tech companies are among the largest in the United States based on revenue and they are among the youngest large companies. Several were founded in the past 25 years. However a group of relatively small companies leads the list of highest profit per employee.

Data for the recent “Profit per Employee” research paper from software company Tipalti came from the Fortune 500. The paper examined 914 major companies most of which made a profit per employee in the last year. Only 238 reported a loss per employee. The company that has the most profits per employee is Air Lease. The company reported $516 million in profits or $4.3 million per employee.

Air Lease with an employee count of 120 buys passenger planes and leases them to airlines. The process allows carriers that do not have capital access to planes. Air Lease makes its profit largely off the interest it charges these carriers. The company was hurt by the trouble with the aviation industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic but its financials have started to recover.

When the company announced its 2021 results John L. Plueger chief executive officer and president commented: “We had a strong fourth quarter and second half of 2021 that benefited from continuing airline industry recovery as seen in our cash collections operating metrics fleet expansion and record lease placement.”

Air Lease owns 474 planes that it leases to 118 customers in 60 countries. The company is based in Los Angeles. (See if Air Lease is also among the 50 best companies to work for.)

To find the 50 companies with the most profits per employee 24/7 Wall St. reviewed Tipalti’s “Profit per Employee” research paper. Very few of the companies with the highest profit per employee are large tech companies. Meta is highest among these ranking 11th with a profit of nearly $500000 per employee based on over 58000 workers. Several financial firms are ahead of Meta.

Mortgage giant Fannie Mae has profit of $1.5 million per employee based on 7700 workers. This places it second on the list. The third is private equity firm KKR at $1.3 million per employee based on 1583 workers. (Find out if any of the companies on this list were also among the most innovative companies in 2021.)

TTWO,Take-Two Interactive,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNnbWFnb25saW5lLmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvZ2FtZS9ncmFuZC10aGVmdC1hdXRvLXYtc2VyaWVzLXgtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grand Theft Auto V (Xbox Series X) Review,"Eight long years after the release of Grand Theft Auto V and its live-service multiplayer component which has grown not only to overshadow but to subsume it almost entirely GTA Online; it’s no exaggeration to say that Rockstar Games’ magnum opus of criminal action-adventure is indisputably the most successful immersive open-world game ever created and it doesn’t appear as though it will be relinquishing that claim to the throne anytime soon. And yes that’s in large part thanks to multi-gen repeat purchasers like me.

Case in point despite never having actually completed Grand Theft Auto V’s gargantuan single-player campaign in the traditional sense when I consider all the time I’ve invested in the title over the course of three generations of console hardware two competing platforms and two separate online character profiles I estimate that I’ve played enough Grand Theft Auto V to roll credits on the game’s Story Mode at least three times over.

Well I’ve just come up for air after playing several days’ worth of Rockstar’s current gen console remaster of Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online for Xbox Series X and if the subheading didn’t already make it obvious the many improvements and enhancements that have been brought to bear on this title will once again will have both veteran players and newcomers alike happily shelling out money to experience the world of Los Santos and Blaine County whether it’s their very first time or a return visit.

Heath Ledger’s Joker once said “If you’re good at something never do it for free” and that philosophy continues to guide the decisions of Rockstar and its parent company Take 2 Interactive when it comes to this remaster. Despite the combined last-gen console install base of Grand Theft Auto V on PS4 and Xbox One hovering well over 25 million copies as of this writing this new remaster is not being offered as a free or paid upgrade patch for those versions.

“The ability to finally be able to play both Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online at a vivid blistering 1440p60 alone is the dream realized.”

Instead the complete package (Story Mode and Online) is being sold as a new standalone product that will cost those interested between $24.99 CAD and $49.99 CAD depending on which current-gen platform it’s purchased on and when it’s purchased (the game is currently on a 50% discount until June 15th). Due to a pre-existing arrangement between Rockstar and PlayStation however PS+ subscribers can claim the game sans-story mode at no additional cost during the sale period while Series X owners can buy it outright for only $12.50 CAD on sale.

Account Migration in GTA Online allows for a free one-time import of a single-player game save from one’s last-gen console as well as a one-time import of a GTA Online profile from last gen and these transfers can be completed either within the same console family or even across console platforms. For example I was able to bring in my most recent Xbox One campaign game-save and continued right where I left off years ago in Story Mode but for my GTA Online profile I imported my older PS4 account which I originally imported from the Xbox 360 version way back in 2014 as I had played that account for much longer and thus had more than double the progression.

Both migrations were surprisingly quick and painless to complete though it should be noted that things will go much faster if you have already linked your Xbox and/or PlayStation accounts to Rockstar Games Social Club and have previously uploaded your GTA Online profile to Rockstar’s servers. Also it’s important to know that account migration to GTA Online is one-way and permanent. In other words any profiles imported to GTA Online are erased from their previous source and can no longer be played on those older platforms. With that in mind it’s probably best to migrate your account to the next-gen platform where all your favourite GTAO-playing friends are.

If you are instead starting over just for the heck of it or are diving into GTA Online for the first time ever you’ll be glad to know that Rockstar has done a commendable job of making the complicated affair of onboarding into the world of GTA Online much easier than in past console generations. Instead of dumping you directly into Story Mode or Online upon first boot the game warmly greets you with a colourful splash screen that first prompts you to create a new character and then instantly rewards you with $4000000 to start up your criminal enterprise with.

From there players are presented with the “Career Builder” menu screen that presents four options Executive Gunrunner Nightclub Owner or Biker each of which ties directly to one of GTA Online’s main Criminal Career expansions. Players can then use some or all their cash to set up their base of operations a warehouse one or more starting vehicles and a selection of weapons.

After designing their avatar in the game’s character creator and completing the brief streamlined tutorial for their career path players are free to continue building their enterprise or go completely off the golden path to participate in the countless other activities that Los Santos has to offer. There are activities such as Classic and Featured Heists the new “Contract” expansion starring GTA V’s Franklin and guest-starring Dr. Dre the underground racing world of Los Santos Tuners or any of the 40+ content updates that GTA Online has brought to its platform since it launched almost a decade ago with Rockstar promising more updates to come. The Career Builder appears to be a great way to provide some direction and goals for both new and returning players that might otherwise be intimidated by the sheer abundance of things to do in GTA Online but if totally random chaos is your poison there’s always Freemode.

“The most significant update Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online now bring to the next-gen table is easily the introduction of three graphics display modes…”

Moving on to presentation the most significant update Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online now bring to the next-gen table is easily the introduction of three graphics display modes Fidelity Performance RT and Performance offering a long-awaited level of versatility and player choice for display options that up until this point could only be enjoyed in the last-gen PC version.

Fidelity targets full 4K (3840x2160p) resolution at a locked 30 frames-per-second with Ray-Traced shadows Performance RT targets 1440p (2560x1440p) at 60fps with Ray-Traced Shadows also and Performance swaps out the RT shadows for the more traditional” approximated” variety in a bid to deliver an even more rock-solid 60fps framerate at 1440p. What’s even more impressive is how quickly players can switch between these modes on the fly via the settings menu without any loading.

I’ve always been a huge advocate for 60fps framerate in most if not all 3D games due to the more fluid and realistic feeling the feature can provide so it should come as no surprise that Performance RT quickly became my preferred setting after only a few minutes of tinkering with all three modes during gameplay. The 4K visuals of the Fidelity mode are strikingly razor sharp but in my opinion the 30fps framerate although consistent is still too heavy a price to pay when combined with GTA’s infamously floaty controls resulting in a sluggish “last-gen feel” in terms of responsiveness. This isn’t to say that the Performance and Performance RT modes visually eliminate Grand Theft Auto V’s trademark floatiness by any means but they do go a long way towards reducing the input lag while offering a more vivid and lifelike presentation.

I was also surprised at how much of a difference that the RT shadows made during my playthroughs. Traced primarily from the sun’s position in the sky GTA Online’s Performance RT mode boasts some of the most natural-looking shadows I’ve seen in a videogame and thanks to the game’s day-night cycle and much of its activities taking place in outdoor environments the effect has much more of a visual impact than one might expect. Shadows will shift and move around vehicles NPCs and your character depending on the placement of the sun and other primary sources and when operating a flying vehicle such as a helicopter one can even see the larger shadow of said vehicle cast accurately on the distant ground below based on the same principle.

Even more mundane examples left me gob-smacked such as the license plate of my custom vehicle becoming partially obscured in shadows cast by raised areas of the car chassis or my player character similarly getting swallowed up by naturally occurring shadows when walking in the shade of a nearby building. In short it’s well worth having Performance RT mode enabled as opposed to straight Performance as there’s barely a noticeable hit to framerate for what you’re getting. Pair Performance RT Mode with a VRR-capable panel and it’s practically perfect.

As one should expect of a paid Grand Theft Auto V remaster in 2022 the above effects are backed up by several other welcome improvements including impeccable cube-mapped reflections on cars that could easily pass for ray-traced ones pinpoint 3D surround sound gorgeous weather particle fire and explosion effects longer draw distances and captivating neon-bathed night driving that will instill the reckless need for speed in the heart of just about any gamer and that’s just scratching the surface of what I’ve experienced thus far.

And then there are the load times! The initial boot on Grand Theft Auto V’s Story Campaign used to take over two full excruciating minutes to load on Xbox One and PS4 but in GTA Online the process only takes around 20 seconds and swapping between Michael Trevor and Franklin in Story Mode takes only seven. It’s a miraculous achievement by both legacy and last-gen Grand Theft Auto V standards. Load times are noticeably faster for the larger online component of GTA Online as well but as that element of the game is dependent on a connection to Rockstar’s cloud servers players can still expect to experience longer load times (upwards of a full minute) when transitioning in and out of multiplayer missions like Heists.

It’s much better than the several-minute-wait on last-gen consoles but still long enough to make me fearful of the game suddenly crashing and losing my progress. Thankfully apart from one lone Heist Finale falling apart thanks to a crew member that glitched out with the getaway chopper I didn’t encounter any severe or annoying bugs online or off a stark contrast from my previous GTA Online experiences.

I remember becoming quite disenchanted with Grand Theft Auto V and Rockstar after the Xbox One X came and went without a proper performance update to enable the game to take advantage of that console’s more powerful hardware and even when the remaster for current gen consoles was announced in May of last year I was still skeptical that I would ever return. Gratefully however Rockstar has since put their best foot forward and I can now say with confidence that the final product is indeed a top-notch re-release that is far far better than a simple performance patch and well worth its current discounted price.

For me the ability to finally be able to play both Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online at a vivid blistering 1440p60 alone is the dream realized. Trust me once you’ve played them with such fidelity just like your imported saves there is no going back. The PS5 version can keep its extra DualSense features and Rockstar has already promised a super-duper PC version of this remaster down the road but it will be on my Series X where I will ultimately conclude my 8-year long criminal journey.

Recap the previous and following episodes and other seasons.

The maternity clinic is holding regular testing for cervical cancer and it alerts the nurses to another disease: scabies. While it is easily treatable it’s highly contagious so the nurses begin checking schools for an outbreak and set up a treatment clinic.

Janis Cowper doesn’t have scabies but she may have cervical cancer so Dr. Turner refers her for more detailed testing. It’s unfortunate timing: it is her first wedding anniversary and she and her husband Philip are eager to start having children. She doesn’t tell Philip about the test and then avoids her appointment to receive her diagnosis fearing the worst.

Sister Frances seeks her out at home and delivers the report personally: Janis has cancer. She will have to have a hysterectomy; she will never be able to have children. When Janis tries to tell Philip he assumes she is pregnant and leaves overjoyed to tell his friends. He returns with flowers and Janis tells him about the cancer. You can leave me she says; I have let you down.

Vivien Thomson has no problem having children. Her fourth is due soon and she isn’t too interested in Lucille’s help—she’s quite independent. She managed to take time off work and its needed wages to have the baby by “helping along” a hole in the ceiling of her slum apartment; the landlord paused her rent instead of fixing the hole.

But money is still tight as evidenced by the nabbing of her devoted son Antony for shoplifting diapers and other goods for the coming baby to his mother’s horror. Her eldest son and first husband have both spent time in prison and she struggled with alcohol until she met her youngest son’s father; she fears the social worker who follows up on the shoplifting will disrupt her family.

The social worker visits Lucille for her opinion of Vivien. She wants to enroll Vivien in a local council program for contraception to prevent a “problem” family like the Thomsons from growing any more lest Vivien can’t take care of all her children. She asks Lucille to bring up the program to Vivien.

Against her better judgment Lucille does—and immediately loses Vivien’s trust. Angry Vivien admits that her husband the father of her coming baby walked out when he found out she was pregnant. She can’t let the social worker know she is a single mother or she might lose her children.

Lucille goes home and vigorously cleans her apartment fearful that she or Cyril will get scabies and be judged for it just as Vivien has been judged by outsiders. But the disease touches all: Matthew Aylward gets it to Nancy’s amusement. Who knew posh people could have it? she laughs teasing him. Trixie checks up on him once he recovers and he urges her to come visit her and his son.

Unfortunately scabies has also reached the Thomson home. Vivien buys bleach to clean her apartment and then her water breaks. Against his mother’s will Antony calls Lucille to help. Lucille immediately realizes that Vivien has scabies and tells her it’s nothing to be ashamed of. She apologizes for trying to interfere with Vivien’s life and choices then sets to work calming Vivien down—Vivien has become stressed by the thought that the social worker will take away her children.

Lucille reassures encourages and praises Vivien throughout her labor while Antony sits by in support. A healthy baby girl is born. But when Lucille arrives for a postpartum check-up the social worker is there trying to order Vivien to take contraception. Lucille angrily tells her to leave for privacy during the checkup.

Miss Higgins has always enjoyed her privacy and independent life like Vivien. One day she arrives uncharacteristically late to the clinic clearly rattled. She had woken to find her living room ransacked a window broken: her apartment had been burgled while she slept. She is afraid to go home so she stays at Nonnatus House sharing a room with Nurse Crane. That night she sleeps clutching her purse and screams and brandishes the candlestick when Crane hears her rustling in the dark and asks after her. Her home has been violated; she’s not sure she can ever go back.

However Miss Higgins’ criticisms particularities and odd ideas of gratitude—such as treating everyone to a recorder recital— soon have the midwives wanting her to find a new place to live. After being criticized by Sisters Julienne and Monica Joan for calling Miss Higgins old Nancy manages to bond some with her learning that she is having trouble adapting to living with others and being cared for.

When the midwives finally admit to each other that they are fed up but are reluctant to broach the topic of new lodging with Miss Higgins Nancy advises them all to be blunt: they can’t coddle Miss Higgins and prevent her from returning to her independent life.

Indeed when Nurse Crane shyly informs Miss Higgins that Sister Julienne has secured Barbara and Tom’s cottage next to Nonnatus House for her Miss Higgins is relieved. You’re all quite impossible to live with she tells Nurse Crane listing everyone’s foibles.

Lucille and Cyril visit Violet to secure Vivien her independence arguing that the council shouldn’t be trying to force contraception onto under-resourced mothers: it must be the women’s choice. The three of them—a nurse minister and councilwoman—send a letter to Vivien’s social worker and she removes Vivien from her list of clients. Vivien may not want another child anyway—but now she can decide for herself. And the hole in her ceiling? Fred and Cyril fix it for her.

Philip longs for children but can’t tell Janis that. He comes to Dr. Turner for advice when Janis refuses to go to a pre-surgery appointment and Dr. Turner tells him he can think about adoption later but for now must simply try to support Janis. Finding her at a café after she again disappears Philip reassures her that he loves her and they still have a life together: it will just be different from what they imagined.

Janis begins to accept her diagnosis donating toys she had kept for a future child to the maternity clinic and telling Sister Frances that she’s thinking of becoming a hairdresser. She will look to the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9uYXRpb25hbC1zZWN1cml0eS9pbnRlcmFjdGl2ZS8yMDIyL3dvbWVuLXBvbGljZS1uZWJyYXNrYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Female officers change police culture in Chief Ken Clary's Bellevue Nebraska department - Washington Post,"Officer Brandy Valdez one of 15 women on the city’s 103-person force in Bellevue Neb. works an overnight shift in February.

BELLEVUE Neb. — Officer Karen Wrigley’s pink nails tapped her body camera as she stepped from her cruiser into the cold. “You want to open up the door?” she asked the middle-aged Black man sitting in a parked minivan. “You’ve got an arrest warrant.”

The man had a criminal record for assault and other offenses had run from Bellevue police before and was wanted for missing a court date for a traffic violation. He had no interest in returning to jail. “That’s horses---!” he cried as Wrigley and her colleagues asked him 11 times over 15 minutes to exit the vehicle.

Wrigley who is White never raised her voice. She got on the phone with his lawyer through a cracked-open driver’s-side window — a window she had the right to bash in given the circumstances. As reality set in the man smoked two cigarettes and cursed his luck. He finally exited the car remarking that he was freezing.

“Yep us too” Wrigley said handcuffing him. “Just to let you know others aren’t going to be as nice as me.”

Wrigley 35 is one of a slew of female officers hired over the past year and a half in this suburb south of Omaha part of a deliberate strategy by Police Chief Ken Clary to reduce the likelihood of misconduct and excess violence on the force.

Jess Manning center talks with fellow officers Feb. 7 about an incident in a restaurant parking lot where a person with mental illness was said to have a gun. That person was taken to the Bellevue police station for questioning.

Valdez takes notes after conducting a field sobriety test on a woman who was pulled over on Feb. 6. She is flanked by Bellevue police colleagues Matt Vetter left and Andrew Jansen.

Clary a former Iowa state trooper believes the research and his own experience both of which tell him diversity makes for better policing and decreases the use of force against civilians especially those who are Black. He’s rewritten the department’s rule book and promoted an officer to become head of recruiting with an eye toward adding more women and police officers of color and making sure they stick around.

It’s too early to see significant changes in data generated by the 103-officer department. But officers say the personnel efforts have helped usher in a culture shift which experts say is the key to long-lasting change.

Outsiders seem to be noticing. This winter seeking to understand the police hiring climate in a post-George Floyd world Nebraska Fraternal Order of Police President Jim Maguire asked the state’s 225 law enforcement entities whether recruiting was up or down. Each chief who responded said the number of applicants had shrunk dramatically. Except one: Clary. He told Maguire he had more applicants hoping to police the city of 53000 than ever before with officers transferring from departments as far as New Mexico. Many new arrivals were women.

There’s Wrigley who was inspired to become a cop as a teenager after watching the 2000 film “Miss Congeniality”; Brandy Valdez a former ballet dancer and maid who sought her badge after leaving what she calls a “patriarchal marriage” and has a talent for calming and reassuring victims of sexual assault; Chatelle Ogea a rookie officer former social worker and current Army reservist; and Pam Volk who resolved a recent dispute between a woman and her substance-abusing granddaughter by recounting her own experience living with an alcoholic.

Bellevue the third-largest city in Nebraska is experiencing “the complete opposite of what everybody else is dealing with” Maguire said. “I don’t know exactly how Chief Clary is doing it. But whatever magic wand he’s been able to use down there I would suspect that a bunch of other departments are going to try.”

A police chief’s evolution Officer Chatelle Ogea walks down a hallway lined with photos mostly of men who have been honored as the department’s officer of the year. Silhouette placeholders for future honorees suggest that many will be women.

As a captain for the Iowa State Patrol seven years ago Clary hadn’t given much thought to the dearth of women in policing (nationwide about 7 percent of state troopers are female). He did notice that the two women under his command drew citizen complaints far less than many of their male peers. In 2016 he attended the National Institute of Justice LEADS Scholars Program in Washington where he was introduced to a wealth of academic research indicating female officers excel at de-escalation and use force less frequently than male officers.

Between classes Clary struck up friendships with Ivonne Roman a Newark police officer who would go on to be a finalist for New York City police chief earlier this year and Maureen McGough an attorney who is chief of staff for the Policing Project at the New York University School of Law. Roman shared with Clary many of the obstacles she faced rising through the ranks in Newark. In a later conversation over lunch Clary shared with McGough a dawning realization.

“He looked at me and out of nowhere he said ‘Mo' we have got to figure out how to get the toxic masculinity out of policing’ ” she recalled. “And it was just like this moment of ‘who are you and how do I support you?’ ”

Clary was the first police chief to join the 30x30 Initiative launched by McGough Roman and others a year ago to push police departments to make their rosters at least 30 percent female by 2030. To date about 150 jurisdictions have signed on including New York City and this month D.C.

Ken Clary seated with recruiter Lisa Vetter at left took the reins of the Bellevue Police Department in 2020 with a view backed by research that diversity makes for better policing. The former Iowa state trooper prioritizes recruiting and retaining women and people of color.

But many others have been skeptical. Only seven of the 40 Midwestern law enforcement agencies Clary invited have signed up McGough said. And during a seminar while the initiative was in the planning stage a male chief told McGough and other organizers he was reluctant to hire women for fear they’d be sexually harassed by male officers and sue the department.

The women in the audience were incredulous.

“So not that he needed to address the behavior of the officers right?” McGough said in an interview. “We don’t want to deal with the sexual harassment suits that would come from a woman.”

Clary was hired in Bellevue to replace a chief who was accused by the police union of sexist attitudes racism and other misconduct. Mark Elbert retired after being cleared in an internal investigation and now works for the city as community development director. In an email to The Post he denied wrongdoing.

Officers say they saw the leadership change as a chance to restore morale and trust within the agency. Clary describes himself as politically conservative. There’s a Ronald Reagan quote about delegating authority framed above a bookcase in his office and twin photos by the door of Clary shaking hands with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. But he says he doesn’t always agree with Republicans on social issues. And in managing his department he preaches that hiring and retaining people from more diverse backgrounds is of paramount importance.

“If you’re not intentional about recruiting everyone and showing everyone that they can be successful here” Clary said as Fox News’s midday lineup played on mute on a corner television “you’re intentionally excluding people.”

He took aim at recruitment and personnel policies he said discouraged women and people of color from applying. The rule dictating that officers couldn’t take extended medical leave twice in two years affecting women who might have pregnancies in quick succession — scrapped. The bans on dyed hair and multiple ear piercings — gone. The bench press requirement for joining the SWAT team — nixed.

And this past winter Clary promoted Howard Banks a Black 39-year-old former school resource officer to lead recruiting efforts hoping he would relate well to a younger more diverse audience. At physical and classroom training sessions for applicants Banks offered breakout groups headed by female officers and officers of color who spoke to the challenges they faced in the regional police academy. Clary told applicants worried about meeting fitness requirements that he would run with them during testing.

At one recent screening the chief joined recruits including Anastasia Schrader 31 a child welfare case manager who said she wants to enter law enforcement in part to reverse distrust of police in communities of color. If hired Schrader would be one of six Black officers on the force — and according to Clary the first Black female officer in the department.

Anastasia Schrader's path to possibly becoming Bellevue's first Black female officer involves passing a physical fitness test so Manning guides her through push-ups during a Feb. 5 session at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Schrader 31 and other recruits were also graded on vertical jumps sit-ups and running ability. One of Schrader's running tests was a 300-meter dash which Clary far left also participated in along with Angel Menjivar second from left. Three days removed from the Feb. 5 fitness test Schrader braids the hair of her 7-year-old daughter Aurora. Later it’s off to her job as a child welfare case manager.

When Clary arrived in September 2020 just four of Bellevue’s 80-plus officers were women and just one officer spoke Spanish in a city where 16 percent of residents are Hispanic or Latino according to census data. (About 6 percent of residents are Black.) Nineteen months later the department has 103 officers including 15 women and five Spanish speakers. Nine of the last 15 hires have been women.

Clary has tried to convince other departments to make similar changes. While teaching a hiring course hosted by the Nebraska Law Enforcement Training Center in 2021 he challenged lieutenants and captains to reconsider the potential impact of credit requirements when recruiting people of color.

“If you’re looking at hiring from minority communities historically you’re going to get bad credit” Clary recalls telling the group. “At 18 years old they don’t have a safety net of family that has money to throw at them to help them get their first apartment or their first car. So are they going to struggle with credit? I would argue yes probably at a much higher rate.”

Clary said he made some headway with a few departments but a larger segment of police leadership in the Midwest has rejected or brushed aside his ideas. Whether Clary advocated reconsidering credit requirements or creating realistic physical fitness requirements for the job he said the most common response was consistent: You’re talking about lowering standards.

“I was exactly where you are five years ago” Clary said he would tell those officers and officials. “We’re not lowering a standard. We’re thinking differently about the standard. We’re inviting people that didn’t believe that there was a pathway.”

Force as a last resort Manning foreground awaits Officer Crystal Kenny 32 who joined the Bellevue force in December 2020.

Research generally supports the idea that female police officers are better than male officers at finding resolutions without using violence. A 2021 study found that female officers made 7 percent fewer arrests than their male counterparts while using force 28 percent less often. The researchers found the largest disparity centered on the treatment of Black civilians.

Female officers are on average more educated than male officers more likely to engender the perception of fairness in the communities they police more efficient in carrying out traffic stops that result in drug seizures and more effective in sex assault and domestic violence investigations other studies show. Experts say female officers are less likely to fire their guns in the line of duty use excessive force or become the target of successful civil suits.

Still there are a few studies that found only minor differences in use-of-force incidents among male and female officers. And some research indicates that diversity cannot be a cure-all for departments especially when traditional training and police culture remain in place. A 2003 look into police killings found that overall department diversity had little impact on outcomes for example. A 2005 study of a suburban Maryland police department determined the difference between men and women in use of force to be statistically insignificant.

Samantha Simon an assistant professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri at St. Louis says she is “pessimistic about the usefulness of demographic diversity in police forces.” She has found that success or failure at combat is still valued above all other fields of study at most police academies regardless of an officer’s gender. Police recruits who struggled in violent confrontations were more likely to be hazed than mentored she concluded when researching an article and an upcoming book.

“The people who end up being hired and make it to graduation fit a blueprint of who the institution thinks will be a good police officer” Simon said. “And a lot of that really revolves around the use of violence.”

Bellevue police leadership believes it’s too early to use data to understand what effect the influx of women is having with the majority of the female officers having been hired in the last year and a half and several still in training.

One early insight: For incidents from September to December in which officers used force the involvement of a female officer in a group effort yielded 8 percent fewer injuries. And in use-of-force incidents involving only one officer none involving a female officer resulted in injury according to the department.

Kenny who worked at a nearby county jail before joining the Bellevue police has a brother behind bars and says that fact influences how she performs her job: “How would I want an officer to treat my brother?”

In her downtime Kenny plays Monopoly with friends and family during a dinner party at a friend’s house.

Ogea an Army reservist and former social worker removes a knife from a man’s pocket before questioning him as her field training officer Weston Secrist observes.

Ogea returns home from a 12-hour shift to greet her 5-year-old twin boys Canyn left and Layton.

In interviews Bellevue’s female officers consistently cited moments in life when they felt vulnerable as a way to explain their approach to policing.

Crystal Kenny who joined the department in December 2020 after working at the nearby Sarpy County Jail said her two brothers were “in and out of the system” often getting hauled out of her childhood home in handcuffs. One is currently in jail in Lawrence Kan. She speaks with him regularly by video chat.

“How would I want an officer to treat my brother?” asked Kenny 32. “I would want them to be treated respectfully and fairly regardless of what they’ve done.”

Valdez 35 said her passion for investigating domestic violence and sexual assault and helping victims is drawn from personal experience. “A lot of times people do find themselves in very helpless situations” she said. “They don’t know that there’s resources. They don’t know that there’s people who care things that can be done to help.”

Changing the culture At the top of her 6 a.m. shift Kenny downloads footage from her dashboard and body camera.

The Bellevue Police Department like most smaller law enforcement agencies does not run its own police academy. Many recruits attend Sarpy Douglas Law Enforcement Academy a regional facility serving multiple departments. Several Bellevue officers said instruction at the academy was heavy on violence and light on some of the skills they’d come to learn months and years into the job. Combat scenarios were common but the scenario simulating negotiations with potentially violent civilians under duress lasted 15 minutes Wrigley said.

“There’s a lot of times where I go to a call and I’m talking to somebody for over an hour” Wrigley said. “You don’t get that in the academy.”

Bellevue officers increasingly are finding ways to use the department’s growing diversity to their advantage. Banks the recruiting director says he’s been asked by White colleagues to respond to traffic stops when Black motorists were growing hostile. Ogea the former social worker said her male counterparts have reacted positively to her taking over negotiations with suspects who are not responding well to them. On one occasion after subbing in and settling a suspect down the officer she’d replaced pulled Ogea aside.

“He said 'Don’t ever think that you’re going to hurt my ego for somebody wanting to talk to you over me.’” recalled Ogea a 36-year-old mother of twin boys. “That might be a stigma for most officers. But I think a majority of them at Bellevue are not going to have any problem.”

Manning Volk and Kenny enjoy a light moment after responding to a call together in February.

One perk of Kenny's job: She can spend a lunch break with her mother Pam Kenny and her dogs.

Clary says he’s always searching for ways to tweak the formula. He set up an anonymous email system by which officers can submit complaints comments or suggestions to him. (The vast majority so far have concerned department technology.) Officers attend mental health discussions hosted by peers and Clary has hired a therapist who offers weekly appointments to all officers.

“They’re going to give that extra little bit every day when they’re out there interacting with people” Clary said. “They’re going to give people grace because they were given grace.”

Wrigley has been known to sit down beside a distraught person — suspect or victim — and cry with them. That wasn’t always her way she said explaining that the example set by her husband’s loving parents birthed a sensitive side that she lacked early in her career.

Her empathy was on display the day she confronted the minivan driver.

“I’ll try hard and talk to him and see if I can get him out because he’s a person just like I am” Wrigley said. “And maybe he just forgot to go to court so why not give him the opportunity to go gracefully I guess.”

After the man accepted arrest Wrigley’s male colleagues teased her: “Karen you’re too nice. We’re freezing.”

Wrigley shot back: “Then wear more layers. I’m perfectly fine.”

The Consortium is comprised of Macquarie Asset Management a global asset manager and the world’s largest infrastructure manager and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) one of Canada’s largest institutional investors. As announced in March 2021 the Transaction forms part of National Grid’s strategic pivot towards electricity and follows last year’s acquisition of Western Power Distribution (WPD) the UK’s largest electricity distribution business and announced sale of The Narragansett Electric Company (NECO) in the US.

The terms of the Transaction imply an enterprise value for NGG of approximately £9.6 billion. On completion National Grid will receive approximately £2.2 billion in cash consideration (subject to customary completion adjustments). Following the Transaction National Grid will own a 40% minority equity interest in NGG via a new holding company called 'GasT TopCo'. In addition National Grid will also receive approximately £2.0 billion from additional debt financing at completion. As at March 2022 NGG’s regulated asset value is estimated to be approximately £6.6 billion and its net debt is estimated to be approximately £3.8 billion.

National Grid has also entered into an option agreement with the Consortium for the potential sale of the remaining 40% of equity in GasT TopCo (the 'Further Interest'). The option may be exercised by the Consortium between 1 January 2023 and 30 June 2023 (subject to change depending on the timing of the closing of the Transaction). If the option is exercised the consideration for the Further Interest is expected to be paid in cash to National Grid on broadly similar terms to the Transaction subject to adjustment for dividends paid in the business at the time of exercise. Further details will be announced if the option is exercised.

Completion of the Transaction will be subject to certain antitrust and regulatory conditions. Subject to these clearances National Grid expects that the Transaction will complete in the second half of calendar year 2022.

On completion the Transaction together with the proposed sale of NECO will:

Increase the balance of National Grid’s portfolio towards electricity with the proportion of the Group’s assets in electricity growing from c.60% to c.70%;

Significantly enhance National Grid’s central role in the delivery of the UK’s net zero targets;

Underpin National Grid’s 6 to 8% asset growth target for longer;

Enable National Grid to maintain a strong balance sheet with its strong investment grade credit rating supporting its sustainable dividend policy.



John Pettigrew Chief Executive of National Grid said: “This transaction further enhances our role in delivering the UK’s energy transition pivots our portfolio towards electricity whilst ensuring the security of the energy supply for the country. Alongside our plans to invest up to £35 billion in energy infrastructure over the next five years the series of transactions announced last March will strengthen our long-term growth prospects and drive long-term value for shareholders.

""Today’s announcement is a strong result for all our stakeholders including employees and customers. The Consortium has a long-term commitment to the UK with significant experience in owning and operating infrastructure assets. I look forward to our partnership and continuing to deliver safe and reliable gas service at the least cost to consumers. I would also like to thank my colleagues in Gas Transmission and Metering for their hard work that has helped us reach this important milestone.”

Martin Bradley Head of Macquarie Asset Management’s Real Assets team in EMEA said: “The national transmission system is a critical enabler of the UK’s energy transition providing the flexibility and reserve energy needed in the electricity system as the deployment of renewable sources of generation accelerates. However if the UK’s net zero by 2050 target is to be met the country must have a next-generation transmission backbone to power homes and businesses with renewable energy.

""Backed by our significant investment the transmission system will play a leading role in making the network ready for this transition. In doing so it will support the expansion of hydrogen’s role in the energy mix to deliver a competitive edge to the UK and its industry while working closely with the Government and Ofgem to maintain security of supply.”

Lincoln Webb Executive Vice President and Global Head of Infrastructure & Renewable Resources at BCI said: “This investment aligns well with our diversified portfolio of regulated utilities that securely deliver critical services to customers. We believe National Grid’s innovative decarbonisation strategy will ensure the business plays a leadership role in supporting the UK to achieve net zero carbon emissions on target by 2050 while meeting consumer demand for reliable networks.”



Following completion of the Transaction National Grid intends to use proceeds of approximately £4.2 billion towards repayment of the bridge financing facility that was drawn as part of the acquisition of WPD. For the purposes of Listing Rule 10.4 NGG’s gross assets as at 30 September 2021 were £6.1 billion. For the period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 NGG group generated profit before tax of £406 million.

The Transaction constitutes a class 2 transaction for the purposes of the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules and as such does not require National Grid shareholders' approval.

Following completion National Grid’s interest in GasT TopCo will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

National Grid was advised by Barclays Goldman Sachs and Robey Warshaw.

For the second consecutive week the Albion/Port Mourant Estate has surpassed it weekly sugar production target.

Having exceeding its target by 7.9% last week the Estate this week (week ending March 26 2022) has again done so this time by 6.3%.

According to the Estate’s Production Manager – Goy Romain the Estate is still suffering from poor cane yields as a result of the floods in 2021 (which directly affected the plant performance over a 12 month period starting in May 2021); however this adverse situation is expected to subside in the 2nd Crop of 2022 weather permitting. Romain posited that the Estate’s current achievement of its weekly targets is attributed to the combined efforts of employees both in the field and factory who closely monitored every aspect of the value chain to bring greater consistency to the production process.

For the second straight week qualified employees (who worked 80% or more days available for the week) have earned themselves an additional day’s pay (tax free) via the GuySuCo’s Weekly Production Incentive (WPI) scheme. This Romain believes will encourage and boost employees’ morale and turn out in the fields. Further it also bodes well for the socio-economic situation in the Corentyne area.

Despite of the inclement weather during the week (24.2 mm of rainfall recorded over a two day period) which slowed the production process the Estate was able to seize the momentum by extending working hours in the fields by using the cane loaders on dryer days.

Romain also disclosed that the overall factory performance as well as sugar recovery is showing positive results attesting to the “pol extraction” at 92% which means that the factory is performing better as it extracts more of the sucrose content from the sugar cane.

GuySuCo’s Chief Executive Officer Sasenarine Singh stated that this can be credited to the investments made by the Government of Guyana into the capital rehabilitation programmme. The CEO also indicated that the support from the current administration is encouraging as it will boost recoveries and contribute to more tonnes of sugar being produced for every tonne of cane supplied to the factory which is in keeping with the Corporation’s Five Year Strategic Plan.

GuySuCo is aiming at a sugar production target of 20260 MT across the industry for the 1st Crop of 2022 which is expected to conclude on April 30 2022. At this point in time the Berbice Estates are well on target with their harvesting plans.

The Executive Management commends the management and workers within the industry especially Albion/Port Mourant Estate on the achievement of their second WPI and urges all families of sugar workers to continue to provide this consistent support to the cane harvesters and other employees on the Estates as the industry continues to recover from all challenges.",,,

Tesla’s idea for a crazy windshield wiper that would clear debris from a driver’s line of sight using a laser beam has been officially published by the United States Patent Office. Tesla filed the application for the patent in May 2019 and it finally was granted in late 2021. Now the U.S. Patent Office has published the patent making it publicly viewable.

Tesla has long been interested in some pretty crazy and revolutionary ideas for automobiles. Over the years Tesla has looked at several different designs and ideas for windshield wipers using anything from a single-wiper system for the Next-Gen Roadster that would utilize an electromagnetic linear actuator to rid the windshield of moisture to no wipers at all when it unveiled the Cybertruck in November 2019. Most recent sightings of Tesla’s Cybertruck have indicated the vehicle will have wipers but Tesla is still revising the design.

With all of the crazy ideas Tesla has thrown around for wipers in the past the patent for the automaker’s “Pulsed Laser Cleaning of Debris Accumulated on Glass Articles in Vehicles and Photovoltaic Assemblies” is among the most interesting. Originally filed in May 2019 Tesla recently had the idea published by the U.S. Patent Office meaning if the Office does not ultimately grant the patent the public can still learn from the work and perhaps develop another system that could be granted.

Tesla describes the patent in the now-published filing:

A cleaning system for a vehicle includes a beam optics assembly that emits a laser beam to irradiate a region on a glass article of the vehicle debris detection circuitry that detects debris accumulated over the region and control circuitry. The control circuitry calibrates a set of parameters associated with the laser beam emitted from the beam optics assembly based on detection of the debris accumulated over the region on the glass article controls an exposure level of the laser beam on the debris accumulated based on calibration of the set of parameters associated with the laser beam wherein the exposure level is controlled based on pulsing the laser beam at a calibrated rate that limits penetration of the laser beam to a depth that is less than a thickness of the glass article and removes the debris accumulated over the region on the glass article using the laser beam.”

It is not necessarily confirmed or known what plans Tesla may have for the laser windshield wipers but illustrations within the patent do seem to display a Model S body. Tesla may be willing to test this type of apparatus on some of its vehicles in-house but the automaker has never detailed specific plans for the idea.

Tesla’s flowchart describing the process for the patent is relatively simple and also shows uses with clearing debris from solar panels. In five steps the patent describes the use of the laser cleaning assembly:

Detect debris accumulated on a region on glass article installed in vehicle Calibrate a set of parameters associated with laser beam emitted from beam optics assembly based on detection of debris accumulated on a region on glass article Control exposure level of laser beam on detected debris accumulated on glass article based on calibration of set of parameters associated with laser beam Irradiate region associated with the detected debris on glass article by laser beam Remove detected debris accumulated on region by laser beam

It doesn’t appear to be operated by the vehicle itself either. Tesla describes the potential for a manual system where the driver could control the laser with a touchscreen joystick or another medium to communicate with different operational components of the cleaning apparatus.

While it seems like an outlandish and potentially satirical idea it would not be too far past Tesla’s realm of ideas to use a laser to clear a windshield. After all CEO Elon Musk has said in the past that the Roadster will fly thanks to SpaceX cold gas thrusters Tesla has filed a patent for the Cybertruck to have solar cells on its tonneau for additional electric vehicle range and plenty of other insane ideas. However the new laser patent if ultimately used by Tesla would only decrease the already-minimal maintenance costs owners deal with as yearly keep-up costs on EVs are extremely low.

The automaker is building factories around the world with plans to build even more and it seems the goal is to produce as many as 20-million EVs per year by 2030.

The company now operates some sixteen different facilities around the world most of which either build cars or produce parts for them. Most recently the automaker recently delivered the first vehicles (Model Y crossovers) built at its new factory in Germany (known as Giga Berlin the Berlin Gigafactory or Gigafactory 4).

Last year was the automaker’s best in terms of sales volume since it was able to sell nearly one million vehicles - 936172 to be precise - marking an almost 90 percent increase year-over-year compared to 2020 when the company just missed reaching the 500000 sales mark; that was again a significant improvement over 2019 when 367500 units were delivered.

The 20-million sales per annum by the early 2030s seems like a big number but it is what Elon Musk stated on the sidelines of the first Giga Berlin deliveries. Automotive News quotes the Tesla CEO as saying

I think it's aggressive but not impossible that we could do 20 million cars in 10 years. And that would be a good number because there's 2 billion cars and trucks in the world that are in active use so 20 million would be then 1 percent of the global fleet per year.

Tesla will also expand its model roster by then - it will not keep building the same four models that it offers now. In regard to this Musk expects that

As we are able to ramp production and satisfy demand in our existing markets then we will be able to expand to other markets and we will also add additional products.

The newly inaugurated production facility in Germany is expected to reach an output of 500000 cars yearly by 2025 - this year it is expected to produce around 54000 vehicles then 280000 in 2023 and the ramp-up will continue until 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbXkuY2xldmVsYW5kY2xpbmljLm9yZy9wYXRpZW50LXN0b3JpZXMvNTU5LXlvdW5nLXdvbWFucy1lcGlsZXB0aWMtc2VpenVyZXMtZ29uZS1hZnRlci1kaXNjb3ZlcnktZnJvbS03LXRlc2xhLW1yadIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woman's Epileptic Seizures Gone After Discovery From 7-Tesla MRI,"Trying to solve Gabi Sable’s medical issue was akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. Doctors knew there was a microscopically small lesion in her left frontal lobe that caused frequent and debilitating epileptic seizures. However they needed to pinpoint its exact location in her brain in order to safely operate.

In the meantime from her epilepsy diagnosis at age 11 and for the ensuing eight years Gabi endured numerous MRIs PET scans CT scans EEGs and other diagnostic procedures to seek the source of her problem. Additionally she was prescribed eight types of anti-seizure medications to try and control her grand mal seizures which left her unable to get a driver’s license go away to summer camp or do much of anything on her own. Some medicines worked for a while but none provided the long-term relief Gabi and family so desperately sought.

“That was my life and I just had to get through it” says Gabi. “All I could do was keep moving forward. I like to keep a positive outlook.”

Adds her mother Amy “It was so frustrating but Gabi was never depressed or anxious. She doesn’t let anything get her down.”

For years after her epilepsy diagnosis Gabi endured rounds of diagnostic testing to try and identify the source of her health issue. (Courtesy: Amy Sable)

Eventually her determination and enthusiasm paid off. In 2020 Gabi was approved to participate in a clinical study at Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute that was evaluating the efficacy of a technological advancement -- an in vivo structural 7-tesla (7T) MRI designed for epilepsy presurgical evaluation. Much more powerful than the standard diagnostic test the 3-tesla (3T) MRI the 7T MRI high-definition imaging technology produces sharper images with potentially better detection and visualization of lesions and other malformations in the brain.

According to Elia Pestana Knight MD a pediatric epileptologist in the Epilepsy Center who has been treating Gabi for nearly a decade the 7T MRI – which has since been approved by the FDA for clinical use – revealed the lesion in her brain was so small it could be removed using a robotic laser. This less invasive option meant Gabi could avoid the large incisions from a lobectomy or other types of resective brain surgeries which can entail removing larger sections of brain tissue and skull when the lesion is larger.

“Our ability to find lesions has improved and so the outcomes have improved. We are fortunate modern technology enabled us to find Gabi’s very small lesion in the area of the brain where seizures are produced” explains Dr. Pestana Knight. “It was quite a journey for Gabi and one we walked together.”

However the path to the solution was a long and winding one. Amy and her husband Alan first noticed something wrong with Gabi when she was in fifth grade because her gait began to look different. They also recalled her crawling into their room one morning saying she couldn’t walk. “But we just thought she was fooling around” Amy recalls “because in a few minutes she was acting normally again.”

Similarly Gabi had a few episodes at school when she would suddenly find herself in a place she didn’t expect. Once while boarding the school bus home she walked several hundred feet in another direction before realizing it.

“It happened a lot” recalls Gabi. “I just never told anyone. It was weird. I felt like I was running but I was walking. It was like tunnel vision.”

Upon visiting a neurologist closer to home in Pennsylvania they learned Gabi did indeed suffer from epilepsy a brain disease whereby nerve cells don’t signal properly causing seizures. She experienced her first grand mal seizure about one week after being hospitalized for her initial evaluation.

After several months the family transitioned Gabi’s care to Cleveland Clinic and Dr. Pestana Knight. Thus began an odyssey as they searched for an effective anti-seizure medication.

Gabi would have periods of time where combinations of medications were effective. However as she grew older they became unsuccessful in treating her seizures. “Since we didn’t have a clear cause for Gabi’s seizures she underwent various tests to rule out genetic and autoimmune causes” adds Dr. Pestana Knight. “We tried everything but we were just not getting an answer.”

Notes Amy “No matter what they did it just wouldn’t work for very long. The aftereffects of her seizures were lasting longer. Gabi would be out of commission for a day or two and wouldn’t be able to think clearly. It was bad.”

“We weren’t giving up” states Gabi. While the epilepsy team was getting closer to identifying the tiny lesion’s location through a variety of innovative tests the haystack was still shrouding the needle’s location.

While hesitant to let Gabi go away to college Amy and Alan relented and Gabi enrolled in Elon University in North Carolina. However a few months into her first semester she had to take a medical withdrawal unable to regularly attend classes because she would be nauseous on a daily basis from a medication’s side effect.

Still there seemed to be no long-term relief from Gabi’s seizures until the 7T MRI study opened up. Gabi eagerly agreed to participate. A week and a half after she underwent the non-invasive test Dr. Pestana Knight called Amy with the news.

“She was so excited” Amy recalls “and started talking a mile a minute. She said ‘We found the spot!’”

Since the procedure Gabi has remained seizure-free. It's opened the doors for her to participate in activities she couldn't before including hiking the Inca Trail in Peru. (Courtesy: Amy Sable)

Armed with that knowledge Dr. Pestana Knight conferred with a team of experts at Cleveland Clinic including neuro surgeon William Bingaman MD. Because the lesion was so small and they could pinpoint its exact location they determined laser ablation therapy would work for Gabi. Dr. Bingaman performed the procedure on November 30 2020. Gabi was home the next day. She experienced no pain.

In the following 26 months since the procedure Gabi has had no seizures. That has opened the door of opportunity on the many things she missed in her teen years. During summer of 2021 she worked at a sleepaway camp. Last fall she even hiked the Inca Trail in Peru’s rugged Andes Mountains as part of a study abroad program through Elon University.

Amy calls Gabi’s transformation “a true medical miracle.” Gabi herself says “Now I’m getting my chance. I’m having all the fun I always wanted to have.” She’ll finally be getting her driver’s license soon too.

Dr. Pestana Knight is thrilled Gabi has overcome her obstacles and is now living the life she’s always dreamed of. “She is quite a remarkable young lady” she notes. “She is inspiration for all young adults who are traveling the same route.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8va2ZveHR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2lkZWEtbWVzcXVpdGUtaGlsbHMtaG9zdHMtY29tbXVuaXR5LWtpdGUtcGFydHktd2l0aC10ZXNsYdIBW2h0dHBzOi8va2ZveHR2LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9pZGVhLW1lc3F1aXRlLWhpbGxzLWhvc3RzLWNvbW11bml0eS1raXRlLXBhcnR5LXdpdGgtdGVzbGE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IDEA Mesquite Hills hosted community kite party with TESLA,"IDEA Mesquite Hills located North of El Paso hosted a free community Kite Party and partnered with TESLA to provide car tours and job opportunities to families on Saturday March 26 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

TXN,Texas Instruments,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR2aW5zaWRlci5jb20vMTAzNzE5MC9jYW5keS1tb250Z29tZXJ5LXRydWUtc3RvcnktbG92ZS1hbmQtZGVhdGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who Is Candy Montgomery the Ax Killer Behind 'Candy' and 'Love and Death'?,"For five consecutive days this May the American public will once again be transfixed by the murderous saga of Candy Montgomery and her friend Betty Gore the former of whom killed the latter with an ax in 1980 but was still acquitted of murder.

With a new episode dropping each day between May 9 and May 13 Hulu’s Candy will retell the true-crime story with Jessica Biel playing the killer and Melanie Lynskey portraying the victim. (See Hulu’s teaser for Candy here.)

Meanwhile HBO Max is readying a different dramatization of the same killing with Elizabeth Olsen and Lily Rabe in the lead roles of the upcoming limited series Love and Death.

So what was the story that inspired dueling TV shows from major streamers?

As The Dallas Morning News reports Candace “Candy” Montgomery was 30 years old at the time of the killing living in Fairview Texas as the wife of Texas Instruments engineer Pat Montgomery and the mother of their two kids. She attended the same church as Betty Gore a 30-year-old middle school teacher. Candy had also embarked on—and been spurned by—an affair with Betty’s husband Allan Gore.

Did Candy Montgomery kill her friend in a jealous rage or was it self-defense after discovering an affair? https://t.co/CgvxmiYO1h pic.twitter.com/tmUqmoerej — Martinis & Murder Podcast (@Martinis_Murder) January 23 2017

Betty’s older daughter Alisa had slept over at the Montgomery house the night before the killing and Candy had offered to drive Alisa to her swim lesson the next day. But when Candy stopped at the Gore house in nearby Wylie to pick up a swimsuit for Alisa on June 13 1980—a Friday the 13th—Betty reportedly confronted her about sleeping with Allan.

During that confrontation someone took up an ax: Candy’s lawyers would later claim that it was Betty who retrieved the ax from her garage and charged Candy with it but it was Betty who got the upper hand as the two women fought.

And hours later when neighbors checked in on Betty—hailed by Allan who was away on business and couldn’t reach his wife by phone—they found her dead in her utility room. She had 41 ax wounds with experts testifying later that many of those blows were dealt after she was already unconscious.

During the trial that October Candy’s lawyer argued that she had acted out of self-defense with a psychiatrist testifying that he had hypnotized Candy and determined that she had a “dissociative reaction” that day such that she wasn’t aware how many times she brought the ax down on Betty.

Candy also took the stand during the trial. “I hit her. I hit her. I hit her” she reportedly admitted as the News recounted in another article. “I stood back and looked at myself and I was covered in blood. I felt so guilty so dirty. I felt so ashamed.”

At the end of the eight-day trial the 12-person jury acquitted Candy of murder buying into the self-defense claim. One juror told the News that their decision didn’t hinge on the number of ax strikes saying “We determined it never had a bearing on the verdict at all—whether it was one gunshot or 1000 whacks.”

As for Candy she moved out of state following the trial and is now in her 70s. She suffers from PTSD according to a person who identified themselves as a relative when the News called and added “the phone calls don’t help.”

Now however Hulu and HBO Max are giving new life to the grisly tale that Dallas-area locals might prefer to leave in the past. “If you listened to talk radio and all that at the time there was: ‘Oh she got away with murder!’ It was all this outrage” journalist Jim Atkinson co-author of Evidence of Love: A True Story of Passion and Death in the Suburbs told the newspaper. “But within that tightly-knit community or series of communities out there they were just as happy to have it be shoved back under the rug.”

Similar to how the two shows offer different takes on the same story Candy creator Robin Veith grappled with differing perspectives on the killing. “We spoke to [people on] both sides of the story and 40 years later they are entrenched in their beliefs” the Mad Men alum told Vanity Fair recently. “I’ve learned working on true crime that you listen to everybody and take careful notes but also remember that memory is a tricky thing.”

She went on: “How you feel about this story says a lot about you in that moment what’s going on in your life and in your mind. That’s the fascinating—and scary—prospect of it.”

According to Textron the SECAT can transport up to 500 tonnes of cargo over 500 nautical miles at high speeds (50 knots). This implies that the SECAT can carry out its tasks even on the high seas.

Evolution of the amphibious military vehicles

Amphibious assault vehicles (AAVs) have proven indispensable in military operations that combine marine and land-based elements. The amphibious tracked vehicle is designed so that it can both cross water and engage in ground defences. AAVs have the power and technology to cross deep water while deploying powerful weaponry and managing all terrains.

AAVs have developed since the first civilian prototype in 1935 to types like the modern Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) deployed by the United States Marine Corps and Navy. These resolute vehicles' design has also improved with greater armour mechanical components and supply and personnel capacity.

The ""Alligator"" developed by Donald Roebling was the first AAV designed by a civilian. The Alligator was lightweight aluminium and included cleats on its tracks for added grip. It was created to improve emergency response during floods and storms and Roebling tried to improve its mechanics and maximise its success potential. Its design highlighted in LIFE magazine's article ""Roebling's Alligator For Florida Rescues"" prompted the US military to acquire a prototype in 1938.

How strong is it?

The Amphibious Assault Vehicle and the Amphibious Combat Vehicle vary primarily in that the former is tracked and the latter is wheeled. There are however lots of other exciting new additions to the ACV to look forward to. A redesigned V-shaped undercarriage provides additional protection against IED blasts. Handling is considerably enhanced allowing it to become much faster when travelling on land - a significant advantage in battle.

Beast on land and the water

Like its predecessor the AAV the new ACV is an amphibious vehicle that can operate on both land and water. The ACV has a 690 horsepower potential and can travel for 12 nautical miles and 325 land miles (at speeds of up to 65 mph!) before requiring refuelling. Inside there's enough room for 13 Marines and three crew members as well as storage for equipment and two days' worth of supplies.

Advent Of The AAVP-7A1

In 1977 the LVTP7 was replaced by the LVTP7A1 later dubbed the AAV7A1. The Cummins VT400 diesel engine Position Location and Reporting System (PLARS) and enhanced diagnostics were all incorporated in this updated vehicle.

Hydraulic electrical weaponry and suspension systems have all been improved to improve usefulness and dependability. An electric weapons station featured an updated M2HB.50-cal machine gun Cadillac-Gage turret and MK19 automatic grenade launcher.

Novel Technologies

In the 1980s General Dynamics began work on an Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle or EFV. After years of development the EFV was suggested as an armoured tracked vehicle capable of 20 knots on the water and around 27mph on land.

The EFV's performance and dependability were determined to be lacking in 2006 prompting authorities to reassess financing for the project. The project was suggested to be terminated in 2011 due to financial and functionality problems.

Success Of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle

The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) was designed when the cancellation of the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV). BAE Systems a business that provides the military with electronic security land and maritime technology develops the ACV. This vehicle's power cargo capacity and countermeasures have improved.

On land the ACV has a range of over 325 miles and can travel at speeds of over 65 mph. It features a 690-horsepower engine and an 8x8 frame based on the Iveco Superav AAV. According to John Swift BAE's head of amphibious systems the ACV has a three-fold higher survival rate than the standard AAV.

The underside of the ACV had a V-shape meant to be more resistant to improvised explosive devices than the EFV which had a vulnerable flat-bottom design (IEDs). The USMC tested the ACV and offered active comments to the manufacturer to enhance the design. According to February 2020 the US Marine Corps bought more ACVs for operational testing during the Low-Rate Initial Production phase.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJyc3Rhci5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxzMDE3ODk2NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"J.

Peterson talks about the early days in the '90s when the company was just getting started out of his basement in Rochester. Then he breaks down how a a surge in online auction participation slowed manufacturing of new equipment and a low inventory of used equipment have put the farm equipment industry in an unprecedented place.

ROCHESTER Minn. ― Greg Peterson has been charting auction prices before they were accessible on the World Wide Web and he's never seen anything like this.

Due to a surge in online auction participation slowed manufacturing of new equipment and one of the lowest inventories of used equipment ever the market for farm equipment has reached an unprecedented point .

Machinery Pete — one of the largest marketplaces for used farm equipment — was founded over three decades ago by Peterson of Rochester.

Back in 1989 Peterson who's from Benson Minn. started Machinery Pete out of his basement in Rochester where he researched and tracked down auction prices for farm equipment starting in the Midwest and eventually across the country.

Peterson said that the online farm auction industry became ""unbelievable"" starting two years ago this month when the curtain fell and the pandemic hit.

""I could see a quantum leap forward in the farm machinery online space"" said Peterson of the time about two weeks after the pandemic started.

For over a decade before then Peterson said he could see that the farm machinery online space was ""way behind"" the online farm construction auction space. He said pre-pandemic nearly 80% of non-ag equipment sold by Ritchie Bros. — a company that sells industrial equipment and trucks through live and online auctions — were buyers online.

""And on the ag side it was more like 20% maybe up to 35% of online bidders were the winning bidders on a physical auction"" said Peterson.

But when the pandemic set in farm equipment auctioneers were forced to go online only. He said at that point the market was coming off a depressed period which began around 2014. But he could see an uptick starting around 2019.

Peterson said the thought might be that during a pandemic farmers would pull back on spending. But due to a commodity price bump the prices went higher than ever.

""If you went back over my 32 years and charted auction prices against the price of corn — it's a complete direct match"" said Peterson.

Production pinched

Rolling into 2021 the supply chain issues started to arise said Peterson and became more severe as time went on. In February of last year Peterson wrote in Farm Journal Magazine warning of the time ahead.

""I was hesitant to do that but I felt compelled to have to say that if you need anything equipment wise — just get it and don't worry about what you pay for it just get your hands on it"" he said. ""Because if you read the tea leaves this ain't gonna be good because the production of new is going be severely pinched in.""

He said with commodity prices up after a six-year period of downturn equipment was at the top of the list for many farmers. But due to supply chain issues farm operations were not able to invest in upgrading equipment.

""Now you've got all kinds of precision things like precision planting high speed planting and all the data applications — farmers wanted to update"" he said. ""But the manufacturers couldn't make enough and so used values just kept going higher and higher and higher.""

Tidal wave

As 2021 winded down Peterson wrote again to expect a ""tidal wave"" of year-end tax buying. He said that even though some accountants say the Section 179 tax deduction is overdone a lot of farmers use it as a strategy to save on taxes which Peterson said ""they get hit from every angle"" on.

""And so the end of 2021 was incredible"" he said of used machinery prices. ""I've never seen anything like it — and honestly it's gotten higher in 2022.""

Peterson said he hasn't seen prices like this in his 32 years and he said it's dangerous for farmers to just assume it's only due to inflation. The underlying issue lies in a very low used inventory level.

""The driving factor is the tightness with used inventory levels on dealer lots around the country the tightest ever"" said Peterson.

Recently to get an understanding on the situation Peterson and his team ran the numbers on a single category — 175-plus horse power tractors — at Machinery Pete. Picking one day -- Feb. 18 — they looked back three years and compared the dates.

""It was confirmed what we knew anecdotally"" he said. ""There's 79.3% fewer five-year old tractors for sale on dealer lots now than three years ago.""

In the past Peterson said whenever commodity prices fell and profit conditions became more negative there was always excess used inventory sitting around the country.

New York’s famous yellow taxi cabs are set to become available for booking for travelers using the popular ridesharing app Uber. The famous taxis – immortalized in various movies and TV shows throughout the years – are ubiquitous throughout the city and have become widely recognized symbols of the city. Their addition to the Uber platform means they could now be the solution to high cab fares and longer waiting times throughout New York.

Despite Uber’s arrival into the city starting a feud between the company and New York’s famous yellow cabs two taxi companies in the city are set to join the platform – the first such agreement of its kind in the US – as all parties look to navigate a course through the choppy post-pandemic travel waters.

We've got everything you need to know about this announcement including what is happening what it means for travelers and whether we can expect to see similar announcements coming out of Uber in the future.

Yellow Taxis on Uber – What Travelers Should Know

When they first burst onto the taxi scene in the US Uber stated that they wanted to “disrupt” the taxi industry. Fast forward a few years and now Uber is looking more and more towards partnering with its rivals in its quest for ride-sharing domination.

Yesterday Uber announced that New York’s famous yellow taxis would be listed on its app for the first time later this Spring – a move which looks like it could pave the way for similar announcements in other cities in the future.

Uber users will be able to specifically choose taxis on the app which will then send the request to the two taxi technology companies – Curb and CMT – that Uber has partnered with which will then let the taxi drivers know to pick the passengers up. Uber users who request a taxi can expect to pay similar prices to Uber’s current UberX rides and both the riders and drivers will see the fare price up front.

Taxi drivers using Uber will be able to accept or decline passenger pick ups as they see fit owing to a city regulation that allows ehail taxis to reject fares – a privilege that doesn’t apply to street-hail taxis.

Surge pricing will also apply when necessary – though given the partnership will significantly increase Uber’s driver pool it could happen far less frequently which would result in cheaper rides for travelers. With more ride options available to them passengers can also expect average ride waiting times to fall too.

The move is set to help Uber move towards their ambitious goal of having all taxis on their platform by 2025. Previously speaking about the aims of the company Andrew Macdonald Uber's senior vice president of mobility said:

“When we look at the next five years we just don't see a world in which taxis and Uber exist separately. There's too much to gain for both sides.”

Uber has entered similar partnerships to the one that has just been announced in New York with taxi firms in other countries around the world such as South Korea Germany Austria and Turkey.

Last year alone Uber welcomed as many as 122000 taxis onto its platform. The partnership in New York could add as many as 13600 more cabs to its roster. With such ambition being shown Uber could well eye up other traditional markets across the US in order to achieve its goals.

The pandemic has been tough for ridesharing platforms and traditional taxi companies alike. Not only did the pandemic reduce the general need for taxis due to more people working from home popular ridesharing companies such as Uber and Lyft have been forced to add a fuel surcharge fee in the wake of spiraling fuel prices in the US.

Is the Uber and Taxi partnership beneficial for riders in New York City?

Unfortunately if you want the best charging experience and speeds possible things can get a bit complicated. For folks using Apple’s latest iPhone models that means getting an Apple-certified MagSafe charger.

Recommended Videos

Apple introduced support for the Qi standard to its iPhone lineup in 2017 with the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. For whatever reason though it also limited the maximum Qi charging speeds to 7.5 watts. That meant charging wirelessly was about 50 percent faster than using the included five-watt USB power brick but it still fell short of the iPhone’s maximum 18-watt wired charging speeds.

This didn’t change until three years later when Apple released the iPhone 12 lineup with its new MagSafe technology. Suddenly an iPhone 12 could be wirelessly charged at up to 15W — speeds that were at least somewhat comparable with a wired fast-charging adapter.

Unfortunately this also required a proprietary Apple-certified adapter. When using any other Qi-compatible wireless charger the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 still only offer the same 7.5-watt charging speeds as older iPhone models.

To be fair to Apple here though just about every smartphone manufacturer that offers higher-speed wireless charging has developed its own standards to get there. Apple’s not unique in this respect although its use of magnets has also muddied the waters a bit.

The MagSafe landscape

Apple’s MagSafe technology isn’t just about charging. The ring of magnets introduced in the back of the iPhone 12 can also be used for attaching everything from stands to wallets. Charging is only one part of that equation although it’s arguably the most important part.

The catch however is that it’s also created some confusion as to how to get the fastest charging speeds. While anybody can stick a ring of magnets in a Qi charger only one that’s certified by Apple as part of its Made-for-iPhone program can actually deliver the twice-as-fast 15W charging speeds.

This means you have to be careful when shopping for MagSafe chargers. Just because a charger magnetically attaches to the back of your iPhone doesn’t mean it will support the fastest charging speeds. Apple can’t patent the laws of physics so anybody can make a standard Qi charger that contains magnets but unless it’s certified by Apple it will only offer 7.5W charging speeds.

To be clear you don’t need to care about fast charging in every situation. For example if you only need something to charge your iPhone overnight the standard Qi charging speeds will suffice. For topping up wirelessly on the go however nothing beats a proper MagSafe charger.

Mophie’s 3-in-1 solution

This is precisely where Mophie’s 3-in-1 travel charger with MagSafe comes in. MagSafe-certified chargers are still fairly uncommon and that’s even more true for those designed for multiple devices. We reviewed one from Belkin just a few weeks ago but it’s not a travel charger.

Until recently if you wanted a travel charger for your iPhone and Apple Watch you had to go with Apple’s own MagSafe Duo. This compact folding charger offers both a 15W MagSafe disc and a place for your Apple Watch. It includes a Lightning to USB-C cable but you’ll have to supply the power adapter yourself.

Now Mophie has an alternative solution to give you everything the MagSafe Duo can and more in a much better package.

As the name implies Mophie’s 3-in-1 travel charger offers spots for charging your iPhone and Apple Watch plus a third charging pad for another device. It is designed to hold an AirPods or AirPods Pro case but it’s actually a standard 5W Qi wireless charger that can be used for any Qi-compatible device. It won’t be as fast as a typical stand-alone Qi charger but it should be enough to charge most smartphones overnight.

Design and accessories

To my eyes Mophie’s travel charger also has a more attractive design than Apple’s MagSafe Duo — or even most of the other travel chargers I’ve encountered.

While the charger looks pretty utilitarian when open it will typically be covered with your Apple devices anyway. It also folds down to a third of its size for compact travel when not in use giving it a footprint that’s only slightly larger than the MagSafe Duo although it’s naturally thicker.

The outside uses a soft heather gray microsuede fabric finish which is more stylish and feels pleasant to the touch but what’s even better is that it comes with a matching carrying case that lets you keep the charger and included power adapter and cables together in a single package.

This brings up another important point: Mophie’s travel charger includes the necessary 30W USB-C PD wall adapter. With Apple’s penchant for cutting back on bundled accessories this is something you’ll need to buy separately with the company’s first-party MagSafe chargers — or even the iPhone itself.

If there is one complaint I have about Mophie’s travel charger it’s the length of the included USB-C to USB-C cable. The three-foot run should be enough for most nightstands but it’s not hard to imagine scenarios where that might not work particularly since the size of the unfolded charger may limit where you can put it. The cable also connects to the right side of the charger behind the Apple Watch section which can further complicate things if your power outlet is on the left side of your desk or table.

Other than the Apple Watch and MagSafe charging discs the top pads use a plastic construction that feels a bit cheap. It’s a stark contrast to the rest of the design but as a travel accessory it’s also understandable that Mophie wanted to keep things as lightweight as possible.

Charging performance

Since it’s officially MagSafe-certified Mophie’s 3-in-1 travel charger naturally offers the same 15W charging speeds as Apple’s standard MagSafe charger. This proved true in my testing where it topped up my iPhone 12 Pro Max in just over three hours. That’s still about twice as long as using a wired 20W adapter connection but you can chalk that up to the general inefficiency of wireless charging.

Either way the MagSafe pad for the iPhone doesn’t offer any real surprises. It performs identically to an Apple MagSafe charger and can also double as a standard Qi charger offering 7.5W speeds for older iPhone models or other smartphones.

The other two charging pads are limited to five-watt speeds however. For the Apple Watch charger that’s more than enough for most Apple Watch models but it does mean that it doesn’t support fast charging for owners of the Apple Watch Series 7. While that’s disappointing it’s also not surprising; faster charging remains exclusive to just a few chargers including Apple’s first-party Apple Watch charger.

Conclusion

In my opinion Mophie’s charger beats out the only other competitor — Apple’s MagSafe Duo — in almost every conceivable way. The MagSafe Duo is more compact by itself but that’s offset by the need to carry a 20W power adapter and Lightning cable around which is much more awkward to do without a case.

You’re also getting more bang for your buck with Mophie’s solution. It costs $20 more than the MagSafe Duo but it offers a third charging pad and includes the 30W USB-C power adapter and case.

For frequent travelers who tote an iPhone Apple Watch and set of AirPods Mophie’s new 3-in-1 travel charger is about as close to a must-have travel accessory as you’re going to find. It gives you everything you need to keep your devices juiced up wherever you may land organized into a single compact package.

Pricing and availability

Mophie’s 3-in-1 travel charger is exclusively available from Apple.com or Mophie.com for $150. It can also be found in stock at many Apple Retail stores.

In its almost 94 years of existence the Capreol Curling Club has never submitted an insurance claim.

That’s why the club’s volunteers were shocked when their insurance premium skyrocketed in December to almost $24000 under Wawanesa Insurance and the club has been left with more questions than answers.

Club president Susanne Aylward said she has been dealing with the insurance issue for months and has since secured a much less costly policy through Greg Cantin of The Co-operators here in Greater Sudbury.

However those few months were fraught with frustration as she was met with roadblocks in her attempt to find out why the club’s premiums increased by 150 per cent.

“We've never had a claim” she said. “(This is) a solid block curling club with brick on the outside. There are no windows we have steel doors and it's just well built.”

Aylward said the club’s insurance underwriter had changed several times over the past few years. Prior to Wawanesa Insurance it was The Travelers Companies that provided coverage.

“Three years ago we had Travelers insurance and our premium was under $6000” Aylward said. “Last year we switched to another broker BrokerLink and they found us insurance through Wawanesa who increased our premium by more than $3000.”

That was before their policy lapsed she said. When it came time to renew the policy that’s when the club was hit with an almost $24000 premium.

“On Christmas Eve day I got a letter from our broker saying our policy is going to be increased to $22426” she said.

Aylward said she was advised by the club’s broker that they had attempted to get a hold of the club to inform them of the increase but was never able to connect. By the time it was brought to Aylward’s attention the club’s policy had lapsed and they had no choice but to pay the premium “otherwise we would have no insurance” she said.

Having been the president for the past six years and having already spent a lot of money on repairs — the club’s chiller brine pump and air-conditioning unit have all had to be replaced and now the club’s furnace in the basement needs to be replaced — Aylward was not about to take the increase sitting down.

She filed complaints with Ontario’s ombudsman as well as the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario. However those complaints fell short as she was stalled in the process.

“I tried to go through the ombudsman to try and get a valid reason for the increase” she said.

She was told curling clubs have been undercharged for years but there was no “definite” answer coming.

Wawanesa Insurance told Sudbury.com in an email that it is always willing to work with its customers “to make sure our premiums accurately reflect the property being insured” said a spokesperson.

“We encourage people to work closely with their independent insurance broker to understand their premiums and to make sure they are getting the right coverage. Insurance brokers are licensed insurance experts and are in the best position to help people and organizations get appropriate insurance coverage.

“With regard to curling rinks in general many facilities currently face a series of factors that increase their level of risk specifically aging infrastructure risks fire risks as well as risks associated with extreme weather and climate change. Taken together these factors impact premiums.

“We are working closely with brokers in the Sudbury area to make sure our mutual customers understand any changes to their premiums.”

She took matters into her own hands and started cold-calling insurance companies in Sudbury for quotes. That’s where Greg Cantin and The Co-operators come in.

“I was just lucky but I had to be on it for two and a half months” she said. “I lived and breathed this.”

Aylward also reached out to Nickel Belt MP France Gélinas who visited the curling club on March 11 to show her support.

Gélinas addressed the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on March 9 prior to her visit calling on the minister of finance to “rein in those astronomical increases.”

“(This club) is a pillar of a small community and it’s a well-loved club” Gélinas said. “The minister of finance has tools at his disposal to rein in those astronomical increases and he needs to step in before those not-for-profit organizations close their doors permanently.”

Skyrocketing insurance premiums seem to be the norm for curling clubs across not only Sudbury but the entire country

Numerous curling clubs across the country are facing similar insurance increases said Danny Lamoureux executive director Curler Experience and Curling Club Development. Curl Canada became aware of the insurance issue about a year ago when clubs started complaining about their premiums increasing he said.

“We're advocating on their behalf with the underwriters in various cases and we're trying to work with them to help them have a conversation with their local insurance guy and find out what the heck is going on” said

It was a hectic season and now that it’s winding down Curling Canada can really start focusing on this issue he said.

“We haven't really jumped into it heavily at this point only because it's been a crazy winter with COVID-19 and lockdowns he said. “But it's certainly something that's on our agenda now and we're going to start asking some questions.”

There are 950 affiliated curling clubs across Canada and probably another 200 that aren't affiliated with Curl Canada he said.

The majority of clubs seeing these types of increases are in Ontario and Atlantic Canada he said. “I haven't heard from too many clubs in the prairies that are concerned but we haven’t interviewed every club either.”

Curl Sudbury saw an increase in their premiums of about $7000 over two years said Tom Leonard manager and chief ice technician Curl Sudbury. The club currently pays about $15000 a year for insurance.

While the club was surprised to be hit with an increase the first year it was better prepared for another increase coming down the line.

“Where’s the justification” he said. “It’s not like we have claims year after year. I don’t get it. I’ve been in the business since the’90s and I’ve never seen it like this before.

“If there's a small curling club that is just getting by with membership fees and they struggle with creating other revenue this could certainly have an impact whether they open or not.”

Greg Cantin is an insurance broker with The Co-operators in Sudbury.

“I can't speak as to what the rationale is of the rate increase but it was dramatic” Cantin said.

He called the Capreol Curling Club an insurance company’s dream.

“We're talking about a concrete block building a steel roof and everything is updated” he said. “There are sprinklers in there. From a property standpoint it really doesn't get a whole lot better than a noncombustible building.”

When Aylward came seeking a quote from him he knew exactly how to help.

“We have a program called Community Garden and it is designed for non-profits and charitable organizations” said Cantin. “The Capreol Curling Club is a perfect fit because they're a registered non-profit corporation. Inside that program we have an appetite for curling clubs.”

While Capreol is the only curling club he currently insures under that program he does have two more quotes pending. He only became aware of the situation in January and is more than happy to help any other curling club.

“This is a unique opportunity for us it's a good opportunity” he said. “We have a dedicated underwriting department for this program. The only catch is that we probably can't underwrite every single club that comes to us. Someone might come to me with a curling club in the middle of nowhere. It's 120 years old and it's made of frame the rates are going to be different”

Cantin has a long history with curling which is another reason he is willing to help them with their insurance issues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbG9mZnBhdGguY29tL2tsbS1oYXMtMTY3LXdvcmxkd2lkZS1yb3V0ZXMtdGhpcy1zdW1tZXItd2l0aC0xMi1kaXJlY3QtZmxpZ2h0cy1mcm9tLXRoZS11LXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KLM Has 167 Worldwide Routes This Summer With 12 Direct Flights From The U.S.,"Post may contain affiliate links; we may receive compensation if you click links to those products.

We are presenting their answers online in full and as sent except for any minor typos/spelling errors.

Democratic candidate Michael Trimble

https://www.trimbleforgov.com/

What sets you apart from the other candidates?

Oregon desperately needs a well-informed hard-working everyday citizen willing to use the governorship to enact progressive change. I am a grassroots candidate unlike Kotek and Read who are part of the elite Democratic establishment backed by special interests/big dollar corporate lobbyists. Too many Oregonians live the paycheck-to-paycheck struggle just one financial disaster away from homelessness. As a gay immigrant who gained citizenship through adoption I learned at a very young age to be a fighter for rights being born without arms and surrendered to an orphanage at birth.

My lived life experience which has had me fighting from the day I was born without arms sets me apart from the other candidates. My lack of arms has placed me at an incredible disadvantage very similar to the tens of millions of Americans with physical and mental challenges who have been discriminated against abused and discarded by society left behind to fend for themselves.

I will govern from the perspective that I am you fighting for you everyday. Living without arms is not easy but it has taught me an invaluable lesson to never give up proving my detractors and the naysayers wrong. Oregon needs a fighter like me someone who is not afraid to shake up the elite Democratic establishment that has left us hurting homeless underinsured underpaid undervalued and living paycheck to paycheck with no hopes in sight o being able to save for our retirement or even for a rainy fund day.

Kroger is a case in point wrongfully terminating because they wanted me to carry my adaptive bike up a flight of stairs into a smoking section as opposed to letting me walk my bike through the front door. I fought back and sue them ultimately coming to an agreed settlement. https://youtu.be/Xrch3_ZT0i0 and https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/16/an-armless-man-couldnt-carry-his-bike-up-the-stairs-he-says-it-cost-him-his-job/ is that story covered by KATU News and the Washington Post. My story was syndicated nationwide. People could not believe that Kroger would terminate a physically challenged individual who chose to work contributing his part to society.

I will take that same wit and grit to Salem and make state government work for you instead of sitting on my hands like my opponents who have have been in elected office for years. Our lives have only worsened and our problems have only grown under the leadership of experienced politicians.

What are your top three priorities and plans to address them?

I will expand Oregon Health Plan to all Oregonians regardless of income. Healthcare after housing is the next biggest expenditure that must come down. I will curtail healthcare costs along with prescription drug prices setting annual ceiling caps to prevent unnecessary bankruptcies guaranteeing a set amount spent on healthcare in any given year.

I will raise minimum wage to $15 an hour in my first 100 days. I will follow that up with instituting a living wage of $25 an hour at all companies reporting billion dollar plus earnings quarterly along with profit sharing with their employees. I will require all corporations pay a use of public infrastructure tax as well as their fair share. The days of billion dollar profit corporations not paying any taxes are over.

I will lower rents of middle-to-low-income by at least $100 at multi-unit apartment properties in my first 100 days while I work with the legislature to ultimately cap rents of middle-to-low-income to 30% of their income in my first term. I will ban all rent related nonrefundable fees including application and pet fees as well as criminalize vacancies longer than 45 days. If a vacancy can't be filled after 45 days the government will give that unit to a tenant on the waiting list. There is no reason for vacancies with so many people looking for housing. Where I live there have been vacant units sitting unoccupied for months because the property management company refuses to rent at below market value. All that will end as your governor. I will mandate Section 8 be accepted by all landlords/property managers and work to cut the obscenely egregious waiting lists/times to under 100 days. I will seize all vacant buildings/properties under eminent domain and give them to nonprofits/organizations/agencies ready to convert them into housing. I will overhaul zoning to discourage single unit only dwellings to expand multi unit/shared dwellings.

RENT/HOUSING IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT NOT A PRIVILEGE OR A LUXURY

What one accomplishment are you most proud of and why?

Despite not having arms I am an avid cyclist. It is the most liberating experience of a thrill as close to flying as one can get to!

I rode my first bike at a gay conversion Christian boarding school where the pastor felt bad I couldn’t participate in any of the physical sports/exercises the other residents could. He found some old discarded steel pipe and hammered/welded it into a “handlebar” of sorts that I could steer. Despite our many disagreements over lifestyles and world viewpoints he willed into reality something I never thought was possible.

Years passed before I tried to get back on the bike again. I was living in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania when I approached bike shop after bike shop only to be told what I wanted was a fools errand to a guaranteed death or that I was a legal liability. I finally found a bike mechanic who not only was awe struck and inspired by my will to pedal on in life despite my many challenges but he jumped at the chance to reunite me with my lost love. The Pittsburgh Post Gazette did an awesome story chronicling my biketastic journey (https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2013/09/22/Pittsburgh-bicycle-maker-builds-wheels-for-man-without-arms/stories/201309220017) (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tus2FS1L-kw is the video version).

Pittsburgh though wasn’t exactly a cyclist’s haven with their mountain like hills and freezing winters with feet upon feet of snow. So I biked off to find more bike friendly terrain ultimately landing me in Portland Oregon where I traded in my single speed steel cruiser for an 11 speed electronic shifting bike with a Schlumpf gear in the front giving me 22 gears! The cycling wizard who willed this biking beast into cycling reality created from scratch and fabricated what would come to be my braking mechanism which I control with my knee.

Everything was biking along quite biketastically until I biked into Kroger’s lane who wrongfully terminated me over my adaptive bike. They wanted me to carry my bike up a flight of stairs into a smoking section as opposed to letting me walk my bike through the front door. I fought back and sue them ultimately coming to an agreed settlement. https://youtu.be/Xrch3_ZT0i0 and https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/16/an-armless-man-couldnt-carry-his-bike-up-the-stairs-he-says-it-cost-him-his-job/ is that story covered by KATU News and the Washington Post. My story was syndicated nationwide. People could not believe that Kroger would terminate a physically challenged individual who chose to work contributing his part to society.

Then on June 16 2018 my bike sent me into a 9 day coma as a result of an accident I to this day don’t fully remember. Prior to this Doomed The 18 Of June fateful day I refused to wear a helmet. OHSU told me if I had been wearing a helmet I was sustain a major concussion but would not have ended up in a nine day coma. Obviously having escaped death by the chain of my bike I wear a helmet and am an avid advocate of these life savers. Most people are shocked and stunned to learn I was biking within 3 months of my discharge. You know what they say “What doesn’t kill you keeps you biking.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s3_3A1bMLk is that fateful cautionary cycling tale captured on my GoPro.

To answer your question biking is one accomplishment spanning years I am most proud of as it has shown even me the impossible is beyond possible. In 2017 I biked 4004.9 miles in 2018 4144.17 miles in 2019 6724.18 miles in pandemic 2020 10868.2 miles and in 2021 6314 miles.

Why should Central Oregonians vote for you?

I will take that same wit and grit I alluded in earlier responses to Salem and make state government work for you instead of sitting on my hands like my opponents who have have been in elected office for years. Our lives have only worsened and our problems have only grown under the leadership of experienced politicians.

I know just how painful this inflation has been for all Oregonians. I will use this opportunity to enact real tax and regulatory reforms that will strengthen our economy for decades with tax credits ranging from $250 to $500 and taxpayer rebates. For the time being I’ll be freezing the state’s gas tax. These short term measures will be an immense relief to Central Oregon.

We need pro-growth tax reform that will benefit everyone in the state both by keeping more money in taxpayers’ pockets and by boosting economic growth. Since inflation is the result of too much money chasing too few goods more production and economic growth can also combat inflation in the long run. We need to start exploring ways to reduce the state’s income tax rates and potentially eliminate the income tax altogether replacing it with an excise tax.

In addition to a temporary tax cut as governor I will lead a widespread regulatory relief as a way to lower prices and expand economic opportunity. I will look at streamlining many regulatory restrictions including adopting sunset provisions offsetting new regulations by cutting outdated ones and strengthening the economic analysis of regulations to ensure the benefits of regulations outweigh the costs.

One of my priorities is to eliminate all in-state tuition and forgive existing in-state tuition debt which will help untold tens of thousands of Oregonians. That in addition to lower rents higher wages truly affordable and universal healthcare set me apart from the rest of the contenders in this election.

Get a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee

Diane Stowers 66 owned one of the last remaining Black gas stations in the country – located on the corner of North Eighth Street and West Atkinson Avenue – for 31 years.

On Oct. 18 she hung up her hose and passed it on to another Black business owner: Kai Trimble-Lea.

“When we came in there were plenty of Black-owned gas stations” Stowers told me late last year.

“Many were on the city’s North Side – 27th Street and Burleigh Fourth Street and Center 27th Street and Capitol. Passing the business on to a Black owner was important to me. I didn’t want to leave without it being a Black-owned business” she said.

The gas station is one of only 29 Black-owned gas stations in the United States. According to the American Petroleum Institute there are more than 150000 gas stations nationwide.

“When I was growing up I saw it all the time: Black gas stations and corner stores. But today sad to say it’s a lot of people that don’t believe Black people can own stuff. It was important for me to remain Black-owned for our culture” Stowers said.

Stowers affectionately called Ms. Diane by the community is known for her trademark silver hair. She’s worked six to seven days a week for decades. Now she wants to do other things including traveling.

“This is a good time in my life to pass things on because I’m still able to help out and do some training and there are things I can teach” she said.

Trimble-Lea a Black woman in her 40s is the new owner of the BP gas station and was born and raised in Milwaukee in the Sherman Park neighborhood.

She was fortunate enough to work with Ms. Diane before she retired learning the ins and outs of the business and becoming well-versed in its day-to-day operations.

When asked how it felt to receive the keys Trimble-Lea said “I thought it would be this miraculous big difference and change but it wasn’t. I was fortunate enough she allowed me to come in two days a week and we even drove to the closing together.”

Stowers has seen many changes over three decades being on this corner. The biggest change she’s noticed is a level of anger in children that wasn’t prevalent in earlier years. And it makes her sad.

She also said the community as a whole is a lot angrier and not as respectful as it once was.

But “when they come through these doors there’s respect and I love that. They try to right their attitude and don’t curse in front of me. They keep the bathroom clean but they do throw their trash in the lot sometimes. I think they think they are keeping somebody employed” she said laughing.

Trimble-Lea said she feels proud to be a part of such history.

“I’m so fortunate the staff she had were gracious and stayed on board because they believe in this station and I believe in this station so it’s important that it thrives and prospers.”

Trimble-Lea has found her footing the last several months and speaks highly of Stowers’ legacy: “I feel like I have been adopted into the family and we really do care about each other here. Ms. Diane is such a beautiful God-fearing person and she is committed to the community.”

When I asked Stowers what she liked most about her years in the business she answered without hesitation.

“I enjoy serving people. That is my calling. When I get up in the morning to come to work I am coming to serve my people” she said.

Stowers wants Black people to understand we can give and get good service too without having to go to the suburbs.

Meanwhile as Trimble-Lea adjusts to being the owner she has plans to expand the offerings at the station including adding new pumps diesel gas and new tanks.

Her ultimate goal is to own another station. “There’s no reason there’s only one. Why isn’t there two three or four like it used to be?”

Said Trimble-Lea “We are a beautiful people and we deserve the best so I want you to walk in here and feel that.”

Its features include the safety deposit vault.

Crafted & Cured was created in downtown Dayton in 2016 by co-owners Christian Alvarez and Andy Routson. The business closed in mid-2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic with plans to reopen in the Arcade before the owners turned their attention to the Troy location.

The timeframe for the business opening has yet to be determined although the owners mentioned later this year. They said they will add a craft beer bar with keg cooler and convert the current catering kitchen to a prep kitchen which will require light renovations. The structure itself will not be altered the owners said.

Alvarez and Routson said they were introduced to downtown Troy and the revitalization of the bank building four to five years ago by local leaders.

“We love the original architecture of the building. The renovation accentuates the beauty and preservation of the original architecture. We admire the historical value of the building in the community” Routson said. “Due to the grand nature it helps to meet our needs to extend accommodations to our guests for group parties private parties and community gatherings.” The building was constructed in the late 1920s.

The existing businesses had a “huge role” in the decision to come to Troy.

“We love to be surrounded by independently owned and operated specialty businesses. We believe that we complement the existing businesses” Alvarez said. “We look forward to partnering with fellow local businesses in a variety of ways to contribute to a vibrant downtown economy. ""

The owners plan to hire up to 30 team members and are looking for candidates for full time managerial positions charcutiers and bartenders. Future expansion phases include catering and on-site community events.

“Crafted & Cured is a natural strong addition to Troy’s historic downtown” Westfall said. “Given its proven record of creating a memorable unique and delicious experience for customers in Dayton I look forward to Crafted & Cured being a similar destination for visitors and residents in Troy.”

Troy Main Street the downtown advocacy organization is excited to welcome Crafted and Cured said Andrea Keller Main Street executive director.

“We look forward to having a new business in downtown that is unlike any other. We are just as eager as everyone to taste their assortment of meats and cheeses as well as their variety of drinks” she said. “We are always happy when a business chooses to open in downtown Troy and we will work to support them in any way we can.”

Alvarez and Routson said they plan to be a part of the Dayton community in the future.

“We value the opportunity to have launched our business in Downtown Dayton. We are extremely grateful to have built a valuable customer-base and relationships with the downtown community” Routson said. “We are actively seeking a home in Downtown Dayton to meet our needs. We will continue our search and continue to implement plans to engage our downtown customers.

A Missouri man has been convicted after shooting at law enforcement officers while fleeing a failed bank robbery.

Jacob Allen Monteer 30 of Drexel was found guilty following a bench trial before U.S. District Judge Brian C. Wimes on Monday March 21 of one count of bank robbery one count of brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence two counts of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence and one count of being a drug user in possession of firearms. The court’s verdict was announced. Monteer remains in federal custody without bond.

On Nov. 30 2017 Monteer attempted to rob US Bank 401 W. Newton in Versailles Mo. Monteer armed with a Springfield 9mm semi-automatic pistol walked into the bank with a bandana across his face and demanded money at gunpoint. He jumped over the teller station and opened the teller drawer but there was no money in the drawer. Monteer fled from the bank in a stolen pick-up truck.

As Monteer led law enforcement officers on a high-speed pursuit he fired several shots at the police chief of Stover Mo. who had set up a roadblock. Monteer then lost control of the stolen vehicle and crashed. He attempted to flee on foot but was apprehended by the sheriff of Morgan County. During their struggle Monteer was able to fire a round from the sheriff’s AR-15 .223-caliber rifle before being subdued.

Monteer later admitted to law enforcement officers that he was a drug addict and used methamphetamine daily. Officers searched his vehicle and found drug paraphernalia.

Under federal statutes Monteer is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 27 years in federal prison without parole up to a sentence of life in federal prison without parole. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.

This case is being prosecuted by Supervisory Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael S. Oliver. It was investigated by the FBI the Morgan County Mo. Sheriff’s Department the Stover Mo. Police Department and the Versailles Mo. Police Department.

This marks the close of a lengthy battle with the city’s transportation agency Transport for London (TfL) over Uber’s safety protocols.

“We’re delighted to announce @TfL has granted Uber a new 30 month licence in London” Uber announced in a tweet on Saturday morning. “TfL rightly holds our industry to the highest regulatory and safety standards and we are pleased to have met their high bar.”

Uber first lost its license to operate in London in 2017 after TfL accused the company of demonstrating “a lack of corporate responsibility” with potential “public safety and security implications.” It cited the company’s shortcomings when it came to reporting criminal offenses issuing driver background checks obtaining medical certificates and also brought up Uber’s alleged use of Greyball a software that hid the ride-hailing service from regulators.

Last year Uber lost a legal battle in the UK over its drivers' employment status. This required the company to start classifying its UK-based drivers as employees granting them minimum wage paid vacation and other benefits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMjYvdWJlci13aW5zLTMwLW1vbnRoLWxvbmRvbi1saWNlbnNlLmh0bWzSAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wMy8yNi91YmVyLXdpbnMtMzAtbW9udGgtbG9uZG9uLWxpY2Vuc2UuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber wins 30-month London license ending a lengthy battle with city regulators,"LONDON — Uber has secured a 30-month license to continue operating in London ending a protracted battle with city regulators over whether the ride-hailing app was ""fit and proper.""

""Uber has been granted a London private hire vehicle operator's license for a period of two and a half years"" a Transport for London spokesperson said in a statement Saturday.

The move ends a years-long spat with the agency which twice revoked Uber's London license — once in 2017 and a second time in 2019. Authorities were concerned about the company's ability to keep passengers safe. Uber subsequently won an 18-month London permit in court.

Uber has sought to turn on the charm over the years adding new safety features to its platform and striking a deal with Britain's GMB to formally recognize the labor union for its private hire drivers.

The company reclassified all its U.K. drivers as workers last year after the country's top court ruled a group of drivers should be treated as workers instead of independent contractors entitling them to employment protections like a minimum wage holiday pay and pensions.

""TfL rightly holds our industry to the highest regulatory and safety standards and we are pleased to have met their high bar"" Jamie Heywood Uber's regional general manager for Northern and Eastern Europe said in a statement.

The decision removes a key source of uncertainty for Uber in the U.K. — London is its largest European market — and comes as the company is dealing with rising inflation amid the twin challenges of a labor shortage and surging energy prices. Uber hiked its London fares by 10% in November.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3VwZXItcHVtcGVkLXRoZS1iYXR0bGUtZm9yLXViZXItc2Vhc29uLTEtZXBpc29kZS01LXJlY2FwLXRoZS1jaGFybS1vZmZlbnNpdmUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Super Pumped: The Battle For Uber' Season 1 Episode 5 Recap,"Super Pumped isn’t a show that needs more storytelling devices given the glut of illustrative titles backscreens and animations on top of Quentin Tarantino’s voiceover narration. Adding “breaking the fourth wall” to the list as “The Charm Offensive” does seems like a bad idea an unnecessary narrative shortcut currently plaguing the mostly entertaining HBO series Winning Time. Yet the structure of this dense purposeful episode makes talking to the camera akin to a courtroom testimonial with Tim Cook as the presiding judge Uber employees like Susan Fowler and Fawzi Kamel as witnesses and viewers acting as jurors in the court of premium cable opinion. And so in the words of many an indulgent TV judge “I’ll allow it.”

The fulcrum for the episode is a meeting Travis Kalanick takes with Eddy Cue and Tim Cook who are threatening to pull Uber from the App Store after the company’s deliberate and reckless violation of Apple’s privacy policies. In the meeting before the meeting Travis cannot humble himself enough to acknowledge the seriousness of the problem much less consider an apology. When his co-founder peeps mouse-like about how this could be Uber’s Waterloo he cracks “Napoleon was a great general. I’m not knocking the little man. But he was not making France the kind of coin that I’m making for Apple.” And when Emil his more fiercely loyal right hand advises an apology (“Saying sorry costs nothing”) the idea sits like ash in his mouth. That’s not the Uber way.

There’s one sliver of a reason to understand Travis’ indignation at this moment even as most humans would recognize him as spectacularly arrogant. As Travis knows — and would have no trouble reminding people as he did when he asked board members to cheer him like Kirk Gibson at Dodger Stadium — his take-no-prisoners rule-breaking style is the reason why Uber is the force that it is fully enabled by the men (always men) who put him in that position. Now these same men want him to change course as if he isn’t the Frankenstein’s monster they all had a hand in creating. It’s not in Travis’ nature to feel remorse for his actions or sympathy for the victims of his ambition and his behavior was never curbed so long as he was winning. This rant to Cook lays bare that Silicon Valley hypocrisy:

“That’s what it means to be a disruptor. You want to punish me for embodying the spirit that built the Valley? That built this building that we’re sitting in right now?”

Nevertheless the App Store issue does represent an actual existential crisis for the company even if Travis is ultimately correct in predicting that Apple isn’t inclined to yank such a popular app from its service. The situation allows Cook to grill Travis over his company’s sins which in turn allows the show to do likewise with powerful vignettes around Fowler and Kamel and glimpses of Uber’s calamitous “charm offensive” with a press corps it had persistently antagonized. In every case Travis’s worst qualities as a person and a manager finally inflict serious damage to the company and his leadership failures.

Much of Fowler’s piece of the story is drawn from her widely read blog post from February 2017 titled “Reflecting on One Very Very Strange Year at Uber.” In an earlier episode we already saw the astonishing account of her first day on the job when her team leader suggestively mentioned his “open relationship.” That started her own open relationship with Uber’s HR department albeit one without a moment’s satisfaction for Fowler. It may seem inelegant on the show’s part to have Fowler tell her story directly to the camera rather than dramatize the subtle and not-so-subtle evidence that Uber is a hostile work environment for women. But Fowler’s blog post lays out the case so well that adapting it directly to the screen seems like the most economical and forceful solution. Working on a genuine world-changing app is exciting for Fowler and other women at the company and so the solution in the face of rampant misogyny and a complicit HR department was simply to try to fit in. But at a certain point that becomes impossible for Fowler and many women at the company.

The show had also sketched some of Kamel’s story in the lead-up to this episode like a scene where he chooses to sleep in his car because he needed to log more driving hours to make ends meet. Here his financial struggles are multiplied by his purchase of a luxury car for Uber Black a decision the company encouraged and supported through a loan program. But in the fascinating dashboard video of Kamel confronting a defensive Kalanick it’s clear that the company’s drivers once lured by big incentives to work to Uber are now hung out to dry by low pricing no tips and poor commissions. The plan for riders and drivers is the same: Spend billions in VC money to kill the cab industry and bring them on board then squeeze them later when they have nowhere else to go. Travis feels perfectly content being a “shit-heel company.”

And so it’s with a smug wink that he gathers the press for an off-the-record dinner and announces “I’m not a rapacious industrialist. I’m just a man stewarding a world-altering vision that’s exceeding all expectations.” Even with a communications team desperate for Travis to make peace with the press and avoid a long list of controversial topics he cannot keep himself from glibly peacocking for journalists or expressing his grievances about their supposedly unfair coverage. On the other end of the table Emil uses “off the record” as blanket immunity for startling slanders about reporters particularly one named Olivia that the company was doing oppo research on with the intention of revealing her as a “slut” who cheats on her husband. BuzzFeed reporter Ben Smith who never agreed to the company’s restrictions on the event dutifully reports about it creating another PR headache.

In the end Cook’s interrogation results in a slap on the wrist just as Travis predicted. Money forgives everything.

Off The Meter

• Travis’s problems with women include those closest to him. In an early scene we never actually hear the “good news” Gabi wants to share with Travis who’s so buzzed by his own victories that he’s more interested in finding the Wii remote. Then his mother tries to counsel him on how to handle reports that Uber is putting women and children in danger a charge that Travis waves off as “middle school stuff.” She counters “Except you’re not in middle school anymore. You’re a grown man and you need to take responsibility and face your problems head-on.” Sorry mom.

• “I have nothing but respect for Apple’s commitment to privacy” gets the burst of open laughter it deserves.

• Not to be outflanked in the rapacious industrialist department Cook blows right past Travis calling him out on the worker abuses at Foxconn the notorious company that manufactures Apple products and ends the meeting by cooly announcing that Uber’s multi-billion dollar investment in China is for naught. Check and mate.

• At this point the conversation shifts to whether Travis’s various missteps are “survivable.” No doubt this will be fleshed out more in the next episode but it’s telling that Travis’ decision to pull Anthony Levandowski away from Google’s autonomous vehicle program is a far graver misstep than his long list of managerial abuses. Losing money is again the only unforgivable crime in business.

• Most of the figures in Super Pumped are dramatized under their real names but “Olivia” is an amalgam of multiple journalists. In this episode Olivia is a stand-in for Sarah Lacy the founder and EIC of PandoDaily. A full account of her battles with Kalanick and Uber can be found on Vox.

• Strongly considered bumping up the rating a full star for The Replacements’ “Here Comes a Regular” needle drop. The song is about people retreating to a bar “after a hard day of nothin’ much at all.” Quite a different feeling for an Uber employee than drawing from a keg in Las Vegas."

Rihanna and Rocky were initially linked in November of 2020 after it was reported that they were seeing each other following the singer's split from her ex-boyfriend Hassan Jameel.

The two had been acquainted ever since the early 2010s when they began performing and touring with each other.

Rihanna and Rocky remained friends for much of the decade before People confirmed that they were officially dating in November 2020.

The two embarked on a romantic vacation to the singer's native Barbados the following month and the rapper spent Christmas with his girlfriend's family.

A separate source spoke to People and noted that although the pair had just started seeing each other they were very invested in each other.

While there are many ways to update your life to accomplish this the easiest and most affordable method (and my personal favorite) is to take on the new season in style with the simple pop of a vibrant spring lipstick. A good lipstick has a unique transformative power being able to completely change a look with zero effort and is undoubtedly the one beauty product I could not live without.

I’ve been obsessed with lipstick since I was a kid and while I’ve always been loyal to a select few products (I’ve been using the same MAC shade for over 10 years) this spring I plan to branch out of my beauty comfort zone and try out more playful color trends to freshen up my look. After all the statement lip is back in a big way.

In addition to leaning into more fun makeup colors I’ll be able to play with different textures whether it’s a creamy hydrating formula a matte or a gloss since with warmer weather I bid goodbye to my ultra-dry lips and the constant need to reapply chapstick. My lips have made it through the harsh winter months where I forewent wearing lipstick to save them for the brighter days ahead and now the possibilities are endless for a bold spring lip.

Gone are the days of dark plum and berry stained lips (fall beauty’s “florals for spring” equivalent) that we rely on to take us through fall and winter — now the spring lineup is here and it’s filled with dreamy pinks and peaches you’ll fall in love with upon first swipe. The beauty of lipstick is that a little bit goes a long way. Whether you’re going au natural or wearing a full face of makeup a touch of lip color enhances the full look and makes you feel completely put together ready to take on the new season by storm.

If you’re looking for an effortless way to refresh your beauty look ahead find the four lipstick shades I can’t get enough of this spring.

We only include products that have been independently selected by TZR's editorial team. However we may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.

Pouty Pink Lipstick

A soft and demure pink is officially my go-to spring neutral. It’s subtle enough to double as your daily color while still offering more of a playful pop than a traditional nude lip color does. It’s all about finding a shade with the perfect balance of pigment and still feeling natural against your own lip color. This ultra-feminine tone matches the energy of spring in bloom and I simply can’t get enough of it.

Fiery Red Lipstick

A fiery red with orange undertones is the vibrant shade your warm-weather style needs. It’s been growing in popularity over the last year and this season it’s ready for its closeup. The cherry-red hue screams summer fun vs. deeper and darker red tones that tend to lean more wintery. I absolutely adore the look of no makeup except a bold red lip. I’ll be rocking fiery reds all season long on date nights girls' nights out and at spring and summer soirees.

‘90s Nude Lipstick

‘90s style is still top of mind for fashion girls everywhere and this translates straight into the beauty category as well. Ultra ‘90s nude and brown hues will be lining my vanity this season for a statement lip paired with both liner and gloss for a full Y2K ~lewk~.

Peach Passion Lipstick

In the past I’ve been wary of bright lipstick colors and I would certainly consider peach hues to be in this category but for the first time ever I am so excited to wear this shade. A bit more quirky than pink peach lips give off a radiant finish to your full look offering a refreshing glow. The hue feels both romantic and also a bit brazen and will definitely enhance your natural lip color.",,,

He was 68.

The cause was complications of lung cancer his sister Victoria Hawley Rome said.

After 9/11 Mr. Hawley a well-respected California business executive with expertise in transportation logistics was summoned to Washington by Norman Mineta the transportation secretary under President George W. Bush to oversee the establishment of the T.S.A. which Congress had charged with protecting the nation’s transportation systems.

Mr. Hawley’s mission included the daunting mobilization of a new 50000-member federal airport screening force; an expansion of the federal air marshal service; and the installation of huge bomb-detection machines to screen checked luggage at more than 400 commercial airports nationwide. The fledgling agency also worked with airlines to reinforce cockpit doors on commercial aircraft. An attempt by Richard Reid the so-called shoe bomber to ignite explosives hidden in his shoes during a flight from Paris to Miami in December 2001 only added to the urgency.

Three administrators led the T.S.A. between 2002 and 2005; during that time Mr. Hawley served as chairman of the Federal Aviation Administration’s Air Traffic Services board with oversight of the air traffic control system. He was named T.S.A. administrator in 2005 and stayed through the end of the Bush administration in early 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-founders and sisters Louise Van Winkle Breen Carrie Van Winkle Greener and Chenault Van Winkle James worked with UPS and others to find the best way to get customers their online orders as fast and as cheap as possible.

Eventually the small business partnered entirely with UPS helping them not just to survive but thrive.

Since the beginning of the pandemic Pappy & Co. has transitioned from about 55 percent UPS shipments to nearly 90 percent UPS shipments.

What they’re saying: “We already had a strong online presence but I don’t think anyone knew what to expect in 2020” Chenault said. “It became apparent that we wouldn’t be reopening the storefront anytime soon so we wanted to up our game online.”

“Pappy & Company and UPS have been great partners” Chenault said. “UPS has really helped us scale the business.”

Making the switch: The sister trio took a customer-first approach in how they listened learned and acted on behalf of their customers.

“We made a decision as a company that our customers’ happiness is everything to us” Louise said. “So we rerouted those packages [from other carriers] and delivered them using UPS. We pride ourselves on our customer service and a big part of that comes down to knowing the customer and knowing when they're going to get their package.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXBwbGVpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMi8wMy8yNi90aGUtYmVzdC11c3BzLXVwcy1hbmQtZmVkZXgtdHJhY2tpbmctYXBwcy1mb3ItaW9zLWFuZC1tYWNvc9IBa2h0dHBzOi8vYXBwbGVpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMi8wMy8yNi90aGUtYmVzdC11c3BzLXVwcy1hbmQtZmVkZXgtdHJhY2tpbmctYXBwcy1mb3ItaW9zLWFuZC1tYWNvcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best USPS UPS and Fedex tracking apps for iOS and macOS,"If you buy through our links we may get a commission.

If you get deliveries regularly there are many ways to track what's on the way. Here are the best iPhone iPad and macOS apps for tracking parcels going through major delivery networks.

Not all that long ago sending a package to someone was a set-and-forget task. You would send it off and hope to get an update from the other end that it would appear safely and on time.

This lack of knowledge of what's happening with a delivery was also quite apparent for people who ordered goods and services. You'd get told of a dispatch but updates were few and far between unless you paid for more expensive delivery options that offered updates.

Delivery services have advanced over the last few years with tracking features in apps and websites providing customers with updates on where their package has traveled on its way to the recipient for most customers. Updates about entering and departing regional depots and warehouses have also evolved with some services even offering tracking of the final delivery van as they go along their route.

Even with this advancement in technology there's still the problem for users knowing where to look. With many options available to send a package from A to B you have to monitor multiple delivery apps simultaneously.

This is especially true at peak times such as when you're waiting for holiday shopping orders from multiple retailers to turn up at your door. It's unlikely that they will collectively use just one of USPS FedEx UPS or DHL.

Thankfully instead of constantly checking multiple apps there are options that simplify the process. Apps are available for keeping tabs of packages going through more than one service giving you just one place to monitor.

Here are the apps you should be looking at to take the stress out of waiting for a package to arrive.

What about the delivery company apps?

While this list primarily deals with apps covering multiple delivery companies you should also keep an eye on the apps those delivery firms offer to users:

All four of these apps provide features specific to each service. They all include tracking for packages entered into their systems but they also offer other services.

This can include calculating shipping prices scheduling pick-ups creating shipments printing labels measuring packages and changing delivery dates.

These extra features certainly make the apps indispensable for someone who repeatedly sends out packages such as a small business owner who uses a small number of delivery firms a lot. For people who tend to receive parcels than send them they are not quite as useful as a less specialized app.

Parcel - Delivery Tracking

Parcel is a great example of a delivery tracking app done well. Available in two versions Parcel for macOS and Parcel for iOS enables users to get notifications on practically the entire Apple device ecosystem including the Apple Watch.

The app can acquire tracking information for 300 delivery services around the world. Major US delivery services are included and Amazon Logistics and other firms.

Amazon tracking doesn't stop with logistics. Integration with Amazon lets the app automatically add orders for tracking without needing any intervention from the user.

A Notification Center widget can display expected deliveries for today or tomorrow. Push notifications from the app are also limited to surface between 8 am and 10 pm by default but this can be disabled.

Parcel is free to download but features including push notifications and tracking more than 3 deliveries require a premium subscription. Currently that premium option is $4.99 per year.

Deliveries: a package tracker

In a similar vein to our first pick Deliveries is a cross-platform delivery-tracking tool that does so on macOS iOS iPadOS and Apple Watch. Where it differs is in its use of color between carriers to make the app more visually interesting and easier to understand.

With the support of dozens of services in the U.S. and beyond the app can also monitor orders from Amazon and Apple even before they ship. For services not supported by the app you can enter a delivery date and a website you can visit with it counting down the days to the package's theoretical arrival.

You also don't have to keep the tracking information within the app. It is possible to share the shipment with others over email AirDrop or iMessage.

There's a Notification Center widget for at-a-glance updates. You can even have the estimated delivery dates added to Calendar so you could potentially plan events around package deliveries.

Free to download Deliveries costs $0.99 per month or $4.99 for a yearly subscription.

Route: Package Tracker

Route for iOS and iPadOS provides similar tracking features to the others including live tracking and real-time push notifications but it offers a more shopping-centric experience.

For a start it supports over 600 shipping carriers worldwide but it also benefits from connections to many retailers and online stores. A lot of this is handled by connecting Route to your inbox so that it can detect new orders and deliveries.

This connection also brings order resolution options for over 11000 merchants so that you can claim for missing orders or damaged goods right from the app. There's also a universal order history so you can search multiple stores for products you ordered in the past at the same time.

Being so retailer-centric the app also includes shopping tools including product discovery and being able to follow brands for new products.

Route is free to download with no in-app purchases.

AfterShip Package Tracker

Boasting support for over 700 carriers around the world AfterShip is an iOS and iPadOS package tracker that again offers a considerable number of services it can check at a time. Handily for users it will automatically detect which carrier a package uses based on the tracking number. However it can also do the same for parcel senders with its barcode scanner.

If you have a tracking number list you can also copy and paste them in en masse to save time. There are options to share tracking links easily so others can see the order's progress for themselves.

Like Route AfterShip provides an enhanced retail-based experience with it able to check the delivery status of orders from retailers like Amazon eBay AliExpress and others. Automatic importing of shipments from Amazon Etsy and Walmart is included and monitoring shipment details sent to a Gmail account.

The app is free to normal users wanting to see shipments of packages but this is down to AfterShip offering chargeable services to retailers such as branded tracking pages and shipment analytics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL2Fib3V0LnVwcy5jb20vdHIvdHIvbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvY3VzdG9tZXItZmlyc3QvdXBzLWFubm91bmNlcy1udW1lcm91cy1wcm9kdWN0cy1hbmQtaW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXByb2dyYW1zLXRvLWhlbHAtc21icy1ncm93LWFuZC1jb21wZXRlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPS KOBİ'lerin Büyümesi ve Rekabet Edebilmesine Yardımcı Olacak Çeşitli Ürün Ve Yenilikçi Teknoloji Programlarını ...,"Atlanta GA

After attending a glamorous reception on Friday night Kate Middleton and Prince William stepped out for their final day in The Bahamas — and the last day of their week-long tour of the Caribbean.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge traveled to Abaco's main island on Saturday to learn about the impact of Hurricane Dorian and to see how communities are still being rebuilt more than two years later.

On September 1 2019 Abaco was dramatically hit by the hurricane which saw winds of up to 185mph and left devastation in its wake. It damaged 75% of homes across the chain of islands and resulted in a tragic loss of life. Queen Elizabeth wrote to the Governor-General to express her condolences following the hurricane.

For her final day of outings Kate wore a bright pink dress by the British brand RIXO wedge heel espadrilles and carried a matching pink clutch.

The group called Civica Rx and based in Utah plans to produce what are known as ""biosimilar"" versions of three insulins now on the market. It will set a maximum recommended price for consumers of no more than $30 for a vial and no more than $55 for a box of five pen cartridges.

Patients today might pay much more out-of-pocket for insulin in those quantities advocates say if they lack insurance or have coverage that comes with high deductibles.

The nonprofit group argues the affordability problem stems from a lack of transparency with current insulin prices and how money gets split among companies in the pharmaceutical supply chain.

Those corporate actors range from pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) and drug manufacturers to health insurers medicine distributors pharmacies and employers said Martin VanTrieste the president and chief executive at Civica Rx.

""Even with some introduction of biosimilars now to the market manufacturers and PBMs are incentivized — as all for-profit companies are — to make money off their products"" VanTrieste said.

""So even if they lower the price and provide pass-through rebates the costs of insulin remain high and unattainable for millions of Americans especially for those who are uninsured or underinsured.""

Trade groups for companies along the pharmaceutical supply chain push back on suggestions that they're to blame for high insulin costs. They sometimes point to other players along the continuum. Meanwhile state and federal lawmakers continue to adopt or consider laws that try to deliver savings for patients.

For Mayo tackling insulin costs via Civica makes sense because it creates a stable and affordable supply to prevent what can seem like inexplicable problems with access to the biologic said Dennis Dahlen the chief financial officer at Mayo.

Civica was launched in 2018 to manufacture dozens of sterile injectable medications that hospitalized patients used routinely for many years. Despite that longevity medical centers found they regularly were struggling with shortages and/or price spikes — problems Civica has helped address Dahlen said by manufacturing generic versions of about 60 drugs.

Mayo and other health systems make minimum purchases that create guaranteed demand for Civica's products he said but they don't rely on the nonprofit for more than half of their supply.

""It's to be a stabilizing force not a monopolistic one"" said Dahlen who is on the board of directors at Civica.

Insulin represents a new direction since it's a biologic dispensed to patients in drug stores. To guarantee a minimum level of demand 12 independent insurers that use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield brands have joined with Civica.

Whereas Civica's medications are made by contract manufacturers it is building a facility in Virginia that will make its insulin for consumers and a number of sterile injectable medications used in hospitals.

""Insulin has always ... sort of defied logic"" Dahlen said. ""Insulin has been with us forever and yet it's still possible for manufacturers to charge very high rates.

""The challenge though was the way insulin gets manufactured and distributed ... is very convoluted and very difficult to get around. So we needed more than health systems to do it. … We needed to organize with the health plans who were ultimately paying the high prices.""

While Mayo hasn't disclosed its financial support for Civica founding members contributed ""several million dollars"" Dahlen said through up-front donations and a line of credit that pays interest.

Civica's work on insulin costs is backed by several large nonprofits including JDRF the advocacy group for patients with Type 1 diabetes. Over the last 30 years there have been minimal innovations with insulin even as prices have doubled or tripled said Aaron Turner-Phifer the director of health policy at JDRF.

Uninsured patients and those with high-deductible health plans might pay out-of-pocket up to $300 for a vial of insulin or $500 for a box of five pens Turner-Phifer said. Depending on how much insulin a patient needs some could pay for a month's supply more than $1000 he said a sum that drives some people to dangerously ration their supply.

He said Civica will also bring transparency to a system where prices aren't known and mark-ups for various companies aren't seen. The group has pledged not to offer rebates avoiding a marketing practice that critics say makes it impossible for patients to understand exactly why insulin costs are so high.

""We know that the current system promotes higher list prices. But we also know that health plans and PBMs and employers at the end of the day aren't paying that list price"" Turner-Phifer said. ""So there are scenarios where there are folks with diabetes paying full list price while their health plan pays 30 percent of the list price. That's where the frustration is.""

Greg Lopes a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association said PBMs believe the key to lowering costs for insulin and drugs more broadly is more competition among manufacturers. He said drug companies have avoided doing that through tactics like extending patents on insulin products.

James Swann of America's Health Insurance Plans said in a statement: ""The only party making unreasonable profits from high insulin prices is Big Pharma.""

But Brian Newell a spokesman for the trade group PhRMA said drug companies believe competition is a good thing that helps lower costs. Manufacturers also sympathize he said with patient frustration over their insulin costs.

""To provide relief to all patients we also need to fix a broken insurance system ... [where] health plans and middlemen like PBMs pocket significant rebates and discounts"" Newell said in a statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzI3LzMtZG93LXN0b2Nrcy10dXJuLTMwMDAwMC1pbnRvLTEtbWlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Dow Stocks That Can Turn $300000 Into $1 Million by 2030,"These well-known profitable and time-tested Dow components can make you a millionaire by the turn of the decade.

In two months the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 0.46%) will celebrate its 126th ""birthday."" Since its founding in May 1896 it's evolved from a 12-stock industrial-dominated index to one that now houses 30 highly successful and diverse multinational companies.

It's also an index full of stocks that have a rich history of making patient investors money. Over the next eight years three Dow stocks stand out as having a good chance to outperform their peers. If you invest $300000 into these Dow components now they have the tools and intangible needed to potentially make you a millionaire by 2030.

Salesforce

The Dow stock I feel most confident about increasing in value by 233% over the next eight years is cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software solutions provider Salesforce.com (CRM 0.72%). Salesforce has averaged an annual gain of nearly 27% for shareholders since March 2005. In other words it doubles on average every 2.7 years.

CRM software is used by consumer-facing businesses to enhance existing customer relationships and boost sales. Some of the more common tasks businesses utilize CRM software for include overseeing online marketing campaigns handling product and service issues and running predictive sales analyses. The latter can be particularly helpful in determining which clients would be likeliest to purchase a new product or service.

As you might have guessed CRM software is geared toward the service industry. However it's made inroads in the financial healthcare and industrial sectors in recent years. CRM software is fully expected to offer low double-digit annual global growth potential through at least mid-decade if not beyond.

Salesforce slots in as the undisputed No. 1 of global CRM spending. According to a report from IDC Salesforce accounted for almost 24% of global CRM spend in the first-half of 2021. By comparison its four-closest competitors in market share didn't even add up to 20% on a combined basis. Salesforce is the go-to CRM solutions provider and is unlikely to cede significant share anytime soon.

It's also a company that's benefited immensely from inorganic growth. CEO and founder Marc Benioff has made a number of amazing acquisitions including MuleSoft Tableau Software and Slack Technologies. These deals not only expand the company's sales channels but they allow Salesforce to reach a broader audience of small-and-medium-sized businesses with their ecosystem of solutions.

Benioff is forecasting a near-doubling in full-year sales by mid-decade ($50 billion in fiscal 2026) making Salesforce the fast-growing Dow component investors should want to own.

UnitedHealth Group

Another Dow stock that can turn a $300000 investment into $1 million by 2030 is insurance and healthcare solutions giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.39%). Over the past 25 years UnitedHealth has averaged an annual return of around 19%. If we include dividends this average annual return jumps to about 20%. This means the company has been doubling investors' money on average every 3.6 years.

UnitedHealth is probably best known for its insurance segment. Even though health insurance tends to be a relatively slow-growing operating model it's very profitable. Insurance companies are typically able to pass along higher premiums to counteract rising costs.

Aside from strong premium pricing power UnitedHealth can continue to benefit from the existence of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)(sometimes referred to as ""Obamacare""). Despite the ACA requiring insurers to accept people with pre-existing conditions it also encouraged a lot of healthier people to purchase insurance as well.

However the real growth driver for UnitedHealth Group is its healthcare services subsidiary Optum. Optum has three segments of its own which provide everything from pharmacy prescription refills to data analytics and software to healthcare organizations. Optum has consistently grown faster than the insurance segment and it generally produces higher margins too. Thanks mostly to Optum Wall Street's consensus estimate calls for UnitedHealth to grow its full-year sales from $287.6 billion in 2021 to more than $497 billion by 2026. That's incredible sales growth for a megacap company.

At its current growth trajectory I believe UnitedHealth Group has the potential to more than triple its earnings per share by 2030 to north of $60 which in turn should send its shares a lot higher.

Visa

A third and final Dow stock with the ability to turn $300000 into $1 million by 2030 is payment processor Visa (V 1.56%). Over the trailing 14 years Visa has averaged an annual total return including dividends paid of around 21%. This means it's doubled investors' money on average every 3.4 years.

The most logical reason to buy Visa is the company's cyclical ties. In short it does well when the U.S. and global economy are expanding and it struggles a bit during recessions when consumers and businesses don't spend as much. The thing is recessions typically last for a few months or a couple of quarters whereas periods of economic expansion are usually measured in years. Visa is the type of company that allows patient investors to take advantage of the natural long-term expansion of the U.S. and global economy.

But let's be clear it also doesn't hurt that Visa controls a majority of credit card market share by network purchase volume in the U.S. -- the largest market for consumption in the world. Between 2009 and 2018 no payment processor saw a bigger jump in U.S. network purchase volume share than Visa. In fact Visa's 53.1% share in 2018 was 31 percentage points higher than its next-closest competitor.

Additionally Visa has a long runway with which to expand its payment infrastructure. It can do so via acquisition as it did with Visa Europe in 2016 or it can organically push into underbanked markets such as the Middle East Africa and Southeastern Asia. With much of the world still reliant on cash for transactions Visa looks to be sitting on a multidecade opportunity.

Lastly take into consideration that Visa purely acts as a payment processor and not a lender. Although lending would allow the company to reap the rewards of interest income and fees during long periods of economic expansion it would also expose it to loan delinquencies during recessions. Not lending means not having to set aside capital to cover delinquencies. This is why Visa bounces back quicker than virtually all other financial stocks following a recession or economic contraction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vcG9saWN5L2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvNTk5ODY4LWJpZGVuLW1lZXRzLXdpdGgtdWtyYWluaWFuLXJlZnVnZWVzLWluLXdhcnNhdy_SAWJodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL3BvbGljeS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLzU5OTg2OC1iaWRlbi1tZWV0cy13aXRoLXVrcmFpbmlhbi1yZWZ1Z2Vlcy1pbi13YXJzYXcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden meets with Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/policy/international/599868-biden-meets-with-ukrainian-refugees-in-warsaw/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vcG9saWN5L2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvNTk5ODY4LWJpZGVuLW1lZXRzLXdpdGgtdWtyYWluaWFuLXJlZnVnZWVzLWluLXdhcnNhdy_SAWJodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL3BvbGljeS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLzU5OTg2OC1iaWRlbi1tZWV0cy13aXRoLXVrcmFpbmlhbi1yZWZ1Z2Vlcy1pbi13YXJzYXcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NieXRlc2FwcC5jb20vbmV3cy9zcG9ydHMvaXBsLWJhdHRlcnMtd2l0aC1tb3N0LXJ1bnMtdmVyc3VzLWphc3ByaXQtYnVtcmFoL3N0b3J50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indian Premier League: Decoding the top scorers against Jasprit Bumrah,"Next Article

It was flat and round. He held it by the edges with the tips of his fingers turned it like a steering wheel and said “Dwive dwive dwive. Dwive dwive dwive.” He was annoyed at how long he was going to have to wait to be old enough to get his license. I was sympathetic because I’d been waiting much longer to be old enough for something that I wanted even more: Medicare.

For more than forty years I struggled to get decent health insurance. My first grown-up job as a fact checker at a weekly magazine came with a medical plan but my wife and I were in our early twenties and therefore didn’t think of that as a benefit. My take-home pay was less than the rent on our apartment so I quit to become a freelance writer and for months after that we had no insurance at all. Then my wife Ann Hodgman got a job at a book publisher. When our daughter Laura was born in 1984 Ann’s policy covered most of the cost of the delivery.

We moved out of the city when Laura was one and Ann became a freelance writer too. A magazine that I regularly wrote for put me on its health plan but some time later the magazine’s insurance company discovered that I wasn’t an employee and threatened to drop the entire staff. I switched to an individual policy from the same insurer at a premium I remember as about a hundred and fifty dollars a month. The magazine reimbursed me (until I stopped writing for it).

In 1990 I wrote the script for a single episode of a network television show and as a result got a year of health insurance through the Writers Guild of America. The policy was so comprehensive that it practically covered toothpaste and deodorant. That year Ann Laura our son John and I addressed every health issue we could think of. A surgeon removed a small cyst from my scalp and while he was at it I had him slice off a couple of moles what the heck. We also filled and refilled as many prescriptions as we could. We didn’t have another bonanza like that until sixteen or seventeen years later when John and two college friends were planning a trip to India. Before he left he needed several vaccinations including a three-shot rabies series for what I was told could be as much as a couple of thousand dollars. I gulped and asked our veterinarian if there was a less expensive option—but went ahead of course after finding a doctor on Martha’s Vineyard who could administer the third shot while we were on vacation. Miraculously though John’s college health plan covered all but a fifteen-dollar co-pay.

When my Writers Guild year ended I could have kept the coverage going for another eighteen months by paying for it myself under the terms of the federal COBRA law but the premiums were higher than we could afford so we went back to the policy we’d had before—which I’d actually kept paying for because I was afraid of losing it. A couple of years later I did lose it: the insurer stopped offering individual plans to anyone and we were on our own.

People who have jobs with decent benefits may not realize how tricky life in the United States is for people who don’t. Ann and I went to see a local insurance agent who described the individual medical policies offered by a couple of big insurers. But he told us that when we filled out our application forms we would need to lie: Ann was seeing a therapist and taking Prozac and he said no insurance company would agree to write an individual policy for someone like that. Lying to an insurance company carries a risk because if you get sick and the company finds out that you deceived them your coverage could disappear and they could sue you to recover claims they’ve already paid. The issue was moot however because both companies we applied to turned us down. (Individuals are riskier than groups.) As it happened a college classmate of ours had (reluctantly) ended up in the insurance business. He recommended a policy from a company we hadn’t heard of: American Republic. It had a reasonable premium and a relatively high lifetime payout limit—enough to cover at least a car accident or two—and significantly it agreed to insure us. Several years later the guy who pumped our septic tank (his business card read “It May Be Sewage to You but It’s Our Bread and Butter”) mentioned that diabetes and a heart condition made it impossible for him to get health insurance. I put him in touch with our old classmate and American Republic insured him too.

The main problem with American Republic was that I wasn’t the only one who hadn’t heard of it. Some of the doctors we used wouldn’t deal with it; they classified us as “self-pay” and charged us more than the fees they accepted from companies that regularly reimbursed them—big corporations like Aetna Blue Cross Blue Shield and UnitedHealthcare which negotiate prices with medical providers. (Negotiated prices also vary significantly from insurer to insurer.) Occasionally I was able to negotiate on my own. When John was ten he broke his wrist after a soccer game by falling off the roof of a baseball dugout. The office of the orthopedist who put the cast on his arm looked as much like an accounting firm as a medical practice: there was a huge open workspace filled with desks covered by piles of insurance forms (plus a few small examination rooms way in the back). I asked the receptionist if she would give me a discount if I paid right then with a check thereby sparing the clerks behind her the nuisance of having to find out that I hadn’t met my deductible. She knocked a couple of hundred dollars off the bill.

Not long afterward I learned that negotiation has its limits. Ann had hand surgery performed by a doctor who amazingly either had an agreement with American Republic or was willing to operate for what it was willing to pay. A few weeks later though the doctor’s office manager called to say that because we hadn’t met our deductible he was going to ignore the negotiated fee and charge us full retail. In addition he said there was the matter of certain “operating room” charges even though the surgery hadn’t been performed in a hospital. I already didn’t like this weasel; now I thought Aha! I’ve got you! But when I called American Republic to report what I assumed was insurance fraud the customer-service agent said I was wrong and that the doctor could charge whatever.

American Republic’s premiums eventually rose so high that I decided we might as well try to sign up with an insurance company that we (and our doctors) had heard of. One turned us down because I’d had Lyme disease a year or two before. (We live in Connecticut where ticks bite even people who never go outside.) Another agreed to insure me but not Ann—Prozac again. She ended up in the state’s “high-risk pool” for people who were otherwise uninsurable as individuals. Her premiums from a company I’d also never heard of were double mine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYm1jbWVkcmVzbWV0aG9kb2wuYmlvbWVkY2VudHJhbC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTAuMTE4Ni9zMTI4NzQtMDIyLTAxNTY4LXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MedMinas project: design and use of mixed methods in the evaluation of pharmaceutical services in primary health ...,"Pilot study

The pilot study was conducted from February to March 2019 and included a sample of patients and one health professional (n = 31) in five municipalities. This study had the purpose of increasing knowledge and assessing the practicalities of the field highlighting aspects that could potentially compromise data collection [57]. We identified problems related to the field team equipment research participants and venues.

The main problems regarding the field team were the interviewers’ lack of experience. Errors were committed when interviewing patients that did not fill all the study’s inclusion criteria; ignoring the ethical rule that requires participants to sign the informed consent before the interviews; taking blurry pictures conducting interviews in noisy places reading questions differently from the original text and in entering wrong participant answers. Regarding equipment we detected problems in recording and uploading the interviews. Some participants and study sites – especially the PCPs – offered extra challenges to data collection such as asking for the research instruments in advance trying to eavesdrop or interfere in other participant interviews complaining about the presence of the field team. Some of the PCP did not have the minimal infrastructure for conducting research i.e. room arrangements and furniture.

After the pilot study another round of contact by telephone and email with the municipalities was conducted to clarify the study purposes and methods and arrange data collection on the venues. We also invested in a focused refresher course to upskill the field team. We took pictures of prescriptions and medicines during interviews to increase the quality of data collected from these items.

The technicalities were solved and a protocol for field monitoring and auditing was developed by the general coordination team including criteria for interview approvals and details on in-process quality verifications such as listening to recorded interviews and database review.

Data collection

A total of 26 municipalities were included in the project and none of them withdrew the acceptance after the study began (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2 Map of the macroregions of Minas Gerais and the municipalities included in the MedMinas Project by population size Full size image

Data was collected from April to October 2019 and began by the municipalities located at the centre macroregion due to the proximity to the project’s leading institution based in Belo Horizonte where the coordination team is based.

The field team was gradually sent either in pairs or solo to each of the 26 selected municipalities following a standardized data collection plan and detailed daily schedule. Upon arrival in each municipality the field team delivered introductory letters to health professionals at the selected facilities and health managers at the Municipal Health Secretariat even though we had a formal agreement with all the municipalities and had exchanged comprehensive information about the project with health managers and professionals before going to the field. Only those that agreed to participate were interviewed at the workplace.

Most managers and professionals were fully adherent to the project. One Municipal Health Secretary refused to participate and another asked to be replaced by the Municipal Director of Health Care which is why the subgroup of “Coordinators of Primary Health Care” is over-represented (Table 3). Additionally the Municipal Coordinators of Pharmaceutical Services of two municipalities were simultaneously responsible for the PCP investigated reducing the number of pharmacists interviewed by 2.

Table 3 Respondent groups by the total number of participants selected demographics and participation rate and interview duration. MedMinas Project 2018–2021 Full size table

Patients were recruited at the PCP. Before dispensing potential participants were approached by the interviewers who introduced themselves distributed the project leaflets and informed about the general purpose of the study. Patients were approached again after dispensation. Those meeting the inclusion criteria were invited to participate while being fully informed about the study’s purpose risks benefits and interview duration to make a conscious decision to accept or decline participation. These procedures were adopted to minimize selection bias and guarantee a probabilistic sample.

We interviewed 1019 respondents of which 127 were professionals and 892 patients (Table 3). The participation rate in the study varied from 92 to 100% according to the respondent subgroup. The mean number of interviews per municipality was 39 (SD ± 7). We achieved 97% of the maximum sample planned for professionals and 95.3% for patients. Most participants were female. The mean age varied from 35 to 53 years depending on the participants' group. In general patients were older than managers and health professionals. Most managers and health professionals have attained tertiary education while the same rate among patients was minimal (8.2%).

We recorded almost 1000 h of interviews (Table 3) most of which lasted between 45 min and one hour. PHCPS coordinators went through the lengthier interview processes (mean time of 1 h 28 m).

The field team spent on average 16 days (SD ± 4.9; min max: 8–24 days) in each location. Despite contacting municipalities ahead of visiting data collection took more days than planned due to the non-availability of patients to participate in the study caused by medicine shortages at the PCP. In one municipality patient recruitment was not feasible so we lost patient data while in another we had to change data collection to another PCP facility because the patient flow was minimum.

We collected copies of 25 Essential Medicines Lists (REMUMEs) 26 Municipal Health Plans 26 Annual Management Reports and 995 prescriptions during the fieldwork totaling 1072 documents. Additionally we took 2070 pictures of prescriptions filled and medicines dispensed at the PCP.

Data monitoring and management

The field supervisor managed interviewers during the entire data collection process to ensure adherence to the study protocol data quality and completeness of the fieldwork. The team also inspected documents and images collected in the field. The coordination team oversaw the entire data collection process assisting the field team in real-time and conducting in-process quality checks.

Additionally we conducted a thorough auditing process for the first ten municipalities (n = 365) and a random sample of 10% of the other 16 municipalities (n = 70) totaling 435 interviews (42% of all interviews). The audit protocol included reading through all the questionnaires and listening to the correspondent audio-based records in detail to identify and correct errors or inconsistencies in data entry. These procedures were also used to evaluate interviewer performance such as remaining neutral during interviews while establishing empathy and rapport with interviewees asking questions correctly and clarifying the questions.

During the auditing process we found that around 24% of patient interviews contained minor errors and a few inaccuracies especially regarding information collected from prescriptions and dispensed medicines. The interview software for instance was programmed to collect data from one prescription at a time but some interviewers especially at the beginning of the fieldwork included information from more than one prescription together as if they were just one document. Another problem was data entry as “unreadable” or “missing” when in fact we could identify the correspondent information in the prescription or in the dispensed medicine by checking photos taken during the fieldwork. We produced a report based on these problems and discussed them with the field team.

Data management included the storage in electronic folders and backup copies of all field products (questionnaires documents images audio-records) organized by municipality and respondent profile. All field products were protected by passwords with access only to the coordination team.

Since MedMinas instruments contained both open-ended and closed-ended questions we transcribed the interviews. These procedures began after completing the fieldwork due to a previous agreement with the third party assigned to collect data that had internal procedures to prepare and deliver the field products.

Fieldwork challenges lessons learned and participant feedback

MedMinas had complex field logistics addressing transportation accommodation field materials and equipment. The most significant fieldwork challenges concerned: (1) municipality and participant enrolment; (2) field team; (3) interview processes; and (4) project budget. Table 4 summarises the occurrences we faced on the ground and the lessons learned from these challenges.

Table 4 Fieldwork challenges and lessons learned. MedMinas Project 2018–2021 Full size table

Regarding participant feedback 39% of managers (n = 30) 60% of the health workers (n = 30) and 70% of patients (n = 57) informed that they did not want to add thoughts or impressions about the interview. However even without further elaboration several of them mentioned the interview covered everything they expected or declared “I am good” “I cannot think of anything else right now” “I have nothing else to add”.

On the other hand most managers (n = 47; 61%) and around a third of health workers (n = 18; 36%) and patients (n = 26; 31%) broadly reflected on the experience of being interviewed. Five common major themes emerged from these groups: “self-awareness” “sense of gratitude” “research value” “access to findings” and “benefits of the research”. Numerous participants mentioned more than one theme.

Self-awareness was the predominant theme (n = 50 46.3%) meaning that the process of being interviewed has encouraged respondents to think about issues that they had not previously thought about:

“I am glad that you came here to my city! The interview made us reflect upon many things even about the work we've been developing here right? We're so in this fire-drill mode that there is no time to stop and plan the work that has to be done” (Coordinator of Pharmaceutical Services 7) “This interview has already yielded results. I will set up a meeting with the Municipal Coordinator of Pharmaceutical Services to create our ‘Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee’ and to update our municipal medicines list (sarg)… All the flaws I've mentioned here… Emm this interview really gave me the opportunity to do something about it!” (Health Secretary 16) “I think that health professionals should be more valued and more jobs should be offered to them.” (Patient 315) “I wish they had more medicines available. There are too much stock outs… physicians prescribe the most expensive medicines and they [the pharmacy] don't have it!” (Patient 164)

A “sense of gratitude” for the opportunity of being heard also emerged (n = 23; 21.3%):

“Thank you for picking us. We know the project only included a sample of the municipalities in the State so we feel like we won an award… We needed to be included to have the opportunity of giving our opinion!” (Coordinator of Pharmaceutical Services 12) “There are places where we feel abandoned. It's good to see someone looking out for us. Congratulations on the research initiative!” (Patient 467)

The “research value” i.e. the relevance of the study was pointed out by the participants (n = 15; 13.9%):

“I really enjoyed this interview… I really like this type of academic work with the aim of ‘diagnosing’ our health system… I'm sure it will bring about benefit to us managers… Research is a powerful instrument.” (Municipal Health Secretary 24) “Extremely valid to understand what people think to improve [the pharmacies]” (Patient 373)

The “benefits of the research” i.e. a hope that the research findings will improve PHCPS was considered by the interviewees (n = 11; 10.2%):

“I wish the results of this interview could benefit people here especially pharmacy users. There are many sick people in our neighbourhood even bedridden…” (Patient 255) “I hope this study makes it possible right for us to do some effective change right in the Pharmaceutical Services in the city (Health Secretary 2)”

Another key theme was “access to findings” i.e. the importance of the participants being informed about the research findings. However this theme emanated only from managers and health professionals (n = 9; 8.3%).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bnN0YXIuY29tLnBoL3BhbXBhbmdhL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvZG9oLWZldGVzLXBhbXBhbmdhLWZvci11bml2ZXJzYWwtaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUtaW5pdGlhdGl2ZdIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bnN0YXIuY29tLnBoL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9wYW1wYW5nYS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2RvaC1mZXRlcy1wYW1wYW5nYS1mb3ItdW5pdmVyc2FsLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLWluaXRpYXRpdmU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DOH fetes Pampanga for universal health care initiative,"THE province of Pampanga received an award from the Department of Health (DOH) for its continued efforts to deliver on the commitment of universal health care (UHC) to provide quality and affordable medical services to the people.

We now have a pathway with practical specific measures for global resilience and recovery and a shared understanding that solutions depend on bringing women and girls to the centre. Let’s capitalize on the work done here put these agreements into immediate practice and move these decisions forward through all the major forums ahead including COP27.”

CSW66 recognized with concern the disproportionate impacts of climate change environmental degradation and disasters on all women and girls that can include loss of homes and livelihoods water scarcity destruction and damage to schools and health facilities and stressed the urgency of eliminating persistent historical and structural inequalities discriminatory laws and policies negative social norms and gender stereotypes that perpetuate multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination. As a result of displacement including forced and prolonged displacement women and girls face specific challenges including separation from support networks increased risk of all forms of violence and reduced access to employment education and essential health-care services including sexual and reproductive health-care services and psychosocial support.

The Commission also expressed concern that the economic and social fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the impacts of climate change environmental degradation and disasters and has pushed people further behind and into extreme poverty. The global pandemic has also increased the demand for unpaid care and domestic work and reported incidents of all forms of violence.

The Commission called on the United Nations system international financial institutions and multi-stakeholder platforms to continue supporting Member States to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in the context of climate change environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes. Only by addressing the underlining barriers that exacerbate women’s and girls’ vulnerabilities in their social and economic status safety well-being and livelihoods will it be possible to tackle the pervasive disadvantages in access to ownership of and control over land and resources; equal access to services such as universal healthcare and quality education gender-based violence prevention; and the equal sharing of unpaid care and domestic work which hampers women’s resilience and rights.

The outcome document calls for leveraging and strengthening the full equal and meaningful participation and influence of women and girls. Specific efforts must be made to amplify the voices and knowledge of marginalized women including indigenous women older women women with disabilities migrant women and those living in rural remote conflict and disaster-prone areas. Their inputs must be heard and included in the management conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives and programmes.

Initiatives to address climate change environmental and disaster and risk reduction must consider the following:

Promoting women’s and girls’ full and equal participation and leadership to make natural resource management and climate environment and disaster risk action more effective. Women and girls are taking climate and environment action at all levels but their voice agency and participation needs to be further supported resourced valued and recognized.

Expanding gender-responsive finance at scale for climate and environment action and to reach women’s organizations enterprises and cooperatives. Following the commitments undertaken under the Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Climate Pact on mitigation adaptation and the provision and mobilization of finance technology transfer and capacity-building developed countries need to mobilize and meet their obligation to developing countries and small island developing States. In addition climate finance must be increasingly gender-responsive to strengthen the capacities of women youth and local and marginalized communities and their organizations.

Equal access and rights to important resources and productive assets such as land water technology technical advice and information can result in greater food security renewable energy and more just resilient and sustainable systems for all. Enhancing gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data in the gender-environment nexus; and fostering gender-responsive just transitions. Disaggregated data and gender statistics on climate change environmental degradation and disaster risk reduction especially with regard to gender differences in vulnerability and adaptive approaches will enhance the capacity of policymakers to develop and adopt effective evidence-based policies and programmes at all levels and boost women’s and girls’ specific contributions to environmental conservation and climate change mitigation and adaptation.

The Commission also emphasized the mutually reinforcing relationship among achieving gender equality and the full effective and accelerated implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the gender-responsive implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Commission also decided to conduct the Beijing+30 review in 2025 with the goal to assess the implementation of the Platform by countries and to identify strategies for further progress. In addition starting with CSW67 onwards the Commission will include an interactive youth dialogue within its annual programme of work to facilitate exchanges among youth representatives from delegations of Member States.

In the sidelines of the intergovernmental process a High-level Multistakeholder Intergenerational Dialogue on Generation Equality marked nearly one year since the Mexico Forum and eight months since the unprecedented number of commitments at the Paris Forum by launching the online Commitments Dashboard which will make the existing 2000 commitments and new ones searchable and visible to all. The Dashboard is a key building block of the accountability framework to accelerate results for gender equality and to track their impact and contribution to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. A first report will be published in the margins of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly in September 2022.

Other high-level events involving Member States UN Agencies civil society organizations activists and private sector partners included UN Women’s side events on ‘Climate Shocks Exacerbating Humanitarian Crisis Insecurity and Gender Inequality’ and ‘Beyond COVID-19: Advancing Gender Responsive Policies on Climate Care and Jobs for a Sustainable and Equal Future’ as well as the Secretary-General’s Town Hall with women’s organizations and feminist civil society. As in the past CSW66 attracted high-level participation from Member States including two Heads of State and Government three vice-presidents and 111 ministers. CSW66 included 213 virtual side events organized by Member States and UN entities many in collaboration with civil society. Additionally more than 800 virtual NGO parallel events organized by civil society took place fostering ongoing dialogue with key policymakers ensuring that their voices are not left out of these crucial processes.

The Commission welcomed the major contributions of civil society organizations including women’s and youth-organizations women human rights defenders women journalists and and trade unions in promoting and protecting the human rights of all women and girls including in the context of climate change environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes.

UNITED NATIONS (GOLDENHORN AGENCY) – On Friday the 66th session on the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW66) wrapped up its two-week long sessions from March 14-25 calling on the United Nations system international financial institutions and multi-stakeholder platforms to continue supporting Member States to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls with regard to climate change environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programs. The statement from the CSW66 said that Member States adopted “conclusions” that serve as a “blueprint for world leaders to promote women’s and girl’s full and equal participation and leadership in the designing and implementation of climate change environmental and disaster risk reduction.”

The Commission reiterated: “Only by addressing the underlining barriers that exacerbate women’s and girl’s vulnerabilities in their social and economic status safety well-being and livelihoods will it be possible to tackle the pervasive disadvantages in access to ownership of and control over land and resources equal access to services such as universal healthcare and quality education gender-based violence prevention and the equal sharing of unpaid care and domestic work which hampers women’s resilience and rights.”

The finalized document that the CSW66 presented is calling for the voices of all manner and type of females throughout the world to be “amplified.” It also requests that their “inputs must be heard and included in the management conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives and programs.” This includes indigenous women older women women with disabilities migrant women and those living in rural remote conflict and disaster-prone areas. The document calls for “leveraging and strengthening the full equal and meaningful participation and influence of women and girls.”



The Executive Director of UN Women Sima Bahous commented: “The agreements reached by the Commission come at a point when the world urgently needs new and coherent solutions to the interlocking crises that impact us all. We now have a pathway with practical specific measures for global resilience and recovery and a shared understanding that solutions depend on bringing women and girls to the center. Let’s capitalize on the work done here put these agreements into immediate practice and move these decisions forward through all the major forums ahead including COP27.”

CSW66 stated its concerns about the devastating effects that climate change environmental degradation and disasters have on all women and girls that may include the loss of homes livelihoods water scarcity destruction and damage to schools and health facilities. The Commission emphasized the urgency of “eliminating persistent historical and structural inequalities discriminatory laws and policies negative social norms and gender stereotypes that perpetuate multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination.” The Commission further stated that as a result of displacement that women and girls face very specific challenges that include “separation from support networks increased risk of all forms of violence and reduced access to employment education and essential healthcare services including sexual and reproductive healthcare services and psychosocial support.” Another significant factor the Commission highlighted is the “economic and social fallout” of the COVID-19 pandemic which it stated has multiplied the impacts of climate change environmental degradation and disasters while forcing people into extreme poverty. They also pointed out that the global pandemic increased the demand for unpaid care and domestic work with reports of numerous forms of incidences of violence directed specifically at women and girls.

In any initiative addressing climate change environmental and disaster and risk reduction four factors must be considered: promoting women’s and girl’s full and equal participation and leadership to make natural resource management and climate environment and disaster risk action more effective. CSW66 stressed that though women and girls are actively involved in all these areas that their activities need to be highlighted. The second factor is expanding gender-responsive finance at scale for climate and environment action and to reach women’s organizations enterprises and cooperatives. The third factor is building women’s resilience in the context of agricultural and food systems forest and fisheries management and the sustainable energy transition. The fourth factor is enhancing gender statistics and sex disaggregated data in the gender-environment nexus and fostering gender-responsive just transitions.

To truly achieve gender equality the Commission has implemented a new online Commitments Dashboard whose purpose is to give the public an opportunity to search existing 2000 commitments and new ones. The Dashboard is key part of the accountability framework to get quicker results for gender equality and to track the impact and contribution to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that the UN has set forth. The first report is scheduled to be published on the sidelines of the 77th Session of the UN General Assembly in September 2022. The Commission highlighted what they term as “mutually reinforcing relationship among achieving gender equality and the full effective and accelerated implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the gender-responsive implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” In addition the Commission will conduct the Beijing plus 30 Review in 2025 with its goal of assessing the “implementation of the Platform by countries and to identify strategies for further progress.” An interactive youth dialogue with representatives from member states will be incorporated into its regular program as well.

An ongoing issue the Commission emphasized is the myriad of challenges and barriers to f full participation and leadership that women and girls face around the world such as reductions in funding violence harassment reprisals and threats to the physical security of their members. CSW66 lauded major contributions from civil society organizations that include women’s and youth-organizations women human rights defender women journalist and trade unions in promoting and protection the human rights of all women and girls – including in the context of climate change environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programs."

That prep will come at TPC San Antonio for the 2022 Valero Texas Open. As always here is your early deep-dive on the 2022 Valero Texas Open and a preview for how to bet.

2022 Texas Open Preview – The Field

As mentioned in the introduction this week presents one final chance to fine tune your game before The Masters. As such a few big names will make the trip to TPC San Antonio. The most notable of those is Rory McIlroy. McIlroy changed up his pre-Masters routine in 2022. Instead of using the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play as his final event he’ll play the Valero Texas Open as his warm up to the Masters. Maybe this will be what he needs to finally secure a Green Jacket. As for TPC San Antonio he’s played this golf course once in 2013. He finished runner up to Martin Laird. Considering how important driving is at TPC San Antonio McIlroy is a great fit for the golf course.

Two golfers in desperate need to shake off the rust ahead of The Masters are Bryson DeChambeau and Jordan Spieth. Both looked pretty bad at the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play last week but for two different reasons. Bryson continues to work his way back from injuries sustained earlier this season. As for Spieth he appears to be struggling with his swing again. Videos of his swing last week look pretty bad. After seemingly figuring things out last year his swing has definitely regressed ahead of The Masters.

Other notables in the field include Abraham Ancer Corey Conners Tony Finau and Gary Woodland.

2022 Texas Open Preview – The Golf Course

TPC San Antonio boasts two 18 hole golf courses. Pete Dye designed the Canyons Course on the north side of the property. It features an intriguing layout. There are a lot of elevation changes up down and around the canyons to create an interesting 18 hole track. There are also wide fairways that make it relatively playable for amateurs However because of the terrain and the short length on the scorecard it isn’t very conducive to set up the infrastructure needed to broadcast a tournament.

Instead the tournament is held on the Oaks Course which is on the south side of the property. It was built in 2010 by Greg Norman with Sergio Garcia consulting on the project. Soon thereafter it became the host for the Valero Texas Open. The golf course at its maximum stretches to just over 7400 yards long. It’s naturally a Bermuda golf course but in its March date the fairways and rough are overseeded with ryegrass. The greens are overseeded with Poa Trivialis. It won’t be exactly the conditions the players will see at Augusta National next week but it’s close.

As for the golf course itself it has its positives and negatives.

Let’s start out with some positives. The golf course is immaculately maintained. As part of the TPC network the golf course boasts fantastic turf conditions for its players. In addition the golf course is not saturated with real estate eyesores like many TPC golf courses are. Golf course architect Greg Norman wanted the natural landscape to shine and it has a much more rugged look than other TPC golf courses. The golf course staff do an amazing job with the conditions and making sure it is in tip top condition for tournament and member play.

And it is located at a beautiful J.W. Marriot resort. It features top-notch amenities including a phenomenal pool lazy river and water park. While the kids can go hang out by the pool you (and your spouse) can get away and play a well-maintained and challenging golf course.

There are some interesting holes and features to it. The greens have some nice undulations and the greenside bunkers have good edging. The back nine also boasts some good holes. The 11th features a centerline bunker with a fairway runout of about 300 yards. That forces some decisions off the tee. The 16th is Greg Norman’s take on the 6th at Riviera. The Par 3 has a bunker placed in the middle of the green which makes for an inconvenient visual for the tee shot. The 18th also features a split fairway and is similar to the 18th at Jumeriah Estates in Dubai. That’s another Greg Norman design and is the home of the DP World Championship on the European Tour.

There are some flaws about the golf course too. Most have to do with the original design from Greg Norman. For starters the front nine isn’t too spectacular Parts of the Front Nine can feel a little repetitive. Most are slightly dog-legged with bunkers guarding left and right of the green. The first nine holes of the golf course won’t stick in the minds of anyone who plays it.

But the biggest negative about the golf course is how difficult it is for amateurs to play it. Greg Norman was one of the longest and straightest drivers at his peak and it requires one to hit it long and straight to fare well on the Oaks Course. Those who don’t are in for a very long day. Each fairway is flanked by a rocky terrain of bramble and brush. There’s no room to miss off the tee. The fairway bunkers are also really deep and make it very difficult for an amateur to get out of.

One isn’t out of the woods should they find the fairways. All the greens are heavily guarded by deep and difficult bunkers. There are a few holes that do provide some bailouts to miss but even those aren’t easy to access. Almost all the greens are raised above the fairway too which doesn’t allow for someone to run the ball up to the green. Everything is aerial at TPC San Antonio which doesn’t make it very friendly for amateurs.

The golf course is also borderline unplayable with a stiff north wind. Starting at the clubhouse the golf course works its way to the south downhill before winding its way in the opposite direction. With a north wind amateurs are aided with a tailwind and downhill conditions over the first half of the front and back nines to get the ball towards the green. But once they turn for home they’re playing both uphill AND into the wind. And with no way to run the ball up to the green it’s very difficult to get on in two (or three).

But for a tournament golf course it’s a great test for the professionals. In windy conditions it certainly can give them fits. But the professionals don’t suffer from the same woes that us mere mortals do. They can certainly make a mess of things if they’re not driving the ball well or don’t have the short game to get up and down from tough spots off the green. If the wind doesn’t blow the best players in the world can eat the golf course up.

Betting Strategies

The Valero Texas Open can be tricky to handicap. For starters it’s a week before The Masters. Motivation is an unmeasurable factor. Does a Masters contender go full bore like Jordan Spieth did last year? Or does one not exert too much energy while doing enough to play four rounds and fine tune their game for Augusta. Gamblers will make complete guesses as to what a golfer’s intentions are this week. Plus outside the top tier this is a pretty weak field. On a golf course that can be difficult tee-to-green trying to guess amongst a sea of average players who’ll hit the ball this week is a dicey proposition.

Let’s first start with the TPC San Antonio relative skill set chart per DataGolf:

TPC San Antonio produces one of the more random leaderboard in terms of skill sets. Length helps but it’s not a prerequisite to success at TPC San Antonio. While avoiding the fairway bunkers is crucial at TPC San Antonio inaccurate drivers have found success there too. So too are players with varying degrees of skillsets with their irons and putter. But the one strong correlation between players who have good success at TPC San Antonio is short game. As shown above there’s a huge correlation of short game wizards who appear at the top of the leaderboard at the Valero Texas Open.

Where they may have an advantage is from greenside bunkers. Of regular PGA Tour stops TPC San Antonio features the third toughest bunkers to get up and down from off the green. Greg Norman built these bunkers very deep. Combining this with the significant undulation of the greens it’s very difficult to get up and down from out of them. With below average green in regulation rates players will be plenty tested around the green.

Next let’s look at where players will hit their approach shots from (per DataGolf). This chart is a great preview of what to expect at the 2022 Valero Texas Open:

On its surface the looks like a fairly spread out distribution chart. There are above average rates on approach shots <125 yards. However they only comprise of approximately 24% of a player’s approach shots every round. There are above average rates on approach shots between 150-175 yards however below average rates on the two tiers right next to it. And while there are almost double the number of approach shots 250+ yards it only comprises 19% of all approach shots per round. And there are very little shots between 200-250 yards where a gambler can handicap approach play on all approach shots 200+.

Digging a little deeper in some scoring attributes reveals a little clearer picture of what gamblers should focus on. Per DataGolf TPC San Antonio is the 2nd toughest golf course of all regular PGA Tour stops for approach shots less than 150 yards. And it features the 2nd toughest Par 5’s of all regular PGA Tour stops on the schedule. It might be because of the high frequency of approach shots 250+ yards along with the really difficult greenside bunkers. As such this chart suggests that gamblers should incorporate performance on approach shots <150 yards along with Par 5 Scoring into their handicap.

Lastly here are the group of players in the field who have gained the most strokes per round on the field (minimum of 10 rounds) per DataGolf:

Corey Conners: +2.19 12 Rounds Charley Hoffman: +2.17 44 Rounds Jordan Spieth: +2.06 22 Rounds Brandt Snedeker: +1.99 16 Rounds Lucas Glover: +1.51 10 Rounds Kevin Streelman: +1.49 24 Rounds Martin Laird: +1.41 30 Rounds Chris Kirk: +1.37 24 Rounds Matt Kuchar: +1.35 36 Rounds Kevin Chappell: +1.15 29 Rounds

A lot of these guys have different skill sets. All of them have varying degrees of skills regarding driving approach play and putting. But a lot of these guys are pretty good around the green. And for those who aren’t (like Lucas Glover and Corey Conners) they’re just exceptional ball strikers who gain an advantage by hitting a ton of greens and avoiding the troublesome greenside bunkers. This list of players is a good preview of who to target for the 2022 Valero Texas Open.

Experto responde,"Conseguir boletos para un concierto parece ser una de las acciones más complejas de nuestros tiempos. Cada vez que se anuncia que alguno de nuestros artistas preferidos estará de gira o que dará un concierto en nuestra ciudad inmediatamente todos solemos pensar “ojalá encuentre boletos”. Y es que las experiencias pasadas nos han hecho sentir que ser uno de los pocos afortunados que alcanza a comprar un ticket incluso cuando sus precios son elevados es casi una cuestión de suerte pues ya la mayoría de eventos tienden a agotarse en muy poco tiempo.

Tomemos como ejemplo el fenómeno que experimentaron las personas para conseguir boletos para el concierto de Bad Bunny en la Ciudad de México o el de Monterrey en las dos fechas de cada una de las ciudades. Es decir de entre cuatro oportunidades. Habiendo tanto espacio en tan solo unos cuantos minutos ya no había nada y hasta los sitios de reventa de boletos (que no son legales) agotaron pronto sus ofertas. Esta gira de Bad Bunny ha arrasado en ventas pues hablamos de uno de los artistas más famosos y apreciados actualmente por múltiples generaciones pero no es el único caso y no se trata solo de una consecuencia de su fama.

La venta de boletos en internet suele ser caótica vecteezy

Parte de la razón por la cual es tan difícil conseguir boletos para un concierto también tiene que ver con la manera en que funcionan los sitios de venta de boletos asegura un experto que hizo una investigación detrás de los procesos de seguridad de este tipo de servicios. Así que sí el caos generado para los boletos de Bad Bunny por ejemplo es en parte por su fama pero también por las razones que te contaremos a continuación.

El problema comienza con compañías como Ticketmaster y otras que dominan el mercado de manera significativa y que en general han causado quejas en sus usuarios por su mal funcionamiento. El que haya pocas opciones hace que la gente se queje en ese sentido."

app tap > > > . Make sure you have a compatible iPhone (iPhone 6 or newer).

This article explains how to turn on Verizon's HD Voice feature so iPhone users can talk and use data at the same. Additional information provides insight into the problem's history as well as other HD Voice features.

How to Use Verizon HD Voice

HD Voice is automatically added to most of Verizon's monthly plans. To use the feature you just need to enable a setting on your iPhone:

Tap the Settings app on your iPhone's Home screen. Tap Cellular. Tap Cellular Data Options. Tap Enable LTE. Tap Voice & Data.

That's it. Return to whatever you were doing on your iPhone with the knowledge that you can now simultaneously make calls and connect to the internet.

Other Verizon HD Voice Features

Simultaneous voice and data use isn't the only feature that HD Voice unlocks for you. In addition Verizon HD Voice customers can make conference calls with up to six lines and activate Wi-Fi Calling.

The Problem

While Verizon has long boasted the largest coverage area of any cellphone company in the U.S. the fact that you couldn't make a phone call and use data at the same time on an iPhone with Verizon was a big drawback compared to AT&T's service. Other Verizon phones that supported LTE could do this but not the iPhone.

It meant there was no way to be on a call and Google something related to the conversation or get walking directions from a Maps app while talking to the person you were going to meet. It was a major limitation—one that convinced some people not to consider Verizon for their iPhone service provider.

However beginning with the introduction of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and some timely upgrades to Verizon's network all of that changed. The key difference was the introduction of HD Voice a feature previously known as Verizon Advanced Calling. With it you can use your iPhone with Verizon service to make calls and use data at the same time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAzLzI2L3dhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWlzLXVuZGVyZXN0aW1hdGluZy12ZXJpem9uLXN0b2NrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Don't Underestimate Verizon's Stock,"Verizon's core business is steady but it has a huge growth opportunity with 5G broadband.

Three months ago I got so sick of a spotty internet connection from Comcast that I bought a (very expensive) wireless business plan from Verizon (VZ 1.13%) for my home office. Unfortunately 5G wasn't available where I live so it was a 4G LTE connection but speeds were comparable to Comcast and the wireless box was far more reliable than my home Wi-Fi.

To my surprise a few weeks later I learned that 5G had been turned on in my neighborhood. 5G Home was now available for just $70 a month ($30 less than Comcast broadband). A few emails and phone calls later and a 5G Home box was on its way. My 4G LTE wireless router was headed back to Verizon.

A little over a month in 5G Home from Verizon is more reliable than my cable internet is. I'm ready to cancel Comcast broadband. This story may be anecdotal but it could be revolutionary for Verizon on a large scale. I'm not sure the market even realizes Verizon could have a massive growth business on its hands.

Reaching into the home

A vast majority of Verizon's revenue comes from wireless services and related hardware for businesses and consumers. At the end of 2021 the company had 115.4 million wireless retail connections and just 13.1 million combined Fios video internet and digital voice connections with another 6.9 million wireline broadband connections. Not surprisingly wireless is growing adding 1.1 million net subscribers last year. Meanwhile Fios lost 222000 connections offset by 241000 net additions for wireline broadband.

The general story of these numbers is that Verizon is huge in wireless phone service but hasn't been particularly successful at reaching into the home. And it's losing customers in the Fios business which has never lived up to expectations.

But this dynamic may change with 5G Home wireless broadband service. It's faster and cheaper than cable and DSL broadband at least in some areas and it'll be a huge opportunity for Verizon if the company can bundle these products successfully. Verizon has said that its 5G Home service is already available to 100 million homes and the rollout is going much faster than expected. Management hoped to have 11 million home broadband subscribers by 2025 but I think that's underestimating the business's potential.

The new bundle

We're starting to see Verizon offer discounts for multiple services but it's not a true bundle company yet. For now it's bringing together 5G smartphone coverage with 5G Home broadband. But I think that's just the start.

Dozens of streaming services are now available and some are sold through Verizon. Bundling these services together with two wireless services makes sense especially as streaming companies look for more distribution options.

Don't underestimate the edge

I've focused primarily on consumer services Verizon will be able to bring to the market with 5G. But another significant impact could be on what's known as the edge. Verizon is calling this the ""network-as-a-service"" for businesses building solutions for computing at the edge of the cloud.

In general the idea is that computing power doesn't need to be done entirely on devices like computers and smartphones. Some computing can be pushed to the ""edge"" crunching numbers and analyzing data streams at a network hub near the user. As the company connecting devices to the internet Verizon is a likely player here.

It's not clear how big Verizon will be able to make this business but like Verizon Home it's an incremental addition of revenue and margin for the company. The core smartphone connection business is strong -- broadband and the edge is about growth.

Verizon's stock is cheap given its growth potential

Telecommunications stocks may not be the market's favorites but there's a lot to like about Verizon stock. Shares trade for an earnings multiple under 10 the dividend yield is 5% and as I highlighted I think there's a lot of potential for growth.

Suppose the edge or 5G broadband provides even a few percentage points of additional growth. In that case they could change the narrative of this company from being a very slow-growth high-capital-cost operation to a very profitable business growing the bottom line by 5% or more per year. I think the value is compelling enough but from what I've seen from 5G Home there's more growth in Verizon's future than investors are giving it credit for.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zeXJhY3VzZS5jb20vbW92aWVzLzIwMjIvMDMvaG93LXRvLXdhdGNoLXRoZS1vc2NhcnMtOTR0aC1hY2FkZW15LWF3YXJkcy10aW1lLXR2LWNoYW5uZWwtZnJlZS1saXZlLXN0cmVhbS1ub21pbmVlcy5odG1s0gGRAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5cmFjdXNlLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvMjAyMi8wMy9ob3ctdG8td2F0Y2gtdGhlLW9zY2Fycy05NHRoLWFjYWRlbXktYXdhcmRzLXRpbWUtdHYtY2hhbm5lbC1mcmVlLWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtLW5vbWluZWVzLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to watch The Oscars: 94th Academy Awards time TV channel FREE live stream nominees,"What TV channel are the 2022 Oscars on?

Special to USA TODAY

After years of innovation in the world of smartphones PCs and tablets there is a new tech gadget leader: the car. In fact key chip companies that have powered those devices for years – including Nvidia Qualcomm and Intel’s Mobileye division – are now putting some of their most advanced technology efforts toward the automotive market announcing carmaker partnerships at a dizzying rate.

Cellular connectivity has also been an important driver in the evolution of cars for many years now having been used to deliver everything from map updates to emergency services to over-the-air car feature updates. (This is a fact that owners of some older cars may have only recently painfully discovered when AT&T recently shutdown its 3G networks. T-Mobile and Verizon are soon to follow on that front.)"

And that number is growing.

When people have Type 1 diabetes the immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin. These cells regulate glucose levels in the blood which the body needs for energy. Blood sugar will continue to rise without insulin so Type 1 diabetics must inject insulin for the rest of their lives.

But over the past 20 years significant advancements in stem cell research and therapies have revealed promising methods of creating new insulin-making cells which are needed to cure Type 1 diabetes.

Biotech company Vertex Pharmaceuticals recently began a clinical trial where it plans to treat 17 participants who have Type 1 diabetes with new insulin-making cells derived from stem cells. The first patient in the trial Brian Shelton has had positive results. After 150 days Shelton was able to reduce the amount of insulin he injects by 92%.

Other global companies are also working to cure diabetes such as ViaCyte CRISPR  and Novo Nordisk  one of the biggest insulin manufacturers in the world.

Watch the video to hear how stem cell therapy has changed Shelton's life and what other diabetes cures are being developed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYnMuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS90aGlzLWN5c3RpYy1maWJyb3Npcy1kcnVnLWNvc3QtMjUwLTAwMC1hLXllYXItaXQtd2lsbC1zb29uLWJlLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1hdC1hLWZyYWN0aW9uLW9mLXRoZS1wcmljZS9saTRwNGhndjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This cystic fibrosis drug costs $250000 a year. It will soon be available at a fraction of the price,"Thousands of people living with a life-threatening disorder will have access to a ground-breaking drug at a fraction of the price after it was placed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.





More than 2000 people living with cystic fibrosis will be able to access Trikafta on the PBS from 1 April which previously could have cost more than $250000 a year Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Sunday.





The drug will now be $42.50 per script or $6.80 for concession card holders Mr Hunt said.





""I am so proud that one of the final treatments listed on the PBS under my watch as Minister for Health is Trikafta"" he said.





""This listing will make access to treatment within reach for thousands of Australians with CF each year.""





Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that causes persistent infections of the lung and there is currently no cure.



Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt. Source: AAP The average life expectancy for people with CF is 47 years much lower than the average life expectancy of most Australians which is 85 years for men and 88 years for women.





One in every 2500 children born in Australian will have cystic fibrosis and some 3500 people live with the disease today.





The drug will be available to Australians aged 12 and over who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene the government said.





""Today is a great day for the CF community"" senior country manager of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Sabrina Barbic said.





""The listing of Trikafta on the PBS is an incredible milestone and we thank the Australian government for recognising the significant need for this medicine and the value it brings to Australians living with CF.""





The company said it had dedicated more than 20 years to researching CF saying their ""life's work has been trying to find a cure"".

Companies with high profits and revenue per employee are presumed to be the most successful. Alphabet Microsoft and Meta Platforms owner of Facebook are such companies. These tech companies are among the largest in the United States based on revenue and they are among the youngest large companies. Several were founded in the past 25 years. However a group of relatively small companies leads the list of highest profit per employee.

Data for the recent “Profit per Employee” research paper from software company Tipalti came from the Fortune 500. The paper examined 914 major companies most of which made a profit per employee in the last year. Only 238 reported a loss per employee. The company that has the most profits per employee is Air Lease. The company reported $516 million in profits or $4.3 million per employee.

Air Lease with an employee count of 120 buys passenger planes and leases them to airlines. The process allows carriers that do not have capital access to planes. Air Lease makes its profit largely off the interest it charges these carriers. The company was hurt by the trouble with the aviation industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic but its financials have started to recover.

When the company announced its 2021 results John L. Plueger chief executive officer and president commented: “We had a strong fourth quarter and second half of 2021 that benefited from continuing airline industry recovery as seen in our cash collections operating metrics fleet expansion and record lease placement.”

Air Lease owns 474 planes that it leases to 118 customers in 60 countries. The company is based in Los Angeles. (See if Air Lease is also among the 50 best companies to work for.)

To find the 50 companies with the most profits per employee 24/7 Wall St. reviewed Tipalti’s “Profit per Employee” research paper. Very few of the companies with the highest profit per employee are large tech companies. Meta is highest among these ranking 11th with a profit of nearly $500000 per employee based on over 58000 workers. Several financial firms are ahead of Meta.

Mortgage giant Fannie Mae has profit of $1.5 million per employee based on 7700 workers. This places it second on the list. The third is private equity firm KKR at $1.3 million per employee based on 1583 workers. (Find out if any of the companies on this list were also among the most innovative companies in 2021.)

In two months the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 0.46%) will celebrate its 126th ""birthday."" Since its founding in May 1896 it's evolved from a 12-stock industrial-dominated index to one that now houses 30 highly successful and diverse multinational companies.

It's also an index full of stocks that have a rich history of making patient investors money. Over the next eight years three Dow stocks stand out as having a good chance to outperform their peers. If you invest $300000 into these Dow components now they have the tools and intangible needed to potentially make you a millionaire by 2030.

Salesforce

The Dow stock I feel most confident about increasing in value by 233% over the next eight years is cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software solutions provider Salesforce.com (CRM 0.72%). Salesforce has averaged an annual gain of nearly 27% for shareholders since March 2005. In other words it doubles on average every 2.7 years.

CRM software is used by consumer-facing businesses to enhance existing customer relationships and boost sales. Some of the more common tasks businesses utilize CRM software for include overseeing online marketing campaigns handling product and service issues and running predictive sales analyses. The latter can be particularly helpful in determining which clients would be likeliest to purchase a new product or service.

As you might have guessed CRM software is geared toward the service industry. However it's made inroads in the financial healthcare and industrial sectors in recent years. CRM software is fully expected to offer low double-digit annual global growth potential through at least mid-decade if not beyond.

Salesforce slots in as the undisputed No. 1 of global CRM spending. According to a report from IDC Salesforce accounted for almost 24% of global CRM spend in the first-half of 2021. By comparison its four-closest competitors in market share didn't even add up to 20% on a combined basis. Salesforce is the go-to CRM solutions provider and is unlikely to cede significant share anytime soon.

It's also a company that's benefited immensely from inorganic growth. CEO and founder Marc Benioff has made a number of amazing acquisitions including MuleSoft Tableau Software and Slack Technologies. These deals not only expand the company's sales channels but they allow Salesforce to reach a broader audience of small-and-medium-sized businesses with their ecosystem of solutions.

Benioff is forecasting a near-doubling in full-year sales by mid-decade ($50 billion in fiscal 2026) making Salesforce the fast-growing Dow component investors should want to own.

UnitedHealth Group

Another Dow stock that can turn a $300000 investment into $1 million by 2030 is insurance and healthcare solutions giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.39%). Over the past 25 years UnitedHealth has averaged an annual return of around 19%. If we include dividends this average annual return jumps to about 20%. This means the company has been doubling investors' money on average every 3.6 years.

UnitedHealth is probably best known for its insurance segment. Even though health insurance tends to be a relatively slow-growing operating model it's very profitable. Insurance companies are typically able to pass along higher premiums to counteract rising costs.

Aside from strong premium pricing power UnitedHealth can continue to benefit from the existence of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)(sometimes referred to as ""Obamacare""). Despite the ACA requiring insurers to accept people with pre-existing conditions it also encouraged a lot of healthier people to purchase insurance as well.

However the real growth driver for UnitedHealth Group is its healthcare services subsidiary Optum. Optum has three segments of its own which provide everything from pharmacy prescription refills to data analytics and software to healthcare organizations. Optum has consistently grown faster than the insurance segment and it generally produces higher margins too. Thanks mostly to Optum Wall Street's consensus estimate calls for UnitedHealth to grow its full-year sales from $287.6 billion in 2021 to more than $497 billion by 2026. That's incredible sales growth for a megacap company.

At its current growth trajectory I believe UnitedHealth Group has the potential to more than triple its earnings per share by 2030 to north of $60 which in turn should send its shares a lot higher.

Visa

A third and final Dow stock with the ability to turn $300000 into $1 million by 2030 is payment processor Visa (V 1.56%). Over the trailing 14 years Visa has averaged an annual total return including dividends paid of around 21%. This means it's doubled investors' money on average every 3.4 years.

The most logical reason to buy Visa is the company's cyclical ties. In short it does well when the U.S. and global economy are expanding and it struggles a bit during recessions when consumers and businesses don't spend as much. The thing is recessions typically last for a few months or a couple of quarters whereas periods of economic expansion are usually measured in years. Visa is the type of company that allows patient investors to take advantage of the natural long-term expansion of the U.S. and global economy.

But let's be clear it also doesn't hurt that Visa controls a majority of credit card market share by network purchase volume in the U.S. -- the largest market for consumption in the world. Between 2009 and 2018 no payment processor saw a bigger jump in U.S. network purchase volume share than Visa. In fact Visa's 53.1% share in 2018 was 31 percentage points higher than its next-closest competitor.

Additionally Visa has a long runway with which to expand its payment infrastructure. It can do so via acquisition as it did with Visa Europe in 2016 or it can organically push into underbanked markets such as the Middle East Africa and Southeastern Asia. With much of the world still reliant on cash for transactions Visa looks to be sitting on a multidecade opportunity.

Lastly take into consideration that Visa purely acts as a payment processor and not a lender. Although lending would allow the company to reap the rewards of interest income and fees during long periods of economic expansion it would also expose it to loan delinquencies during recessions. Not lending means not having to set aside capital to cover delinquencies. This is why Visa bounces back quicker than virtually all other financial stocks following a recession or economic contraction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vMjQ3d2FsbHN0LmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXJlcG9ydC8yMDIyLzAzLzI2L3RoaXMtY29tcGFueS1oYXMtdGhlLW1vc3QtcHJvZml0cy1wZXItZW1wbG95ZWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Company Has the Most Profits Per Employee,"This Company Has the Most Profits Per Employee Scott Olson / Getty Images News via Getty Images

Companies with high profits and revenue per employee are presumed to be the most successful. Alphabet Microsoft and Meta Platforms owner of Facebook are such companies. These tech companies are among the largest in the United States based on revenue and they are among the youngest large companies. Several were founded in the past 25 years. However a group of relatively small companies leads the list of highest profit per employee.

Data for the recent “Profit per Employee” research paper from software company Tipalti came from the Fortune 500. The paper examined 914 major companies most of which made a profit per employee in the last year. Only 238 reported a loss per employee. The company that has the most profits per employee is Air Lease. The company reported $516 million in profits or $4.3 million per employee.

Air Lease with an employee count of 120 buys passenger planes and leases them to airlines. The process allows carriers that do not have capital access to planes. Air Lease makes its profit largely off the interest it charges these carriers. The company was hurt by the trouble with the aviation industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic but its financials have started to recover.

When the company announced its 2021 results John L. Plueger chief executive officer and president commented: “We had a strong fourth quarter and second half of 2021 that benefited from continuing airline industry recovery as seen in our cash collections operating metrics fleet expansion and record lease placement.”

Air Lease owns 474 planes that it leases to 118 customers in 60 countries. The company is based in Los Angeles. (See if Air Lease is also among the 50 best companies to work for.)

To find the 50 companies with the most profits per employee 24/7 Wall St. reviewed Tipalti’s “Profit per Employee” research paper. Very few of the companies with the highest profit per employee are large tech companies. Meta is highest among these ranking 11th with a profit of nearly $500000 per employee based on over 58000 workers. Several financial firms are ahead of Meta.

Mortgage giant Fannie Mae has profit of $1.5 million per employee based on 7700 workers. This places it second on the list. The third is private equity firm KKR at $1.3 million per employee based on 1583 workers. (Find out if any of the companies on this list were also among the most innovative companies in 2021.)

CHESAPEAKE Va. — Police in Chesapeake are investigating a homicide after a male was found shot in a vacant lot.

According to a police spokesperson this unfolded just before 4 p.m. when a concerned citizen flagged down a Norfolk Police unit and told them that there was a male lying in a vacant lot in the 2000 block of Berkley Ave. (This is right at the city line between Norfolk and Chesapeake.) There they found a male with gunshot wounds. They began performing life-saving measures.

At about the same time Emergency Dispatch in Chesapeake began receiving several calls from people reporting that they'd heard several gunshots and that there was a male lying on the ground in the same area. Chesapeake Police units arrived on the scene and took over life savings measures from the Norfolk personnel until Medics could get there.

The male was transported to a hospital but died from his injuries there.

The city has also previously earned podium finishes for the Berkley Springs water competition for Best Purified Water. In addition to this year’s second-place finish the city earned third place in 2020 fifth place in 2018 and third place in 2016.

“Reliable access to clean drinking water is something that is of the utmost importance to our community” said Edwin Porter Executive Director of Infrastructure. “The fact that Hamilton’s municipal water is consistently recognized in this international competition really is a testament to the quality of our product.”

Porter said it’s common for a person to spend $2 for a bottle of water but for that same $2 Porter said residents can get around 1100 bottles of award-winning water from the tap.

“I am very proud of our highly skilled and dedicated team who have perfected the process to keep this luxury water running throughout our community” he said.

Hamilton as well as several communities in the region gets its water from the Great Miami Buried Valley Aquifer.

The city does bottle its water which is labeled Hamilton On Tap and Mayor Pat Moeller said not only is the city’s bottled water tastes great but “the bottles are environmentally friendly” since the bottles are reusable.

“It takes a great city team to produce water quality that has been judged highly many times” the mayor said. “We have a water taste dynasty.”

Hamilton Water Superintendent John Bui said the award is due to the work of the city’s staff.

“Our staff works tirelessly to produce the highest quality and finest tasting water for our community” he said. “To ensure high-quality water is being distributed to our community our water is constantly monitored. Samples are taken from every step of the treatment process at least every two hours.”

While it’s convenient to get the city’s award-winning tap water by turning on a faucet or spigot to get the city’s bottled water is a bit rare. Moeller has bestowed six-packs of water on occasion at City Council meetings ― though that practice hasn’t been done recently ― but the city does sell its water. While the bottled water is currently out of stock currently it can be ordered at 513-785-7245.

Hamilton has been known to ship water out to disaster areas. In 2017 the city shipped more than 100 cases of Hamilton On Tap to Texas residents who had been devastated by Hurricane Harvey a Category 4 hurricane.

Hamilton has two water plants: the South Water Treatment Plant located on River Road in Fairfield and the North Water Treatment Plant located on North Third Street in Hamilton. The South Water Treatment Plant serves as the primary facility for Hamilton’s water distribution system pumping about 15.5 million gallons per day for the city of Hamilton and Butler County’s water distribution systems.",,,

WBA,Walgreens Boots Alliance,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDY1NDg3OS9JdHMtdGltZS1zZWxsLUJvb3RzLXNheXMtb25lLWhhbGYtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtY291cGxlLWNoZW1pc3QuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGlzaXNtb25leS5jby51ay9tb25leS9tYXJrZXRzL2FydGljbGUtMTA2NTQ4NzkvYW1wL0l0cy10aW1lLXNlbGwtQm9vdHMtc2F5cy1vbmUtaGFsZi1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1jb3VwbGUtY2hlbWlzdC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'It's time to sell Boots' says one half of billionaire couple who own chemist,"Growing up near Genoa in Italy the young Ornella Barra dreamt of being a doctor. Never for a moment did she imagine she would one day become one half of the most powerful business couple on the planet.

Today she is chief operating officer international of pharmacy giant WBA whose empire includes Boots the Chemists which is up for sale – probably to private equity.

Her long-term partner is the legendary dealmaker Italian billionaire Stefano Pessina who created Walgreens Boots Alliance and is its executive chairman. When the pair are not globetrotting for work they live together in Monaco.

Hard to say goodbye: Ornella Barra may retain a seat on the board of Boots after a sale of the pharmacy

Barra is taking a lead in management presentations to possible buyers for Boots including British private equity firm TDR backers of the billionaire Issa brothers who own Asda. Other potential bidders are US buyout barons at Apollo and rival firm Sycamore Partners. A consortium of Bain Capital and CVC Capital did not put in a first round bid.

Ironically considering her future success Barra was dissuaded by her family from pursuing a career in medicine on the grounds it would be too hard to reach the top.

'I wanted to become a surgeon but 50 years ago it was not the best profession for women because it was male-dominated' she says. Instead she studied pharmacy at the University of Genoa – a decision that led her to cross paths with Pessina.

In the near 40 years of their extraordinary professional and personal partnership the couple has created a healthcare and pharmacy business spanning the US Latin America and Europe.

Now they have hoisted a 'for sale' sign over Boots after 16 years of ownership.

Despite the sale Barra 68 claims a deep affection for the British chain saying: 'I love Boots. I like the way it is close to the community. Eighty five per cent of the UK population is within ten minutes of a store. This reflects my DNA as a pharmacist.'

A devotee of the No7 serums which have developed a cult following among British women she also recommends the Dual Defence cold remedy to anyone she meets with a sniffle. And she is she says 'very very proud' of staff during the lockdowns.

There is speculation that it might not be a final farewell to Boots and that WBA may in fact keep a minority stake – and Barra a seat on the board.

Be that as it may ownership of Boots has not been an easy ride. Sales were hammered in the pandemic. Though it was allowed to trade in lockdown as it was classed as an essential retailer fewer people came into city centre stores.

The company has been forced to announce 6000 job cuts one in ten of the workforce in the past couple of years.

Even before Covid devastated footfall like other traditional bricks and mortar retailers Boots had to manage a big store estate with some shops in the wrong place or too close to another branch. Some 200 stores have been earmarked for closure. And while 19 new stores have opened in prime locations and others have undergone impressive refurbishments some still look dowdy. Boots has been up against competition from online operators such as Amazon and from supermarkets which have expanded into personal care and toiletries.

High hopes to transform No7 from a British bathroom cupboard staple to an international superbrand have not yet fully borne fruit. Boots remains a much-loved and trusted name and the latest online sales figures for the first quarter of the company's financial year – the three months to November 30 2021 – almost doubled compared with the same quarter just before Covid struck. The digital business in which Boots has invested more than £70million in three years is booming.

Total retail sales in the same quarter are up 16.3 per cent on the same period the year before. So why sell the 2263 store-chain now?

'We started a very big reorganisation in Boots to shape the company in the right way to develop three important pillars healthcare pharmacy and beauty' says Barra. 'The team and I have worked on creating the right foundations for growth over the past three years. Now it is in good shape. It is the right time to go into a new era.

'WBA decided to focus particularly on the US and on healthcare and it is difficult to manage everything. It is important in life to make choices.'

The first big disposal came last year with the sale of wholesaler Alliance Healthcare for £4.6billion. Boots is next on the block with an estimated £7billion price tag. The business has previous experience of private equity ownership. In 2007 Pessina who now owns 17 per cent of WBA teamed up with KKR in what was then Europe's largest ever leveraged buyout financed by £10billion of debt. The deal immediately stoked fears of asset-stripping and unsustainable borrowing which for once proved unfounded.

Boots became part of a much larger group teaming up with American chain Walgreens. Despite the controversy over 'pandemic predators' Barra argues that another stint in private equity custody will be good for the retailer.

'I remember the very interesting time from 2007 to 2014 with KKR. Boots had a very good experience' she says. She is she adds highly aware of the need to find a responsible buyer given the unique place that Boots occupies on the UK high street and in the healthcare system. Paramount in her mind she says are the 51000 employees. 'We will be very careful. A buyer that will be responsible towards the employees for me that is the priority' she says with an Italian cadence. English is her fourth language after her native tongue French and Spanish.

Many small UK shareholders might like to see Boots returning as an independent business to the UK stock market.

Initially she says they considered floating Boots in an Initial Public Offering (IPO). 'At the beginning we had the idea of an IPO but we didn't start the process because the offers came in' she says. So is an IPO off the table? She replies: 'In the style of WBA everything is on the table.

'If the offers are not in line with our expectations we could come back to an IPO.' At this time however that looks unlikely.

Barra met Pessina 80 in 1984 when she was looking for a business partner not a romantic one.

It was the start of an enduring relationship built on a mutual addiction to work.

'It is easy because he is the architect and I am the engine' she says. 'Stefano is the deal maker. Then when you finish a deal it is important to develop the business to create a common culture to work with the team. This is my job.

'He is the boss in professional life. We have a very strong complementary relationship and a very good understanding.'

Both sound like complete workaholics. One associate says: 'You can call any time day or night except on a Sunday before 2.30pm. It's the only time they rest.'

Her job as chief operating officer involves overseeing all of WBA's businesses outside the US.

'Before Covid I lived on a plane' she says. Vacations don't exist in her world.

'For me a holiday means working for five hours in the day and after that maybe have dinner' she explains. 'But it is not a job for me it is a pleasure. I work with a lot of passion. People talk about stress but personally I don't know what it means.'

One of Barra's proudest moments was in January 2015 – ringing the bell on the Nasdaq stock market in New York to celebrate the merger of Boots and Walgreens. 'It was emotional. I remember it was snowing it was cold but I didn't care it was a fantastic day. If you ask me whether 50 years ago could I imagine this – no.'

Her advice for others who are aiming for the top is one that runs against the orthodoxy that women – or men – can have it all.

'Be prepared to make sacrifices because you can't do everything in life' she says. 'It is about choices. I don't spend time in the gym or in a spa.'

In pre-Covid times walking around WBA stores chatting to staff and checking the shelves meant she didn't need the gym anyway. 'I did my 10000 steps' she laughs.

Her advice? 'Support your colleagues and take support from them. Avoid conflict and jealousy. And it's important to remain calm. Not every problem is a disaster.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzgyN2YxNTEwLTg0OTQtNDczNi1hMGRjLWU1Y2RjZDBlOWE2NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Political proxies: conservative activists file record shareholder proposals,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

He was 95.

Bogle was Sam Walton’s first manager at the Walton Five and Dime on the Bentonville square. He worked with the company for 28 years before retiring in 1982.

According to his obituary Bogle enlisted in the U.S. Army in January 1945. After graduating from Airborne School at Fort Benning Georgia he was assigned to the Company 1 3rd Battalion 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg.

He graduated from the University of Arkansas in 1949 and began his career in public health.

After earning a master’s in public health in 1951 from the University of North Carolina Bogle and his wife Marilyn moved to Bentonville where he worked as Benton County health inspector.

In 1955 Sam Walton recruited Bogle as the first store manager for the Walton Five and Dime in Bentonville.

According to the obituary Bogle “loved working in the store and you usually heard his cheerful whistling upon entering. He eventually moved to the general office where he would take on solving some of the challenges of the new company.”

Regarding Bogle’s suggestion of the “Wal-Mart” name the obituary said: “Bob wrote this suggestion for Mr. Sam who glanced at it and put it in his pocket. Bob did not know if he would use the name until he saw the letters going up on the first store in Rogers [in 1962].”

Bogle’s military career with the Arkansas National Guard began on July 9 1954. In June 1972 as a Lt. Col. he took command of the Battery A 1st Battalion 142nd Artillery. He remained in the Arkansas National Guard until his retirement in 1982 at the rank of Colonel.

The Bogles were dedicated financial supporters of the University of Arkansas and its academic and athletic programs. In May 2008 Bogle Park the UA’s softball facility was officially dedicated on the Fayetteville campus thanks to the Bogles’ support of the Razorback softball program. In 2015 the Bogles pledged $1 million to the UA’s Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural Food and Life Sciences.

Marilyn Bogle died in January 2020.

Bogle’s funeral service through Nelson-Berna Funeral Home of Rogers will be at 1 p.m. on March 30 at First Baptist Church in Bentonville.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGFzMTEuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9jb21tdW5pdHkvd2FsbWFydC1jbG9zaW5nLXN1cGVyY2VudGVyLWdyb2Nlcnktc2hvcHBpbmctcmFnZ2FyZC1yb2FkLXBycC1jbG9zdXJlLXBsZWFzdXJlLXJpZGdlLXBhcmsvNDE3LWE0MDQ1N2JhLTM3NmQtNGM4Mi05ZDI1LTY4ODNjNjJhZWM2ZtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart closure in PRP | Customers community concerned over loss,"Both business owners and shoppers alike expressed their concerns with such a major retailer leaving the community.

LOUISVILLE Ky. — The announcement that the Pleasure Ridge Park Walmart will be closing next month has many people talking.

Both business owners and shoppers alike expressed their concerns with such a major retailer leaving the community.

""It's gonna be kind of devastating. But I think we are going to have to figure out what we'll do next"" Eric Overton of Shively said.

Devastating inconvenient. Some of the many words people are using to describe the closure of the Walmart near the Shively and Pleasure Ridge Park communities.

""It's a hardship on people like us because you know when you're retired or disabled you know you can't get out there and go five and 10 miles every day to a store or whatever"" Dave Smith of Riverside Gardens said.

Walmart said in a statement the store will close Friday April 22 due to historic and current financial performance.

Shoppers like Dave Smith say it feels as though their community is being forgotten.

""We need it we need it. I mean you know like I said we barely make enough now in this neighborhood because of jobs"" Smith said.

Others echo it's also the convenience factor of it all.

""We don't have a lot of time we'll be going to three four different places you know we have children"" Overton said.

And with people coming in and out of Walmart all day there are also other shops in the area for people to explore. So what do local businesses have to say about the closure?

""We're going to be here whether or not Walmart stays or goes. And we will adapt. And like I said it leaves other opportunities for entrepreneurs here to bring something over here this location"" Stephen ""Lucky"" Probus owner of Lucks Barber Shop said.

Probus better known as Lucky in the community is the owner of a barbershop next to the Walmart. He says having a major retailer like that has been beneficial to his business.

""One of the things is that it does help provide the information to future clients as to going over their grocery shopping"" Lucky said.

Lucky was born and raised in the area so he says he doesn't want this breakup with the big-box retailer to leave a stain on the community.

""This community doesn't want to see dead space over there. It can be a real eyesore. I truly believe that someone will see the opportunity"" Lucky said.

(KOLO/Gray News) - Police have arrested a man in connection to the abduction of 18-year-old Naomi Irion from a Walmart parking lot.

The Lyon County Sheriff’s Office said Friday evening they have taken 41-year-old Troy Driver into custody according to KOLO. He is being held on a kidnapping charge.

The sheriff’s office reported a pickup truck that may have been involved was located and impounded.

The search continues for Irion who remains missing.

Police said Irion was abducted from the Walmart parking lot in Fernley Nevada on March 12 just before 5:30 a.m. She was waiting for a shuttle to her job at Panasonic which normally arrives to pick her up between 5:30 a.m. and 5:40 a.m. according to her brother.

Surveillance video from the parking lot shows a man approaching Irion’s car at 5:24 a.m. and a minute later her car leaves the parking lot.

Her brother Casey Valley said he learned from Panasonic that Irion did not show up for work that day. She hasn’t been heard from since.

Valley said he went to the Walmart the next day when Irion still did not come home. Once at Walmart he watched surveillance video showing the suspect say or do something to make Irion move over from the driver’s side of her car to the passenger side. The suspect then drove off in an unknown direction with Irion inside the car.

Valley said he was “mortified” when he saw the video.

On March 15 a ping of Irion’s cell phone led authorities to an industrial park in Fernley where they found her car. Deputies say evidence found inside the car suggests Irion’s disappearance was criminal in nature.

Her phone has not been found.

Irion was last seen wearing a blue Panasonic shirt a gray cardigan and gray black or brown knockoff Ugg boots. She was also carrying a black purse. She is 5′11″ with dyed black hair and green eyes. One eye also has brown in it. She also has a smiley face tattoo on one of her ankles and a septum piercing. She is known to carry a fidget spinner her family said.

The community held a candlelight vigil for Irion on Tuesday.

Irion’s mother Diana arrived in Nevada Monday night from South Africa. She spoke during Tuesday’s press conference and urged people with information to come forward.

“Please save my daughter and bring her home please” she said.

This weekend I was able to visit Walt’s gorgeous storybook mansion in the Hollywood Hills and also take a visit to his favorite restaurant The Tam O’Shanter. Of course I have a recipe to share with you inspired by my amazing weekend… Walt’s favorite go-to meal from The Tam a Mister MacTavish Burger! Here’s a little history about Walt and then we’ll get to the recipe!

Walt Disney’s Storybook Mansion

In 1932 Walt and Lilian Disney built the mansion of their dreams in the hopes of expanding their family in the hills of Los Feliz not far from their previous home further down the hill on Lyric Avenue. The private residence occasionally hosts tours so Disney fans can see inside and learn the incredible history of the place. I was so honored to visit Walt’s Storybook Mansion this weekend and hear all of the amazing stories that took place in this stunning estate.

The exterior has such a fairytale feeling to it with ivy-covered brick walls and turrets.

As you enter the home you’ll see a beautiful iron staircase that follows the curve of the tower leading up to a magnificent hand-painted ceiling.

In every square foot of the house you are reminded of Walt.

The backyard has a stunning view of downtown Los Angeles. But what I love most about the yard isn’t the view or sprawling lawn or even the inviting pool — it’s the Snow White cottage that Walt had built for his daughters Diane and Sharon for Christmas while they were living in the house.

The mansion is filled with painted and stained glass windows and many charming storybook details.

Walt really loved this particular area of LA which is why he built his homes and his Hyperion Studio right down the street along with some production outbuildings right around the corner. However Walt forgot one important element when building the Hyperion Studio: there was no commissary for his staff to eat at. Instead he adopted a nearby Scottish-themed restaurant called The Tam O’Shanter that essentially became an extension of his office. He would conduct a lot of business at Table 31 next to a cozy fireplace that is marked by a poster and placard tag on the table that mentions that was Walt Disney’s preferred spot.

When “The Tam” was built by Lawry’s owner in 1922 the builder was told to throw out all levels and plumb lines and just eyeball it! What was created was a very charming timber and mortar building that may have inspired the look of Snow White’s cottage the Disney girls’ playhouse and the studio production outbuildings.

My parents grew up in Burbank just a few blocks from the current Burbank Studio and my first trip to The Tam was after I had my first piano recital when I was 8 years old in 1973. I thought I was so grown up eating in such a fancy restaurant!

It’s still a meaningful spot for me today: I even celebrated my 55th birthday there with my family and sat in Walt’s room (there were too many of us for Walt’s table) but then I was able to slide into the booth and get some pictures!

Mister Mactavish Rarebit Burger Recipe

At least 3 times a week Walt had lunch at “The Tam” and often ordered the same thing. He wasn’t a fan of fancy steaks and had a very simple palate. His “to go” meal was the Mister MacTavish Rarebit Burger which was a regular menu item from 1922 through the seventies. Unfortunately it is no longer on the menu today. However I was able to find the original MacTavish Burger recipe. The original was served on plain white bread and the rarebit (a type of cheese sauce) was lightly spiced with added bacon. This recipe is like taking a trip back in time in the best way possible.

Mister MacTavish Rarebit Burger

Ingredients:

1egg yolk

1 Tbsp butter

1 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese

1/2 cup ale

1 tsp Worcestershire sauce

1/2 tsp dry mustard

4 slices crisp bacon

1 lb ground beef

1 tsp salt

Fresh-cracked black pepper to taste

3 Tbsp butter

2 Tbsp grated parmesan cheese

8 slices white bread toasted or sliced ciabatta rolls toasted

Instructions:

Beat egg yolk in a medium-sized heat-resistant bowl and set aside on the counter. Melt butter in the top of a double boiler; add cheese and stir until melted. It’ll be clumpy but don’t worry gradually add the beer stirring constantly and it will smooth out. Stir in the Worcestershire and mustard powder and continue to whisk. Remove the top portion of a double boiler (leaving the hot water pan over the heat) and pour beer/cheese mixture gradually into the egg yolk bowl whisking steadily to prevent curdling. Scrape this all back into the top portion of the double boiler; place back over hot water pan and cook whisking until mixture thickens and you have a smooth velvety sauce. Remove from heat and set aside.



Pan-fry or oven fry bacon. Drain fat. Set aside.

Season ground beef with salt and pepper. Shape into 4 patties. Pan fry to desired doneness.

While burgers are cooking toast bread. Set aside four toasts. Cut the other four diagonally to make triangles. Mix together butter and parmesan cheese and spread on toasts.



To serve: Place one of the whole toasts in the center of a serving plate. Place a triangular toast on either side. Top the center toast with a burger. Pour sauce over. Top burger with bacon slice. Repeat for each serving.



As an added bonus I’ve included a recipe from the Tam O’Shanter for Scotch Rarebit that can be used as a spread on toast or as a dip for vegetables.

Tam O’Shanter Scotch Rarebit

Makes 5 1/2 cups

6 tablespoons oil

1/2 cup flour

2 teaspoons dry mustard

1 quart milk scalded

1/2 pound plus 1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

1 teaspoon salt

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Dash hot pepper sauce

Dash cayenne pepper

2 tablespoons cornstarch

1/2 cup beer

Instructions

Bring oil to boil. Add flour and dry mustard. Cook 3 minutes.

Add milk cheese salt Worcestershire sauce hot pepper sauce and cayenne pepper. Cook until cheese melts.

Mix cornstarch in beer and add to hot mixture.

Return cheese mixture to heat and bring to boil. Add food color if desired. Remove from heat and strain.

Disney World has been one of my favorite places since I started visiting as a child. Now I take my own children every chance I get.

But now my whole family has been to Disneyland at least once. After our last visit we all agreed that if it weren't for the expensive plane ride across the country we'd spend more time in Disneyland than Disney World.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Read on for why I think the California park is better.

Disneyland is the original Disney theme park

It's a Small World first opened at Disneyland in California. Sarah Gilliland

There's something to be said about being the first.

Walt Disney created Disneyland as a place for families to spend time and have fun together and the legacy isn't lost on me — it's what I strive for every time we travel.

The nostalgia of the park and its storied history pull at my heartstrings every visit.

Park-hopping is easy and quick in Anaheim

There are two parks: Disneyland and California Adventure. Sarah Gilliland

One of my biggest issues with Disney World is how spread out the property is — even if it was purposefully set up that way for future expansion.

The ease of park hopping between the two parks at Disneyland is a better experience than trying to get around all four at Disney World.

It's nice to take a break in Downtown Disney during a park day

I love to shop especially when I can also enjoy sipping my Starbucks while people-watching.

All of those things are easy to do in Disneyland's Downtown Disney area — located a simple walkable distance away from the parks.

In Disney World you have to commute 15 minutes to Disney Springs the dining shopping and entertainment district.

I was blown away by Disneyland's Avengers Campus

There are so many Marvel characters to meet at Disneyland. Sarah Gilliland

Even though I'm a bigger fan of ""Star Wars"" than I am of Marvel Disneyland's Avengers Campus simply blew me away on my first visit.

The roaming characters replica movie props and live entertainment are truly captivating.

Even if you're not familiar with Marvel it's difficult not to be impressed by the grandeur. And you can't experience anything like it at Disney World (yet).

The Disneyland hotels are within walking distance of the parks

All of the Disneyland hotels and many of the locally affiliated ""Good Neighbor"" hotels are within walking distance of the parks.

We almost never go back to our hotels at Disney World because that travel eats up too much of our vacation time.

Disneyland's smaller more compact size makes taking a break easy especially when visiting with children.

After trying both the churros are better at Disneyland

The chocolate-peanut churros are amazing. Sarah Gilliland

I don't know what the West Coast knows that the East Coast doesn't but there's a vast difference between the churros at Disneyland and Disney World.

Each park has its strengths but the churros are one of Disneyland's superior food options.

Disneyland also goes more all out with its holiday celebrations

Sections across the park get decorated for the holidays. Sarah Gilliland

Epcot in Disney World is known for its festivals but Disneyland still has it beat with holiday celebrations.

Every year Disneyland celebrates Lunar New Year Día de los Muertos and the winter holidays with a special flair.

My family's latest trip to Disneyland was over the holidays and it was worth every penny to be there during Christmas. The holiday overlays at Disneyland really make my family enjoy certain rides more.

For example one of my daughters won't ride the Haunted Mansion in Disney World. But during Christmas at Disneyland when the Jack Skellington overlay is up she'll go on more than once.

Genie+ is more useful at Disneyland

Regardless of how much I grumble about paying extra to skip the lines on a Disney vacation I have to admit how much better the system Genie+ works at Disneyland than Disney World.

At Disney World guests can start reserving rides at 7 a.m. regardless of when they actually enter the park. But at Disneyland you have to scan into the park before using Genie+ which I think levels the playing field a little more.

Even though Genie+ costs $5 more a person at Disneyland it also includes unlimited PhotoPass downloads — Disney World's Genie+ only offers special AR lenses you can use on your phone.

There are some unique attractions you can only find at Disneyland

They turned the Disneyland Tower of Terror ride into one based on ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Sarah Gilliland

Many attractions at Disneyland can only be found in California including Alice in Wonderland Matterhorn Bobsleds and Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

Of the rides that can be found at both Disneyland and Disney World such as Space Mountain or It's a Small World I think Disneyland's win because they incorporate more familiar characters or offer better seating arrangements.

I've had better character interactions and experiences in California

Sometimes you can naturally interact with characters around the park. Sarah Gilliland

Character interactions are a major part of visiting the Disney parks and Disneyland does them best.

Waiting in line for meet and greets is the norm across the parks but you can also often catch characters out and about interacting with guests in California.

In interviews with Fox News Digital several Republicans lawmakers said Disney has become too ""woke"" in their opposition to legislation that bars instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. Critics have dubbed the effort the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.

""Corporate America is under this cloak of arrogance where they think they get to play God with morality and sexuality and a host of other realities in this world and somehow if you don't agree with their interpretation then you are guilty of some kind of hate speech"" Florida Republican Rep. Brian Mast told Fox News Digital.

DESANTIS SLAMS 'WOKE' DISNEY AFTER CEO CONDEMNS PARENTS' RIGHTS BILL

Mast likened Disney's recent opposition to the bill to Coca-Cola and Major League Baseball moving the All-Star game out of Georgia last year to protest the state's voting law as well as efforts by Twitter and Facebook to censor conservative voices. He said conservatives are better than liberals at avoiding companies that try to cancel their viewpoints and Walt Disney World in Florida may be in for lost tourism.

""There's a real conviction to actually boycott companies that try to cancel you on the conservative side"" Mast said.

Under pressure from LGBTQ activists and progressive employees – some of whom who have walked out of the job in protest– Disney CEO Bob Chapek’s eventually criticized the Florida legislation paused all political giving in Florida and apologized to employees.

""You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down"" Chapek said in a statement on March. 11. ""I am sorry.""

While Disney employees were walking out to demand more LGBTQ support conservative employees quietly penned an anonymous open letter saying the company has become an ""increasingly uncomfortable place to work"" for employees whose political and religious views are not explicitly progressive. They described an ""environment of fear"" for right-leaning employees and being treated as ""villains.""

""Disney has turned their family-friendly company into an activist machine that perpetuates a whole agenda of left-wing propaganda"" said Rep. Greg Steube R-Fla. ""What they’re doing is incredibly dangerous as their company is mainly marketed towards families and children.""

DISNEY EMPLOYEES ARE WALKING OUT TO DEMAND MORE LGBTQ SUPPORT

Steube added: ""Even their employees have noted Disney doesn’t have room for religious or political conservatives. I hope folks remember that when choosing where to spend their hard-earned vacation funds.""

Rep. Mike Waltz R-Fla. said ""these corporations need to stay out of politics.""

He called it ""hypocritical and disgusting"" that companies like Disney and Coca-Cola call out states like Florida and Georgia but continue to do business in China despite its human rights abuses and government censorship.

""They'll bow down to an authoritarian regime that has zero diversity and in fact is committing genocide against ethnic minorities"" Waltz said. ""They'll do whatever it takes to keep that business but yet want to preach social justice here at home … It's really hypocritical and disgusting.""

The Parental Rights in Education bill bans Florida school employees or third parties from giving classroom instruction on ""sexual orientation"" or ""gender identity"" in kindergarten through third grade.

The bill  which passed the House and Senate and awaits the signature of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been dubbed the ""Don’t Say Gay"" bill by Democrats who have claimed it bans any discussion pertaining to being gay in the state's schools. President Biden has called the bill ""hateful.""

But DeSantis and backers say there's nothing in the bill preventing anyone from saying gay but rather it's about age-appropriate education on gender and sexual orientation in schools.

""For years children have been exposed to the teachings of gender identity and sexual fluidity in Florida’s classrooms"" said Rep. Byron Donalds R-Fla. ""If you think schools should be imposing these teachings upon elementary-aged children you’re the controversial one—not me.""

Rep. Carlos Giménez R-Fla. said Disney is increasingly out of touch with Florida values if the company thinks it's appropriate for the state to teach issues of sexual orientation and gender identity to 5 6 and 7 year-olds.

""In Florida we are standing up for our parents and families"" Gimenez told Fox News Digital. ""Maybe it’s time for Disney to rediscover its core values and quit trying to appease the woke left.""

But Rep. Lois Frankel D-Fla. said she's ""not worried"" that Disney's stance will impact tourism more broadly in Florida.

""Tourism is such a big industry in Florida and families love coming here"" Frankel told Fox News Digital. ""So from where I sit in Boca Raton Fla. I think the average person is not looking at it closely my point of view this is a blip. However someone in Orlando might see it differently.""

The subtitle of the book is “12 Women Reflect on Their Trailblazing Theme Park Careers.”

“A dozen female Imagineers recount their trailblazing careers! Capturing an era ― and preserving the stories they have told their daughters their mentees their husbands and their friends ― a dozen women Imagineers have written personal stories from their decades designing and building the Disney world-wide empire of theme parks. Illustrated with the women’s personal drawings and photos in addition to archival Imagineering images the book represents a broad swath of Imagineering’s creative disciplines during a time of unprecedented expansion. Intertwined with memories of Disney legends are glimpses of what it takes behind the scenes to create a theme park and the struggles unique to women who were becoming more and more important visible and powerful in a workplace that was overwhelmingly male. Each chapter is unique from a unique Imagineer’s perspective and experience. These women spent their careers telling stories in three dimensions for the public. Now they’ve assembled their stories in print with the hope that their experiences will continue to entertain and illuminate.“

Alex is not a ""DIY girl"" so she's not sure what inspired her to pick up the scissors and test out her snipping skills. It turns out that she's craftier than she gave herself credit for!

During the March 8 city council work session Blake Leonelli from Waste Management gave a presentation on the green waste change — and its benefits to the city.

The proposal is that green waste such as grass clippings and branches be put in the regular black trash bin. As a bonus existing green waste bins could be used as a second waste can.

Residents can opt out though and contact the city at 801-229-7000. They will come and collect the green bin. Residents who opt out will see a monthly reduction on their city bill of $6.60. Those who keep the bin and use it will save $3.40 by being charged the $6.60 rather than the $10 a month that regular black bins cost.

The green waste program started in 2006 with weekly pickups between March and November. Only 6009 bins have been distributed in a city of nearly 100000 people.

The green cans collected mostly grass clippings which are not good for mulching.

The current process was to collect green waste curbside at homes it is then delivered to the North Pointe Transfer Station where it is mixed with humanure — human manure — and the compost is sold.

Waste Management proposed the cans be picked up curbside delivered to the transfer station and on to the city’s landfill.

They also indicated there was only one small company doing the composting and processing organic waste. If more outlets develop they could reconsider the green waste cans.

The benefit of having it go directly to the landfill is that green waste in the landfill decomposes producing methane gas. That can then be collected and used as an alternative renewable energy.

“Orem’s landfill has a methane capture system underway” according to Leonelli.

Making this change can add many years on to the landfill according to Waste Management. It also saves space in the trucks.

Getting rid of the green waste pickup also allows for less trucks to be used less wear and tear on city roads less labor dependency and allows for year-round pick up.

On the money side of the proposition both Waste Management and the city pointed out that the collection of green waste was being subsidized. Under the current practices green waste collection operates at a loss.

“Making the change the costs would be completely covered” Leonelli said during his presentation.

In order to educate the public about the change which is a long term process the city has borrowed from Dr. Seuss. Residents will begin to see “Green Waste and Ham” promotions throughout the city.

Editor’s note: A previous version of this story wrongly stated that green waste would no longer be collected under Waste Management’s proposed change.

Waste Management has been awarded a five-year contract to collect trash and recyclables in the township beginning in the second quarter this year. Cost for township residents will increase from $59.76 to $87 quarterly.

More increases are ahead.

Residents will pay $93.09 quarterly for trash and recycling pickup in 2023 $99.61 in 2024 $106.58 in 2025 and $114.04 in 2026.

Waste Management was the only company that submitted a bid to provide collection services in the township through March 2027. Supervisors awarded the contract Tuesday.

Though the cost for township residents will increase the cost is not out of line with other municipal trash rates township solicitor Mark Shaw said in summarizing the contract for township supervisors.

""I think the pricing we got was not unreasonable given the cost increases in the climate we're in"" Shaw said. ""I think the pricing we had the last five years frankly was a great price and actually was decreased from the prior contract. We were lucky to have that for that five-year period.""

Trash and recycling service had been provided by Advanced Disposal which was awarded a five-year contract in April 2017. The company was acquired by Waste Management in October 2020.

""From the historical perspective just to remind folks the last time (the contract came due) we had several bidders and (we) were in a position to choose the lowest bidder who was a new entrant to the market Advanced Disposal"" Shaw said.

The incremental increase in the service cost will soften the blow for residents township officials said. And residents will have the option to pay per bag rather than pay for unlimited pickup.

Cost per bag will be $7 this year $7.50 in 2023 $8 in 2024 $8.50 in 2025 and $9 in 2026.

Collection services won't change and that's a plus for township residents Supervisor Jim Bock said.

Waste Management will continue ""single-stream"" recycling meaning recyclables don't have to be sorted and can be left at the curb in one container. The company also will continue to collect glass in Millcreek for recycling.

""Obviously none of us likes the increase that's occurring compared to what (the price) has been but one main component is the fact that the service itself is not going to change"" Bock said.

It lifts our spirits knowing that all this beautiful wholesome produce will reach the tables of those who need it.

But in our larger food system 30 to 40 percent of what is produced never gets eaten. And all the resources that went into its growth — seeds water soil nutrients energy labor — are wasted too.

Eliminating this staggering loss could cut by half the number of Americans facing food insecurity. In Maine where one in five children face hunger it could transform untold lives.

The food wasted by consumers’ costs the average U.S. household an estimated $1866 per year as of 2020 a figure that has undoubtedly risen due to the pandemic and increased oil prices.

Nearly all of the uneaten food ends up in landfills where it can sit for two decades or more generating methane a potent greenhouse gas. When climate impacts from production to disposal are measured food waste accounts for 8 percent of global greenhouse emissions.

According to the scientific nonprofit Project Drawdown cutting food waste is a top strategy to limit emissions. (Inexplicably food waste got only a passing reference in Maine’s climate action plan but it could still be added to the recommended community resilience actions that the state is supporting through grants.)

Redirecting food to hungry people would do far more than cut greenhouse gas emissions and increase food security. It would improve public health save on municipal waste disposal costs slow the expansion of landfills and reduce water waste. With so many potential benefits and such universal relevance (everyone eats) tackling food waste should be a state priority.

The need for faster progress

When I first wrote about this topic in 2015 it seemed like the tide might be turning with the advent of composting businesses the construction of an anaerobic digester in Exeter movies like Just Eat It a growing network of local food councils and pilot programs in supermarkets to sell imperfect produce.

But then momentum seemed to flag. Some of those pilots ended and other New England states moved ahead of Maine in crafting bans on landfill disposal of organic waste.

It’s hard to track how much progress Maine has made in recent years because the state lacks adequate staff to gather solid data on food use diversion and disposal. The only reliable waste characterization studies date back to 2011 just before former Gov. Paul LePage abolished the State Planning Office. At that time 27 percent of baggable household waste was food.

Almost no food should be landfilled or incinerated according to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection’s food recovery hierarchy (see figure). The highest and best use of food is feeding hungry people. Animals are next with inedible food scraps appropriate for composting or anaerobic digestion. The top tier of the pyramid deserves primary attention: preventing food waste (the proverbial “waste not want not” tradition once revered in Maine).

Even diversion of once-edible food to anaerobic digestion “still represents a loss when compared to waste prevention” said Travis Blackmer an economist at the University of Maine making the metrics of “success” in food waste reduction difficult to track. “Waste prevention is nearly impossible to measure in the aggregate” he added “so researchers focus on measuring what is diverted from disposal.”

According to Ryan Parker Maine program associate director for FoodCorps much of what is shipped to the anaerobic digester in Exeter is unopened unused food that ought to be distributed locally to humans and livestock.

“It’s incredibly inefficient and makes zero sense” he said. “We haven’t done anything to move things up to the higher levels of the (food recovery) hierarchy… The top tier is where we should be focusing.”

Susanne Lee who leads Food Rescue MAINE — a program to end food waste established by the University of Maine’s Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions in 2019 — is working on that task and many others in collaboration with students municipalities businesses and nonprofits. They have identified a need for more food-processing infrastructure around Maine. In response the university is developing a Maine Food System GIS map to help the state identify suitable processing locations.

Lee would also like to see Maine employ a widely used food rescue software system to help manage the dynamic mix of available food and volunteers willing to transport it. But any new approach she noted “needs to be community-based” embraced by the volunteers who operate local food banks.

Building local resilience

Despite Maine’s thriving local food movement little attention goes to returning food scraps to local soils — minimizing reliance on outside fertilizers and insulating communities from price shocks in waste hauling and disposal fees.

Skowhegan for example runs a municipal composting operation that gathers food scraps from local schools and residents to mix with yard waste. Bryan Belliveau the town’s waste management supervisor urges other communities to consider composting given there are “only plusses to doing it; there are no negatives.”

Alongside generating compost valued at $40 to $60 per ton municipalities could realize annual savings on waste disposal fees ranging from $5000 per year for the smallest towns to $60000 for cities like Augusta or Waterville the Mitchell Center estimates. As hauling costs and fertilizer costs rise with higher fuel prices the economics of local composting improve even more.

The Maine DEP offers grants for communities seeking to divert food waste and U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree has proposed federal bills that would provide grants for school and community initiatives to reduce food waste and would create at the U.S. Department of Agriculture a grant and loan program supporting both large-scale and community-based composting.

To encourage more communities to reduce food waste and increase food recycling the Mitchell Center’s Food Rescue MAINE will work this year with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to offer regional meetings around the state. Details will be announced at a virtual Food Waste Solutions Summit on April 15. “There are so many factors that make now the time to embrace this approach” Lee observed.

Revisioning food

Efforts like Food Rescue MAINE are helping but the state needs policies to further accelerate progress. “Carrots and education aren’t going to fix the problem by themselves” Parker observed.

Fortunately states like Vermont have demonstrated viable models like a food scraps ban first applied to larger generators and then in 2020 extended to all households. The staged implementation gave Vermont time to scale up composting infrastructure and do the outreach needed to ensure broad voluntary compliance. As the ban took effect food donations tripled.

Mainers like residents of Vermont value food equity cost savings and healthy soils so there should be broad support for policies that reorient our food system to ensure edible food is consumed and scraps are used productively.

To get there we need to recover more than just food. We must revive the ethic earlier generations had — recognizing that natural cycles are free of waste and honoring food as the gift of a generous Earth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcnlsYW5kbWF0dGVycy5vcmcvMjAyMi8wMy8yNy9zdGF0ZS10by10ZW1wb3JhcmlseS10YWtlLWNvbnRyb2wtb2YtY2l0eXMtd2FzdGV3YXRlci10cmVhdG1lbnQtcGxhbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,State to Temporarily Take Control of City's Wastewater Treatment Plant,"Maryland Environment Secretary Ben Grumbles on Sunday said the Maryland Environmental Service would temporarily take control of Baltimore City’s Back River Wastewater Treatment Plant the site of ongoing illegal discharges into the river.

Grumbles said the city had failed to comply with a previous state order to immediately end illegal discharges of water pollution into the river.

Grumbles’ directive tasks the Maryland Environmental Service with overseeing the operation maintenance and improvements of the plant to ensure that the city operates in compliance with all terms of its discharge permit and cease all illegal discharges from the plant.

“The ongoing and escalating problems at the Back River Wastewater Treatment Plant present an unacceptable threat to the environment and public health” Grumbles said in a statement. The directive states that the Department of the Environment “has determined that the decline in the proper maintenance and operation of the Plant risks catastrophic failures at the Plant that may result in environmental harm as well as adverse public health and comfort effects.”

The Maryland Environmental Service a quasi-governmental agency already runs and maintains state-owned water wastewater and solid waste management facilities across Maryland.

The Back River plant is the largest in the state designed to discharge up to 180 million gallons a day of treated wastewater. Baltimore City’s operation of the Back River and Patapsco wastewater treatment plants and the unauthorized discharge of pollutants including nitrogen and phosphorus undermines Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts by Maryland and the other bay watershed states the Maryland Department of the Environment said. The rivers are tributaries of the Bay.

As of Sunday evening city officials had not issued a public response to Grumbles’ order. According to the Department of the Environment Grumbles spoke to Baltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott (D) about conditions at the wastewater treatment plant on Friday after issuing an order that the city had 48 hours to curb discharges at the plant.

Earlier this year the Department of the Environment filed suit against the city seeking civil penalties and an order requiring the city to take all steps necessary for the Back River and Patapsco treatment plants to come into permanent and consistent compliance with environmental law. That case is pending.

Grumbles’ directive calls on the Maryland Environmental Service to work with Baltimore officials to ensure that the city meets the following objectives at the Back River plant: protecting public and environmental health; abating any further nuisance; providing appropriate levels of qualified staff; conducting appropriate maintenance improvements and modifications; operating the Back River plant in compliance with all terms of the plant’s discharge permit from the state; and ceasing all unpermitted discharges from the plant.

The directive also calls for the environmental service to undertake an assessment of the plant’s operation maintenance staffing and equipment and to submit a report to Department of the Environment of its findings and recommendations by June 6.

Here in an area where nearly 70 percent of households speak a language other than English a case of environmental injustice is unfolding — one that is a microcosm of nationwide efforts to advance health equity for generations to come.

More than 2000 of Hamtramck’s roughly 22000 residents live within a half-mile radius of the U.S. Ecology Detroit North waste management facility which processes and stores toxic heavy metals and other toxic waste produced by commercial entities and governments.

Over the years the facility has amassed a spotty track record on environmental safety compliance. In 2016 the Detroit Free Press obtained records showing the company had accrued 150 wastewater violations since 2010 for infractions that included discharging water with excessive levels of toxic mercury and arsenic into the city sewer system. In 2017 independent tests of public lands surrounding the facility found soil samples containing arsenic a known carcinogen at levels almost 20 times the EPA safety limit. (The facility has longstanding waivers that exempt it from groundwater and soil monitoring.)

Several years ago as residents began to catch wind of a proposed expansion that would increase the site’s chemical waste storage capacity ninefold and permit it to process 30 new categories of hazardous waste including cancer-causing aflatoxins local activists cried foul. They filed petitions and staged protests to little avail. In 2020 after delaying its final decision and extending the public commenting period the Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy the state agency that oversees hazardous waste management approved the facility’s expansion.

A battle to protect residents of Hamtramck is now being waged by the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center which has filed a formal grievance with the EGLE’s Nondiscrimination Compliance Coordinator. The coordinator reviews Title VI complaints in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency regulation. In addition to violating that regulation the law center alleges that the decision to issue the expanded license to the U.S. Ecology facility also constitutes discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The grievance notes that 80 percent of the residents within a 3-mile radius of the site are people of color.

The lawyers contend that although the EGLE provided public notice of the proposed expansion the agency failed to make those notices available in languages appropriate for the many Arabic and Bengali-speaking immigrants who live near the facility. Further the complaint states public hearings that were promised to be language-accessible at the behest of residents and grassroots organizations ultimately were not. EGLE has since released a Limited English Proficiency Plan that outlines steps the agency will take to comply with federal civil rights law and public notice requirements in the future.

Meaningful language access to legally mandated environmental information disclosures is a key component of many regulations and EPA discrimination-related complaints. But another perhaps more far-reaching criticism leveled in the Hamtramck grievance centers on a concept that has become a perennial point of contention in environmental regulation: an idea known as cumulative risk.

A large body of research in disciplines such as toxicology and social epidemiology has demonstrated that environmental pollutants can act in conjunction with one another and that a person’s health can be negatively impacted by the accumulation of health risks over his or her lifetime. The nature of these risks extends beyond toxic chemical and biological exposures; stress-inducing socioeconomic conditions often prevalent among people of color pose risks to human health as well. These factors may act cumulatively or even synergistically with environmental toxicants to exacerbate the risk of adverse health outcomes.

There’s reason to believe that such cumulative risks could be inordinate in communities in and around Hamtramck. The city is marked by high population density and poverty rates two factors that are associated with a high incidence of chronic disease. Predominantly Black areas of metropolitan Detroit already face high volumes of industrial pollution and have some of the highest asthma rates in the country. In Hamtramck many Bangladeshi and Yemeni immigrants have had to endure both chemical exposure and social toxicity.

In addition to ongoing xenophobic and Islamophobic discrimination some Yemeni immigrants still suffer psychological and biological effects of forced displacement from their home country a war-torn nation where violence famine and disease are commonplace. These comorbidities and social stressors would likely be amplified by further exposure to environmental pollution.

Moreover Bangladeshi immigrants to the U.S. come from a country that has among the highest level of groundwater arsenic contamination in the world and many have brought their agricultural traditions to Detroit where they rely on urban farming. They may be fearful of the cumulative toll that continued exposure to arsenic in groundwater and soil could take on their health.

Predominantly Black areas of metropolitan Detroit already face high volumes of industrial pollution and have some of the highest asthma rates in the country.

In its grievance against EGLE the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center argues that the agency should have assessed these cumulative risks before approving the expansion of the U.S. Ecology Detroit North site. The complainants maintain that Michigan’s continual permitting of polluters that contribute to Hamtramck’s disproportionate burden of health-related risks is in itself discriminatory.

However there exist few federal mechanisms for compelling state and local agencies to consider cumulative risk when reviewing permit applications. The EPA has spent this past year developing long-awaited updates to its framework for planning and implementing cumulative risk assessments with the aim of encouraging more health-focused state permitting decisions but the guidance is not legally binding.

The National Environmental Policy Act requires cumulative risk assessments only for facilities that receive federal funding a category that excludes facilities such as U.S. Ecology’s Detroit-North site. (Even for those facilities that are subject to the policy act the law does not actually require that states base their decisions on the results of the cumulative risk assessments.)

In the absence of a federal mandate cumulative risk assessments are not standard in most states’ environmental regulations. In part this may be because implementing and enforcing state-level cumulative risk assessments require significant investments of time and resources: Stakeholders must come to terms on every aspect of these complex analyses from the types of stressors that a risk assessment must consider to the methodology for estimating how a new activity might elevate population-level risks.

Still those hurdles have not stopped some states from formally incorporating cumulative risk assessment into their environmental protection laws. Some states limit these laws to certain types of emissions; New York for instance enforces cumulative risk assessments for air pollution. But other states such as Massachusetts and Minnesota have adopted wider-reaching cumulative risk measures and include mechanisms for community participation. The Hamtramck case illustrates why it’s so important for more states to follow their lead.

The outcome of the grievance filed on behalf of Hamtramck’s residents is still pending. But this much seems clear: Decades of science have shown that the health risks of environmental pollution particularly in marginalized communities cannot be measured in toxicity levels alone. Until lawmakers formally codify this principle into law environmental justice will continue to prove elusive for marginalized communities like those in Hamtramck.

Sign up for the free Billy Penn newsletter to get everything you need to know about Philadelphia every day.

Thanks to the NCAA men’s basketball tournament the most exciting games at the South Philly sports complex this weekend aren’t by any of the teams that regularly call it home.

But as the St. Peter’s Peacocks play the Wells Fargo Center during their historic March Madness run they’re playing a role familiar to any Philadelphia fan: the underdog that makes good on a dream.

After the Jersey City school won Friday night beating favored Purdue 64-67 to become the first-ever No. 15 seed in the NCAA tournament’s Elite Eight they tipped a hat to the basketball team whose floor they were dancing on.

“When in Philly” the team posted on Twitter “PLAY THE SONG!!!”

If there was any question about what song they meant — and there really wasn’t — it was answered by the music player screenshot they photoshopped to go along with the tweet showing the Sixers bell logo embellished with a set of peacock feathers and the song title changed to “Here Come the Peacocks.”

The underdog story itself needs little embellishing for the basketball program at St. Peter’s University a Jesuit school that’s been on the Division I fringes for years.

Leaky roofs that flooded coaching staff offices. Leaky roofs in the gymnasium which was often shared with other sports or community events like bake sales. A low budget that meant assistant coaches had to volunteer to travel. An embarrassing visiting team locker room.

These are just some of the stories being shared by alums of the school’s men’s basketball program which has been flourishing nonetheless under Coach Shaheen Holloway.

He’s been helped by the grit and determination of his players who include mustachioed sixth man Doug Edert star guard Daryl Banks twin forwards and Mali natives Hassan and Fousseyni Drame and the entire roster which also includes North Philly native Clarence Rupert.

With North Jersey just a short car ride away the Wells Fargo Center on Friday was packed with St. Peter’s fans for the Sweet 16 game.

It’ll likely be just as full on Sunday at 5 p.m. when the Peacocks appear again in South Philadelphia to play No. 8 North Carolina for a chance to make it to the Final Four and take the Cinderella fable to a whole new level.

The odds are long but the coach and players are confident they can make it happen.

She recently called out a former manager and Wells Fargo financial advisor on social media saying that $10000 was charged to her credit card without her consent to purchase the services of an attorney to pursue guardianship over her.

In the weeks since The Wendy Williams Show was officially canceled and it was announced that Sherri Shepherd would take over the time slot with her own show Sherri Williams has continued to defend herself against rumors regarding her mental health and maintained that she is on the road to returning to television . Her finances continue to be a struggle since former financial advisor Lori Schiller claimed to Wells Fargo in February that Williams was “of unsound mind” causing the bank to remove Williams’ access to her accounts. The media personality went on Instagram to express her frustration regarding the situation:

When I began asking questions about my money suddenly Lori Schiller has got no response regarding my money. I want my money. This is not fair. And Wells Fargo has no questions and answers with regarding my money. This is not fair. And Lori Schiller and Wells Fargo have this guardianship petition about keeping me away from my money.

Not only did Wendy Williams say that Wells Fargo started this guardianship without her consent and amid her consistent denials regarding rumors about her mental health she also accused her former manager of using her credit card to retain the services of an attorney.

The former host accused Bernie Young of spending $10000 of her money per The Sun  to try to take over guardianship of her bank accounts. She addressed her former manager’s actions in her post:

And this guy named Bernie Young I know for a fact that Bernie Young used my American Express card to hire an attorney to file a petition against me. That was done with my American Express card. Bernie Young you’re no good and this is not fair at all.

The star fired Bernie Young as her manager earlier this year and although she reportedly wanted “nothing to do with him” Wells Fargo believed he was acting in the former host’s best interests. While The Sun verified the transaction that Williams said took place on her credit card there was no proof that the payment shown in the statement was unauthorized or improper.

The media personality did not appear on The Wendy Williams Show this season as she reportedly battled health problems including COVID and Graves disease. Her condition was reported to be deteriorating with sources claiming in January that she couldn’t dress herself get out of bed without assistance or recognize those close to her. A number of guest hosts took over for her including Leah Remini Michael Rapaport and Sherri Shepherd.

When Debmar-Mercury made the decision to cancel the show they left the door open for Wendy Williams’ possible return to television if and when she was able to.

The pilot study was conducted from February to March 2019 and included a sample of patients and one health professional (n = 31) in five municipalities. This study had the purpose of increasing knowledge and assessing the practicalities of the field highlighting aspects that could potentially compromise data collection [57]. We identified problems related to the field team equipment research participants and venues.

The main problems regarding the field team were the interviewers’ lack of experience. Errors were committed when interviewing patients that did not fill all the study’s inclusion criteria; ignoring the ethical rule that requires participants to sign the informed consent before the interviews; taking blurry pictures conducting interviews in noisy places reading questions differently from the original text and in entering wrong participant answers. Regarding equipment we detected problems in recording and uploading the interviews. Some participants and study sites – especially the PCPs – offered extra challenges to data collection such as asking for the research instruments in advance trying to eavesdrop or interfere in other participant interviews complaining about the presence of the field team. Some of the PCP did not have the minimal infrastructure for conducting research i.e. room arrangements and furniture.

After the pilot study another round of contact by telephone and email with the municipalities was conducted to clarify the study purposes and methods and arrange data collection on the venues. We also invested in a focused refresher course to upskill the field team. We took pictures of prescriptions and medicines during interviews to increase the quality of data collected from these items.

The technicalities were solved and a protocol for field monitoring and auditing was developed by the general coordination team including criteria for interview approvals and details on in-process quality verifications such as listening to recorded interviews and database review.

Data collection

A total of 26 municipalities were included in the project and none of them withdrew the acceptance after the study began (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2 Map of the macroregions of Minas Gerais and the municipalities included in the MedMinas Project by population size Full size image

Data was collected from April to October 2019 and began by the municipalities located at the centre macroregion due to the proximity to the project’s leading institution based in Belo Horizonte where the coordination team is based.

The field team was gradually sent either in pairs or solo to each of the 26 selected municipalities following a standardized data collection plan and detailed daily schedule. Upon arrival in each municipality the field team delivered introductory letters to health professionals at the selected facilities and health managers at the Municipal Health Secretariat even though we had a formal agreement with all the municipalities and had exchanged comprehensive information about the project with health managers and professionals before going to the field. Only those that agreed to participate were interviewed at the workplace.

Most managers and professionals were fully adherent to the project. One Municipal Health Secretary refused to participate and another asked to be replaced by the Municipal Director of Health Care which is why the subgroup of “Coordinators of Primary Health Care” is over-represented (Table 3). Additionally the Municipal Coordinators of Pharmaceutical Services of two municipalities were simultaneously responsible for the PCP investigated reducing the number of pharmacists interviewed by 2.

Table 3 Respondent groups by the total number of participants selected demographics and participation rate and interview duration. MedMinas Project 2018–2021 Full size table

Patients were recruited at the PCP. Before dispensing potential participants were approached by the interviewers who introduced themselves distributed the project leaflets and informed about the general purpose of the study. Patients were approached again after dispensation. Those meeting the inclusion criteria were invited to participate while being fully informed about the study’s purpose risks benefits and interview duration to make a conscious decision to accept or decline participation. These procedures were adopted to minimize selection bias and guarantee a probabilistic sample.

We interviewed 1019 respondents of which 127 were professionals and 892 patients (Table 3). The participation rate in the study varied from 92 to 100% according to the respondent subgroup. The mean number of interviews per municipality was 39 (SD ± 7). We achieved 97% of the maximum sample planned for professionals and 95.3% for patients. Most participants were female. The mean age varied from 35 to 53 years depending on the participants' group. In general patients were older than managers and health professionals. Most managers and health professionals have attained tertiary education while the same rate among patients was minimal (8.2%).

We recorded almost 1000 h of interviews (Table 3) most of which lasted between 45 min and one hour. PHCPS coordinators went through the lengthier interview processes (mean time of 1 h 28 m).

The field team spent on average 16 days (SD ± 4.9; min max: 8–24 days) in each location. Despite contacting municipalities ahead of visiting data collection took more days than planned due to the non-availability of patients to participate in the study caused by medicine shortages at the PCP. In one municipality patient recruitment was not feasible so we lost patient data while in another we had to change data collection to another PCP facility because the patient flow was minimum.

We collected copies of 25 Essential Medicines Lists (REMUMEs) 26 Municipal Health Plans 26 Annual Management Reports and 995 prescriptions during the fieldwork totaling 1072 documents. Additionally we took 2070 pictures of prescriptions filled and medicines dispensed at the PCP.

Data monitoring and management

The field supervisor managed interviewers during the entire data collection process to ensure adherence to the study protocol data quality and completeness of the fieldwork. The team also inspected documents and images collected in the field. The coordination team oversaw the entire data collection process assisting the field team in real-time and conducting in-process quality checks.

Additionally we conducted a thorough auditing process for the first ten municipalities (n = 365) and a random sample of 10% of the other 16 municipalities (n = 70) totaling 435 interviews (42% of all interviews). The audit protocol included reading through all the questionnaires and listening to the correspondent audio-based records in detail to identify and correct errors or inconsistencies in data entry. These procedures were also used to evaluate interviewer performance such as remaining neutral during interviews while establishing empathy and rapport with interviewees asking questions correctly and clarifying the questions.

During the auditing process we found that around 24% of patient interviews contained minor errors and a few inaccuracies especially regarding information collected from prescriptions and dispensed medicines. The interview software for instance was programmed to collect data from one prescription at a time but some interviewers especially at the beginning of the fieldwork included information from more than one prescription together as if they were just one document. Another problem was data entry as “unreadable” or “missing” when in fact we could identify the correspondent information in the prescription or in the dispensed medicine by checking photos taken during the fieldwork. We produced a report based on these problems and discussed them with the field team.

Data management included the storage in electronic folders and backup copies of all field products (questionnaires documents images audio-records) organized by municipality and respondent profile. All field products were protected by passwords with access only to the coordination team.

Since MedMinas instruments contained both open-ended and closed-ended questions we transcribed the interviews. These procedures began after completing the fieldwork due to a previous agreement with the third party assigned to collect data that had internal procedures to prepare and deliver the field products.

Fieldwork challenges lessons learned and participant feedback

MedMinas had complex field logistics addressing transportation accommodation field materials and equipment. The most significant fieldwork challenges concerned: (1) municipality and participant enrolment; (2) field team; (3) interview processes; and (4) project budget. Table 4 summarises the occurrences we faced on the ground and the lessons learned from these challenges.

Table 4 Fieldwork challenges and lessons learned. MedMinas Project 2018–2021 Full size table

Regarding participant feedback 39% of managers (n = 30) 60% of the health workers (n = 30) and 70% of patients (n = 57) informed that they did not want to add thoughts or impressions about the interview. However even without further elaboration several of them mentioned the interview covered everything they expected or declared “I am good” “I cannot think of anything else right now” “I have nothing else to add”.

On the other hand most managers (n = 47; 61%) and around a third of health workers (n = 18; 36%) and patients (n = 26; 31%) broadly reflected on the experience of being interviewed. Five common major themes emerged from these groups: “self-awareness” “sense of gratitude” “research value” “access to findings” and “benefits of the research”. Numerous participants mentioned more than one theme.

Self-awareness was the predominant theme (n = 50 46.3%) meaning that the process of being interviewed has encouraged respondents to think about issues that they had not previously thought about:

“I am glad that you came here to my city! The interview made us reflect upon many things even about the work we've been developing here right? We're so in this fire-drill mode that there is no time to stop and plan the work that has to be done” (Coordinator of Pharmaceutical Services 7) “This interview has already yielded results. I will set up a meeting with the Municipal Coordinator of Pharmaceutical Services to create our ‘Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee’ and to update our municipal medicines list (sarg)… All the flaws I've mentioned here… Emm this interview really gave me the opportunity to do something about it!” (Health Secretary 16) “I think that health professionals should be more valued and more jobs should be offered to them.” (Patient 315) “I wish they had more medicines available. There are too much stock outs… physicians prescribe the most expensive medicines and they [the pharmacy] don't have it!” (Patient 164)

A “sense of gratitude” for the opportunity of being heard also emerged (n = 23; 21.3%):

“Thank you for picking us. We know the project only included a sample of the municipalities in the State so we feel like we won an award… We needed to be included to have the opportunity of giving our opinion!” (Coordinator of Pharmaceutical Services 12) “There are places where we feel abandoned. It's good to see someone looking out for us. Congratulations on the research initiative!” (Patient 467)

The “research value” i.e. the relevance of the study was pointed out by the participants (n = 15; 13.9%):

“I really enjoyed this interview… I really like this type of academic work with the aim of ‘diagnosing’ our health system… I'm sure it will bring about benefit to us managers… Research is a powerful instrument.” (Municipal Health Secretary 24) “Extremely valid to understand what people think to improve [the pharmacies]” (Patient 373)

The “benefits of the research” i.e. a hope that the research findings will improve PHCPS was considered by the interviewees (n = 11; 10.2%):

“I wish the results of this interview could benefit people here especially pharmacy users. There are many sick people in our neighbourhood even bedridden…” (Patient 255) “I hope this study makes it possible right for us to do some effective change right in the Pharmaceutical Services in the city (Health Secretary 2)”

Another key theme was “access to findings” i.e. the importance of the participants being informed about the research findings. However this theme emanated only from managers and health professionals (n = 9; 8.3%).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL2tlYXJuZXlodWIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvc2VuaW9ycy1maW5kLW91dC10aGF0LXN0YXlpbmctZml0LWlzLWlzLWZ1bi1hdC10aGUtcGV0ZXJzb24tc2VuaW9yLWFjdGl2aXR5LWNlbnRlci9hcnRpY2xlXzI1YjI0Y2EyLWFjNDktMTFlYy1iODdkLTAzNWViMTYxOTkyOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seniors find out that staying fit is is fun at the Peterson Senior Activity Center in Kearney,"KEARNEY — You’re never too old to stay fit.

Five years ago at the urging of a friend Rose Stevens of Kearney started going to the Peterson Senior Activity Center’s chair exercise class. She’s now a regular at the center at Yanney Park at 2020 W. 11th St.

“I’m out here almost five days a week. It keeps me from being this wide” she laughed. “I know it’s good for me. Exercising keeps you healthier. I never got COVID or the flu or even a cold” she said.

A retiree from West Pharmaceutical Services Stevens works out on machines lifts weights and enjoys an exercise-fitness program for women called Dedicated Dames. It’s held twice a week right after a class called Motivated Men.

Both classes were launched by Jerry Schwarz who retired 12 years ago as pastor at Calloway United Methodist Church and moved to Kearney.

First came Motivated Men. “A few guys got together and said it was more fun to exercise with somebody instead of just yourself” Schwarz said. Four men were in the class when it began but attendance quickly grew due to word of mouth.

“When Jerry started Motivated Men we women said we wanted to do that too” Stevens said. That’s how Dedicated Dames was launched. Asked how the names originated nobody was quite sure.

The 45-minute classes held downstairs in the spacious exercise areas at Peterson are fast-moving routines of a warm-up 40 minutes of steady exercise and a cool-down period. Schwarz selects the 15 exercises the classes do each session. He has compiled two fat notebooks of exercises and routines. Each has 150 laminated pages.

”It’s very popular. Many men and women have taken that class. One regular lady was 93 years old” he said.

“When the program first started we just had a clock on the wall. Then we got a timer. Workouts start with 40 seconds of exercising for men and 35 seconds for women then a 20-second period of rest. It’s balancing and stretching. It’s good for us” he said.

It was so popular in fact that initially two classes were offered for men and one for women. Now there is just one class for men but the program remains so popular that 15 or 20 people come to each session “mainly by word of mouth” Stevens said. Men come at 8:30 a.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays; women start at 9:15 a.m.

The center used to offer a F.R.O.G. program which stands for Fitness Reaching Older Generations. It was launched several years ago by Rylan Little the center’s senior services programmer. “We did that for two years and it was well-attended so we may eventually resume it. It was a lot of stretching” Little said.

Cardio drumming

The senior center’s downstairs space includes treadmills stationery bikes and a CrossFit machine. It is all free to anyone age 50 and older during center hours which are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday. No membership is required.

Every Monday at 9 a.m. Peterson offers a class called cardio-drumming. Participants of both sexes turn their chairs upside down put a fat exercise ball between the chair’s legs and guided by a YouTube program beat the exercise ball with drumsticks. “It’s quite a workout. We march in place” Juanita Eppenbach of Kearney a regular participant said.

Stevens enjoys that too. “Once I tried it I’ve come every time” she said.

The center also offers gentle yoga and chair yoga for people who have difficulty exercising while standing.

Social benefits too

The center offers more than just physical exercise. Friendships develop too.

Schwarz and his wife Phyllis moved to Kearney from Calloway 12 years ago and started coming to the Peterson center to meet people. They play pitch and pinochle and eat lunch too. “We just wanted to have fun” he said.

Added Stevens “They have so many activities. I go to movies here. I don’t pay money to go to the movies but I can come here and see them free” she said. The center shows a recent movie once a month on Wednesdays and Fridays.

“There’s always something to do here. I visit with the people I’ve met here too” she added.

Eppenbach who is retired from Cabela’s is a regular at Dedicated Dames and comes to the center two more days a week as well. “It’s fun to socialize here too. I don’t just do a machine and not talk to anyone; we introduce ourselves meet people and enjoy a good workout” she said.

Loren Booton drives to Peterson every day from near Minden to work out on the treadmill and lift weights with impressive results. A retired carpenter and builder he’s as trim as he was 50 years ago. He has been working out here for seven years. “I just like getting out and exercising” he said.

Booton and Eppenbach both widowed have become close friends since meeting here. It turns out both went to Red Cloud High School “but we were a year apart and didn’t know each other” Eppenbach said. Now happily they do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvaHlkZXJhYmFkL2t0ci1waXRjaGVzLWh5ZC1hcy1waGFybWEtaHViLXRvLWJpZ2dpZXMtaW4tdXMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTA0NjcyNDQuY21z0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9oeWRlcmFiYWQva3RyLXBpdGNoZXMtaHlkLWFzLXBoYXJtYS1odWItdG8tYmlnZ2llcy1pbi11cy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTA0NjcyNDQuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Telangana minister KT Rama Rao pitches Hyderabad as pharma hub to biggies in US,HYDERABAD: Telangana industries & IT minister KT Rama Rao  who is on a week-long US trip hard-selling Telangana as an investment destination met top honchos of the world’s top three pharma players — Pfizer  Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline — in New York on Saturday.Not only did KTR pitch Telangana’s life sciences sector especially the Hyderabad cluster he also sought their suggestions on boosting the city’s life sciences innovation quotient and invited them for the 20th edition of BioAsia that is scheduled to be held in February 2023 in Hyderabad.In a bid to get a sense of the $42 billion turnover Pfizer’s strategy and plans for India’s healthcare and pharma sector KTR met its chairman & chief executive officer Albert Bourla and also showcased Telangana’s vibrant life sciences ecosystem that accounts for a chunk of the global vaccine supply.The Telangana delegation which also included industries department principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan and life sciences director Shakthi M Nagappan also met Pfizer’s EVP & chief global supply officer Mike McDermott as well as its SVP & chief scientific officer Dr Uwe Schoenbeck.At the office of the $82 billion turnover J&J KTR held deliberations with its EVP of pharmaceutical R&D Dr Mathai Mammen.The minister also met Agam Upadhyay SVP & chief technology officer GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to acquaint him with Hyderabad’s technological and digital innovation capabilities.,,,,,,

This flaw is an out-of-bounds heap read/write (tracked as CVE-2021-44142) in the Samba vfs_fruit VFS module.

It can be exploited by unauthenticated threat actors in low complexity attacks targeting My Cloud devices running vulnerable firmware versions.

""This specific flaw exists within the parsing of extended attributes (EA) metadata when opening a file in smbd"" the data storage company explained.

""This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users if they are allowed write access to file extended attributes.""

Bug addressed by removing vulnerable Samba module

While default configurations are exposed to attacks threat actors need write access to a file's extended attributes (this could also be a guest or unauthenticated user if they are allowed write access to file extended attributes according to the Samba Team.

Western Digital addressed the vulnerability by removing the ""fruit"" VFS module from the list of configured VFS objects and changing EA support configurations in My Cloud OS 5 Firmware 5.21.104 released on March 23 2022.

The American hard disk drive manufacturer advises customers to update their devices to the latest firmware by clicking the update alert as soon as possible.

The list of devices considered vulnerable to CVE-2021-44142 attacks includes:

My Cloud PR2100

My Cloud PR4100

Netatalk critical flaw also patched this week

This week Western Digital fixed one more critical vulnerability in the open-source Netatalk Apple File Protocol fileserver used to access network shares and perform Time Machine backups.

The bug was addressed by deprecating the Netatalk service and removing it from My Cloud OS with the 5.19.117 firmware update.

After installing the firmware to the latest version the Netatalk service will no longer be available.

However My Cloud device users can still configure them to access network shares via SMB (info on how to do that is available on this support page).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25ld3MubmV0L3Bob3RvLXZpZGVvL3Bob3RvLWdhbGxlcnktdW5pY29pLWF0LXdlc3QtcmlkZ2UtYmFzZWJhbGwvY29sbGVjdGlvbl8wNzhjMGY4YS1hZDkxLTExZWMtYTEwNi04NzQ2ZGRiZWJlZWQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photo gallery: Unicoi at West Ridge baseball | Digital Media | timesnews.net,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Earlier this month West was barred from the upcoming Grammys and there has also been overwhelming public support to keep him from headlining Coachella.

A representative for West confirmed to Variety that the rapper won't be performing at the awards show due to his ""concerning online behavior."" Meanwhile a petition to have West removed as a headliner of Coachella has garnered over 40000 signatures.

""We have watched Kanye harass manipulate and hurt Kim Pete and others for over a year now. No one seems to want to stand up to him and the ones that do he puts under fire as well"" the petition states.

""Most recently he has been threatening actual bodily harm on others. This is ridiculous that he is allowed to freely do this. Coachella (along with other brand names that are still working with him) should be ashamed of themselves and should not be giving him any more of a platform. Please sign & share!""

Representatives for Coachella have not returned Fox News Digital's request for comment regarding the matter.

The hit to West's career stemmed from a handful of social media rants in which the rapper targeted Kardashian Trevor Noah Corey Gamble and Kardashian's new boyfriend Pete Davidson.

The rapper was temporarily suspended from Instagram for 24 hours due to a violation of Instagram's policies on hate speech harassment and bullying a spokesperson for Meta confirmed to Fox News Digital at the time.

Eric Schiffer chairman of Reputation Management Consultants and a leading brand expert told Fox News Digital that the suspension was a good thing for West.

""The best recovery for Kanye is that Instagram has banned him because it's hard for him to do further damage within the social platforms"" Schiffer said. ""But I think it also sent a message to him hopefully that his behavior has gotten a bit out of control.

""Part of this is him following his own instincts because he's a master at attracting attention. But it was done in a way that unlike other things that he does was missing strategic brilliance … It came across to women and certainly those who have been in abusive relationships or have had stalkers as dangerous and suffocating and unstable.""

Schiffer also noted that West's decision to turn to ""bullying"" is ""repulsive.""

""He's systematically worked to position himself in a way that to many especially women has been repulsive"" Schiffer told Fox News Digital.

The ""Flashing Lights"" rapper has also used social media to call out Kardashian for keeping their children from him an allegation she has denied. West and Kardashian share four children together: North Saint Psalm and Chicago.

West has continued to share details about the divorce on social media even though Kardashian has said the posts were causing her ""emotional distress.""

Despite West's desire to let the divorce play out on social media Kardashian has said she has chosen to take the ""high road"" during a recent appearance on ""The Ellen Show.""

Kelcey Kintner senior vice president of Red Banyan PR told Fox News Digital West needs to ""own up to his mistakes"" and ""apologize to all those involved"" before he decides to step ""back into the spotlight.""

""Kanye can recover from the current backlash but to avoid becoming too toxic and a PR liability he must rein in his erratic and concerning behavior own up to his mistakes apologize to all those involved and then lie low for a bit before stepping back into the spotlight.""

By continuing his behavior Kintner believes West could continue to be left out of music industry events.

""What happens next really depends on Kanye himself and his conduct"" she said. ""If he keeps up the public attacks on Kim Pete Davidson and others then he could certainly end up left off the lineup of other big events.""

Howard Breuer CEO of Newsroom PR doesn't believe West will be ""canceled"" over his behavior in the long term but echoed Kintner noting that West shouldn't ""dig himself an even deeper hole with this awful and abusive behavior"" if he wants ""a long-term shot at public redemption and forgiveness.""

""I think many of his fans would be inclined to go along with that"" Breuer added.

Following the Grammy news celebs spoke out about the show's decision with Noah who is hosting the awards show tweeting ""I said counsel Kanye not cancel Kanye.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS93b3JsZC9maXZlLWh1cnQtaW4tcnVzc2lhbi1zdHJpa2VzLW9uLWx2aXYtaW4td2VzdC11a3JhaW5lL2FydGljbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five hurt in Russian strikes on Lviv in west Ukraine,"The attacks came about two hours apart - Copyright CCTV/AFP STR

At least five people were wounded Saturday in two barrages of strikes that damaged infrastructure including a fuel storage facility in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv a rare attack there.

The attacks approximately two hours apart were an effort to “intimidate Ukrainians and diplomats from democratic countries who are in the city” Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak said on social media.

The strikes sent plumes of thick smoke over the city centre and Lviv residents out onto the streets to observe the dark clouds billowing and growing larger in gusts of wind.

Regional governor Maksym Kozytsky said the initial missile strikes within Lviv had wounded five people.

Mayor Andriy Sadovy said a fuel storage facility had caught fire after the first strikes while the second round had inflicted “considerable damage” to a defence facility in a residential area.

In a video statement he showed what he said was damage to a school nearby the impact site which had had its windows blown out.

“With today’s strikes the aggressor wants to say hello to President Biden who is currently in Poland.” Sadovy told a press conference before it was interrupted by air raid sirens.

– Loud whistling sound –

Lviv has been largely untouched by violence rendering it a key hub for people fleeing cities that have been under fierce Russian shelling for several weeks such as Kharkiv in east Ukraine.

The city is just 70 kilometres (45 miles) from the border with Poland where US President Joe Biden is currently visiting to shore up support for the fellow NATO-member just over one month into Russia’s assault on Ukraine.

Twenty-one-year-old Taras who lives 10 kilometres (6 miles from the strikes said he heard a loud whistling sound at around 4:30 pm (1430 GMT).

“After that I heard other passers-by shout ‘missile’. Then I heard two explosions one with a very loud boom that echoed in the sky and the other with a weaker sound” he said following the first attack.

Olga 44 a bank employee who had fled to the city from Kyiv was several kilometres from the affected site. She said she was walking when she heard two loud explosions.

“Very black smoke began to rise up. It was clear that something holding fuel had been hit. Ambulances police cars and fire engines drove quickly towards the bombed site” she told AFP by telephone declining to give her surname.

AFP journalists in Lviv said medical vehicles and fire engines were responding to the incident.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxzcHkuY29tL21vdmllcy9vc2NhcnMvYTM5NTUxNDUyL29zY2Fycy0yMDIyLWFyaWFuYS1kZWJvc2Utd2lucy1hY2NlcHRhbmNlLWxnYnRxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,West Side Story's Ariana DeBose gives powerful Oscars win speech,"West Side Story star Ariana DeBose has delivered an inspiring message after winning her first-ever Oscar.

The actress took the stage during Sunday's (March 27) ceremony to accept the Best Supporting Actress Award for her portrayal of Anita in the remake of West Side Story.

DeBose used her speech to dedicate her Oscar victory to anyone whose identity had ever been questioned or had lived in ""life's grey spaces"".

""Imagine this little girl in the back seat of a white Ford Focus"" she asked viewers. ""Look into her eyes: you see an openly queer woman of colour an Afro-Latina who found her strength in life through art. That's what I believe we're here to celebrate.

""To anybody who has ever questioned your identity ever ever or you find yourself living in the grey spaces I promise you this: there is indeed a place for us.""

DeBose's West Side Story co-star Rita Moreno won the Academy Award for playing the same role Anita for the original musical film back in the 1960s.

The multi-talented singer and actress had been widely expected to take home the Oscar after largely sweeping awards season with wins at the BAFTA Awards Golden Globe Awards and the Screen Actors Guild Awards.

According to Deadline she’s the first Black woman to own a production studio in the state. Up until this point Tyler Perry was the only Black person to own a production studio in the state of Georgia.

For 12 years Williams and her business partner Gary Guidry CEO of G-Square Events have worked relentlessly to make the 60-acre studio a reality. They founded Cinema South Studios “a one-stop shop for movie studios filmmakers and production companies” the site describes.

“We’ve been patient” Williams told AJC in February sharing how long of a journey it’s been to arrive at the groundbreaking moments of her $135 million production studio. “This has not been an overnight thing — this vision for us.”

The studio has eleven soundstages a back-lot lighting and grip rental house props and wardrobe. The production facility will have a transportation company as well as an office building for post-production and a theater.

They plan to have two of the eleven soundstages operating by 2023.

Guidry spoke to the increasing global demand for soundstages and the lack of representation and ownership for Black people in these spaces.

“The demand for soundstages is happening globally and the ownership rarely looks like us let alone an African American woman” Guidry said. “When I choose to invest I evaluate the need of the business and the ownership. Investing in Tammy Williams and her team of professionals convinced me that buying the land in Fayetteville GA.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9kcml2ZXItcmVjcnVpdG1lbnQtd2Fycy1yYWdlLWF0LW1hdHMtYm9vdGgtYWZ0ZXItYm9vdGgtYWZ0ZXItYm9vdGjSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVpZ2h0d2F2ZXMuY29tL25ld3MvZHJpdmVyLXJlY3J1aXRtZW50LXdhcnMtcmFnZS1hdC1tYXRzLWJvb3RoLWFmdGVyLWJvb3RoLWFmdGVyLWJvb3RoL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Driver recruitment wars rage at MATS booth after booth after booth,"Editor’s note: The payment to contractors by WEL has been corrected in this version to reflect the average payment.

LOUISVILLE Ky. — Imagine walking through aisle after aisle of display booths and seeing multiple signs that say in so many words “We want you bad.” But it’s not the same “We want you” with Uncle Sam’s finger pointing straight ahead.

That was the scene at the Mid-America Trucking Show here the first one since 2019 where all the endless online and radio advertisements from trucking companies looking for drivers come to life. There may be 100000 carriers in the U.S. so they clearly aren’t all here recruiting drivers. But it sure seems that way.

In interviews with recruiters on the floor of MATS the growing softness in the trucking market and the signs that rates are headed down show no sign of trickling down to the recruiting wars. One by one recruiters staffing their company’s booths all told FreightWaves the same thing: the market is as tight as ever.

“Everybody is busy and everybody is making money” Corey Huey a recruiter at Bruce Oakley Inc. said.

FreightWaves discussed the recruitment market with a cross-section of companies. Oakley for example is a specialized hauler of dry bulk products such as grains or scrap metal. Huey said that possibly because of the unique nature of what the company transports “we haven’t seen much of a change yet. It is a tough market out there.”

And Oakley’s model is different in that it only brings on owner-operators with their own trucks. But the model can bring on a new owner-operator as well; Huey and his colleagues Harrison Herrell and Kent Childers discussed a driver for Oakley who came on as an owner-operator by buying a used truck and then did well enough to move into a new truck. They noted however that the time between the new truck being ordered and it arriving – fairly recently – was a year.

(Huey also noted that Oakley had two owner-operators in California where the AB5 law on independent contractors has been blocked from implementation in trucking but still looms as something that could eventually have a vast impact on ICs in the state. One of the two drivers was “de-leased” by Oakley trying to get in front of any AB5-related issues; a second moved out of state.)





The estimate on what some of the Oakley drivers are making was significantly higher than an important annual number released at MATS: the ATBS estimate of what the average owner-operator made in 2021.

ATBS is a financial services and accounting firm that services tens of thousands of independent owner-operators. As a result it handles a lot of tax returns. With most of those returns now completed ATBS executives said in a presentation that the average owner-operator last year made $72000.

ATBS CEO Todd Amen had already signaled last year that the average for 2021 was likely to be in excess of $70000. For the first six months of the year Amen said the average was $70310 a gain of $6530 for the 12 months.

But given the unique nature of what it is hauling the Oakley recruiters said many of their drivers are making $250000 to $300000 per year with one husband/wife team making more than $400000.

Michael Martin is the driver recruiting specialist for paint manufacturer Sherwin Willliams (NYSE: SHW) and while Oakley may be looking for owner-operators to lease on to the company Martin is looking to hire company drivers.

Michael Martin driver recruiting specialist at Sherwin Williams at the company’s booth at the Mid-America Trucking Show.

He said he’s got about 950 drivers now. And while Sherwin Williams does use owner-operators to move its product to market Martin said Sherwin Williams is looking for 200 more company drivers.

Martin provided that number when asked if the paint manufacturer was looking to expand its use of owner-operators. “We’re going in the opposite direction” he said citing cost control and what his company sees as better service from company drivers as the reason for the push to bring in more employees.

The average company driver is making around $98000 to $100000 Martin said. That may be less than the specialty drivers at places like Oakley but Martin noted that they have full benefits. Base rates at the company are between 66 to 72 cents per mile Martin said depending on the region.





And how hard is it to get those drivers? “It’s as competitive as ever” Martin said. “COVID did a doozy on us and we’re having to adjust.”

Sherwin Williams’ most recent pay increase was at the end of 2021 “and we are constantly reevaluating.”

Stop by a company’s booth and you’re likely to find a difference in pay approaches every time. As Oakley’s Huey said you need to make apples to apples comparisons. But it can be tough since everybody has a different structure in part because they are not all in the same business.

Reefer carrier WEL Companies runs half owner-operators and half employees. When FreightWaves stopped by its booth the employee recruiter had stepped away so the pitch was all about being an owner-operator.

Its pay package is a percentage: 70% of the load according to Dylan Keester director of contractor services.

He said the average gross to the contractor is $218000 — touted on its banners at the booth — which comes from the payment being 70% of the gross.

Greg Mumme (lEFT) and Dylan Keester at the WEL Companies booth at MATS.

Keester said he’s been in the recruiting business for 12 years and “I’ve never seen it as tight as this. There is no easing at all.”

Each of the companies visited on the floor was asked a version of the same question: with more than 100000 new authorities issued by FMCSA last year has that provided a visible new supply of drivers? There wasn’t a single affirmative answer.

Averitt Express its booth drowned in the red color of the company that is known mostly as an LTL carrier was recruiting for all its operations but with a focus on its regional truckload activities according to Ken Chrisman recruiting leader at the conference.

And sitting on its booth’s front table was a highly detailed sheet spelling out its current pay packages.

Starting pay for dry van no hazmat: 52 cents per mile. Starting out and driving flatbed: 57 cents per mile. A $69 per diem. $20 per hour detention paid after two hours. Annual profit sharing of $2391 to $2621. And those were just a few.

Chrisman touted some of the company’s dedicated customers like Cracker Barrel and the Alabama plant of Mercedes Benz as being a strong attraction to potential drivers. And he said Averitt believes its retention rate is high.

Maybe it is. But as the action on the floor of MATS showed any signs of slowdown in the freight market is not being met by a relaxation of efforts to put more drivers behind the wheel.

72 passed away on Monday March 21 2022 from complications of Lewy Body Dementia. He was the devoted husband of Sandra (Reis) Williams for 49 years and loving father of Courtenay E. Williams (and Kai Lee) of Middletown New York; Grant L. Williams (and Alejandra Hernandez) of Los Angeles California; and Amy K. Williams MD (and Adam Obaza) of Long Beach California.

He was born in New Haven Connecticut on May 1 1949 to the late Guy and Helen (Sullivan) Williams. When Larry was a teenager he found his passion in the sport of football and was awarded an athletic scholarship to the University of Rhode Island where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Physical Education. He was a member of Phi Mu Delta fraternity and his Brothers remember him as a down-to-earth man with a gracious and gentle nature.

During his time at URI he was an assistant coach after an injury cut his playing career short. His work as a coach continued at the Albie Booth Memorial Boys Club in New Haven Connecticut where he founded a boxing program for local youths. He believed athletics and discipline were a gateway to a better life and many young men benefited from his wisdom.

Larry also ran his own construction company with his wife Sandra building custom swimming pools and water features. As a member of the Connecticut Spa & Pool Association he contributed to the construction of the swimming pool at Paul Newman’s The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp in Ashford Connecticut. His specialty was constructing unique swimming environments that worked in harmony with their surrounding natural settings.

But he never lost his love for athletics in particular football and strength training. Following his career in pool construction Larry worked as a volunteer assistant football and strength coach at Coral Gables High School Christopher Columbus High School and Florida International University for 10 years. He also was the proud father of three accomplished athletes.

In his leisure time Larry enjoyed working out and riding motorcycles. He practiced cross-training before it became trendy. His motorcycle collection over the years included a Triumph TR6R a Harley Sportster and a BMW R1200C and he rode as often as he could. We hope that he is now riding along eternal and smooth roads enjoying boundless beauty and freedom.

Special to the Canton Repository

It was early spring 1986 when the city of Canton’s youth summer jobs were being assessed and hiring of many of the city youth was beginning.

As deputy mayor and director of management overseeing the hiring process fell under my responsibility but it was the Youth Services Department run ably by Paul Martin that was actually the center of gravity in summer hiring for the city.

So I was a little puzzled when my secretary the ever charming Miss Eli came into my 8th floor office and told me a lady wanted to talk to me about her son getting a summer job in Canton.

As I invited her in I noticed her demeanor. I had seen it before in other African-American mothers. She had that look … many of you know of what I speak: stern and determined poised and polite and I could tell this lady was on a mission and I knew I had to listen.

Joe Emma Williams told me that her son was looking for a job that summer. She explained to me that her family income precluded him from working the typical summer jobs that were geared toward the low and moderate income population and that her family fell outside those guidelines.

More guest commentary:How to retain Ohio's future leaders

She felt her son should not be punished because his family income was not what some folks felt was typical for minorities. At that time Mayor Sam Purses walked in and we both listened intently as Mrs. Williams told us about her son Fonda who at the time was a student at Duke University. She went on to describe her son and how he was a good student and a good son and he deserved a summer job.

Mayor Purses obviously taken in by Mrs. Williams asked me to make it happen. It happened and that was the beginning of Fonda having an impact on the city of Canton Stark County and the state of Ohio as well.

I was deeply impressed with Fonda that summer as I noticed how he interacted with others in and out of city government. I was pleased and proud of him and I have enjoyed watching him climb the stairway of opportunity in his very successful career.

He has been a welcome addition to the landscape. And since that time he has been the youngest city councilperson a successful executive with private companies and a successful private business person.

When Mayor William Healy first hired him as the city's economic development director we all expected a lot from Fonda. He outran our expectations as he helped to move the city forward gaining more experience and successes along the way.

And when Tom Bernabei was running for the position of mayor he openly promised to keep Fonda and Andrea Perry in his administration. I continued to watch Fonda perform amazing folks as he went forward in his now-famous humble way.

It was good to see an African-American male who others saw as ""one of the good ones."" He said all the right things became knowledgeable about government programs and loans and established relationships with bankers leaders of organizations and others.

More guest commentary:A relationship with a horse can change your life

He has been appointed positions on important boards within our community such as the YMCA Mercy Medical Center Sisters of Charity Foundation Stark State College Canton Regional Chamber of Commerce and many others.

Everyone has come to expect especially with his successful relationship and tenure with Mayor Bernabei that his next stop was as the first Black mayor of Canton. I even attended a dinner last year in which the mayor introduced him as the future first Black mayor of Canton.

I have seen other governments and businesses try to recruit him away from Canton. I’ve attended many out-of-town events about minority business development and when introduced to others there many of them knew about the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton but some had also heard of that Black deputy mayor who was helping to do great things in Canton.

So while it was not unexpected that Fonda was recruited I was surprised that he accepted

an offer to be the senior vice president of government relations and economic development for the Columbus-based Economic and Community Development Institute (ECDI) a position newly created just for him.

ECDI’s mission is to provide training loans advice and more to small businesses. It has dispersed more than $91.6 million in loans with the creation and/or retention of 13097 jobs since 2004.

Fonda anticipates a huge amount of construction occurring in the state within the next several years and one of his goals is to expand minority-owned businesses and individual opportunities to participate in that work.

He points to the anticipated construction by Intel Google Ohio State University Facebook and others all requiring lots of back-office services.

In his new position he will have a great opportunity to have a huge impact. He will use his experiences to grow the amount of minority businesses within the state as he concentrates on Northeast Ohio but will also have some responsibility for the states of Kentucky and West Virginia.

""One of my ideas"" he says ""is to utilize ... the Minority Contractors Resource Center"" to help smaller companies scale up to bigger jobs.

With his new office conveniently located in downtown Canton in the old bank building at Central Plaza he will still be in the thick of things when it comes to business development. And that is a very good thing.

I have watched him drag a project over the finish line when everybody else might have given up. And that goes all the way back to the Onesto project which he was instrumental in getting the asbestos issue and many other hurdles solved so that developer Steve Coon would be able to complete the renovation of the Onesto into one of Canton’s premier places to live. And that project is not the only one.

Mayor Bernabei has given him many projects like that where it would take his herculean efforts to finally bring it home to fruition to the benefit of the developers and Stark County citizens.

Fonda is fully aware of the challenges that he is facing but he is also keenly aware of the opportunity that this new position represents to him personally and again to the citizens of Canton.

And what would his mom say about the successes that he has racked up so far? He says calmly that his mother and father would be proud of the investment they made in him. Not only does that show the positive impact that a strong family can bring to their children’s success but to the success of their community they happen to live in as well.

Right Joe Emma?

Count Caesars Entertainment one of the largest Strip operators among the gaming companies participating Earth Hour. The company said it will turn off all non-essential lighting at its Las Vegas venues during the aforementioned hour on Saturday night.

That includes the iconic Eifel Tower at the Paris — an integrated resort named for the French capital which ironically is often referred to as “the city of lights.”

Caesars says it’s participating in the event to boost awareness of climate change.

The Water Club an upscale restaurant and event venue moored on 30th Street and the East River in Kips Bay is rolling the dice to become the Big Apple’s first casino with live gaming — but some locals aren’t all in.

“There should not be a casino there and I’m not even happy that the Water Club is there” Community Board 6 member Anton Mallner said at a meeting Thursday night. Others called the idea for a 24000 square foot casino with 450 feet of “open deep water pier” for more gaming space a “horrible” idea citing concerns of traffic and rowdy high rollers.

But board member Daniel Devine said casinos are the economic engine needed to compete with major cities like Hong Kong Madrid and Singapore.

“I would love for it to be in our district” he said. “We really have to think about the long term viability of the tax base in New York.”

“There already is a casino in New York and it’s on Rockaway Boulevard (Queens) so I encourage you to go and enjoy” cracked board member Sandra McKee.

New York currently has a moratorium on adding new casinos till the end of 2023 but Gov. Hochul wants to speed up the process and award three downstate licenses this year if it gets approved in the state budget.

In addition to the Water Club 30 groups including major players such as Hard Rock International Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts submitted requests for information to the state Gaming Commission last fall.

Though an avid gambler herself Diane Liotta said doesn’t want to place her bets on a casino near her home on 39th Street for fear of it attracting unseemly characters.

“I was playing the slots at the Borgata one time and someone just came up and snatched my purse right out of my lap” she told The Post.

“Rowdy people have never been allowed into any of my establishments in my career” Water Club owner Micahel “Buzzy” O’Keeffe said in a phone interview. “We set a tone that proper behavior is expected.”

The state has only four commercial casinos — with live table games like blackjack craps and roulette — not operated by Native American tribes and none are in the city.

Promo PARTNER CONTENT

When it comes to entertainment there is no better place in the world than Las Vegas. Here it’s possible to watch concerts attend cabaret shows and even follow sports competitions from golf to football to basketball to baseball to hockey boxing to mixed martial arts and more.

The options for live entertainment are endless and whenever a break is necessary there are some of the best restaurants in the entire country within talking distance. There are often better deals for eating inside the hotel or resort so it’s worth taking advantage of these restaurants.

There are even hotels called sportsbooks that offer on-site sports booking events and opportunities. Many offer excellent rates on their rooms and of course come complete with many excellent amenities to make the stay spectacular. Plus military members veterans and their spouses typically get a discount as well. Visitors should always look to see if the hotel or resort that they are interested in offers special discounts for being a military member AAA member and so on so that those savings can be spent on fun events.

To help choose the right hotel for a sports fan here are seven popular destinations in Vegas. It’s worth checking the full package and making sure to take note of the resort fees (daily fees added to the room fee for the use of the amenities) when considering which one is right.

Westgate Las Vegas Resort

Considered the single best sportsbook in Las Vegas is the Westgate Las Vegas Resort and that is because it is widely acknowledged as one of the best sportsbooks in the world. It is the largest option and features LED screens to give an incredible viewing experience of the events visitors want to watch.

As possibly the biggest and best sportsbook in Las Vegas the resort offers a larger number of options to view each sport and game.

Guests will also be able to enjoy a full spa a pool live entertainment and some incredible restaurants like Benihana and the number-one-rated restaurant on TripAdvisor Edge Steakhouse.

Wynn Las Vegas

Wynn Las Vegas has one of the newer sportsbooks in the city. Here visitors will find state-of-the-art technology sophisticated design and a recently opened nearby restaurant to enjoy the experience. One of the biggest draws is the new 1600-square-foot wraparound LED screen that gives everyone equal access to the action. It gets packed as well which helps to recreate a real sporting event as far as possible.

The hotel itself is just one mile from the Las Vegas convention centre and offers floor-to-ceiling windows in every room. Luxe suites even have massage rooms granite-wet bars and whirlpool tubs to add ongoing luxury throughout a stay.

On top of the spas gyms pools and hot tubs the hotel also offers an 18-hole golf course a live theatre experience and four different trendy nightclubs.

Caesar’s Palace

Caesar’s Palace is one of the most famous and prestigious hotels in Las Vegas and offers an equally luxurious sports experience. Here visitors will find a custom 143-foot LED screen state-of-the-art sound and plush seats to watch the game. With such a great overall experience this sportsbook hall is a great place to watch a game.

One of the biggest draws is for many people the horse racing. There are 65 private booths for horse racing competitions where one has a private space and a 12-inch TV to catch the action as it happens.

The Mirage

The Mirage is a classic when it comes to accommodating sports lovers. Unlike the others in the list guests will find multiple 85-foot HD projector screens available to watch the game or event of their choosing.

They can boost the experience further by getting the VIP experience. The VIP “owner’s boxes” start at just $50. Included in this price are unlimited drinks which makes this the best way to spend a day (especially for those who are there for the NFL Sunday).

If sports fans are in the Mirage for restaurants and want to catch a game it can serve them well. Other highlights include the dolphin tank where it’s possible to swim with dolphins and of course the live events. As one of the most famous hotels on this list there will be more than enough to do there while in town.

The Venetian Resort Las Vegas

The Venetian offers a 10000-square foot sportsbook and is run by CG Technology. There are only 118 seats available however so guests will need to reserve in advance to secure a spot. The good news is that there are also full-service kiosks available throughout the resort. Though small the sportsbook at the Venetian can be intimate and for those who are in the hotel already it can be the perfect way to catch a game throughout the day.

To save on a hotel room visitors will want to stay primarily during the weekdays and not the weekend. This is because Las Vegas is a very popular weekend destination for Americans who either fly or drive-in.

South Point Hotel

With 24/7 coverage the South Point is perfect for the Brit or European coming to Las Vegas who is interested in catching a game or sporting event from back home regardless of the time difference. It is a favourite amongst the locals and a great option for a quieter experience.

The hotel is located five miles away from the Strip. Nearby one can get to the Silverado Park and also the Las Vegas premium outlets making it a great choice for families. The hotel offers free valet parking an airport shuttle and more. The biggest features for sports fans are of course the equestrian centre and the 4600-seat arena.

The Book at the LINQ

This sportsbook hall is different from the rest and is targeted more towards millennials and younger. Rather than sitting in one seat seat visitors can rent a fan cave which includes a 98-inch TV and two 49-inch TVs where they can watch another game play video games with friends and more. Guests will get bottle service and food sent to them directly making it an excellent option when planning a night out with friends or an after-work experience with co-workers.

The LINQ hotel itself comes with great connections at only six minutes from the nearest monorail station and just five minutes from the High Roller ferris wheel. Another unique feature of this venue is the museum and gallery of classic cars – another highlight for sports fans.

""I looked back once in the third and he was stretching and I was like 'This is pretty awesome' "" captain Jared Spurgeon said.

Fleury's transformation from rival to teammate was on display in a 3-2 overtime rally against the Blue Jackets on Saturday a successful Wild debut in which the three-time Stanley Cup champion performed as advertised.

""Very calm and good with the puck and makes the plays and makes the big saves"" Kevin Fiala said. ""Just a great goalie.""

After a clean first period with infrequent work Fleury was busier in the second and that's when Columbus capitalized.

The first goal came amid a scramble in front with the puck ultimately bouncing in off Fleury's skate and the second was a crisp shot by Jakub Voracek. That finish turned a one-goal hole into a one-goal lead for the Blue Jackets a turnaround indicative of a lull in front of Fleury.

""Our second period sort of got away from what we were doing in the first period"" Spurgeon said. ""Just overextending shifts and then you get stuck out there and we're not as aggressive as we usually are which is what makes us good. We had to fix that.""

While the team improved in the third Fleury turned aside all three shots he faced in the period before making a clutch stop on Patrik Laine ahead of Spurgeon delivering his third career overtime goal less than a minute later.

""The save on Laine at the end that's a world-class shooter"" Wild coach Dean Evason said. ""For him to come out like that challenge give no opportunity and then we're able to transition and get going the other way because of it that was a big save for us.""

Overall Fleury racked up 23 saves to secure his 20th victory of the season and become just the fourth netminder in NHL history to post 14 seasons of at least 20 wins; Patrick Roy (17) Martin Brodeur (16) and Ed Belfour (15) are the others.

What also made the evening memorable was Fleury nicknamed ""Flower"" collecting a bouquet off the ice during the postgame celebration.

""It will get better with time"" Fleury said about settling in behind a new team. ""There were one or two [Saturday] that were just so-so but it was pretty good. Guys were talking and that always helps.""

Shifting momentum

Evason credited a shift by Fiala Frederick Gaudreau and Matt Boldy in the third for flipping momentum in the Wild's favor.

The team dominated the Blue Jackets most of that period outshooting them 13-3 and that pressure eventually culminated in Kirill Kaprizov's tying goal with 1 minute 3 seconds left in the frame.

""When we sustained it in there the crowd got going and I think that really energized us because it was pretty quiet"" Evason said. ""Rightfully so because of the way we were playing. But that shift they started getting jacked up. There was a buzz and then it just rolled our lines over.

""That line and the crowd combined was real good.""

Etc.

The Wild continued to shuffle its blue line on Sunday against the Avalanche scratching Alex Goligoski while Jon Merrill rejoined the lineup alongside Dmitry Kulikov .

PAUL Minn. — Growth for NHL teams is not something that can easily be tracked within a game.

It usually takes consistent improvement over a wide expanse of time for the league's most inexperienced teams. There are always exceptions however and the Blue Jackets' game Saturday night at Xcel Energy Center was one of them.

There were noticeable moments of growth for the Jackets throughout it despite ultimately falling 3-2 in overtime to the Minnesota Wild to end a hard-hitting intense tilt that included star defenseman Zach Werenski leaving early with an upper-body injury.

“We played our tails off” said Blue Jackets coach Brad Larsen whose team stood up to the bigger rougher Wild a day after losing in overtime to the Winnipeg Jets on the front end of a challenging road back-to-back. “I mean we’re coming in the building we played (Friday) night get in at 2 a.m. It’s a pretty loaded (Wild) team trying to make a (playoff) run ... I’m so proud of our team how we played tonight. Lights out tonight. Lights out.”

The final statistics say otherwise but the lessons learned in this game by the Jackets weren't measured statistically. They were earned physically through constant challenges against a ""heavy"" opponent with its mind squarely focused on qualifying for the playoffs.

Minnesota started newly-acquired goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury for the first time making sure his 23 saves led to victory but Columbus made sure it wasn’t easy.

The Blue Jackets overcame an early 1-0 deficit after the first of Kirill Kaprizov’s two goals taking a 2-1 lead on goals in the second from Jake Bean and Jakub Voracek. At the other end goalie Elvis Merzlikins (35 saves) made numerous key stops to keep Minnesota at bay until late in the third.

That's when Kaprizov scored for the second time knotting it 2-2 with 1:03 left and Fleury on the bench for a 6-on-5 advantage. Overtime came next and Jared Spurgeon endedit at 1:24 with a backhand goal over Merzlikins' outstretched right leg.

“I’m frustrated for our guys” Larsen said. “I’m going to be quite honest. They played so hard tonight. They really did. And I wanted that win for them for that group to feel good about themselves. And they should because what they laid on the line tonight was impressive.”

As for Werenski the Jackets’ top defenseman needed assistance leaving the ice with 2:12 left in the first after a high hit by Wild defenseman Jacob Middleton. Larsen and assistant Steve McCarthy were forced to mix and match the remaining five defensemen.

Hit by Minnesota Wild’s Jacob Middleton injures Zach Werenski infuriates Blue Jackets

The only good news regarding Werenski's situation is his teammates saw him moving around better in the locker room than he did leaving the ice.

Working backward from that point the situation was much scarier in the moments after Middleton’s hit — which he finished with a high point of contact after Werenski let a wrist shot go. Available replay angles on the ESPN+ broadcast weren't definitive as to what happened as the one shot at ice level cut away before showing whether Middleton’s shoulder or helmet struck Werenski in the mouth.

Werenski fell immediately to the ice covered his mouth and stayed prone face down while Mike Vogt the Jackets' head athletic trainer attended to him. He was helped to his feet but needed stabilizing assistance from teammates Gustav Nyquist and Oliver Bjorkstrand to get off the ice.

Werenski was hunched the entire glide to the bench and a close-up of his face showed his eyes partially closed. He was then helped down the hall leading from the bench to the locker room and officially declared out of the game in the second period.

The ESPN broadcast crew of Bob Wischusen (play-by-play) Brian Boucher (analyst) and NHL rules analyst Dave Jackson came to the agreement that it wasn’t an illegal hit and was just an unfortunate injury resulting from Middleton’s hard style of play.

The Blue Jackets strongly disagreed.

“It takes arguably our best player out of the game” center Sean Kuraly said. “It’s not something you want. We thought it was high. They didn’t call it. ‘Not a penalty.’ You move on you keep playing.”

Larsen declined to give a opinion when asked directly but his sarcastic tone when asked whether he even saw the play live spoke volumes.

“I was there yeah” he said. “Front row. Yep.”

Meanwhile the Jackets had to stomach the sight of their teammate leaving in distress. The Wild were also trying to bully them knowing Columbus lacked an enforcer so the visitors stood their ground as their blood boiled.

“It definitely gave us a little bit of a boost” said Oliver Bjorkstrand who was penalized in the second for boarding Minnesota’s Marcus Foligno. “We wanted to try and get the win there. It’s not fun seeing (Werenski) go down like that so we hope he’s going to be OK.”

This was the final meeting this season between Minnesota and Columbus so any hard feelings will have to wait until next season. Werenski's condition on the other hand is a bigger concern now with only 16 games left on the Jackets' schedule.

Blue Jackets did not seek revenge for Marcus Foligno hit on Jakub Voracek

Had this game been played 15 years ago there probably would’ve been some carryover from the first meeting in Columbus.

In the waning stages of regulation in that one which the Jackets won 3-2 in a shootout Mar. 11 at Nationwide Arena Foligno drilled Voracek with an open-ice hit late in the third that caused an injury. No penalty was called Voracek hyperextended his left knee and Foligno was fined $5000 by the NHL’s department of player safety the following day for kneeing — the maximum amount allowed under the league’s collective bargaining agreement with the NHL Players’ Association.

That’s not a large number for an NHL player to pay so it seemed like Foligno — the younger brother of former Blue Jackets captain Nick Foligno — got away with a dangerous hit. Voracek only missed one game and told reporters he didn’t feel Foligno intended for the hit to be dirty or cause injury but he also criticized the lack of a penalty and suspension.

Two weeks later Larsen didn’t anticipate any spillover in Saturday's rematch.

“I think it’s overblown” he said at the morning skate. “I mean Jake’s already addressed it. It’s not a dirty play. I don’t think (Foligno) meant to do it. It happened. And yeah you go back maybe 15 years ago it might’ve been a brawl at that point I don’t know. But it’s one of those plays. We slow these plays down (now). You have 38 cameras and ‘ultra slo-mo' and you go ‘Wow he meant to.’”

Watching it live Larsen offered a different perspective.

“He’s trying to make a play” he said of Foligno. “It’s a 6-on-5 situation he’s trying to get physical and sometimes when you’re trying to get physical you stick a leg out whatever it is. There’s no intent I believe to be dirty. Where Jake was frustrated is we didn’t get a call. And I agree. You could’ve called it tripping you could’ve called it kneeing you could’ve called a lot of things.”

As it turned out Werenski scored a 6-on-5 goal to send that game to overtime and the Jackets won in the shootout that followed. That apparently was where the Jackets' payback ended. Bjorkstrand was asked whether his boarding penalty on Foligno might've been related to the situation with Voracek and flatly denied it while attempting to downplay its severity.

Boqvist doesn't play after scoring goal for Blue Jackets in Winnipeg

Larsen made only one lineup change from what he used Friday in Winnipeg.

It was a bit of a surprise too.

Gabriel Carlsson replaced Adam Boqvist on the third defense pairing taking one of his best offensive weapons out of the lineup a day after Boqvist scored his 11th goal of the season Friday against the Jets. That game was his first after an 11-game absence with an upper-body injury and Larsen cited ""ice time"" management as the reason Boqvist didn't face the Wild.

Boqvist who took a high hit in the Winnipeg game leads all Blue Jackets defensemen in goals despite missing 24 games. Look for him to possibly rejoin the lineup Tuesday against the New York Islanders especially if Werenski can't play.

Merzlikins learning to handle increased workload as Blue Jackets' starter

Merzlikins nearly pulled off a victory in one of his best performances this season.

Even with the loss the talented goalie’s night was impressive while soaking up his second game in as many days. One week earlier Merzlikins left a game against the St. Louis Blues with back spasms that rendered him unable to remove his own socks for two days.

“I think it’s real important for him” Larsen said of his top net-minder who has already surpassed his career-high for appearances. “He’s going to play a lot of games and I want him in these games because hopefully next year we’re in this situation (again) ... but much closer to a playoff spot or in it. You want your starter to be going every night and managing that and understanding what that’s going to feel like. So he’s going to play.”

Until allowing the goals to Kaprizov late in regulation and Spurgeon in OT Merzlikins was the game's top standout. He kept the Blue Jackets close after they allowed the first goal and kept the Wild at bay once Columbus gained the lead.

It just didn’t hold up for the entire game.

Blue Jackets overcome statistical disadvantages against Minnesota Wild

Merzlikins’ excellence was the biggest reason the Jackets kept the score close and nearly won. Without numerous key saves from him the Wild might’ve won in a blowout.

According to Natural Stat Trick Minnesota had a 38-25 edge in total shots and 28-20 advantage at 5-on-5. The Wild also built a 22-10 margin in scoring chances and 14-5 edge in high-danger chances – including 9-0 in high-danger opportunities during a third period when Minnesota outshot Columbus 13-3.

Those are numbers that also reflect Werenski’s absence and the workload absorbed after his injury by the Jackets’ five remaining defensemen: Bean Andrew Peeke Vladislav Gavrikov Dean Kukan and Gabriel Carlsson.

“I have no problem with how we played” Larsen said. “Under the circumstances coming in (and) the player we lost with the minutes he gobbles up that was a really good effort from a group of guys that played really hard tonight. Very competitive. They were drinking pickle juice and (cramping) up from playing so many minutes. … it was a gut-check time to go out there.”

Marc-Andre Fleury notches win over Blue Jackets in Minnesota Wild debut

The Wild are officially operating on “flower power” now.

Fleury played his first game for Minnesota after he was acquired in a trade with the Chicago Blackhawks last Monday. He made 23 saves including back-to-back beauties at the end of the second to keep the Jackets from extending a slim 2-1 lead.

Fleury’s numbers with the Blackhawks were pedestrian going 19-21-5 with a 2.95 goals-against average and .908 save percentage but he's got a hall-of-fame worthy career resume and should thrive on a team with better defense played in front of him.

The Bulldogs’ captain for the past two seasons signed a two-year contract with the Flyers on Sunday that begins with the 2021-22 season. Cates and the Bulldogs’ 2021-22 season ended on Saturday afternoon in Loveland Colorado with a 2-1 loss to Denver in an NCAA regional final.

Cates said ideally he would have liked to take a couple days to hang out longer in Duluth spend more time with teammates and get his academics in order before signing with the Flyers however the process was expedited so he could make his debut at the rink where he won two NCHC Frozen Faceoff titles with the Bulldogs and played at with Stillwater High School in the 2016 boys state hockey tournament.

“It’s pretty crazy” Cates said Sunday about making his debut at Xcel. “There are going to be a lot of people there for me so it’s going to be really special. I’ll have a ton of support. I couldn’t dream it up any better. I’m really looking forward to it and excited.”

A fifth-round draft pick of the Flyers in 2017 many believed Cates would sign with the Flyers a year ago after his junior season at UMD especially after his older brother Jackson signed with Philadelphia as an undrafted free agent. Instead Noah decided to return to UMD to serve a second consecutive season as captain.

Jackson — who Noah said is flying in to watch Tuesday’s game but not play — is in his second season with the Flyers organization having signed after his junior season at UMD came to a close last spring. Jackson Cates played four games with the Flyers late last season and 11 this year — picking up his first NHL goal — but is currently in the American Hockey League with the Flyers’ top minor-league affiliate the Lehigh Valley Phantoms.

Returning to the wing Noah Cates posted 11 goals and 13 assists in 35 games as a senior. He also represented the United States at the 2022 Olympics in Beijing scoring a goal for Team USA in the first of their four games while serving as an alternate captain.

Because the NCAA granted anyone who played during the pandemic-shortened 2020-21 season an extra season of eligibility Noah Cates could have returned to UMD in 2022-23 as a fifth-year senior. But Cates said he feels ready for the NHL. He’ll also be graduating with his degree in marketing after completing one more class this summer.

“Just coming back this year and having a more normal year I feel ready and the Olympics helps” Cates said. “I’m leaving UMD with no regrets. The last game was tough but I had a phenomenal awesome four years that were just so incredible on and off the ice. There’s nothing kind of to go back to here. The biggest thing was coming back and not having any regrets at UMD. I’m just happy I played this year out. We had a fun year and a really fun group.”

Cates helped the Bulldogs win an NCHC postseason title as a freshman in 2018-19 as well as the national championship that year in Buffalo New York. He helped get the Bulldogs back to the NCAA Frozen Four a year ago in Pittsburgh where UMD fell to eventual national champion Massachusetts. He added a second NCHC postseason title this season and had UMD within a win of the Frozen Four.

Cates finishes with 99 career points at UMD having totaled 39 goals and 60 assists but as Bulldogs coach Scott Sandelin has said over and over and over this season the scoresheet isn’t where Cates makes the biggest impact. It’s everywhere else. He epitomizes the Bulldogs Sandelin said.

“There’s a reason he’s wearing the C” Sandelin said Thursday in Loveland when asked about Cates. “He just quietly does his job and all the little things that the non-hockey person may not notice but they are so valuable to the team. It’s great to see him play that way.”"

The ones with drive-thrus will focus largely on off-premise consumption. Some of these won't have dining rooms just a lobby for customers and delivery drivers to pick up their orders meaning they'll be much smaller than normal KFC restaurants. The smallest will be 1300 square feet KFC said.

The features will vary between sites but some will have a separate entrance for online orders and delivery drivers.
