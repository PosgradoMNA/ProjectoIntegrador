He’s racked up three wins over the course of his career (so far) and he really should have more considering he also has 10 runner-up finishes on Tour.

Finau has long been known as an uber-talented golfer who hasn’t closed the deal as much as he should’ve but he’s still earned nearly $30 million on the course and has an impressive net worth to boot.

Tony Finau has earned nearly $30 million on the PGA Tour

For a long time Finau was known as one of the best golfers in the world who simply didn’t know how to win. The Utah native won his first PGA Tour event at the 2016 Puerto Rico Open then he went 144 straight starts without another victory. In start 145 Finau finally got back on the board with a thrilling win at the 2021 Northern Trust in a playoff over Cameron Smith.

Eleven months later he secured his third career victory at the 2022 3M Open. He’ll start the fourth round of this weekend’s Rocket Mortgage Classic in a tie for the lead as he guns for his second win in a row.

The floodgates may be opening for Finau and he has a chance to squash his label as the talented golfer who hasn’t reached his full potential.

Thanks to his prolonged success on the PGA Tour Finau has racked up $29.4 million in on-course winnings. That makes him currently the 46th-richest golfer in PGA Tour history from an earnings perspective.

What is Tony Finau’s net worth?

Finau may not have as many PGA Tour victories as he would like but he’s still built up an impressive net worth for a golfer who’s never been ranked inside the top five of the Official World Golf Ranking.

As of March of 2022 Finau’s net worth sits at a whopping $13 million per Golf Net Worth. That number will only grow if Finau continues to stack up wins and maybe mix in a major championship or two.

Colin Skellett 77 earns £1 million a year for running a water company that loses 70 million litres of water a day due to faulty infrastructure.

As it struggles to stop the leaks it is telling customers to watch their usage - even with advice on pools.

Colin Skellett the boss of Wessex Water which has warned of a ban on ‘non-essential’ water use has a 40ft swimming pool at his £3million home

In a ‘water saving’ section of the website it says: ‘Did you know? An average sized paddling pool needs around 200 litres to fill it up – that’s more than an average person normally uses in one day.’

It doesn’t say how much a swimming pool like Mr Skellett’s would take to fill. The advice adds: ‘Cover pools when they’re not in use to reduce evaporation ... and reuse paddling pool water on your garden plants or lawn.

Water companies must publish drought plans to show how they will deal with extended dry weather and extreme heat which the UK is now experiencing. Wessex Water recently updated theirs.

It says it will ban hosepikes and sprinklers in extended periods of dry weather saying they must not be used for lawns cars or swimming or paddling pools.

Married Mr Skellett who is a grandfather bought the house in a village outside Bath in 2007 for £1.65million. It is thought to be worth almost double that now.

Wessex Water owned by Malaysia’s YTL Corporation made profits of £150million to the year to April. Mr Skellett was paid £975000 last year and £1.38million the year before.

Mr Skellett was cleared in 2003 after a six month police probe of taking a £1milloin bribe from YTL during the takeover process."

It was called the Auto-Red-Bug and it had a one-cylinder engine that powered a single rear wheel so it might be called a stylistic predecessor to the Can-Am Spyder or Ryker. Maybe.

Lawrence Pendergast of Ledyard CT brought his 1920 Auto-Red-Bug to the National Meet of the Yankee Chapter of the Antique Motorcycle Club of America this weekend and exhausted himself getting it started.

“It could possibly be the only one in existence that runs” said Pendergast who explained that the Auto-Red-Bug came in gas and electric versions. He got his gas-powered model a year ago from a friend who discovered it when tearing down a building.

The story behind the Auto-Red-Bug is open to debate. Sources aren’t consistent on when it launched – both 1910 and 1916 can be found. It’s more certain that it ended in 1928. The website of the Heritage Museums & Gardens in Sandwich MA says it was sold by high-end retailers such as F.A.O. Schwartz and Abercrombie & Fitch.

1920 Auto-Red-Bug

With slats for a floor side-by-side seats and a steering wheel the Auto-Red-Bug is an oddity. It has a floor lever in front of the operator that engages and disengages the rear wheel. It actually raises and lowers it. There is also a brake pedal. Stopping is accomplished by hitting the pedal which pulls the fenders covering the rear wheels against the tires.

In showing off the Auto-Red-Bug to RIDE-CT & RIDE-New England Pendergast noted that attached aside the engine is a fan that blows air on to the cylinder which is necessary because the driver’s seating position blocks air flow from the front.

The fan that cools the engine on the Auto-Red-Bug

The website Silodrome reports that the Auto-Red-Bug was first produced as the ”Smith Flyer” by A.O. Smith the company that made heaters and boilers. The price was $125. Design rights for the mini-car were later sold to Briggs & Stratton and to the Automotive Electric Service Corp. in Norther Bergen NJ.

Pendergast’s Auto-Red-Bug has a Briggs & Stratton engine and an Automotive Electric Service Corp. plate that says it car number 1741. “This is like the cheapest car in the world ever made” he said. ”It became like a toy for rich kids.”

Lawrence Pendergast gets ready to take off in the 1920 Auto-Red-Bug

The Auto-Red-Bug is quite a collectable. Pendergast reported that an electric model recently sold on eBay for $18500. He has no plans to sell his.

Abbott,"SKOWHEGAN – Alice “Allie” E. Abbott beloved daughter granddaughter sister auntie niece cousin and friend passed away on July 16 2022 at the age of 20.

Allie was beautiful spontaneous and had laugh and smile that could light up the room. She was a fiercely strong woman with a kind gentle soul. In her childhood years Allie loved being part of the Brownies Girl Scouts and bowling team. In her teens Allie loved spending time with her friends and family. She had a special place in her heart for mentoring the autistic youth in the area.

When Allie wasn’t hanging out with her friends and family you could find her at home 4x4ing out back in her truck fishing baking reading listening to music doing arts and crafts and gaming. She had a special passion for watching hummingbirds starry night skies and collecting special rocks. Every year Allie looked forward to helping her brother get ready for the demolition derby. She loved painting the cars and hanging out in the pit with the family. She was especially looking forward to the birth of her first nephew in September.

Allie is survived by her parents Perley and Alice M. (Russell) Abbott; grandfather Joseph Russell; brother Clifford ”CJ” and wife Kristin Warren; uncles Harry ”Joe” and wife June Abbott Alfred Abbott and fiancé Tammy Louis Bernard and Donny Bush aunts Nancy Bloss and Laura Russell. Allie also had many cousins and friends that meant the world to her.

Allie was predeceased by grandparents Perley and Elmira Abbott grandmother Alice K. Russell; uncle Jason “Porky” Abbott aunt Jennifer Russell; and cousins Joseph and Nathaniel Watson.

Those who knew Allie even just a little lost a shining light in their lives. She had so much goodness so much capacity to bring happiness to others and such a bright future. She will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved her.

A Celebration of Allie’s Life will be held 12 to 4 p.m. Sunday August 7 at the Skowhegan Elks Lodge 21 Silver St. Skowhegan. A private graveside service will be held. Please contact the family for date and time.

Greg Abbott's Abortion Ban,"An ad criticizing Texas Governor Greg Abbott has gone viral emphasizing his harsh abortion laws as his re-election campaign presses on.

The ad by Mothers Against Greg Abbott PAC—the “other ‘MAGA’”—depicts a doctor telling a pregnant woman and her partner that their child has “a catastrophic brain abnormality” and will suffer horrifically experiencing seizures and choking on her own fluids; she will only live a few hours if she survives at all. The doctor says he will need a decision on termination but can't advise the couple: “I wish I could tell you what to do but there’s only one person who can make this choice — and that person is Greg.”

While the ad is humorous—the father responds “Who the fuck is Greg?”— it highlights the strictness of the Texas abortion laws and the difficult choices that families have to make.

“It’s really important for us to tell people that when it comes to women's reproductive rights and women's health care there is no one-size-fits-all solution which is what the far-right is proposing” Nancy Thompson the founder of Mothers Against Greg Abbott told the Houston Chronicle. “In order to have change for Texas women and for us not to be second-class citizens we all need to vote for change.”

Last year Texas passed SB 8 a law that would allow private citizens to sue anyone who “aids or abets"" performing abortions. This law goes even further than last month's Supreme Court ruling which overturned the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade ruling.

In response to Texas's severe stance on abortions Democratic pockets in the state are attempting to mitigate the aftermath. Last week Austin council members passed the Guarding the Right to Abortion Care for Everyone (GRACE) Act. The GRACE Act aims to prevent discrimination against individuals' reproductive health choices prohibit using City funds for reporting reproductive health information to government agencies and educate Austin citizens about birth control options.

But experts say that this law isn't protective enough as the Democratic city is still subject to state laws and cannot ultimately decriminalize abortion. San Antonio is also trying to formulate its counter to the state's abortion laws.

Governor Abbott will face Beto O'Rourke in November in Texas's gubernatorial election. Axios reported that although Abbott has more funding overall O'Rourke has raised more campaign money than the incumbent since February reflecting the ever-tightening race. In December only 37% of voters said they supported O'Rourke while this month 43% said they supported him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA3LzMxL2lmLXlvdS1pbnZlc3RlZC0yNTAwMC1pbi1hYmJvdHQtbGFib3JhdG9yaWVzLWluLTIwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If You Invested $25000 in Abbott Laboratories in 2013 This Is How Much You Would Have Today,"The real question may be has Abbott been a better buy than AbbVie since the spinoff?

It has been more than nine years since Abbott Laboratories (ABT -0.26%) spun off AbbVie (ABBV -0.03%). By doing so AbbVie could focus on research and developing breakthrough therapies while Abbott could remain a diversified healthcare company focused on generic pharmaceuticals medical devices diagnostics and nutrition.

The move has worked out well for AbbVie which today has a larger market capitalization than Abbott's. But how has it worked out for Abbott and would its investors have made the right move if they bought $25000 worth of shares in the company back then?

Abbott has continued to grow and remain diverse

In the years since the deal Abbott has more than doubled its annual revenue and COVID-19 testing played a big role:

In 2021 Abbott generated $7.7 billion in revenue from its COVID-19 testing products which accounted for 18% of its $43.1 billion in total sales. The healthcare company has been investing in its different segments and developing new products which has made the overall business stronger. Here's a quick look at how its reporting units have grown since 2013:

Reporting Segment 2021 Revenue 2013 Revenue % Growth Established pharmaceuticals $4718 $2862 65% Nutritionals $8294 $6740 23% Diagnostics $15644 $4545 244% Medical devices $14367 $3012 377%

Diagnostics revenue will likely fall as demand for COVID-19 testing diminishes. However even in 2019 Abbott reported $7.7 billion from its diagnostics business -- more than double what it reported back in 2013.

What's most impressive is the company's growth in medical devices. In 2013 Abbott had a segment called ""vascular"" that encompassed all of its devices. Today the company has a wider variety of devices with sub-segments including diabetes care neuromodulation heart failure vascular and others.

Being able to invest in its core business has certainly made Abbott a more diverse and stable company. However that's not always what investors seek out.

Growth has trumped stability and diversification

On Jan. 2 2013 after the spinoff Abbott's stock was trading at around $32. A $25000 investment would have been enough to buy 781 shares of the business. Today the value of that investment would be worth more than $85000.

Investors would have made out well on the investment but they would have enjoyed even better gains from holding shares of the growth-oriented AbbVie instead; its value has risen by more than 330% since inception while Abbott's stock price has climbed by 239%. Ultimately it turned out to be a win-win for both companies and investors would have made great returns by choosing either stock back then.

Is Abbott still a good buy today?

Abbott recently released its second-quarter results and all indications are that the company is fine and still finding ways to grow. Sales for the period ended June 30 totaled $11.3 billion and organically the business grew at a rate of 14.3% year over year. While diagnostics and COVID-related testing continue to drive its strong numbers totaling $2.3 billion its other segments have also been growing. The only exception is the nutritional segment. That's due to recalls of infant formula products a problem that the company has already addressed.

Although its shares are down 23% this year (worse than the S&P 500 which is down 17%) Abbott remains a good long-term buy. Its strong fundamentals and diverse product offerings make it a safe option for risk-averse investors for the long haul.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt4eHYuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9yZWQtem9uZS8yNS1kYXlzLW9mLWhpZ2gtc2Nob29sLWZvb3RiYWxsLWFiYm90dC1wYW50aGVyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,25 Days of High School Football: Abbott Panthers,"ABBOTT Texas — Each of the past two seasons the Abbott Panthers have seen undefeated regular seasons end in playoff heartbreak. This year they will try to take the next step toward a 1A state title.

Abbott last won a state championship in 2015.

""Our expectation is to win state this year"" Abbott lineman Will Kazda said. ""Anything less wouldn't be a disappointment but it's not what we want.""

The six-man squad lost a pair of key pieces from their 2021 roster which fell shy in the state semifinals against May. However they return the important senior duo of QB Karsyn Johnson and RB Isaiah Singleton along with a strong sophomore and junior class.

""We had really good senior leadership last year and I think all of the seniors this year want to get back to where we were last year. I think we'll have good leadership"" Johnson said.

Head Coach Terry Crawford said the team will rely on its defense especially in the early part of the 2022 season as the offensive players adjust to some new roles. Kazda mentioned the Panthers still need to improve on their offensive timing before they kick off in their season opener.

Abbott enters 2022 ranked No. 2 in the preseason Top 25.

""Our kids are pretty grounded"" Crawford said. ""We tell them that's just the projection. It's just what they think you have the potential to do. Potential never won a football game. So we've got to work hard. We won't focus on it. We won't talk about it. We like it. You'll see it posted on our social media. But our kids are focused on where we're gonna be at the end of the season.""

Katharine 48 London

Occupation Headteacher of Michaela community school in Wembley north-west London and chair of the Social Mobility Commission

Voting record Katharine voted Labour until 2010 when she spoke at the Conservative party conference and switched allegiance. She now describes herself as a small-c conservative

Amuse bouche When she was 10 Katharine’s father took away their television “because he was a good Caribbean father and he wanted to make sure we didn’t watch too much”. She found a tiny secondhand black-and-white TV and bought it with her paper-round money

For starters

Diane I loved history at school. I remember saying to my teacher “I want to do the Oxford and Cambridge entrance” and she said “I don’t think you’re up to it.” Looking back I can see that she thought a black girl whose parents left school at 14 doesn’t go to Oxford or Cambridge.

Katharine That teacher was a terrible teacher. My whole life has been about ensuring that children can aspire to be whatever they want to be. There are children who have all sorts of talents and achieve all sorts of things – we should celebrate them not just the ones who become rich bankers in the city.

Diane I don’t celebrate rich bankers in the City!

Katharine It’s the Hollywood rags-to-riches story someone from the slums who ends up as a CEO but there are all sorts of people who make shorter leaps.

Diane I have a problem with anyone who would cap children’s aspirations because that was done to me. It’s only because I was – even then – quite stubborn that I was able to overcome it.

Katharine You’re preaching to the converted. I’ve worked in education for 25 years; 82% of my children go to Russell Group universities.

The big beef

Katharine There are issues in terms of expecting too little from children who come from a variety of different backgrounds that could be considered disadvantaged. For instance the way it can often go is if a black child doesn’t bring in his homework there’s a sense of well he might come from a difficult background it’s hard for him perhaps he has a single mum we can’t really expect as much of him as we can from another child so it’s OK we’ll let it go. If this happens over time in the end the black child falls behind because the expectations of him are less than they would be of say the white middle-class child.

Diane Your argument is that the real problem black children have is teachers who are too kind to them?

Katharine It masquerades as compassion but actually it’s a way of letting children down.

Diane I’ve worked in an inner-city area for 35 years. I’m very interested in education. I visit schools I talk to parents about their children and I don’t recognise this idea that black children are being let off lightly. You know as well as I do that the level of exclusions for black boys is much higher than for white boys. This doesn’t suggest to me that it is about letting them off; it suggests a system that is quick to make judgments.

Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.

Katharine The number one thing holding children back in schools is poor behaviour and that is because of poor leadership decisions in the school. If you have an environment that demands high standards the children will rise to the standards. If you’re relaxed about behaviour the more vulnerable children – because of race class they live on the local estate they are SEN it could be anything – end up falling off the wagon. People call me the strictest headteacher in Britain but all that means is we’ve got order and structure in the school which means children can thrive in an environment that is safe and secure.

Diane I would say that the one thing that holds black children back is teachers’ preconceptions. I go back to the teacher who told me I was not up to the Cambridge entrance exam. Even teachers who think they are nice have preconceptions especially about black boys and if you have preconceptions about children they can live down to them. That’s why I come back to changing the atmosphere in the classroom and having a more diverse mixture of teachers. I’m not against discipline – I come from a working-class West Indian background. The thing about discipline is that it has to be done with love and you’re not just arbitrarily saying: you can’t speak in the corridor.

Katharine I agree they need to know that they are immersed in love; they need to feel that you are on their side and the system is fair. So our children will do things like thank the teachers for giving them detention because they know they are trying to help them stay on the straight and narrow.

Diane That’s a bit extreme!

Sharing plate

Katharine Both our mothers are Jamaican nurses who came to this country at a similar time which is a lovely thing.

Diane This is a bit irrational but because of my family I’m prepared to give people of Jamaican origin the benefit of the doubt because it is a very specific experience. And you’re very interested in children; I’m interested in children and education.

For afters

Katharine I think schools today are nothing like the schools you and I attended with regard to race in particular. I remember being called racist names being excluded from friendship groups. People would come up to me and rub my skin and say “Does it come off?” Everyone talked about the local shop using the P-word. Now if a child was racist in any way the other children simply would not accept it; it’s blasphemous.

Diane I think teachers have mastered the language of anti-racism but in terms of the preconceptions about children I’m not sure much has changed. And sadly because I’ve spent my life campaigning on these issues I wouldn’t say policing has got much better.

Takeaways

Diane It’s important to meet and listen to people – that’s what politics is about.

Katharine I do feel I have to defend myself against various assumptions you think I think which I don’t actually think. When I was younger we all looked at you and were excited: you were talking in parliament saying something on the news you were most definitely a role model. It was great to meet you.

Diane It was good to meet you.

Diane and Katharine ate at TH@51 London.

It has been more than nine years since Abbott Laboratories (ABT -0.26%) spun off AbbVie (ABBV -0.03%). By doing so AbbVie could focus on research and developing breakthrough therapies while Abbott could remain a diversified healthcare company focused on generic pharmaceuticals medical devices diagnostics and nutrition.

The move has worked out well for AbbVie which today has a larger market capitalization than Abbott's. But how has it worked out for Abbott and would its investors have made the right move if they bought $25000 worth of shares in the company back then?

I’ve been weighing up which one to focus on in order to become a better editor and video professional. I’ve considered the ease of use when editing and exporting the support and community of each and the market demand.

Cost is also a factor so it’s worth knowing what you’ll pay for in the long run let’s say for the next 10 years. I also consider what each one of these brands stand for from my personal perspective. These are my findings.

Ease of Use

Speed

Each one of these has a timeline which you edit with. Media is imported and it’s not hard to get started scrubbing through and moving clips into the position you want. But what differs is the speed at which it does this and if your computer can handle what you’ve given it to process. Premiere Pro requires the most work before you can actually move around the timeline with ease. Proxies need to be generated but once that’s done it’s easy to flip between the raw footage and proxy footage in the timeline.

Final Cut does this almost automatically. It’s done in the background if you didn’t uncheck the box during import.

DaVinci Resolve also has this feature and it is on par with Final Cut here. It’s quite impressive to think Final Cut is an Apple-produced piece of software and DaVinci does this by itself.

UI

I would say that Final Cut doesn’t intimidate you as much as Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve does when opening it up for the first time. It’s more user friendly in that way. But if you don’t make the needed changes before you start editing your hard drive will fill up quickly. The application wants to import all the footage into the library by default which essentially creates a duplicate of the footage. You can change it but the other two import media and keep it in its location by default. It’s most likely the way Apple likes to have control of how you work with the application and footage whereas Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve is much more open to your interpretation.

Final Cut’s magnetic timeline is quite troublesome for some but also the main reason many use the application. DaVinci Resolve does have a magnetic timeline when cutting clips in the Cut panel and then goes into a free timeline in the Edit panel. It’s almost the best of both worlds. In my opinion the way DaVinci Resolve uses it is justified. It’s not needed all the time but is useful when going through rushes or putting the rough cut together.

Panels

Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve have panels for each part of the video production workflow. Final Cut doesn’t. In my opinion DaVinci Resolve’s panels are the best for getting started and finishing a project. Premiere Pro still makes it possible to do color changes while in the editing page which essentially could deem it useless to switch between. DaVinci Resolve has dedicated panels for media cutting editing color and effects. The only place where the media and effects come together is during the editing panel which makes sense. Final Cut doesn’t offer panels. You have a timeline and that’s the focus. What you do with it is add video audio text and effects. It’s simple and more straightforward. But it’s also limiting in that regard.

Color

Although you have great third-party plugins for Final Cut and Premiere Pro DaVinci Resolve is the professional staple when color is concerned. It’s what the industry uses to grade big films.

If you’re shooting ProRes or raw footage it’s only as good as the color you can get out of it. In this way it’s quite ironic that Apple the founder of ProRes has a piece of professional software that’s quite limiting in that regard. DaVinci Resolve just has so much more to offer. Basic grades but also masking certain parts of the frame you want to grade differently tracking them and creating a look is far better in DaVinci Resolve than in Premiere Pro or Final Cut.

Effects

If you consider the abilities of Premiere Pro when you can add in the power of After Effects with dynamic links it outweighs the others. This is of course only if you’re versed in the application. If you’re planning on adding custom graphics to your videos Premiere Pro and After Effects is the route you should follow. However Apple Motion and DaVinci Resolve’s Fusion panel can offer great graphic generation options but the community support meaning the amount of education available on YouTube is limited whereas the amount of tutorials you can find for Premiere Pro and After Effects is in a state of abundance.

I must however say that the training page on Black Magic Design's website has a complete set of tutorials based on each of the workflows from editing to color-grading. If you've ever watched some tutorials on YouTube you might've heard the name or watched Sam Kolder's videos. And even he's migrated completely from Premiere Pro and now is launching a course on DaVinci Resolve.

Delivery

Resolve and Premiere Pro have the option of exporting individual clips. This is useful in you need effects added to certain clips on your timeline.

Market Demand

I am a DOP and director who’s shot ads for Gillette and Avene and social videos for Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue. I can say that the industry standard is to use Premiere Pro. It’s Premiere Pro projects that are passed around as industry standard. Is it going to change soon? I don’t think so although I do think DaVinci Resolve is becoming more of an option with their cloud integration. Final Cut is actually considered a no-fly zone because it’s hard to use the XML data in DaVinci for color grading.

Unless Final Cut changes to cater for video production being a collaborative experience its use will become more for personal projects rather than for commercial work. A lot of movies have been edited using Final Cut but in the commercial industry it’s not that used.

I believe another aspect of Premiere Pro is the speed of getting started and being able to move the whole project by dragging into a separate folder on a hard drive. If I wanted to move a project created with Final Cut or DaVinci Resolve I have to go into the application and export it from the database. For short-form videos it’s also easier to add effects and do things with video that you wouldn’t necessarily see in commercials or movies. Making video collages or adding effects are just easier to do in Premiere Pro and After Effects so that’s what’s used.

If budget is concerned basic skin retouching can also be done in After Effects rather than Autodesk Flame. In this way Premiere Pro is easier to use for everyone in the production pipeline. I must say that I am not yet versed in retouching in DaVinci Resolve although I have heard good things.

What I would like to see is video editors starting to use DaVinci Resolve. This will be better for the colorist because they’ll have the project in DaVinci Resolve already. I believe it’ll take time before effects are done in DaVinci Resolve as industry standard but it can do incredible things already if you are open to learn.

What Each Company Stands For

Adobe has its Creative Cloud. All the applications you need to do great work are included in a monthly subscription. Its tagline is “Creativity for All.” I think it’s powerful from a branding perspective although buying in to this will set you back financially in the long run. Adobe Creative Cloud will cost you $55 a month. That’ll be $660 per year and over a 10-year period you would pay $6600. I assume you are a photographer or visual artist so you have the whole suite at your disposal for that cost so it might not be too expensive if you think it’s the monthly cost of your whole business.

DaVinci Resolve is a software that was acquired by Black Magic Design. They’ve modified it and made it to be what it is today. You can actually download a free version. It’s not limited to time but this free version doesn’t give you all the features it has. In this way they are much more oriented towards “Creativity for All.” They also make cameras and video production hardware. The Black Magic Design Pocket 6K Pro is the cheapest camera that records in-body raw footage and ProRes 422. And if you support this way of a company trying to make it possible to capture video and edit it professionally at the lowest possible cost Black Magic Design is the one to choose. You can download a very capable free version get the Studio version for free when you buy a camera or piece of gear they make or buy it outright for $295.

Apple is the wealthiest company in the world. It’s incredible to think that the company is based on and made for the creative industry. Creative technology therefore outweighs companies in the oil logistics and all other sectors in the global market. The Mac Studio is an example of this. The way they build their new M chips with Video Processors built-in also shows that they are focused on the creative industries at large. It’s therefore incredible to be here in this moment in time where your machine can edit layers of 8K footage if needed. But it is strange to consider they give you all this power to edit with software that isn’t used as the standard tool in the industry they’re built around.

Conclusion

I might be biased because I own a 6K Pro Pocket camera from Black Magic Design. I therefore have Da Vinci Resolve Studio too. But I subscribe to Adobe Creative Cloud because I also do a lot of photo retouching and when my team shoots commercials we do the dailies and editing in Premiere Pro. I bought Final Cut because I wanted to change to an easier method of getting videos out but found myself stuck with regards to collaboration.

However when shooting video on the day the DIT would import footage using Resolve because it has great backup functionality and the director can rest assured that when a card is formatted the footage has been captured transferred checked and backed up which I don’t believe Premiere Pro or Final Cut can do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyZWF0aXZlYmxvcS5jb20vZGVhbHMvYWRvYmUtc3R1ZGVudC1kaXNjb3VudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe student discount: save over 60% on Photoshop Premiere Pro and more,"An Adobe student discount could offer you a very welcome saving if you're setting out to study in a creative discipline.

Adobe student discount: save over 60%

How do I qualify for an Adobe student discount? As you might expect you need to be a student to qualify for an Adobe student discount. The terms and conditions state that you need to be at least 13 years old and need to be enrolled at either an accredited public or private university or college that grants degrees requiring at least the equivalent of two years of full-time study; at an accredited full-time primary or secondary school or at home school as defined by state homeschooling regulations. Fortunately it is easy to prove that you qualify. Adobe says that ""if you provide a school-issued email address during purchase you are instantly verified"" and these include .edu or .k12 in the US .ac.uk in the UK or ""other email domains sponsored by educational institutions"". If you don't have a school or uni email address you'll probably be asked to prove your eligibility after you've signed up to Creative Cloud by supplying documentation. This could take the form of an ID card report card or a tuition bill.

Why should I sign up for an Adobe student discount? Adobe Creative Cloud is a collection of more than 20 desktop and mobile apps many of which have long been industry-standard software in the creative field. You get professional tools for design photography video and UI creation all of which are regularly updated to keep up with technological advances. The package allows you to download the desktop software and the mobile apps on as many devices as you like and the integration of the whole suite makes it easy to work across several of the programs even on different devices. Basically if you want to create anything visual for print or digital Creative Cloud is likely to have the tools you need.

What do I get with an Adobe student discount? The Adobe student discount applies to its Creative Cloud suite of apps which means you'll get access to everything that you'd get in the full professional CC package if you paid full price. We'll pop the full list of twenty apps below. The best known and most widely used are Lightroom for photo editing Photoshop for more advanced image manipulation illustrator for vector graphics InDesign for designing layouts Premiere Pro and After Effects for video and Adobe XD for UI design. Other benefits include 100GB of cloud storage and access to Adobe Spark Adobe Fonts and Adobe Portfolio.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkY2V4ZWMuY29tL3dhcmVob3VzaW5nL2FydGljbGUvMjIzNTM3OTEvYXVndXJ5LWluYy1pZGVudGlmeWluZy1jcml0aWNhbC1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLWFzc2V0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Identifying Critical Manufacturing Assets,"Companies around the world are increasing spending on supply chain innovation to effectively navigate pandemic-era disruptions from shortages to the Great Resignation. For the manufacturing industry clogged supply chains restrict the flow of essential spare parts and equipment into manufacturing facilities. With longer lead times and limited resources coupled with record consumer demand manufacturers must navigate the pressure to push more products out while getting fewer resources in by optimizing their maintenance and reliability programs to maintain the highest level of productivity possible.

But many companies today still tend to respond to supply chain disruption by panic-buying stockpiling inventory they may or may not need to keep production lines running in the future. While it might supply some peace of mind to anxious manufacturing professionals this approach also results in inventories filled with unnecessary stock increased overhead costs and even higher tax prices due to retaining tangible assets.

Instead manufacturers must assess and identify the relative criticality of their assets and take every possible step to protect and maintain the most essential equipment. With a thorough understanding of asset criticality they can minimize wasted capital in two key ways: by not overbuying spare parts and by having the right parts on hand to prevent critical failures and long downtimes.

Asset criticality assessments for optimizing inventory

The goal of the asset criticality assessment is to uncover data to inform strategic decisions for manufacturing maintenance and inventory. With a criticality score tied to each machine manufacturers gain a better idea of which machines they should invest in monitoring continuously.

By monitoring the machine health of critical assets in real time manufacturers will know in advance when machines are likely to fail and what parts they’ll need on hand to prevent downtime. Equally important they’ll identify non-critical assets for which they don’t need spare parts inventory enabling lower overhead costs.

When determining the criticality of machines manufacturers must look for the assets that would shut down the production line in the event of failure. These are the critical pieces of equipment and where organizations will want to spend strategy and money. Equipment that isn’t vital for running the line or that manufacturers could find easy workarounds to continue operations is non-critical.

Adapting manufacturing maintenance and reliability practices

After distinguishing critical from non-critical equipment manufacturers must adjust maintenance and reliability practices to ensure sustained productivity. Start with three key steps:

1. Monitor the right equipment continuously.

When machine health sensors collect and report continuously on the machines to which they are assigned maintenance technicians know which machines need attention and when long before machine failure. But performing maintenance on non-critical assets will be an inefficient use of labor that would be more valuable spent on critical equipment.

In addition constant data collection can be a pricy investment with low ROI if sensors aren’t strategically placed. Once you’ve determined your most critical assets adjust your monitoring approach accordingly to allocate expensive sensors only to production-vital equipment.

2. Stop stockpiling unnecessary inventory.

Many organizations are currently overbuying parts to circumvent machine downtime due to parts shortages but this is an expensive and inefficient strategy. For one it exacerbates the shortages as companies buy out resource stock potentially inflating prices for future purchases.

Another direct issue is that keeping extra unused parts in storage just adds to a list of taxable assets which can become a significant expense for manufacturing companies. Instead of panic-buying parts use data from continuous monitoring of critical assets to predict when machines will need repairs with plenty of lead time and prioritize your parts inventory based on criticality scores.

3. Avoid extreme preventive maintenance.

Technicians tend to perform maintenance on set schedules. For example if the failure rate of certain parts shows bearings usually fail after six months technicians replace those parts in advance to prevent the failure — every five months in this example.

This might be a more targeted method than monitoring all equipment at all times or stocking up on replacement parts for every asset but it can still be wasteful if organizations put a lot of capital into unnecessary repairs. Instead insights from the continuous monitoring of critical equipment can help companies optimize inventory and labor by determining not only when machines are likely to fail but also what maintenance teams must do to prevent it.

With proper asset criticality assessment and strategic continuous monitoring manufacturers can predict necessary repairs enabling longer lead times for securing parts and making data-driven decisions for inventory and labor allocation. It’s the smart way to keep operations resilient keep production lines running and limit costs well into the future no matter what unforeseen disruptions may come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyZWF0aXZlYmxvcS5jb20vYnV5aW5nLWd1aWRlcy9iZXN0LXVpLXByb3RvdHlwaW5nLXRvb2xz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best UI prototyping tools,"The best UI prototyping tools are an essential part of any UI designers' toolkit.

01. Marvel The best UI prototyping tool for ease of use Our expert review: Specifications Platform: browser Free plan: Yes Free trial for paid plan: 7 days Pricing for paid plan: from $12 per month Today's Best Deals Check Amazon Visit Site Reasons to buy + Simple to use + User testing features + Interesting integrations Reasons to avoid - No desktop app - Not for high-fidelity prototypes

One of the easiest and most intuitive prototyping tools around Marvel is a great good option for making simple screen-linking prototypes if you don’t need to test more complex microinteractions. It works directly from pre-designed PSD or Sketch documents so visual drafts can be used without conversion formatting.

We think it's perhaps the easiest app for non-designers to follow making it super quick to get started. It's also very straightforward for stakeholders to use to give feedback. You're limited to an online app but the interface is wonderfully simple and it even adds in testing tools which you don't tend to find in UI prototyping tools. This allows you to validate your prototypes in Marvel itself.

02. Figma The best UI prototyping tool for collaboration Our expert review: Specifications Platform: Windows MacOS browser Free plan: Yes Free trial for paid plan: No Pricing for paid plan: From $12 per editor per month Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Great collaborative tools + Lots of features and plugins + Very versatile Reasons to avoid - Limited free plan

Figma is billed as the collaborative UI design tool and it's this aspect is what has made it so popular since it chaned what was possible in terms of real-time collaboration. Dubbed 'multiplayer design' this feature makes it a UI design tool that's comparable to working on a Google Doc. The app can keep smooth performance even with several team members working on a project at the simultaneously.

This makes it great for sharing prototypes with multiple stakeholders and getting immediate feedback and saves time by allowing teams to ditch the piece-by-piece approach and work across an entire project at the same time. Again like Google docs previous versions can easily be retrieved making it easy to keep track of iterations. The web-based tool also has desktop versions for Windows and iOS and prototypes can be easily shared to Windows iOS and Android. There are lots of plugins which can become a hassle but allow you to for example add support for lottie files for animation.

When we reviewed it we found that when it came to prototyping Figma did most of what we wanted it to. It supports a fairly complete range of standard gestures and page transitions which can be used to transition to a new frame switch component variants open/swap/close overlays go back ‘scroll to’ and open links. The ‘smart animate’ feaure is a timesaver for prototyping animations.

Adobe XD has been playing catchup with other UI prototyping tools and it hasn't yet managed to excel in its own right. That said if you’re committed to the Adobe suite of products then you already have access to Adobe XD. When we reviewed it we found that it integrates well with the likes of Adobe Photoshop Adobe Stock and Adobe Fonts and its prototype tab is easy to switch into.

It feels rather different to other Adobe products but offers seemless integration and it works on Windows as well as Mac making it an alternative all-in-one UI design option to Sketch for Windows users. It also allow the creation of prototpyes with voice command triggers and playback which can make it useful for very specific projects. There's also a wide range of plugins.

07. Framer The Best UI prototyping tool for designers who code Our expert review: Specifications Platform: Windows MacOS browser Free plan: Yes Free trial for paid plan: N/A Pricing for paid plan: $15 per site per month Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Granular interactivity + Very versatile Reasons to avoid - More complex than many other tools

Framer is another of the most versatile options among the best UI prototyping tools. The caveat is that to use its full potential it helps to be comfortable writing some code. The majority of prototyping tools are code-free but Framer uses the JavaScript library React. This and the lack of friendly controls mean that the learning curve can be daunting to non-coders.

But if you can code or are prepared to get up to speed Framer allows you to create prototypes that can be almost indistinguishable from the final product. This allows you to demo fully interactive prototypes and collect reliable feedback on natural user behaviour. It offers seamless support for HTML CSS and Javascript. It also supports calling the system keyboard inputting real text then using it as data and real control and monitoring of audio and video. Through its component store you can add analytics and heatmaps to test prototypes.

Inspectors have hailed the impact of the family safeguarding model in helping a council move from ‘good’ to ‘outstanding’ in a report this week.

Ofsted credited the approach for enhancing the quality of practice and supervision helping parents gain insight into the impact of negative behaviours on their children and enabling families to stay together.

Bracknell Forest implemented the model – pioneered in Hertfordshire – in 2017 with government funding and a 2020 evaluation found the numbers of child protection plans and looked-after children had subsequently fallen in the Berkshire authority.

The model involves placing domestic abuse substance use and mental health practitioners in multi-disciplinary teams with children’s social workers to enable them to work with parents in tackling the root causes of their children’s needs and risks including through the use of motivational interviewing. The workers also share regular group supervision sessions.

‘Very beneficial direct work by passionate practitioners’

Ofsted highlighted the impact of both specialist adults’ staff and group supervision in the model’s success in Bracknell Forest.

“Meaningful and very beneficial direct work completed by the passionate specialist workers such as

domestic abuse workers is having a very positive impact on children and their families” said the report. “This approach enables children and adults to gain an insight into their challenges and establish ways which help them to manage anxiety and behaviours in a positive way.”

The report added: “This support has been very impactful in enabling more children to return to the care of their parents and remain in their care.”

Inspectors praised the “effective collaborative” way children’s social workers and adults’ specialists worked together to tackle domestic abuse parental substance use and neglect.

Group supervision ‘providing clarity on what makes a difference’

This was enhanced by group supervision which provided “real clarity and understanding about need risk intervention and what makes a difference to children” as well as reflection and challenge.

The report also praised leaders’ investment in the model saying refresher training to strengthen its implementation had “had a significant impact on practice and the effective interventions provided to improve children’s family experiences”.

The impact of the family safeguarding model helped Bracknell Forest earn an outstanding grade for both its work with children in need of help and protection and for leadership – in both cases an improvement on the good rating it achieved in 2017.

Ofsted also found leaders and managers were “working tirelessly to develop more placement options for children and young people” and had done much to tackle recruitment and retention problems resulting in improved workforce stability.

While this had led to some social workers carrying higher caseloads than the authority would have liked leaders had implemented a plan to address this.

The authority however slipped back from outstanding to good in relation to services for children in care and care leavers.

Creative practice with children in care

Inspectors were generally positive about provision for children in care who they said generally benefited from permanent homes found in timely manner.

Social workers saw children as much as they needed carrying out life story work proactively to help promote their understanding of their identities and working creatively to communicate with them and ensure their voices were heard.

Sexual and criminal exploitation and other risks were well-managed through effective risk assessment while those placed out of area were well-supported by social workers who saw them regularly.

Foster carers praised the support they received with supervising social workers “achieving a good balance between professional vigilance and challenge and providing support”.

Personal assistant caseloads ‘higher than optimal’

The only deficits in practice identified by Ofsted were in relation to care leavers.

Personal assistants were ambitious for young people and supported them well to achieve their aspirations through “tenacious and skilled support” which young people spoke highly of.

However their caseloads were “higher than optimal” sometimes affecting their ability to provide as much support as they would like.

Not enough care leavers were in education employment and training with relatively few progressing to higher education and their influence on service design was “in its infancy” with the council needing to do much more to enable their participation.

‘Immensely proud’

Grainne Siggins executive director people at Bracknell Forest said: “I am immensely proud that Bracknell Forest’s children’s services has been rated as outstanding. This is testament to the hard work dedication and passion in providing the best possible service to improve the lives of children young people and their families in the borough.

“We will continue to focus on improving our services to ensure that we can provide outstanding services to all of our children and young people.”"

The Ryzen 5 7600X even managed to outscore a Raptor Lake i9-13900 ES leading UserBenchmark to label AMD as “Advanced Marketing Devices”.

4 Reviews

It’s long been believed that UserBenchmark has shown an unfair bias toward Intel in its average bench scoring something which we have touched on before. However the much-maligned synthetic benchmark has remained useful to tipsters for spotting new engineering samples being tested as happened recently when APISAK noticed what appears to be a Zen 4 Raphael Ryzen 5 7600X chip being put through its paces. However the apparent praiseworthy results of the Ryzen 7000 processor have seemingly left a bitter taste with UserBenchmark which has now resorted to unveiled insult and unprofessional comments in a bid to fight back against the perceived AMD threat.

Firstly the site has already been accused of skewing results with the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X reportedly the highest-ranked chip on the site before it was slotted into second place in the benchmark’s rankings just behind the Intel Core i9-12900KS. On top of that not only has AMD now been renamed “Advanced Marketing Devices” (and not “Advanced Micro Devices”) but Team Red’s chip has also been unceremoniously labeled as part of the “Zen 4 Hype Train”. All companies hype their latest and greatest new products including Intel but UserBenchmark is convinced that AMD controls “hundreds of ‘news’ outlets”. When Team Blue took a risk with Alder Lake by choosing a hybrid architecture to show it could innovate and be competitive we praised the company for it and frequently lauded impressive chips such as the i9-12900K.

It’s too early to say just how good Zen 4 may (or may not) be but the signs are looking good for PC builders who want to enjoy a choice in products. But Raptor Lake also looks promising with the i9-13900K showing terrific multi-core performance gains over its predecessor. Raptor Lake vs. Raphael Zen 4 is going to be an exciting competition for all involved with the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X taking a little first blood on UserBenchmark against both the i9-12900K and apparently an engineering sample of an i9-13900. The Zen 4 part is awarded a +3% speed gain over its Raptor Lake rival along with a decent +14% lead in single-core benchmarking. The i9-13900 sample is registered as a 24-core (8P + 16E) part here so it understandably leads over the 6-core Ryzen 5 7600X in multi-core tests.

But instead of being excited about the prospect of Team Red having produced the goods or even relishing a cracking Intel vs. AMD showdown that should benefit the consumer UserBenchmark has reduced its credibility levels further by simply attacking the latter finishing an SKU description with: “if Zen 4 actually delivers anywhere near a 57% single core uplift we will bow down call AMD king and commit seppuku”. This is in regard to the Ryzen 5 7600X sample showing an apparent +56% gain over the Ryzen 5 5600X in single-core speed. It’s likely there will be many DIY builders and desktop PC enthusiasts hoping for that to come true.

Global sales of PCs had been in decline for nearly a decade when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Instead of hurting demand further people's need to work and attend school remotely triggered a boom. PC shipments surged by 11% in 2020 and another 15% in 2021. Last year was the strongest year for PC sales since 2012 with unit shipments reaching 341 million.

This was good news for Intel (INTC 0.30%). Even as rival Advanced Micro Devices was winning away some of its market share the growth of that market helped keep Intel's PC chip sales growing. But all good things eventually come to an end. 2022 is going to be a rough year for the PC industry. Some demand was pulled forward by the pandemic and the combination of high inflation and recession fears is taking a toll on consumer spending.

Tumbling demand for PCs

Intel now predicts that its total addressable market related to PCs will decline by around 10% this year. Weakness in the consumer and education markets will be the biggest factor in this decline though demand for commercial PCs may also take a hit later this year if businesses pull back on their tech spending.

Intel's PC chip segment actually did substantially worse than the overall PC market in the second quarter. Revenue from its client computing group plunged 25% year over year and segment operating income crashed by 73%. Sales of notebook chips were down more than 40% not too surprising given how many laptops were sold over the past two years.

Intel is underperforming the PC market because manufacturers are now drawing down on inventory as they brace for a difficult environment. What this means is that Intel is selling PC chips at a rate below the rate at which its customers are using them. ""[O]ur Q2 PC unit volumes suggest we are shipping below consumption as some of our largest customers are reducing inventory levels at a rate not seen in the last decade"" said CEO Pat Gelsinger during the second-quarter earnings call.

This inventory correction will eventually run its course after which Intel's sales will adjust to levels that are back in line with the PC market. Intel expects the second and third quarters to be the bottom of the slump for the company as a whole. Management anticipates that a combination of seasonal strength lower customer inventory levels and price increases will drive its PC-related sales higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half.

A strong roadmap

Intel's latest Alder Lake PC chips are unquestionably good products. The company has sold over 35 million units of them and their innovative architecture which mixes high-performance cores with high-efficiency cores delivers significant gains over Intel's previous products. While AMD's Ryzen chips had overtaken Intel in terms of performance prior to Alder Lake Intel struck back in a big way with those chips.

The next couple of years will be exciting in the world of PC central processing units (CPUs) as Intel and AMD battle for supremacy. Intel's next-gen Raptor Lake CPUs are set to launch this fall delivering double-digit performance gains over Alder Lake. Meteor Lake chips will then come sometime in 2023 built on the new Intel 4 manufacturing process. Meanwhile AMD's Ryzen 7000 series chips are expected to launch in a matter of months.

Investors should expect at least one more rough quarter for Intel's PC segment as its manufacturing customers realign their inventories to reflect lower demand. Once that process is done Intel's PC segment performance should start to look a whole lot better especially as its new product lines arrive on the market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sZWFoLXdpbGxpYW1zb24tZW5nbGFuZC1zdWNjZXNzLWNoYW5nZWQtMTkzNjU5NTg2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leah Williamson: England success has changed society not just women's football,"Leah Williamson knows the Euro 2022 final with Germany is a ‘fairytale fixture’ (Nigel French/PA) (PA Wire)

England captain Leah Williamson has described Sunday’s Euro 2022 final against Germany as a “fairytale fixture” – and one she believes is “not the end of a journey but the start of one”.

The storied football rivalry between the two nations continues with a showdown at a sold-out Wembley.

The Lionesses are looking to secure the first major silverware in their history while Germany the competition’s most successful side are aiming for a ninth Euros title.

Williamson told a press conference: “I think it’s a good narrative for you guys. Obviously it is a fairytale fixture with the history behind it.

“I think the journey that both of us have been on you’ve got the two teams who have had the best tournaments in the final which is the best thing.

“I think this is what we expected to come up against a team playing their best football and luckily we’re playing ours.”

Williamson then spoke in broad terms when asked about the magnitude of what it would mean for England to win on Sunday.

I think for every success that we make and for every change of judgement or perception…I think that makes change in society

Leah Williamson

The Arsenal defender said: “I think what we’ve seen in the tournament already is that this hasn’t just been a change for women’s football but society in general how we’re looked upon and I think tomorrow is not the end of a journey but the start of one.

“Naturally it’s my job to go out for 90 minutes to play and win but I think when we look back on this tournament as a whole we’ve really started something and as I say I think tomorrow is the start of that. I want it to be the start I want this to be a mark for the future.”

She added: “I’ve only ever been involved in this workplace in football but I think in most workplaces across the world women still have a few more battles to face and to try to overcome.

“And I think for every success that we make and for every change of judgement or perception or opening the eyes of somebody who views women as somebody with the potential to be equal to her male counterpart I think that makes change in society.

“I think that’s a powerful message. In a typically male-dominated environment these strides that we take forward can impact everybody on that wider scale.”

An attendance record for any Euros match women’s or men’s could be set tomorrow and Williamson said: “I think this has felt unachievable for a very long time. The people that have come before me have had to fight.

“I think that’s a nice reflection moment tomorrow that there will be so many people filling that stadium with an interest in women’s football that have the opportunity to watch it because its been made available because not so long ago that wasn’t the case.”

Ten years ago a crowd of 70000 were at Wembley to watch Great Britain’s women’s team beat Brazil at the London Olympics.

Williamson who attended that match as a fan said: “I think tomorrow will be another moment like that. It’s incredible that happened and I think the fall-off afterwards we hope that’s not what happens after this tournament.

“We can’t have a lack of interest post this tournament because it defeats the object of everything we’ve achieved throughout these last six weeks.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdHJheS1raWRzLWRyb3Atc3VycHJpc2Utc29uZy0xNTA3NTAwODEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stray Kids Drop Surprise Song 'Mixtape : Time Out' to End Fan Week: Listen,"Stray Kids have been showing thanks to their dedicated fans all week with a new song to cap off the celebrations.

Opening with the sound of beach waves “Time Out” quickly jumps into an energetic punk-rock vibe to pair nicely with the fun message of the track: “Let the stress fly away/ Don’t worry ’bout tomorrow” the Kids sing. “We’ll just have some fun right now.” According to a track description the song reflects an actual vacation the band went on together with the beach sounds recorded by the group.

“Time Out” is the latest “mixtape” track from Stray Kids that the group tends to drop as off-cycle typically surprise tracks. Their last tape “Mixtape: Oh” was released in June 2021 at No. 1 on the World Digital Song Sales chart giving the band their first-ever chart-topper on the tally.

It won’t be long before Stray Kids get a chance to see their U.S. Stays as the group will soon be one of the leading performers at KCON 2022 in Los Angeles next month.

AES,AES Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hdWluZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMi8wNy9jb21wYW55LWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQtb24tbGFyZ2VzdC1zb2xhci1wcm9qZWN0LWluLXN0YXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Company breaks ground on largest solar project in state,"Developers broke ground in Central Maui on Friday for the largest solar project planned in the state a 60-megawatt solar 240-megawatt-hour battery storage system that will have the capacity to power 27000 homes on Maui.

Kuihelani Solar will be built on 450 acres of old sugar cane lands leased from Mahi Pono between Kuihelani and Maui Veterans highways. It’s expected to come online by October 2023.

“We’re just really excited. It’s taken a tremendous amount of collaboration with our partners and our team has worked really hard to get all the approvals in place really to get us to where we are today” Sandra Larsen Hawaii market business leader for project developer AES said ahead of the groundbreaking Friday.

Bernerd Da Santos executive vice president and chief operating officer for AES Corporation said that as Hawaii transitions to 100 percent renewable sources it needs to keep up a reliable system of supplying energy.

“You achieve that by having projects lined up like this in order to establish the reliability through solar plus in this case battery. Energy storage solutions that actually give you the opportunity to cover not only the day hours that is when the solar is present but also the shoulders” Da Santos said referring to the sunrise and sunset hours when people are home and demand is high.

Kuihelani Solar was one of two Maui projects chosen after Hawaiian Electric Cos. put out a request for proposals in 2018 seeking renewable energy projects.

The state Public Utilities Commission approved Kuihelani Solar in 2019 and the Maui Planning Commission unanimously granted a special use permit for the project in November of last year.

Earlier this year however Kuihelani Solar appeared to be at risk of missing its guaranteed commercial operations date of Oct. 27 2023 according to a status report of projects across the state provided to the Public Utilities Commission. AES said it was monitoring supply chain impacts due to the pandemic and raised concerns about a U.S. Customs and Border Protection order potentially impacting the delivery of solar panels.

However Da Santos said the company was able to address supply issues by directing equipment toward projects that were set to come online in 2022 and 2023. It’s also working to close the gap for projects set to be operational in 2024.

“We have observed some delays but the delays that we have observed are not meaningful to change the strategy or to create a disruption in the delivery of our project” Da Santos said. “I’m talking worldwide but more importantly here in Hawaii.”

He said the project has all its permits and approvals and that “I don’t see any reason to not fulfill that commitment” to be operational by October 2023. From there the project has a 25-year power purchase agreement to feed into the Hawaiian Electric grid on Maui at a cost of 8 cents per kilowatt-hour one of the lowest rates in the state for renewable energy according to project documents.

It will have the capacity to power about 15 percent of the island’s energy needs. While early solar projects on Maui focused primarily on supplying solar more recent projects have also included battery storage as Hawaiian Electric and solar developers look to make the energy supply more reliable when the sun’s not out.

“This project is intended to dispatch every day with emergency or without it” Da Santos said. “It’s designed to have that resiliency.”

The project will also allow for agricultural uses as well. Larsen said they’re looking into having herds of sheep that can graze under the panels as well as maybe beekeeping operations.

As Maui sees more renewable energy developments and solar projects continue to expand some residents have raised concerns about their size and impacts to nearby communities. Kuihelani Solar hasn’t run into the same legal challenges as Paeahu Solar a 15-megawatt solar 60-megawatt-hour battery storage project in South Maui that was chosen around the same time as Kuihelani and has drawn complaints by neighbors. However Larsen said that after AES received community feedback raising concerns over Kuihelani Solar’s footprint the developer redesigned the project to keep the energy capacity but reduce the amount of land by 35 percent.

All animal experiments conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Research Center for Animal Life Science at Asahikawa Medical University. The animal experiments conformed to the protocols including ethical treatment reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Asahikawa Medical University (IACUC Approval No. R3-108). The sample sizes for the animal studies were guided by a previous publication that studied the effects of maternal HFD consumption on NASH in offspring72. All mice were housed with free access to chow and water on a 12-h light/dark cycle. For timed mating females that were breeding were checked for vaginal plugs every morning and if present the time point was set to day post-coitum (dpc) 0.5. Then the female C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into two groups fed either a control diet (CD; 4.3% kcal fat 19.2% kcal protein and 67.3% kcal carbohydrate D12450J Research Diets Inc. New Brunswick NJ) or a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat 20% kcal protein and 20% kcal carbohydrate; D12492 Research Diets Inc.) during gestation. During lactation all dams were fed the control diet. Because of the lack of significantly different phenotypes of liver pathology between male and female offspring and the usage of MPHs from male mice most of the data are presented from experiments using male offspring. We used littermates born to some dams from each CD and HFD group that gave birth to 6 or more offspring to exclude the effect of the number of offspring on growth. After weaning the male offspring were fed the control diet generating two groups: CD and HFD. At 15 weeks of age male offspring were assessed for body weight and FBS HbA1c NEFA and ALT levels as well as systolic blood pressure (SBP). We performed two series of studies. First we performed histological and biochemical studies including the detection of hypoxia immunohistochemical staining and western blots for HIF-1α and HODMAD1 levels in mouse tissue sections (CD; n = 16 offspring from 4 dams HFD; n = 15 offspring from 4 dams). Second we measured the liver volume diameter of the umbilical vein and tissue density of fetal livers (CD; n = 4 offspring from one dam HFD; n = 6 offspring from two dams) and the tissue density of the livers of offspring at 7 days (CD; n = 7 offspring from 4 dams HFD; n = 9 offspring from 4 dams) 4 weeks (CD; n = 6 offspring from 3 dams HFD; n = 9 offspring from 4 dams) and 15 weeks (CD; n = 17 offspring from 7 dams HFD; n = 11 offspring from 5 dams) of age using synchrotron-based phase-contrast micro-CT imaging at SPring-8. We performed the histological examination and micro-CT imaging using synchrotron radiation of 33-week-old offspring of HFD-fed dams to explore the malignant potential of this mouse model.

Histological analysis

Three-micrometer-thick paraffin-embedded liver tissues and fetuses were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson’s trichrome (blue = collagens; red = erythrocytes and cytoplasm; dark purple/black = nuclei). The stained sections or fetuses were observed and visualized using a light microscope system (BZ-8100; Keyence Osaka Japan. https://www.keyence.com).

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemical staining was performed as previously described5273. Briefly formalin-fixed sections were deparaffinized and then microwaved at 100 °C for 30 min to retrieve antigens. Sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxidase for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Then the specimens were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies rinsed with PBS and subsequently incubated with ENVISION + (Dako Carpinteria CA) for 30 min. The reactions were visualized with 33′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride after 1–3 min revealing brown staining. The cell nuclei were then counterstained with hematoxylin. Immunohistochemistry was performed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (1:400) (NB100-479 Novus Biologicals Centennial CO USA) a rabbit polyclonal anti-HORMAD1 antibody (1:400) (28719-1-AP Proteintech Group Inc. Rosemont IL USA) and an anti-cytokeratin 19 (CK19) antibody (provided by Dr. Atsushi Miyajima Institute for Quantitative Biosciences The University of Tokyo Tokyo Japan). The stained sections were observed and visualized using a light microscope system (BZ-8100; Keyence). Quantification of immunohistochemical images was performed with Fiji Image J (US National Institutes of Health Bethesda MD USA imagej.net/Fiji v.1.52) as described in the previous study52.

Detection of liver hypoxia

After pimonidazole a 2-nitro-imidazole is delivered in vivo it binds to thiol groups of proteins in tissue with oxygen tensions less than 10 mmHg which can be detected using commercially available anti-pimonidazole antibodies74. For the detection of hypoxic conditions in mice pimonidazole (60 mg/kg CAS# 70132-50-2 Cayman Chemical Company Ann Arbor MI USA) was injected intraperitoneally 1 h before the animals were euthanized74. Staining was performed using Hydroxyprobe (Pharmacia International Belmont MA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions75. The stained sections were observed and visualized using a light microscope system (BZ-8100; Keyence).

Microarray

The microarray was performed as described in a previously published study76. Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Hilden Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cyanine-3 (Cy3)-labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.2 µg of RNA using the Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions followed by RNAeasy column purification (Qiagen). Dye incorporation and the cRNA yield were assessed with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. Cy3-labeled cRNA (0.6 µg specific activity > 25.0 pmol Cy3/µg cRNA) was fragmented at 60 °C for 30 min in a reaction volume of 25 µl containing 1 × fragmentation buffer (Agilent) and 2 × blocking agent (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Upon completion of the fragmentation reaction 25 µl of 2 × GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM (Agilent) were added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to a SurePrint G3 Mouse GE microarray 8 × 60 K Ver. 2.0 (G4858A #74809 Agilent Technologies) for 17 h at 65 °C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization microarrays were washed for 1 min at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and for 1 min with 37 °C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent) and then dried immediately. Microarray slides were scanned immediately after washing using the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2539A) with the one color scan setting for 1 × 60 K array slides (scan area 61 × 21.6 mm scan resolution 3 µm dye channel set to green and green PMT set to 100%). The scanned images were analyzed with Feature Extraction Software 11.0.1.1 (Agilent) using the default parameters (protocol AgilentG3_GX_1Color and grid: 074809_D_F_20150624) to obtain background-subtracted and spatially detrended processed signal intensities. Data were normalized and filtered with three filters using GeneSpring software 12.1 (Agilent Technologies. https://www.agilent.com). Briefly the raw data were normalized to their 75th percentile values. In the first filter when the value of a probe was lower than the 20th percentile value in any sample the probe was excluded. In the second filter when the flag of a probe was compromised in any sample the probe was excluded. In the last filter when the value (log scale) of CV was greater than 50% under both conditions the probe was excluded. After filtering control probes were excluded and log scale values were transformed into normal scales. The microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under number GSE183360.

Data are presented using GeneSpring software 12.1 (Agilent Technologies. https://www.agilent.com).

Western blotting

Total cellular extracts from mouse liver tissues and mouse primary hepatocytes were prepared as described previously75. Western blotting was conducted using 4–12% Novex NuPAGE Tris–glycine gels (Invitrogen) for HIF-1α and HORMAD1 (Proteintech Group Inc.) under reducing conditions. After the proteins were transferred onto Hybond-P PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences Co. Piscataway NJ USA) the membranes were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody at a dilution of 1:500 (NB100-479 Novus Biologicals USA) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-HORMAD1 antibody (28719-1-AP Proteintech Group Inc. Rosemont IL USA) at a dilution of 1:1000 at 4 °C overnight followed by an incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:50000) (Amersham) and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham ECL Prime). For loading controls the same membranes were stripped and reprobed with a β-actin antibody at a dilution of 1:5000 (A5316 Sigma–Aldrich St. Louis MO USA). As the levels of β-actin were affected by hypoxia exposure PVDF membranes were stained with a Coomassie brilliant blue solution (CBB 0.1% R250 25% isopropanol 10% acetic acid) solution for 5 min and washed with double-distilled water to confirm equal protein loading77. The protein intensities of the HIF-1α and HORMAD1 bands were processed using ImageJ software for densitometry analysis.

Isolation and culture of MPHs

MPHs were isolated from 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice using previously described methods78. The viable hepatocyte population was further purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation. Freshly isolated primary hepatocytes were plated in collagen-coated 6-well plates (IWAKI Tokyo Japan) at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well and cultured with high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco 11965092 Carlsbad CA USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum insulin-transferrin-selenium supplement (Gibco) 10–7 M dexamethasone (Sigma–Aldrich Inc. St. Louis MO) and antibiotics. Cells were allowed to adhere overnight before switching to fresh medium and were exposed to reagents under normoxic (21% O 2 ) or hypoxic (1% O 2 ) conditions for 24 h before being harvested for experiments as previously described75.

Quantitative RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from mouse livers and primary hepatocytes from each group using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed with a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with RNase Inhibitor (Applied Biosystems Carlsbad CA). Each cDNA sample was analyzed for gene expression using quantitative real-time PCR with a fluorescent TaqMan 57-nuclease assay and a sequence detection system (Prism 7300 Applied Biosystems CA). TaqMan real-time PCR was performed using 2 × TaqMan Master Mix and 20 × assay-on-demand TaqMan primers and probes (Applied Biosystems Thermo Fisher Scientific Foster City CA). The analysis was performed with ABI Prism 7300 SDS software (version 1.4.1 Applied Biosystems https://www.thermofisher.com/jp/ja/home/technical-resources/software-downloads/applied-biosystems-7300-real-time-pcr-system.html). Unlabeled specific primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems to detect the mouse Hif1α gene (assay ID: Mm00468869) mouse Hif2α (assay ID: Mm01236112_m1) mouse Hormad1 gene (assay ID: Mm00471448) and mouse ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P0 (Rplp0) gene (assay ID: Mm 00725448). After an initial incubation for 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C the samples were cycled 55 times at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. For the quantitative analysis the cDNA content of each sample was normalized to the levels of the housekeeping gene Rplp0 using the comparative CT method.

Immunocytochemistry

Primary hepatocytes were cultured on collagen type 1-coated four-chamber glass slides (BD Biocoat Collagen I BD Biosciences Bedford MA USA). After an overnight incubation under normoxic or hypoxic conditions the cells were fixed with 100% ethanol for 10 min and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (1:400) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-HORMAD1 antibody (1:400) at 4 °C overnight. Then the cells were rinsed with PBS and subsequently incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled polymer-conjugated secondary antibody (Envision Dako Carpinteria CA) for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were visualized with 33′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride after 2–3 min revealing brown staining. The stained sections were observed and visualized using a light microscope system (BZ-8100; Keyence).

siRNA transfection

Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific) was mixed with siRNAs (Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus siRNA Horizon Discovery a PerkinElmer company Cambridge GB Supplementary Table 2) in Opti-MEM reduced serum medium (Gibco) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and cells were used in experiments 24 h later.

Liver sample preparation for the synchrotron radiation micro-CT analysis

The contrast medium was prepared using a previously published protocol79. Briefly the contrast medium consisted of 40% wt/vol (in distilled water) BaSO 4 and 8% wt/vol gelatin. The abdomen and thorax were cut by creating a midline incision extending from the pubic symphysis to the jugulum under anesthesia. Three hundred units of heparin were injected into the beating left ventricle of the heart using a 24-gauge catheter. The right atrium was then cut and the mouse was perfused first with 42 °C prewarmed heparinized saline (100 IU/ml heparin in 0.9% NaCl) and then with contrast medium (42 °C). Immediately after perfusion cold saline (< 4 °C) was gently poured into the abdominal cavity. The mouse was carefully placed in an ice bucket for 10 min to solidify the contrast medium. Thereafter the liver which was filled with contrast medium was removed and stored in a freezer. The sample exclusion criteria were determined before the CT scan for technical failures such as misinjection of the contrast medium in the left ventricle or insufficient perfusion.

Imaging of liver samples

Samples were visualized using the synchrotron micro-CT system in BL20B2 at SPring-879 (Supplementary Fig. 5A). The synchrotron radiation beam is produced by deflecting the electron beam with a bending magnet and the flux is much higher than that of laboratory X-ray sources. The X-ray was monochromatized with a Si (111) double crystal monochromator and the beam then irradiated the samples. As the X-ray beam was approximately parallel each horizontal line corresponded to a slice position along the rotation axis and images of multiple slices (the slice pitch was equal to the pixel size namely the “cubic voxel”) were easily obtained in one rotation (3D-CT).

A high-resolution image detector (Beam monitor 5 and ORCA-Flash4.0; Hamamatsu Photonics Hamamatsu Japan) was used for radiographic imaging80. The format of the 3D image was 2048 × 2048 × 1320 pixels with cubic voxels of 15.53 μm3 (3.72 × 10−6 mm3). The scintillator which converts the X-ray beam to visible light was a 25-μm layer of GADOX (Gd 2 O 2 S: Tb± P43). The X-ray energy was 37.6 keV and the exposure time per projection was 100 ms.

For each sample 1800 radiographic images were acquired over an angular range of 0°–180° within 3 min. In this study the liver sample was placed on the rotating stage in an insulated chamber with double Kapton and Styrofoam walls and then scanned while the cryogenic temperatures were maintained using dry ice. After scanning we reconstructed the CT images from the radiographic images using a conventional tomography algorithm and convolution back projection.

X-ray phase tomography using a grating interferometer

X-ray phase tomographic measurements were performed at bending magnet beamline BL20B2 in SPring-8 Hyogo Japan. An X-ray grating interferometer composed of a phase grating G1 and an absorption grating G2 was used to retrieve phase information (Supplementary Fig. 5B). The principle of the grating interferometer is described elsewhere81. The X-ray grating interferometer was set between a sample and an X-ray imaging detector as shown in Supplementary Fig. 5B. G1 was composed of nickel with a pattern thickness of 3.53 μm which was designed to generate a π/2 phase shift at an X-ray energy of 20 keV. G2 was composed of gold and its pattern thickness was greater than 20 μm. The grating pitch in both gratings was 2.4 μm. The distance between G1 and G2 was defined by the fractional Talbot distance. The 5th-order fractional Talbot distance (p = 5/2) was chosen as an interferometric condition. The fractional Talbot distance depended on the Talbot order p the grating pitch and the X-ray energy. In this experimental setup the fractional Talbot distance was calculated to be 232 mm. In preparation for the tomographic measurement a sample was placed in a designated cylindrical container made of polypropylene with inner and outer diameters of 12 mm and 13 mm respectively. When placing the sample in the container an agarose gel with a concentration of 2% was used to fix the sample in the container. The sample in the container was measured within a specially designed water cell filled with pure water to avoid strong artifacts due to the drastic phase shift at the outer wall of the container. A visible light conversion-type X-ray imaging detector was used to detect projection images. It was composed of an AA60 beam monitor with a P43 scintillator (Hamamatsu Photonics) and a C13949-50U high-definition CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics). In this case the effective pixel size and the effective field of view were 3.47 μm and 14.2 mm in width respectively. In the X-ray phase tomographic measurement the number of projections was set to 1200 during a sample rotation of 180°. At each projection a 5-step fringe scan method was used to calculate a differential phase image. Then the differential phase image was integrated along the horizontal direction to generate a phase image. A phase tomogram was reconstructed from 1200 phase images using the conventional filtered back projection method.

Estimation of the mass (tissue) density

The mass density ρ (g/cm3) is proportional to the phase factor δ in the X-ray refractive index as shown in the following equation:

$$\delta =\frac{{\lambda }^{2}{r}_{e}{N}_{A}}{2\pi }\frac{Z}{M}\rho $$ (1)

where λ is the X-ray wavelength r e is the classical electron radius N A is Avogadro’s constant and Z/M is the ratio of the number of electrons to the molecular weight of the sample. In most soft tissues Z/M is assumed to be 0.55 (NIST: X-ray mass attenuation coefficients—Table 2. https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/XrayMassCoef/tab2.html). The difference in the X-ray refractive index Δδ between the sample and water can be obtained from X-ray phase tomography82. Therefore the difference in the density Δρ between the sample and water can also be estimated using Eq. (1). Finally the mass density ρ of the sample is estimated from Δρ + ρ water (= 1.0 g/cm3).

3D modeling of the liver and intrahepatic vessels and quantitative data processing

The computed tomography data from each mouse fetus were uploaded to advanced 3D image processing and quantification software (Amira version 5.4.3 Thermo Fisher Scientific MA. https://www.thermofisher.com) and extraction was performed using color contrast. The sample sizes were guided by a previous publication using synchrotron X-ray83. Liver and hepatic vessels were extracted from all mouse fetuses. The volume of the extracted liver was derived by forming multiple tetrahedrons with the center point as the apex in Amira. Intrahepatic blood vessels were extracted from the umbilical vein just before they entered the liver and branched. The blood flow rate was determined by deriving the vessel diameter which is proportional to the multiplier of the vessel diameter according to Murray’s law4784. For this purpose we used an open-source toolkit (Vascular Modelling Toolkit version 1.4.0 VMTK www.vmtk.org) to derive the vessel diameter semiautomatically. The liver vessel tree geometries were clipped at the side branches such that the main vessel remained to reduce the computational cost (Supplementary Fig. 5C). The images were created using 3D image software (Amira).

Statistics

The sample sizes for the animal studies were guided by a previous publication85. Values obtained from MPHs are presented as the means ± standard deviations (SD) and they are representative of at least three independent experiments. All measured variables from the synchrotron radiation micro-CT imaging were log(e) transformed for all statistical analyses. The significance of the differences between groups was determined using unpaired Student’s t tests and one-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc tests for multiple comparisons as needed. Welch’s corrections were used when the variances between groups were unequal. Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical data. Nonparametric analyses of histological scores were conducted using a Kruskal–Wallis test with the unpaired nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test as a post hoc analysis. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed to analyze the association between two variables using GraphPad Prism ver. 6.0 software (GraphPad San Diego CA. https://www.graphpad.com). The other statistical analyses described above were performed using SPSS ver. 24 (SPSS Chicago IL. https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics).",,,,,,,,,,,,

Can that change?,"A journalist who covers wildfires responds to Premee Mohamed’s “All That Burns Unseen.”

In “All That Burns Unseen” set in a dystopian but not-too-distant future we finally get the drone sidekick we didn’t know we needed. Premee Mohamed’s heroine Vaughn Collins is a government worker gone rogue as a wildfire burns. Along the way she rescues a dazed glitchy fire extinguisher drone. When a funnel of flames heads for Vaughn’s truck threatening everything her new friend dives into the blaze and sprays.

I understand her affection for it. When the world is too much I’d like to humbly recommend fire drone YouTube. Drones can spot forest fires find people behind flames and pull firehoses up beyond the tallest ladders. Some like this little guy are essentially flying fire extinguishers.

Vaughn’s enthusiasm for her drone friend is dampened only by the chemicals it contains. “Supposedly they were less dangerous than they used to be. Vaughn still didn’t like the idea of breathing the stuff in” Mohamed writes. In our present and in Vaughn’s past the chemicals in some firefighting foams known as PFAS are indeed dangerous. What replaces them could depend on today’s Environmental Protection Agency.

In firefighting different fuels call for different chemicals and techniques. Class A fuels like wood or paper can be put out using water often made even more effective with additives. You’re probably familiar with Class A fire retardants from photos of air tankers dropping red clouds near wildfires; they slow oncoming flames by changing how they burn. To be clear these are different from PFAS—although they have their own risks. Made of salts or chemicals used to make fertilizer they have killed fish and caused algae blooms; their use is now restricted near water.

But at least these Class A wildfire retardants should break down over time. When I asked Shirley Zylstra at the U.S. Forest Service she told me that they “lose most or all of their toxicity within a month or so.” So do the Class A foams used to fight wildfires up close which are made of detergents like those in shampoo or shaving cream; they help water sink in and coat buildings in protective bubbles. Like retardants “Class A” foams are also short-term bad for fish; on the upside they are required to biodegrade quickly. (In case you were wondering home fire extinguishers shouldn’t have long-term effects either. Their powders smother grease and electrical fires as well as Class A fires. White powder is basically baking soda; yellow is chemically close to bird poop.)

Vaughn’s drone sprays black powder. It could be carrying fire extinguisher powder. Or if the drone also carries water it could be carrying a futuristic foam concentrate. As Vaughn points out first responders should avoid breathing any of this stuff in. Many of these chemicals could cause coughing irritation or even death at high-enough doses. That said they are deeply diluted before use. Opponents would like Class A foams and retardants used less but they are not focused on making the chemicals themselves less harmful.

When Vaughn says firefighting chemicals have become less dangerous then she may be talking about a different category: aqueous film forming foams or AFFFs. Invented in the 1960s these foams protect jet fuel at airports and oil at refineries. They are our best tool for Class B fires: when vats of flammable liquids catch flame. In Mohamed’s story Vaughn lands her plane on an oil company runway. Perhaps her manta ray–shaped drone sidekick fighting fires in a land filled with flammable liquids thanks to the oil industry is carrying a futuristic replacement for AFFF. But what exactly?

Like the fossil fuels they protect AFFFs cause long-lasting harm. Instead of killing fish quickly they give fish cancer. In Lake Superior chemicals used in AFFFs have made some fish dangerous to eat affecting tribal fishing traditions and people who fish to survive. Across the U.S. these chemicals are contaminating drinking water. What’s worse they essentially never break down.

Called PFAS (for per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) these “forever chemicals” repel both water and oil. They form weirdly impenetrable firefighting foam; they also give us waterproof mascara rainproof tents leakproof burger wrappers and nonstick pans. But in addition to repelling liquids PFAS also accumulate in our blood. Most of us have at least some PFAS in our bodies.

You’ve probably heard about them before. In 1999 mysterious cow deaths near a DuPont factory sparked class-action lawsuits and medical research into the impacts of PFAS. The 2019 film Dark Waters follows lawyer Robert Billot played by Mark Ruffalo who won several lawsuits against DuPont which knew there were risks for years.

Independent research ordered during those lawsuits linked high levels of PFAS to thyroid problems pregnancy complications kidney disease and more. Since then even low levels have been connected to immune system problems and other health concerns.

PFAS were first developed in the 1930s and are still used widely. But AFFFs are one of the most obvious ways they wind up in our water. For years fire departments could simply hose huge foamy mounds of AFFF into soil and storm drains. Eventually many states tightened guidelines for disposing of foam.

In the early 2000s chemical companies started phasing out early PFAS called PFOS and PFOA replacing them with ostensibly less-bad alternatives. Newer “short-chain” PFAS are different than their predecessors on a molecular level so existing research about risks did not as clearly apply. Many municipalities did what seemed like the right thing: They switched to firefighting foams made with the newer PFAS.

Now it appears many of the newer PFAS are still plenty bad for us. Many fire departments will have to replace AFFFs again this time with non-PFAS foams. In the meantime we’ve spent two decades using replacement chemicals in all sorts of products that are still toxic and that still persist in the environment.

It’s the kind of seemingly preventable mistake that makes teeth grind. But in the chemical industry these “regrettable substitutions” are common. Vaughn’s skepticism toward the contents of her drone is warranted: The same thing could easily happen again.

Reasonable people might expect chemical regulation to work something like drug approvals. To release drugs (or vaccines) companies must first run—and pay for—study after study to clarify any side effects. For the U.S. chemical industry for a long time the process was almost the opposite. For decades most new chemicals entered the market with no required safety testing and no formal review by the U.S. EPA.

Under the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act chemicals were assumed safe until proved dangerous. The EPA had limited power even to request data. Once it understood health risks it had to weigh them against financial costs. When the EPA banned asbestos in 1989 manufacturers sued to weaken the ban and won.

Now there is a glimmer of change. In 2016 Toxic Substances Control Act reform finally passed. A bipartisan bill the Lautenberg Act gave the EPA more authority to test and regulate new and existing chemicals—and required it to do so. In June the EPA finally proposed a new asbestos ban; it also ordered safety tests for 6:2 FTAB one of the “short chain” PFAS now used in AFFF.

A week later the EPA also announced health advisories for four other PFAS. The new “safe” level for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water is approximately zero. Next the EPA plans to designate those two PFAS as hazardous. That move will trigger Superfund cleanups and big decisions about who will pay.

For the first time the EPA also defined safe drinking water levels for two of the newer “short chain” PFAS; enforceable limits should follow. Surely now we can rest easy knowing that Vaughn’s well-meaning drone sidekick decades in the future is spraying something truly harmless?

The problem is none of this actually bans the PFAS in AFFFs. PFAS are still used in Class B firefighting foams because they still put out liquid fires faster than alternatives. The Department of Defense has a mandate to find non-PFAS replacements by 2024 but so far it doesn’t have a silver bullet.

More broadly drinking water limits alone can’t solve for regrettable substitutions. There aren’t just four PFAS chemicals—there are thousands. The EPA can’t even test for them all yet. While this year’s four health advisories were based on clear if limited data most PFAS are entirely unstudied. They may be better or worse than their predecessors; we don’t know.

Advertisement

That’s why some toxicologists want the EPA to regulate PFAS as one big group. As with drugs they think PFAS should be assumed dangerous until proved safe. Because PFAS don’t biodegrade and we can’t study them quickly enough continuing to produce them multiplies problems we don’t yet understand. Add all the other chemicals we can’t keep up with and we may even be threatening the stability of life on Earth. (Again may I recommend a delightful firefighting drone video as a break from the news?)

A handful of states like California are already regulating PFAS as a group banning them in product categories like food packaging. The EPA is taking a different tack working first to better understand the specific risks of different PFAS subgroups.

Using computer models and machine learning computational toxicologists can treat PFAS molecules like keys and virtually test them against receptors in our cells. PFAS that are likely to accidentally unlock similar cellular functions can be grouped and prioritized for research. Data from the 6:2 FTAB used in AFFF for example could help the EPA make educated guesses about the health risks of 503 other structurally similar PFAS.

This approach could clarify health risks and help justify eye-popping cleanup costs—it could also take decades. In an email the EPA said the agency “is focused on improving its ability to address multiple chemicals at once.” In the dystopian future Mohamed imagines Vaughn’s continued skepticism implies plenty of “regrettable substitutions” in the meantime.

How to avoid chemicals lurking in everyday products - from labels to packaging changes

As well as lurking in plastics and toiletries phthalates are also found in things like food packaging detergents furnishings flooring clothing paints rubber coating materials and medical devices.

Used in hundreds of products we come across on a daily basis it’s small wonder they’re known as ­“everywhere chemicals”.

Now a new study published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics has revealed that pregnant women who were exposed to multiple phthalates (pronounced thal-ates) are at increased risk of a premature birth.

The discovery joins a long list of health concerns already surrounding these controversial ingredients.

“Phthalates are a wide range of chemical compounds commonly used as softeners to make plastics such as PVC more flexible and durable or to stabilise chemicals including fragrances in certain products” explains Dr Philip Bassindale of

sustainable goods firm Bower Collective (bowercollective.com).

“Worryingly numerous studies have shown that exposure to these phthalates can damage male fertility unborn children and interfere with our hormonal systems.”

Phthalates have also been linked to certain cancers obesity diabetes and asthma.

Another recent study published in the journal Environmental Pollution found that people who had higher levels of the ­chemicals in their body were more likely to die early from any cause particularly cardiovascular issues.

Image: Getty Images/Westend61) Getty Images/Westend61)

According to Dr Michael Warhurst Executive Director at campaigning ­organisation CHEM Trust (chemtrust.org) phthalates can enter our bodies in a few different ways.

“We can ingest them when we consume food and drinks that have been packaged in plastic or stored in plastic ­containers that contain phthalates” he explains.

“We can also breathe them in when they wear off plastic products and mix with dust indoors. Children can also be exposed to ­phthalates by sucking on plastictoys.”

In July 2020 new European regulations restricted the use of four particular ­phthalates linked to reproductive effects in some consumer plastic goods ordering that new products should contain a ­concentration of no more than 0.1% by weight of the plasticised material.

But the directive doesn’t restrict ­phthalates in all plastic products including food packaging.

Additionally other phthalates suspected of being harmful remain unrestricted.

And in many cases these less-researched but still suspicious phthalates are being used to replace those being phased out.

Whatever the case because of their widespread use it is now practically impossible to totally avoid exposure. But there are lots of ways to reduce the amount of contact you have with phthalates.

Here’s how...

AVOID PLASTIC PACKAGING

They’re widely used in plastic food and drink packaging and can leach into the food and drink they contain particularly high-fat dairy products fatty meats and poultry.

Limit your exposure by choosing goods in plastic-free food packaging instead.

CONTAIN IT

Stop storing food in plastic containers – go for glass stainless steel or porcelain instead. And never reheat food in plastic containers in the microwave. When plastic is heated it accelerates the release of phthalates.

Even if a plastic container is labelled microwave-safe it just means it won’t melt.

Transfer food to ceramic plates and bowls first instead.

LOOK AT LABELS

Unfortunately unless a product is labelled as phthalate-free it can be tricky to tell if it has added ­phthalates. Manufacturers aren’t required to state overtly that a product contains them either.

Scan the ingredient list and look out for acronyms including BBP DBP DEHP DEP DCHP DMP DIBP DINP DNHP DNOP.

The number three in the triangle of recycling arrows on plastics and V or PVC underneath the triangle also indicate the presence of phthalates.

EAT UNPROCESSED AND COOK FROM SCRATCH AT HOME

Phthalates typically enter processed foods through factory conveyor belts and pipes plus plastic gloves worn by food processing workers. So avoid processed foods as much as possible and buy fresh instead.

It could also be a good idea to avoid eating out too often according to one study by George Washington University in the US.

It found that people who had eaten at fast-food outlets and restaurants the night before the tests had almost 35% higher levels of phthalates in their urine the following day than people who had prepared their own meals at home.

Another study by the university found more than 80% of fast-food samples tested contained the phthalate DnBP and 70% contained the phthalate DEHP.

Yet the researchers say they were unsurprised since fast foods are so heavily processed packaged and handled.

BUST THE DUST

Phthalates can build up in household dust so use a damp cloth on surfaces and vacuum carpets regularly.

Wash your hands well before preparing food and eating – research has shown that using soap and water can remove 80% more phthalates than water alone.

‘CLEAN’ COSMETICS

Phthalates can hide in all kinds of personal care items including skincare make-up nail polish soaps and shampoos. Some harmful phthalates were banned from being added to many skincare products in the EU in 2015 but they’re still allowed in other countries.

Also be aware that cosmetics that list fragrance or perfume in their ingredients may well contain

non-banned phthalates

Some well-known brands such as bareMinerals The Body Shop and REN are free from phthalates while brands that focus on natural and organic ingredients also tend to make phthalate-free formulas. If things aren’t clear on cosmetic packaging then search the company’s website.

BREATH OF FRESH AIR

In air fresheners phthalates are used to make fragrances last longer. Look for organic air-freshening products instead try essential oil diffusers or make your own.

“Fill a glass jar about a quarter full with bicarbonate of soda then add about eight drops of essential oil – peppermint lavender or orange oils are particularly nice” suggests Emma Heathcote-James founder of Little Soap Company.

“Cover the top of the jar with foil and poke a few holes in it to release the smell. To refresh the scent give the jar a small shake now and then.”

PLAY SAFE

Since 2005 The EU Toy Safety Directive has banned the use of certain phthalates in children’s plastic toys. The regulations apply to all toys sold in the EU and UK even if they were manufactured outside the EU.

Despite the regulations there may still be toys imported here that contain phthalates.

Look for a CE mark indicating they comply with EU safety standards for health and safety.

Avoid soft pliable plastic second-hand toys that were ­manufactured before 2007 as they are likely to contain phthalates.

VEER AWAY FROM VINYL

Vinyl or PVC products contain phthalates to make them flexible.

For peace of mind search for phthalate-free vinyl flooring from brands such as Tarkett. And consider swapping a PVC shower curtain for one made from PEVA (polyethylene vinyl acetate) or nylon.",,,,,,

I’m sure I’m not alone in reading with alarm the article about short-term rentals in Orleans. (7/18) To be a year-round resident and have to contend with huge gatherings in formerly quiet neighborhoods would be a problem.

The Lower Cape has always had more than its share of second home owners but now thanks to Vrbo and Airbnb these large homes are now filled with short-term “guests” who are not always the best of neighbors.

I hope other towns take note of this problem before it infects the entire Cape. I live in a condo and we’re prohibited from renting to anyone for less than a year. Of course this solution can’t be applied to single homes but it seems towns can put some sort of limits on the number of nights. A fine of $100-$300 is laughable when owners are raking in thousands of dollars a night but there has to be some discussion of possible limits on this explosion of short-term rentals.

It's not a place made famous by Instagram nor a place filled with any particular industry that would lure in the crowds. It's a spot that's barely a speck on the map located some 42 miles southwest of Palermo on the island of Sicily with fewer than 6000 permanent residents. But it's a spot worth knowing especially if you're into slow travel — and even more so if you're into Airbnbs.

In 2019 Sambuca di Sicilia gained internet notoriety thanks to its decision to sell dilapidated homes for just 1 euro. The plan was meant to encourage international investment and to help restore this lovely little village to its former glory. One of the lucky buyers happened to be none other than Airbnb which scooped up a property to rent out. The peer-to-peer home rental giant is not only ready to unveil its creation to the world but it's doing so with the help of the Lastra family who won a free year-long stay at the house and will now act as host to world travelers looking to get to know Sambuca too. They gave us a little peek at what the family and guests are in for with a weekend stay at the home before anyone else arrived.

""The project is part of a wider Airbnb commitment to support rural communities and cultural heritage in Europe"" a spokesperson for Airbnb told Travel + Leisure via e-mail. ""With the growing flexibility to work and live from anywhere this unique Sicilian home offers a stylish yet sustainable setting for remote working — we feel it is the perfect symbol of how changing work and travel trends can breathe new life into a community.""

Coming to Sambuca felt a little like falling off the face of the earth and into another dimension. The road from Palermo quickly thins of houses making way for verdant landscapes with rolling pastures on either side. The further you get from the city the fewer humans you'll see replaced instead with friendly cows and the odd sheep herd or two blocking the road. But unlike most traffic jams this one's a welcome sight introducing a calm slowed-down approach that only enhances as you make your way to the renovated Airbnb.

The home sits at the top of town just behind the massive church which acts as the center of life in Sambuca. Next to the church sits an unassuming but wildly delicious pizza restaurant visitors will want to return to over and over again.

The home's exterior blends seamlessly into the neighboring properties but upon entering the doors it's easy to see the extent of the work put in by architects and designers Studio Didea an architectural firm based in Palermo.

The interior design combines contemporary items with local artisanal elements. It includes lighting by designs brands Lambert & Fils and Marset furniture by CC Tapis E15 and MDF Italia and technical fixtures and fittings by Bulthaup Kos Smeg and Zucchetti. It's chic but in no way overdone allowing the views out the windows to be the star of the show from the downstairs bedroom the upstairs office the living area and the lofted second bed atop that.

""This home reflects the 'Italian way' of design culture capable of combining the country's rich artisan tradition with an aspiration that is often fiercely opposed to modernity"" an Airbnb spokesperson explained.

It's a space where the Lastra family will undoubtedly make themselves at home and invite guests to do the same.

Claudia Zalla/Courtesy of Airbnb

""We are easy-going and down-to-earth people who love to share and learn so our guests can expect nothing but a warm welcome from us"" Eva Lastra said. ""We would love to share cool spots to check out and also aid them in discovering the delicious Sicilian gastronomy with a touch of 'French culture.' And maybe a yoga class or two.""

In town the family can help guests head out for tours of neighboring ricotta farms go for wine tastings at Sicily's beloved Planeta Winery and even try their hand at wild foraging (the area is a stellar spot to hunt down wild asparagus).

""We are looking forward to exploring the landscapes indulging in the local cuisine and trying the lifestyle and change of pace Sambuca will provide for us"" Lastra said. ""We also know that Sicilians are very family-oriented so this was a huge cherry on top for us.""

Research has found a boom in rental properties being used for short-term lets caused by a rise in domestic holidays and increased regulations for long-term landlords.

In tourist areas this is putting a strain on local provisions causing housing shortages and pushing vital workers away from areas where they are needed leading MPs and councils to consider measures to clamp down.

A report by Scarborough council found the number of private rental properties in the centre of the town had fallen from an average of 25 homes being available at any one time in 2017 to six in 2022. The number of holiday lets rose dramatically over the same period.

The report stated: “The council is reliant on using the private rented sector in meeting demand [for housing] however officers are reporting a significant drop off in the availability of private rented sector accommodation in the borough.

“We have also seen examples of private landlords evicting tenants in order to convert [their properties] into Airbnb and holiday lets.”

This is not unique to beauty spots as the number of Airbnb listings in London more than quadrupled between 2015 and 2019 in a city with a shortage of long-term lets previous research by the Greater London Authority found.

A private member’s bill brought last week by Rachael Maskell the York Central Labour MP aimed to implement a licence to turn domestic properties into short-term and holiday-let accommodation give local authorities the power to issue fines and to remove licences and seek to introduce bans on such properties in certain areas.

Last month the government launched a consultation into how to balance the need for tourist accommodation with homes for locals to live in. The deadline for responses is 21 September.

In the meantime councils are coming up with their own solutions. North Yorkshire county council is considering proposals to introduce a 100% premium for council tax bills on second homes while new rules come into force next year in Wales requiring second homeowners to pay 300% council tax.

Landlords said it was not only money but experiences with bad tenants and a lack of flexibility in long-term lettings that was driving them to platforms such as Airbnb.

One landlord who got a court order to evict a tenant who did not pay rent for 14 months told the Guardian she would eventually turn her other long-term lets into Airbnbs.

She has four apartments in Scarborough rented through Airbnb and another two are long-term private lets. She said: “I have only kept those houses on assured shorthold tenancies because I can trust them and the families would have a terrible time finding alternative accommodation which is at a premium in this tourist area.

“As and when the houses become empty I will use them for holiday accommodation if at all possible. I will not risk different new full-time tenants.”

She said being able to claim expenses including mortgage interest setting up costs and running costs made it more lucrative for her pension pot. “But most of all I do not have to worry about bad tenants antisocial tenants and non-paying tenants which all take forever to get rid of.

Last Updated 2 years ago

Beginning this August Airbnb will be changing its host cancelation fee structure in to crack down on hosts who cancel reservations at the last minute. Airbnb has grown to be a wildly popular platform over the last decade and it continues to offer affordable unique and diverse accommodations not found anywhere else. When it works it works but sometimes the unexpected can happen.

Bookings made months in advance that were considered a done deal have been canceled by the host leaving travelers scrambling to find accommodation for their trips. Sometimes the reasoning is understandable enough such as downed powerlines or unexpected damage to the property. However sometimes the reason is outright unfair. Some hosts list the same property twice at different rates and cancel the booking for the person who reserved the lower rate.

Why Airbnb Is Making The Change

Until recently the only penalty hosts faced when canceling a booking was a $50 to $100 fee dependent on how close to the reservation the host canceled. This fee is excruciatingly low compared to how much hosts can make if they list a property more than once or find other ways to “resell” the reservation at a higher rate.

Consider the following:

A host has a single property they list on Airbnb for $100 per night. This is low enough they can nearly guarantee a booking. Now they list the same property again either on Airbnb or another platform for $250 per night. Why? Sometimes you catch a big fish where you least expect it. The property may not be worth $250 per night but the host hopes to get lucky. Now imagine you reserved the Airbnb months ahead of an upcoming trip. However three days before you're ready to leave the higher-priced listing gets booked. What do you think the host will do? They will recoup the minuscule fee incurred in a single night so of course they will cancel your reservation!

The New Standard

The problem was getting out of hand with 41.1% of scams affecting Airbnb users falling into the “Multiple Listings Scam” category in 2021. Understandably Airbnb has decided this needs to stop. When hosts cancel at the last minute the travelers affected lose all confidence in the platform. They will very likely advise everyone they know to avoid using Airbnb. For this reason Airbnb will be updating its host cancellation policy beginning on August 22nd 2022.

Beginning this August the minimum cancelation fee will be $50 and the maximum fee will be $1000. The fee imposed will be dependent upon how close to the reservation the host cancels. Here is the breakdown:

If Cancelled:

30 days ahead of check-in: 10% of Reservation Cost

Less than 30 days but more than 48 hours before check-in: 25% of Reservation Cost

Less than 48 hours before check-in: 50% of Reservation Cost

What It Means For Travelers

Travelers will likely reap the benefits of this necessary change. Firstly host cancellations are more likely to decrease overall. In the case of the multiple listing example above a fee of $1000 would greatly diminish any additional profit the host would gain by double listing the property. Knowing this the host is less likely to double-list the property in the first place.

Additionally travelers are likely to receive more support from Airbnb when things still don't pan out as intended. Before the change Airbnb would try to help travelers find similar accommodations. The company would their original deposit to a new booking. However no similar properties were often available at the same price point. This forced travelers to either stay in sub-par accommodations stay further out from their originally intended area or cancel their trip and receive a refund.

Time will tell whether the change effectively lowers the incidence of host cancellations but the future looks promising. Airbnb is a unique alternative to traditional bookings such as hotels and this new change is sure to inspire more confidence in the platform moving forward.

The 5-megawatt 32-acre project will generate electricity to power the equivalent of 1300 homes and will offset the Mercury Marine Fond du Lac campus's energy usage by 10%.

“We're a company that's here in Fond du Lac that is here to stay and we’re advancing what we can through sustainability and renewable energy"" said Scott Louks the Mercury Marine sustainability manager.

This facility will be located on a privately-owned family farm in eastern Fond du Lac. Because of this setting it has one particularly unique aspect: sheep which Louks describes as ""groundskeepers"" of the facility. And the relationship is symbiotic as the sheep reap the benefits of the solar panels as well.

“The solar project is a great fit for our grazing flock because the animals will get the extra benefit of shade in their pasture under their solar panels where currently they are grazing in a field and don't have the extra benefit of shade"" Farm owner Olivia Halbur said.

Mercury Marine is paying for all costs to tie the solar facility to the power grid but they could not disclose the project's price tag.

The energy will be distributed through a partnership with Alliant Energy.

""We're pleased to help them move in the right direction because we know sustainability and renewable energy is the future"" Chris Caporale Alliant Energy communications partner said.

The project is slated to be completed by spring of next year.

Mercury Marine took on its first solar project in 2017—with a 2000-panel array at the company’s eastern headquarters in Belgium. Its first solar project in the U.S. was at its world headquarters in Fond du Lac where it installed 320 panels on its roof.",,,,,,,,,,,,

These out-of-this-world wheels will be used for the upcoming Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) of Lockheed Martin.

Goodyear Racing Eagle tires are stacked up along a wall during practice for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Allstate 400 at the Brickyard at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on July 25 2009 in Indianapolis Indiana.

The American multinational tire manufacturer announced this detail on July 20. Goodyear already manufactured advanced wheels for other space missions.

These include the Apollo 11 mission which launched around 53 years ago. Now the company plans to be involved in another important space effort.

""The company will continue that tradition-focusing on lunar vehicle tires-by joining Lockheed Martin in its development of a lunar mobility vehicle"" said the tire maker via its official press release.

Goodyear's New Moon Tires To Arrive!

According to PC Mag's latest report Goodyear's recent wheels for NASA's lunar rovers are designed to last only a few days.

A Goodyear store is seen on August 19 2020 in Miami Florida. President Donald Trump called for a boycott against Goodyear in reaction to a social media post that was purportedly from a company training session that deemed MAGA attire unacceptable for the workplace.

These tires need to be replaced so that the moon vehicles of the space agency can work properly.

Now the tire manufacturer is expected to develop new lunar wheels that can last longer and endure rugged terrain as well as other harsh conditions.

The company's CTO Chris Helsel said their new collaboration with Lockheed Martin is a big deal.

Designing new moon tires for the defense corporation will give them more experience in wheel making allowing them to create better airless tires.

Can Goodyear's Lunar Wheels Endure Moon's Environment?

As of press time it is hard to conclude that the new tires of Goodyear can endure harsh lunar conditions.

But the wheel maker said that it would use its advanced technologies for airless tires in Earth-based autonomous shuttles passenger cars as well as micro-mobility vehicles.

Although the new lunar wheels are still under development you can definitely expect more longer-lasting moon tires from Goodyear since it has been providing strong wheels for various automakers and other companies.

Meanwhile a luxurious space balloon is now being designed by Space Perspective.

On the other hand Russia confirmed that Roscosmos' ISS stay had been extended until 2028.

""It’s clear we are facing a challenging macro environment with more uncertainty ahead."" He added ""There are real concerns that our productivity as a whole is not where it needs to be for the head count we have."" He asked employees to help ""create a culture that is more mission-focused more focused on our products more customer focused.

CFO Ruth Porat said she expected some of the challenges to continue in the near term but the company doesn't give formal guidance. It also comes after Pichai recently announced that it would slow the pace of hiring and investments through 2023 asking employees to work “with greater urgency” and “more hunger” than shown “on sunnier days.""

“I would love to get all your help” Pichai said at Wednesday's all-hands meeting speaking to its more than 170000 full-time employees.

To that end Pichai introduced a ""Simplicity Sprint"" initiative to crowdsource ideas for quicker product development. ""Sprint"" is a term often used in software development and by tech startups to denote short focused pushes toward a common goal.

Screenshot of outrage on Twitter posted by players who oppose the Indian government's ban on BGMI

The Indian government has ordered the country’s Alphabet Inc.'s Google Play Store and Apple Inc.’s App Store to delete South Korean game developer Krafton Inc.'s Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI).Battlegrounds Mobile India is the Indian version of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) Mobile made exclusively for players in the South Asian nation.Krafton developed and published the online multiplayer battle royale game and released it last July for Android devices and the following month for iOS devices.In just a year of publishing the game attracted more than 100 million accumulated players and ranked No. 1 in the App Store.The Indian government did not provide an official reason for the latest decision.Existing users of the game can play it but updating or downloading it for the first time is not possible.Prior to Krafton managing the game directly China’s Tencent was in charge of the game’s publishing.Relations between China and India have continued to sour since 2020 when a border conflict between the two countries heated up.This is when New Dehli first blocked the original PUBG Mobile from its app market.But even after Krafton pushed out a local version some argued that BGMI should be treated the same as PUBG Mobile.Last month a 16-year-old boy from Uttar Pradesh India shot his mother after she prohibited him from playing mobile phone games. The murder incident added weight to those who want stronger regulations for the mobile gaming industry.The crackdown on PUBG is just one of India’s bans on more than 100 mobile apps originating from or related to China.According to Krafton’s regulatory filing in Seoul the Shenzen China-based Tencent has a 13.5% stake in the South Korean company as of the end of March 2022.If the block continues Krafton may choose to discontinue the service in India just as Tencent did.“We are trying to get a clear idea of the current situation in India” a Krafton employee told The Korea Economic Daily.Upset BGMI players took to Twitter to show their disapproval of the government’s decision using the hashtag “BGMIbanned” and reasoned that if the game is banned a host of other games must be banned as well.Krafton's share price plummeted on Friday when the news broke.It finished the day’s trade at 233500 won ($179) a share 4.5% lower than the previous day.Seung-Woo Lee at leeswoo@hankyung.com Jee Abbey Lee edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2dtYWlsLWdvZXMtZm9yLWludGVyZmFjZS1kZXNpZ24tb3ZlcmhhdWwtY2hlY2stbmV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLTEwMTY1OTE3OTk1ODU1NC5odG1s0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZ21haWwtZ29lcy1mb3ItaW50ZXJmYWNlLWRlc2lnbi1vdmVyaGF1bC1jaGVjay1uZXctZmVhdHVyZXMtMTAxNjU5MTc5OTU4NTU0LWFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gmail goes for interface design overhaul.

This integrated view organises all the three at one place. The improved layout supports users in exploring Google apps integrated into the Gmail main menu.(Bloomberg)

The improved layout supports users in exploring Google apps integrated into the Gmail main menu. The main menu of each app is displayed in a collapsible panel. The users can customise the collapsible panel based on their choice to see specific app menus in it. Gmail carries the feature to show or hide the side panel and collapsible panel manually. Also by pointing to each app’s icon user can preview what’s going on without shifting the context.

The restructured layout is rolled out for everyone. Credit: Google

There are notification bubbles at the bottom-left corner to show incoming notifications of recent Chat and Space messages. These bubbles can be clicked to reply directly from the chat or spaces tab.

The notification bubbles can be turned on by the following four steps.

1) At the top right of your Gmail window next to your status indicator click More options Chat notification settings.

2) In the window that appears tick the boxes next to ‘Allow Chat notifications’ and ‘Open chat bubbles for new messages’.

3) Click Done at the bottom of the window.

4) The notification bubbles can be turned off by simply unpicking the box next to ‘Open chat bubbles for new messages’.

Google started launching its updated Gmail interface since February this year. The ‘extended rollout’ had an opt-in feature. In June the interface became a default feature having an opt-out option. Now it has been rolled out for every Gmail user. Although the option to switch back is provided even now users will have to eventually shift to the newer version as it will turn into the only option.

If the feature is too complex or does not suit your mood you can shift to the old Gmail layout by the following three steps suggested by Google support.

1) At the top right click Settings.

2) Under ‘Quick settings’ click Go back to the original Gmail view.

3) In the new window click Reload

Meanwhile The Verge has reported that the Google is planning to bring new features in Gmail for it tablet users. It is expected that better emoji support and more accessibility features will come in the near future."

The Indian government has ordered the country’s Alphabet Inc.'s Google Play Store and Apple Inc.’s App Store to delete South Korean game developer Krafton Inc.'s Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI).Battlegrounds Mobile India is the Indian version of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) Mobile made exclusively for players in the South Asian nation.Krafton developed and published the online multiplayer battle royale game and released it last July for Android devices and the following month for iOS devices.In just a year of publishing the game attracted more than 100 million accumulated players and ranked No. 1 in the App Store.The Indian government did not provide an official reason for the latest decision.Existing users of the game can play it but updating or downloading it for the first time is not possible.Prior to Krafton managing the game directly China’s Tencent was in charge of the game’s publishing.Relations between China and India have continued to sour since 2020 when a border conflict between the two countries heated up.This is when New Dehli first blocked the original PUBG Mobile from its app market.But even after Krafton pushed out a local version some argued that BGMI should be treated the same as PUBG Mobile.Last month a 16-year-old boy from Uttar Pradesh India shot his mother after she prohibited him from playing mobile phone games. The murder incident added weight to those who want stronger regulations for the mobile gaming industry.The crackdown on PUBG is just one of India’s bans on more than 100 mobile apps originating from or related to China.According to Krafton’s regulatory filing in Seoul the Shenzen China-based Tencent has a 13.5% stake in the South Korean company as of the end of March 2022.If the block continues Krafton may choose to discontinue the service in India just as Tencent did.“We are trying to get a clear idea of the current situation in India” a Krafton employee told The Korea Economic Daily.Upset BGMI players took to Twitter to show their disapproval of the government’s decision using the hashtag “BGMIbanned” and reasoned that if the game is banned a host of other games must be banned as well.Krafton's share price plummeted on Friday when the news broke.It finished the day’s trade at 233500 won ($179) a share 4.5% lower than the previous day.Seung-Woo Lee at leeswoo@hankyung.com Jee Abbey Lee edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2dtYWlsLWdvZXMtZm9yLWludGVyZmFjZS1kZXNpZ24tb3ZlcmhhdWwtY2hlY2stbmV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLTEwMTY1OTE3OTk1ODU1NC5odG1s0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZ21haWwtZ29lcy1mb3ItaW50ZXJmYWNlLWRlc2lnbi1vdmVyaGF1bC1jaGVjay1uZXctZmVhdHVyZXMtMTAxNjU5MTc5OTU4NTU0LWFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gmail goes for interface design overhaul. Check new features,"Gmail’s revamped interface design is now available for all its users. Alphabet Inc’s Google had announced these changes in February this year. The restructured design has borrowed elements from Google’s Material design 3. Meet Chat and Spaces are kept closer together allowing users to switch between them easily. This integrated view organises all the three at one place. The improved layout supports users in exploring Google apps integrated into the Gmail main menu.(Bloomberg)

The improved layout supports users in exploring Google apps integrated into the Gmail main menu. The main menu of each app is displayed in a collapsible panel. The users can customise the collapsible panel based on their choice to see specific app menus in it. Gmail carries the feature to show or hide the side panel and collapsible panel manually. Also by pointing to each app’s icon user can preview what’s going on without shifting the context.

There are notification bubbles at the bottom-left corner to show incoming notifications of recent Chat and Space messages. These bubbles can be clicked to reply directly from the chat or spaces tab.

The notification bubbles can be turned on by the following four steps.

1) At the top right of your Gmail window next to your status indicator click More options Chat notification settings.

2) In the window that appears tick the boxes next to ‘Allow Chat notifications’ and ‘Open chat bubbles for new messages’.

3) Click Done at the bottom of the window.

4) The notification bubbles can be turned off by simply unpicking the box next to ‘Open chat bubbles for new messages’.

Google started launching its updated Gmail interface since February this year. The ‘extended rollout’ had an opt-in feature. In June the interface became a default feature having an opt-out option. Now it has been rolled out for every Gmail user. Although the option to switch back is provided even now users will have to eventually shift to the newer version as it will turn into the only option.

If the feature is too complex or does not suit your mood you can shift to the old Gmail layout by the following three steps suggested by Google support.

1) At the top right click Settings.

2) Under ‘Quick settings’ click Go back to the original Gmail view.

3) In the new window click Reload

Meanwhile The Verge has reported that the Google is planning to bring new features in Gmail for it tablet users. It is expected that better emoji support and more accessibility features will come in the near future."

Under the guise of “diversity” Amazon is offering a $10000 bonus to its delivery service partners — but only for those partners who are black Latino or Native American. Asian-Americans and whites are categorically ineligible for this racially discriminatory stipend. This is a flagrant violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 which guarantees to citizens of every race and color the same right to make and enter into contracts with others.

Amazon also operates a “Black Business Accelerator” program that gives money and racially discriminatory preferences to black-owned businesses that sell products through Amazon including a “$500 credit to assist with start-up and operational costs for eligible newly launched sellers” and “advertising credits to increase exposure.” Businesses owned by members of any other race are categorically ineligible for these benefits.

AFL has proven its commitment to stamping out illegal discrimination. To date we have challenged woke ideology and illegal discrimination in corporate America the federal government and local public school systems. More lawsuits will be coming against woke corporations that violate federal civil rights laws in the name of “diversity equity and inclusion.”

All American citizens are harmed when companies illegally discriminate based on race color national origin religion or sex. Companies should be focusing on the quality of their products and services seeking new ways to innovate and expand and maximizing shareholder wealth not on imposing an illegal and immoral equity agenda on their employees and customers.

Statement from America First Legal President Stephen Miller:

“Jeff Bezos is one the wealthiest men on the planet. But instead of using that vast wealth to protect the essential rights and freedoms of his fellow citizens the company that made Bezos his vast fortune is engaged in an elaborate — and flagrantly illegal — scheme to violate the core civil rights of the American People. This includes providing exclusive and lucrative business partnerships cash bonuses and professional opportunities based solely on skin color. Amazon planned orchestrated and implemented its explicit system of racial preferences and exclusions that tears at the very fabric of our civilization for ours is a nation built on the precipice of equal rights equal justice and full equality under the law. But Amazon has decided it is exempt from these legal and moral mandates: they are grievously mistaken. AFL will do all it can to ensure Amazon is judged harshly by our courts and our history books for the brazen and invidious racial discrimination they have so callously plotted engineered and executed. America First Legal will not yield in the righteous crusade for justice” Stephen Miller said.

It's served her well whether staving off boredom during road trips or giving her a way to game and chat with friends. I'd even go so far as to say that it's helped her manage screen time and even learn a little bit about responsible behavior online (though with the teen years ahead I figure even more lessons await on that front).

But despite all that her time with the Fire HD 10 may be nearing the end. Her elementary school years have ended and that means the toys she associates with that time in her life seem to be getting cycled out. These days she'd much rather spend that precious screen time with her Nintendo Switch or with a hand-me-down MacBook so that she can stream music. The joys of Toca Life Shopkins Run Robbery Bob and whatever other games she's sampled on her Fire tablet are proving ever more fleeting.

Of course Amazon may have just given our family the final push it needs to say farewell to its tablet. Over the weekend we got an email from the retail giant informing us that the cost of our subscription to Amazon Kids Plus is about to go up. Which makes this as good a time as any to bid farewell to both the subscription service and the tablet it supports.

Don't confuse Amazon Kids Plus with Amazon Prime though Amazon hiked up the price of that service earlier this year too.

Don't confuse Amazon Kids Plus with Amazon Prime though Amazon hiked up the price of that service earlier this year too. Amazon Kids Plus is a separate service that gives kids access to books programs educational apps and games on assorted Fire Android iOS and Kindle devices. The content is split up into different age groups and built-in parental controls come as part of the package. I'd say it's a good add-on to pay for if you're thinking of getting a Fire HD tablet for your young'un.

Kids Plus may be separate from Prime but Prime subscribers do pay a lower rate for the service. Of course that doesn't mean Prime members are being spared from Amazon's Kids Plus price hike. Our service is jumping to $4.99 a month up from $2.99. Non-Prime customers see their Kids Plus subscription go to $7.99 from $6.99. The prices go into effect after July 14 the next time you're billed for Amazon Kids Plus.

Yes an extra $2 isn't that much — right up until everyone starts asking for an extra $2.

Amazon would point out that this is the first time Kids Plus prices have gone up since Kids Plus launched a decade ago. And Amazon isn't just raising prices on a whim — the retail giant says the collection of content under the Kids Plus umbrella has grown dramatically with reputable providers like Disney Nickelodeon and PBS Kids. To Amazon's way of thinking it's merely bringing the price of Kids Plus in line with the product you're getting for your subscription.

You could also argue that a $1 to $2 monthly price hike isn't that much in the greater scheme of things especially if it's a product enjoyed by its intended audience. What's an extra $12 to $24 per year amongst friends after all?

The problem with that line of thinking is that a lot of companies are making that argument these days. Yes an extra $2 isn't that much — right up until everyone starts asking for an extra $2. And with prices rising all around us we're being forced to make choices on which price hikes we can afford to absorb and which ones are an increase too much. You can probably guess which way we're leaning with Amazon Kids Plus.

It doesn't help that Amazon is becoming a repeat offender on the rising subscription cost front. Earlier this year Amazon announced that the cost of a Prime membership was going up by $20 — again the only price increase since 2018 Amazon helpfully pointed out. But if you stick with both Prime and Kids Plus that's $44 you're paying to Amazon that you weren't previously.

At the time of the Prime price hike I noted that my family and I wouldn't be renewing our membership. Indeed that's the plan as our Prime membership doesn't flip over to the new rate until later in the year. The Kids Plus price hike is just going to strengthen our resolve — ""I'm twice as quit now"" as Deckard from Blade Runner once observed. We'll be breaking the news to my daughter that the Kids Plus membership is ending sooner than anticipated too.

There's a lesson here even if you're not a subscriber to Amazon Kids Plus or if you're a Prime member who's made their peace with the higher rate Amazon introduced. Anytime the price goes up on something — and believe me in this day and age it probably will — ask yourself whether the service is worth keeping or if that same service is being offered somewhere else for less. You may even ask yourself whether the thing you had been paying for is something you can do without altogether. You may be surprised by the answers you come up with.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYXIybmV3cy5jb20vaG9tZXBhZ2Utc2hvd2Nhc2UvYS1zaW5nbGUtbW90aGVyLXdhcy1jYXJqYWNrZWQtYW5kLWhvc3BpdGFsaXplZC13aGlsZS1kZWxpdmVyaW5nLWFtYXpvbi1wYWNrYWdlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Single mother carjacked run over by own car while delivering Amazon packages,"BALTIMORE — A single mother is hospitalized after sustaining multiple broken bones from a carjacking. The victim was working when a male suspect ran her over with her own car.

It happened around 4 a.m. Saturday morning. The victim was doing Amazon deliveries in Wyman Park going door-to-door to drop off packages.

That's when she was attacked.

""It's so heartbreaking to see my sister like that it's really concerning"" said Tiffany Nicolette sister of the victim.

Woman struck by car during carjacking

During one of her drop offs the 39-year-old heard her car door slam shut. When the delivery driver turned around she saw a man using push start to drive off in her car filled with packages.

But he didn't get far once he realized the keys weren't in the vehicle. He turned around slammed on the gas and hit the Amazon worker.

As she was laying on the ground the robber snatched the car keys from the her belt and drove off with her car and the remaining Amazon deliveries.

The woman is now in the hospital preparing for surgery.

""She has a broken hip broken pelvis broken shoulder few broken ribs and a collapsed lung. It is very sad. I'm upset a person would do this to anyone"" said Nicolette.

Although the incident happened early in the morning neighbors say the commotion quickly woke them up. When they ran outside they found the woman laying on the ground asking for help.

""My initial reaction was fear for the woman. When I went over to talk to her and hold her hand and make sure she was comfortable I put a towel under her head. Her main concern was that she had lost her phone and couldn't contact her daughter. She was in such pain and must have been terrified and it really moved me and that her main concern was her daughter"" said Barbara Rosenthal resident of Wyman Park.

Now the 39-year-old’s family is preparing for a significant amount of hospital bills and emotional trauma as they wait for police to find a suspect.

""These are quiet neighborhoods and people can never be too careful. You can never think oh I'm safe. I live in a nice neighborhood. This only happens in certain neighborhoods that are only tied to the drug trade no they can happen anywhere"" said Nicolette.

Rochester Rd.

Amazon officials are mum saying only as spokesman Austin Stowe did: “There are no updates for launching an Amazon Fresh in Michigan.”

Multiple media outlets have reported the online retail giant has plans for Amazon Fresh outlets in Rochester Hills and Troy in Oakland County Grand Blanc in Genesee County and Shelby Township in Macomb County.

But you won’t find “Amazon Fresh” in any Rochester Hills public-facing planning documents. Instead building permits for 2651 S. Rochester Road simply state “new plan Hampton Village LLC / 2651 S. Rochester Rd.” In some cases permit details available on the city’s website refer to “new grocery store” or “national grocery chain.”

Some permits are for electrical or mechanical work others for interior alterations. The most recent permits visible on the city’s website

June 6: Gallant Building Solutions of Crystal Lake Illinois for installing electrical components and devices.

June 13: Grand Rapids-based Vanguard Fire & Security Systems for installation of a kitchen hood and fire suppression system.

June 20: Shelby Township-based Discover Plumbing owner Jeffrey VanPamel received a permit for new commercial construction plumbing at the future grocery store.

“We do not comment on future road maps” said Stowe the Amazon spokesman.

Company officials also provided links to Amazon job listings. While they are hiring warehouse associates in Pontiac and elsewhere none of the 208 jobs listed on Tuesday were for Michigan-based Amazon Fresh opportunities.

Amazon’s Pontiac Robotics Fulfillment Center opened in September and currently employs just over 3000 people Stowe said. Starting pay is $15.50 an hour.

Rochester Hills Mayor Bryan K. Barnett said he can’t talk about Amazon Fresh in any way adding that some corporations “choose to keep their information close to the vest. I don’t want to make any guess as to any particular company but I’m sure it’s corporate strategic planning.”

From the city’s standpoint he said Best Buy closing at that site “left a significant vacancy in a very popular shopping center.”

Seeing the area revived in any way is good from a purely economic development standpoint he said.

“Having any significant national retail grocery invest in the city is a good thing” he said.

A Yelp! Review page for the Rochester Hills Amazon Fresh store exists for the South Rochester Road address and includes an Amazon toll-free number. That page remains unclaimed.

Company officials announced during this year’s first-quarter report to stockholders that there are 46 Amazon Fresh grocery stores and the number is expected to grow. In 2017 the company bought the grocery chain Whole Foods. Some Amazon Fresh stores are not far from Whole Foods outlets but company officials have not commented on the future of the two brands..

Amazon officials’ second-quarter earnings call will be a webcast at 5:30 p.m. (Eastern) Thursday July 28. Audio and related slides will be online at www.amazon.com/ir for up to three months according to the company’s announcement."

American Airlines destroyed a man's wheelchair and then severely damaged his replacement.

The total value of John Morris's wheelchairs is about $65000.

The airline has apologised but Morris said ""apologies don't solve the problem.""

An American Airlines passenger said the carrier had destroyed his wheelchair and severely damaged his replacement chair less than three weeks later.

On July 9 John Morris's electric wheelchair was dropped by American Airlines staff while being loaded onto a flight from his home airport of Gainesville Florida to Charlotte NC he told Insider.

Its frame which had already sustained damage on a previous American flight was bent the wheel was broken and it was no longer turning on.

Morris an accessible travel consultant and founder of travel blog WheelchairTravel.org accepted that the damage to his $40000 wheelchair was accidental. He was forced to delay his trip while he found a replacement chair.

The airline supplied Morris with two loan chairs. One Morris described as ""not designed for a full-time wheelchair user."" The other was ""probably a decade old and lacking any of the features that I require to prevent issues related to pressure on my body.""

As a result Morris bought a new one costing about $35000 and had to fly to southern Florida to purchase it.

But after flying back to Gainesville with his new chair on July 26 again on American Airlines he realized the new chair had also been damaged.

""The damage is quite significant. It's bent in a lot of places the joystick is loose and won't stay in place there are rips and tears all over the upholstery"" he explained.

Morris 32 said he now struggled to control the chair and had injured himself.

He hoped the airline would cover the cost of the destroyed chair and the repairs needed for the replacement.

In a statement to Insider American Airlines said: ""We extend our sincerest apologies to Mr. Morris for the damage caused to his wheelchair while traveling with us and our team is working to ensure a better experience for his future travels. A member of our team has reached out to address his concerns and apologize.""

An immeasurable burden

Morris 32 said that it was ""heartbreaking"" when a wheelchair was damaged. ""I understood immediately what the next few months were going to look like that I was not going to have the device that grants me mobility and the opportunity to participate in society and go about everything in life that I do"" he said.







""The burden placed on the disabled person with the destruction of their chair can last for months or longer – it is truly immeasurable.""

Morris expected to spend up to 80 hours resolving this ordeal.

In an email to Insider Senator Tammy Duckworth said ""We would never accept airlines breaking the legs of 1 in 65 passengers and yet that is essentially what is happening when 1 out of 65 wheelchairs are being damaged by airlines.

I know from personal experience that when an airline damages a wheelchair it's more than a simple inconvenience—it's a complete loss of mobility and independence. We cannot rest until every airline finally treats our wheelchairs as what they are: complex medical devices not just suitcases to be tossed around.""

Reacting to the airline's apology Morris told Insider that ""apologies don't solve the problem"" and calls for new policies and a ""sustainable solution"" to the frequent mishaps that disabled people repeatedly suffer when flying.

""I'm the top tier of frequent flier in American's loyalty program I'm an Executive Platinum member but I have not had a substantive conversation with anyone with any power at American Airlines"" said Morris who writes about his travels. He wanted a ""seat at the table"" for himself and other disabled people.

Department of Transportation data shows an average of 35.8 wheelchairs are broken or damaged on US flights daily.

At least 95% of the roughly 158000 pilots employed in the United States are men according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""This is a very male-dominated industry"" said Dana Donati a former pilot with Republic Airways.

Donati recalls being one of two females in her college aviation courses and during her early officer training.

At the height of summer travel as airlines brace for a pilot shortage on one side and recent protests from current pilots on the other some airlines are making efforts to attract the next generation of pilots who have been historically excluded from the industry -- women and people of color.

Donati who now serves as the CEO of United Aviate Academy is one of those aviation professionals trying to change the system. Founded by United Airlines the academy is a 12-month program in Phoenix Arizona that aims to diversify the cockpit.

The program offers a 12-month training footprint in which students complete several certificates on private piloting commercial piloting instrument operations and more.

""It's about time the industry looks at how they have historically operated"" added Donati.

The figures are stark -- there are only about 200 Black women pilots in the U.S. accounting for less than 1 percent of the profession according to Sisters of the Skies an organization advocating for Black women pilots.

Flying has traditionally been an ""elitist"" profession according to Theresa Claiborne the first Black woman pilot in the U.S. Air Force and a United Airlines pilot.

""They did not make any provisions. So it's been perpetuated"" said Claiborne who holds the rank of captain the highest rank for commercial pilots.

Claiborne attributes flight costs and generational and economic disadvantages as significant contributors to the lack of pilots of color.

Adding the total costs for an aspiring pilot to obtain all licenses and complete 1500 hours of flight training required by the FAA to become an airline pilot are estimated to cost nearly $100000.

""That's a lot of money. And financial institutions are not jumping at the bit to loan that kind of money to an aviation student"" Claiborne said. ""We don't have these long generations of pilots in the family.""

Other commercial airlines are also pushing efforts toward diversity including Delta Airlines which launched the Delta Propel Career Path Program. The program offers an accelerated path to the flight deck for selected students across 13 universities around the US.

""Delta’s commitment to developing a diverse workforce that is reflective of the communities we serve domestically and around the world is unwavering. This includes removing barriers and broadening recruiting funnels to help create a diverse pipeline for qualified and talented pilots to join us"" a Delta airlines spokesperson told ABC News.

In 2008 JetBlue launched Gateway University the airline's first pilot development program for prospective pilots and aircraft maintenance technicians.

""JetBlue is addressing the uncertainty that prevent many from pursuing their dreams and can very well meet the growing need for aviation professionals while also opening the door to underrepresented communities including women and people of color"" a JetBlue spokesperson added.

Donati said the makeup of pilots hasn't changed in over 20 years. ""It's time that we think differently about how we're approaching our communities and supporting students entering this career"" she said.

Pilot Abby Awosanya sits in the cockpit during pilot training July 6 2022. United Aviate Academy

Eighty percent of the inaugural class of future pilots at United Aviate Academy identify as women or people of color. In that number is Abby Awosanya a 25-year-old first-generation Nigerian-American from Maryland. Awosanya recently obtained her private pilot license and is working to become a 787 captain for United Airlines.

""I probably would have gotten involved in aviation sooner if there was some sort of representation"" Awosanya told ABC News.

After completing her first solo flight in April Awosanya says she's proud to be part of the inaugural class. She says she looks forward to ""changing the way the flight deck looks to better reflect the passengers who are in the cabin.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2FhLWxveWFsdHktcG9pbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is American Airlines Loyalty Points Program Too Generous?,"My dear readers some links on this site pay us referral fees for sending business and sales.

Initially I Didn’t Love Loyalty Points

I wasn’t shy that Loyalty Points put undue stress on flyers looking to earn American Airlines status actually flying the airline. At that time I noted that a new American Airlines flyer would need to spend more than $27000 on American Airlines tickets (excluding taxes and fees) to earn Executive Platinum status the top tier for which requirements are published. In just the last few years mileage and segment requirements shifted to spend initially requiring $10000 spent on airfare in the old Aadvanatage program to earn the status. In the last few years Executive Platinum elite status qualification moved to a revenue requirement of $15000 spent on airfare with a remaining segment requirement. To push that above $27000 during the COVID lockdowns was an absurd notion.

Some might suggest I wouldn’t admit when I am wrong. Here it is for everyone to see I was wrong about Loyalty Points. To be clear it’s not any easier than I stated for a new flyer to American and really for any flyer with American to earn status actually flying on the airline. No I was right about that. I was wrong in my estimation of just how little the airline actually cares about whether customers fly the airline – they solely care about income which has been great news to those who have embraced the new system.

Truly Rewarding Spend

In a post I published a few months ago I highlighted the lucrative opportunities to gain vast amounts of Loyalty Points – which now count toward status – for hotel stays with Rocket Miles. In some cases a single $300 stay was enough to earn entry-level Gold status on American along with enough miles for a domestic roundtrip (usually.)

Some enthusiasts have been even more ambitious and posted that they received the airline’s elusive ConciergeKey status with very little flying activity but high levels of spending in the program. Boarding Area’s own Gary Leff was one such recipient. Matthew covered his reaction to seeing this news yesterday and I don’t really have more to add on that particular instance. Gary wasn’t alone as he pointed out. Other members of AA Loyalty Points Facebook groups were also shocked but delighted to see that the same behavior was rewarded though their spend seemed to be on a wider variety of participating outlets.

The notion that American Airlines would reward spending across the program so long as it benefits the bottom line is something I didn’t properly take into consideration. During an investor call in the past one banker asked if the airline should spin off the frequent flyer program independent of the airline. Management said it felt the two needed each other to work properly together but that highlights just how independent the loyalty program has become and what an important revenue source it is for the airline.

Frankly the move makes a lot of sense. Rewarding customers who earn loyalty points that have a material effect on American’s bottom line is the most logical way to incentivize behavior. Award travel (redeemed from those points) is usually very inexpensive for the airline and allowing those who participate heavily with the program to earn elite qualifying miles in the program as a result of a non-flying transaction of value to American makes a lot of sense. It’s a very honest way to run a loyalty program without the illusion of being a successful profitable airline.

I’ve personally considered making a run for Executive Platinum status this year and haven’t started the process because they seem so easy to obtain why rush? I don’t have to fly American or even member oneworld airlines to be a Loyalty Points guy and hold high status within the program. End-of-the-year mileage runs on partner airlines be damned.

Increased Requirements Coming?

The question that remains in the back of my mind is whether American Airlines increases its requirements for status even higher to fend of swelling elite ranks at the top. Blame it on years of airlines (and hotel chains) changing the rules of the game to their favor – but if anything seems easy in this hobby it usually goes away.

From a math perspective there’s little reason to raise requirements. Customers are responding with lots of financial impact to the company reducing the benefits of those transactions may disincentivize how active customers are.

However if a number of true American Airlines elite travelers who fly on the carrier with regularity are outranked for program perks and crowded out by those exercising their elite choice rewards for international upgrade space American will likely be forced to act.

I’ve focused a lot on the top of the program but the lower levels return even less for the airline in terms of revenue to achieve them. Recent offers from Motley Fool have paid over 9000 Loyalty Points for a $99 transaction. New Verizon Business accounts offered as much as 14000 (halfway to Gold) for a purchase that was even further reduced by American Express offers. I fear the lowest tiers will be the first to see hikes which scares off those that may be new to our hobby.

Conclusion

I was wrong about American Airlines Loyalty Points because I was still stuck thinking that it was an adaptation of the Aadvantage program. Unlike Aadvantage miles earned which only counted toward redeemable miles in the new program members earn points that can be used for redemption as well as status. There are trememndous ways to utilize the program gain status and nearly free travel for purchases customers may already intend to make. However I fear that this will lead to an increase in the program requirements or a reduction in program benefits. I hope that I am wrong about this too.

What do you think? Have you embraced Loyalty Points? Do you think American will adjust the program following the overly generous approach?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vbGVnYWN5LXBvc3RzL2JvZWluZy10by1yZXN1bWUtNzg3LWRlbGl2ZXJpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing Set to Resume Dreamliner Deliveries,"DALLAS - Reports have surfaced that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has informed Boeing that it would approve the company's procedures for validating fixes to each plane before they are delivered to airline customers.

While the decision has not yet been made public by Boeing or the FAA Airways has received confirmation from a reputable source that yesterday (Friday) the FAA approved Boeing’s certification plan for inspections and any rework needed for undelivered 787s to meet the standard to return to delivery. This is one step in the regulatory process.

The next step will be for Boeing to submit documentation that an individual airplane meets the standard and request ticketing.

Boeing would benefit from approval to resume deliveries because it receives a sizable portion of the purchase price of each plane at delivery. About 120 Dreamliner orders from Boeing have not yet been delivered.

Depending on size the Boeing 787 Dreamliner lists for US$248m to US$338M although airlines typically spend much less than that.

Dreamliner Woes

The aircraft has been beset by a number of production challenges since late 2020. Small gaps were discovered between carbon composite panels of the fuselage that year which was when problems with the Boeing 787 first surfaced.

Inspections were initiated as a result and they uncovered issues with a pressurization bulkhead at the front of the aircraft.

Following the discovery that an Italian Boeing supplier had utilized alloys that did not comply with FAA regulations the company also had to replace titanium components including fasteners.

The Dreamliner Backlog

The length of time it will take Boeing to deliver all 120 backlog 787s which were produced in South Carolina and Washington state factories is unknown.

American Airlines (AA) chief financial officer Derek Kerr stated last week on a conference call to discuss quarterly earnings that the carrier anticipates receiving its first two 787s ""in early August"" but won't be adding them to the schedule until November.

If the reports are true the American aerospace company will have overcome a significant regulatory hurdle to get its new 787s into the hands of its customers. The last deliveries of the Dreamliner took place in May 2021.

We've reached out to Boeing for comment. The company states that none of the issues it is addressing have an immediate safety impact on the in-service fleet.

According to the planemaker the 787 is performing well and has been ""the most utilized widebody through the pandemic because of its fuel efficiency; also many airlines used it to carry cargo when passenger traffic was low.""

Boeing CEO David Calhoun stated last month that he was confident the deliveries of the type would resume this summer.

This is a developing story.

United Flight Attendants Are Going to Start Scoring The Airline On How Well it Serves THEM,"Flight attendants at United have found themselves locked in battle with airline management over long telephone hold times. With so many last-minute schedule changes flight attendants are expected to call the airline to acknowledge changes to their rosters and this has resulted in hold times of as long as four hours.

The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) has been pushing United to get those lengthy hold times down but the airline’s head of inflight service John Slater hasn’t been impressed with the union’s campaigning on the issue alleging AFA was making more of the problem than necessary for “political opportunism”.

That criticism hasn’t deterred the union and flight attendants responded by bombarding Slater with letters and emails about how the long hold times were affecting their quality of life.

The point the union has been trying to make is that flight attendants are internal ‘customers’ of the airline and the United branch of AFA claims it’s just plain “common sense that in order to provide a great experience to United passengers those people providing the experience must feel valued and supported.”

So the AFA wants United to measure flight attendant satisfaction in the same way it measures passenger satisfaction.

In recent years United has started to use the Net Promoter Score (NPS) to gauge how happy passengers are with the airline. Across a range of industries NPS has become an incredibly popular tool to measure customer satisfaction and airlines have really embraced NPS as a key measure of success.

If you’ve ever been sent a survey that asked you how likely you were to recommend a company to a friend or family member on a scale of 1 (being least likely) and 10 (being highly likely) then you’ve taken part in an NPS survey.

A score of zero means you definitely wouldn’t recommend United whereas a score of 10 means you definitely would. Passengers who score a 9 or 10 are considered promoters whereas a score of 7-8 is neutral and 0-6 are detractors.

The NPS is then worked out with a simple sum: % Promoters – % Detractors = NPS

The beauty of measuring NPS is that you can try small changes to see what will bring about the biggest improvement. It’s hardly surprising to learn that airlines often report a spike in NPS when passengers have flown on the carrier’s newest aircraft but one change can have a ripple effect that completely changes a passenger’s perception.

Several years ago for example Portuguese flag carrier TAP discovered that passengers rated food and beverage more highly when they flew on WiFi-connected aircraft. The logical explanation was that the addition of inflight WiFi had a ‘halo effect’ on other areas of the passenger experience.

In the case of flight attendants the union is going to start judging how much flight attendants feel valued through its own ‘Flight Attendant Promoter Score’.

Flight attendants will be asked a series of questions such as how much they feel their contributions the airline are valued and whether they feel supported and the results will be compiled into the FPS.

At the end of each week the union will then publicly publish the FPS and over time we’ll be able to see whether internal changes make a big difference to how flight attendants feel about working for United.

The FPS isn’t being supported by United but the union claims making changes to improve the FPS could “make a significant impact on our work environment and have a correlating impact on United’s NPS scores.”"

A map in a state draft plan proposes such stations be located near the Interstate 77/U.S. Route 30 interchange and off the Whipple Avenue NW/Everhard Road NW exit.

The Ohio Department of Transportation using federal money wants to place one EV station every 50 miles along interstate highways. Each station which could charge at least four vehicles at a time would cost anywhere from $600000 to $1.2 million to build.

The Federal Highway Administration has designated all of I-77 in Ohio and Route 30 west of I-77 as alternative fuel corridors where planners would want to build EV charging stations.

At the end of May Ohio had 24502 registered electric vehicles according to DriveOhio's registered alternative fuel vehicles dashboard. Ohio has 8.1 million registered passenger vehicles overall.

Of those 462 were in Stark County 1404 in Summit County 4376 in Franklin County and 2865 in Hamilton County according to the dashboard.

Viewpoint of local officials

Eduardo Molina a traffic engineer for Canton oversaw the installation of two fast chargers on Fulton Road NW and 25th Street NW and two on Tuscarawas Street E between Walnut and Cherry avenues in January 2021. A $300000 grant through American Electric Power funded the installation. Motorists pay a $1 per session and 25 cents per minute of charge.

Molina said in June 18 unique drivers of electric vehicles used the chargers on Tuscarawas Street E for 32 charging sessions in contrast with about 10 charging sessions in March 2021. Many of the motorists live at the Hercules development. The Fulton chargers had 25 charging sessions.

""Do you install the electric chargers first in order to sell the electric vehicles?"" asked Molina the owner of an electric Tesla Model Y. ""Or wait for the vehicles to hit the road and begin investing in an infrastructure? ... The super chargers are definitely going to be needed for people to move from Point A to Point B.""

Plain Township has three chargers installed in December with that AEP grant funding that charge faster than a basic home connection. But not as fast as a fast charger. Eric Haines the township's director of information technology and the owner of a Tesla Model 3 said the chargers for each hour of charge provide enough juice for a 35-mile drive.

Two chargers are by Township Hall in Oakwood Square. A third is in Veterans Park on Schneider Street NE.

The township provided charts that said motorists have used the chargers for about 15 to more than 30 charging sessions each month since March. About eight to 15 unique drivers have used them monthly.

Haines predicts that the cost to buy and operate an electric vehicle will one day be less than the cost of buying and driving a vehicle with the traditional internal combustion engine.

""So we need to build out the electric vehicle infrastructure along our corridors. It's vitally going to be important to those who are traveling"" Haines said.

Where are Ohio's electric vehicle chargers located?

The state chargers can provide enough electricity for an electric vehicle to go 60 to 80 miles for every 20 minutes of charge.

Ohio now has 217 publicly available direct-current fast chargers but only 12 are within a mile of a interstate highway exit and have at least four charging stations according to DriveOhio's draft plan on expanding availability of EV chargers. Only one of the 12 is near I-77 at a Walmart store in Cambridge.

Others are located off Interstate 70 in Columbus and Huber Heights; Interstate 275 in Cincinnati; along the Ohio Turnpike in northwestern Ohio; Interstate 90 in Lorain County and in Mentor; Interstate 76 in Girard; and Interstate 71 in Mansfield.

The state in an initial Phase I wants to add 30 more stations to increase the total to 42 stations that are within 25 miles of 91% of Ohio's population. The state plans to spend any remaining federal funds on opening additional electric vehicle charging stations near interstates and major state routes.

Besides the two possible Stark County locations DriveOhio is looking at building new EV charging stations on interstates in the Cincinnati Dayton Columbus Toledo Cleveland Youngstown near Medina around New Philadelphia and Dover on interstates in between these metropolitan areas and on the boundary between Summit and Portage counties.

The state anticipates that the federal government would cover about 80% of the cost with much of it authorized by the Infrastructure Bill approved by Congress last November. The plan is due to be submitted to the Federal Highway Administration by Monday.

State planners envision the private companies that won bids to build and operate electric charging stations would pay the 20% local match according to the draft plan.

Jeff Dotson the technical director of the Stark Area Transportation Study told local engineers and infrastructure planners about the state plans in a meeting last week of SCATS' policy committee.

Dotson reported to committee members what he heard at a recent ""listening session"" at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland organized by DriveOhio to discuss the state's draft plan. DriveOhio which is part of ODOT is coordinating the state's efforts to seek federal funds to build electric vehicle charging stations.

The state does not plan to operate the stations. It would solicit third-party private entities bid to build and operate them. Motorists would likely pay some kind of fee.

By federal guidelines to be considered accessible to an adequate electrical grid the fast charging stations have to near one or more truck stops one or more retail centers or big-box stores or three or more nearby gas stations and/or convenience stores with high-turnover restaurants.

The chargers would have to be available for the public to use 24 hours a day near restroom facilities with 24-hour customer service and support according to federal guidelines said Luke Steckey a policy and communications managing director for DriveOhio.

Many funding sources

Federal funds from several programs are expected to fund the construction of the stations along interstate highways in Ohio by the end of 2024 and major state routes by 2025 according to the draft plan.

It's not clear if approved when the station in Stark County would be built.

One main allocation would come from $7.5 billion set aside in the Infrastructure Bill to finance building an infrastructure of charging stations to support electric vehicles around the country.

Under the law each state to get funding has to submit a draft plan by Monday to the Federal Highway Administration. If the agency approves Ohio's plan by the Sept. 30 deadline Ohio is set to get $20.7 million a year for five years to help build chargers that would serve 1854 miles of major highways in the state.

The draft plan says the global supply chain may not be able to provide the labor and materials necessary for all 50 states to build EV charging stations.

""The country doesn't have the manufacturing capability to make them (all of the planned electric charging stations)"" said Dotson adding that the Infrastructure Bill requires many components be manufactured in the U.S. ""All 50 states are doing this at once.""

Steckey said crucial electrical equipment and transformers are taking up to 56 weeks to be delivered due to supply chain constraints.

""Anytime we talk about timelines take that with a grain of salt"" he said. ""Maybe we don't have a manufacturer that can satisfy the federal requirements.""

America needs better charging networks,"CNN —

With electric cars people often talk about “range anxiety” and how cars with bigger batteries and longer driving ranges will alleviate that. I just drove an electric car from New York City to Atlanta a distance of about 950 miles and it taught me something important. The problem really isn’t range anxiety. It’s anxiety around finding a convenient and working chargers on America’s still-challenged charging networks.

Back in 2019 I drove a Tesla Model S Long Range from New York City to Atlanta. It was a mostly uneventful trip thanks to Tesla’s nicely organized and well maintained network of fast chargers that can fill the batteries with an 80% charge in a half hour or less. Since then I’ve wanted to try that trip again with an electric car that wasn’t a Tesla one that wouldn’t have Tesla’s unified charging network to rely on.

I got my chance with a Mercedes-Benz EQS 450+ a car that is as close to a direct competitor to the Tesla Model S as any. And while I made it to Atlanta without major incident I encountered glitchy chargers called the charging network’s customer service twice and experienced some serious charging anxiety during a long stretch of the Carolinas.

Long range

The EPA estimated range for the Tesla I drove in 2019 was 370 miles and Tesla’s latest models can go even further.

The EQS 450+ is officially estimated to go 350 miles on a charge but I beat that handily without even trying. When I got into the car its internal displays showed a range estimate of 446 miles. On my trip the car couldn’t stretch its legs quite that far because I was driving almost entirely on highways at fairly high speeds but by my calculations I could have gone between 370 and 390 miles on a charge.

Driving through the Harbor Tunnel near Baltimore. Peter Valdes/CNN

I was going to drive over the George Washington Bridge then down through New Jersey Delaware Virginia then North Carolina and South Carolina. I figured three charging stops would be needed and strictly speaking that was correct. The driving route laid out by the car’s navigation system included three charging stops but the on-board computers tended push things to the limit. At each stop the battery would be drained to a little over 10% or so. (I learned later this is a setting I could adjust to be more conservative if I’d wanted.)

But I’ve driven enough electric cars to have some concerns. I use public chargers fairly often and I know they’re imperfect. Sometimes they aren’t working as well as they should. Sometimes they’re just plain broken. And even if the car’s navigation system is telling you that a charger is “available” that can change at any moment. Someone else can pull into the charging spot just a few seconds before you get there.

I’ve learned to be flexible and not push things to the limit.

On the first day when I planned to drive from New York to Richmond Virginia no charging stop was called for until Spotsylvania Virginia a distance of nearly 300 miles. By that point I had 16% charge left in the car’s batteries which by the car’s own calculation would have taken me another 60 miles.

People need to recharge too

As I sat and worked inside the Spotsylvania Town Centre mall I realized I’d been dumb. I had already stopped twice at rest stops in New Jersey and Delaware. The Delaware stop at the Biden Welcome Center had EV fast chargers. I could have used one even though the car’s navigation didn’t suggest it.

Stopping without charging was a lost opportunity and it cost me time. If I’m going to stop to recharge myself why not recharge the car too?

But that’s the thing though. A car can be designed to go 350 miles or more before needing to park whereas human beings are not. Elementary school math will tell you that at highway speeds that’s nearly six hours of driving all at once. We need bathrooms beverages food and to just get out and move around once in a while. Sure it’s physically possible to sit in a car for longer than that in one go but most people in need of speed will take an airplane and a driver of an EQS with a starting price just north of $100000 can almost certainly afford the ticket.

I stopped for a charge in Virginia but realized I could have stopped sooner. I encountered a lot of other electric cars on the trip including this Hyundai Ioniq 5 charging next to the Mercedes. Peter Valdes/CNN

I vowed not to make that strategic error again. I was going to take back control. On the second day I decided I would choose when I needed to stop and would look for conveniently located fast chargers so both the EQS and I could get refreshed at once. The EQS’s navigation screen pinpointed available charging locations and their maximum charging speeds so if I saw an available charger I could poke on the icon with my finger and add it onto my route.

For my first stop after leaving Richmond I pulled into a rest stop in Hillsborough North Carolina. It was only about 160 miles south from my hotel and I still had half of a full charge.

I sipped coffee and answered some emails while I waited at a counter. I figured I would take as long as I wanted and leave when I was ready with whatever additional electricity the car had gained in that time. In all I was there about 45 minutes but at least 15 minutes of that was used trying to get the charger to work. One of the chargers was simply not working at all and at another one a call to Electrify America customer service – the EV charging company owned by Volkswagen that by coincidence operated all the chargers I used on the trip – I got a successful charging session going at last. (It was unclear what the issue was.)

I recharged myself on some barbecue in North Carolina. Peter Valdes/CNN

That was the last and only time I successfully matched my own need to stop with the car’s. I left with my battery 91% charged and 358 miles of range showing on the display. I would only need to stop once more on way to Atlanta and not for a long time.

Charging deserts

Then I began to notice something. As I drove through North Carolina and then South Carolina the little markers on the map screen indicating available chargers became fewer and fewer. During some fairly long stretches there were none showing at all.

It wasn’t an immediate concern though. The EQS’s navigation wasn’t calling for me to a charge up again until I’d nearly reached the Georgia border. By that point I would have about 11% of my battery charge remaining. But I was getting nervous. Given how far it was between chargers my whole plan of “recharging the car when I recharge myself” had already fallen apart. I had to leave the highway once to find a gas station to use the restroom and buy an iced tea. A while later I stopped for lunch a big plate of “Lexington Style BBQ” with black eyed peas and collard greens in Lexington North Carolina. None of that involved charging because there no chargers around.

So I got back on the highway and I worried. What if there was something wrong with that charger near the border?

Fortunately a charger came into sight on my map while I still had 31% charge remaining. I decided I would protect myself by stopping early. After another call to Electrify America customer service I was able to get a nice high-powered charging session on the second charger I tried. After about an hour I was off again with a nearly full battery.

To play it safe I pulled in for my last charge a little early. Actual charging time after a call to customer service took 21 minutes. Peter Valdes/CNN

I drove the last 150 miles to Atlanta crossing the state line through gorgeous wetlands and stopping at the Georgia Welcome Center with hardly a thought about batteries or charging or range.

But I was driving $105000 Mercedes. What if I’d been driving something that cost less and that while still going farther than a human would want to drive at a stretch wouldn’t go far enough to make that trip as easily. Obviously people do it. One thing that surprised me on this trip compared to the one in 2019 was the variety of fully electric vehicles I saw driving the same highways. There were Chevrolet Bolts Audi E-Trons Porsche Taycans Hyundai Ioniqs Kia EV6s and at least one other Mercedes EQS.

Americans are taking their electric cars out onto the highways.

The package would set aside $369 billion for climate and energy proposals the most ambitious climate action ever taken by Congress and raise an estimated $451 billion in new tax revenue over a decade while cutting federal spending on prescription drugs by $288 billion according to a summary circulated Wednesday evening.

The product of a deal announced by Mr. Manchin and Senator Chuck Schumer Democrat of New York and the majority leader it would reduce the federal deficit by about $300 billion while seeking to push down the cost of health care prescription medicines and electricity.

The plan falls far short of the ambitious domestic policy and tax package President Biden proposed last year but Democrats looking toward midterm elections that are likely to be shaped by voters’ concerns about soaring costs pitched it as a targeted attack on the rapid price increases that have socked American consumers in the wallet this year with inflation running at a 40-year high.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFuLXNheXMtYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtYnJva2UtdHdvLXdoZWVsY2hhaXJzLWluLXRocmVlLXdlZWtzLTIwMjItN9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFuLXNheXMtYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtYnJva2UtdHdvLXdoZWVsY2hhaXJzLWluLXRocmVlLXdlZWtzLTIwMjItNz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disabled man says American Airlines broke 2 wheelchairs in 3 weeks,"John Morris John Morris

American Airlines destroyed a man's wheelchair and then severely damaged his replacement.

The total value of John Morris's wheelchairs is about $65000.

The airline has apologised but Morris said ""apologies don't solve the problem.""

An American Airlines passenger said the carrier had destroyed his wheelchair and severely damaged his replacement chair less than three weeks later.

On July 9 John Morris's electric wheelchair was dropped by American Airlines staff while being loaded onto a flight from his home airport of Gainesville Florida to Charlotte NC he told Insider.

Its frame which had already sustained damage on a previous American flight was bent the wheel was broken and it was no longer turning on.

Morris an accessible travel consultant and founder of travel blog WheelchairTravel.org accepted that the damage to his $40000 wheelchair was accidental. He was forced to delay his trip while he found a replacement chair.

The airline supplied Morris with two loan chairs. One Morris described as ""not designed for a full-time wheelchair user."" The other was ""probably a decade old and lacking any of the features that I require to prevent issues related to pressure on my body.""

As a result Morris bought a new one costing about $35000 and had to fly to southern Florida to purchase it.

But after flying back to Gainesville with his new chair on July 26 again on American Airlines he realized the new chair had also been damaged.

""The damage is quite significant. It's bent in a lot of places the joystick is loose and won't stay in place there are rips and tears all over the upholstery"" he explained.

Morris 32 said he now struggled to control the chair and had injured himself.

He hoped the airline would cover the cost of the destroyed chair and the repairs needed for the replacement.

In a statement to Insider American Airlines said: ""We extend our sincerest apologies to Mr. Morris for the damage caused to his wheelchair while traveling with us and our team is working to ensure a better experience for his future travels. A member of our team has reached out to address his concerns and apologize.""

An immeasurable burden

Morris 32 said that it was ""heartbreaking"" when a wheelchair was damaged. ""I understood immediately what the next few months were going to look like that I was not going to have the device that grants me mobility and the opportunity to participate in society and go about everything in life that I do"" he said.







""The burden placed on the disabled person with the destruction of their chair can last for months or longer – it is truly immeasurable.""

Morris expected to spend up to 80 hours resolving this ordeal.

In an email to Insider Senator Tammy Duckworth said ""We would never accept airlines breaking the legs of 1 in 65 passengers and yet that is essentially what is happening when 1 out of 65 wheelchairs are being damaged by airlines.

I know from personal experience that when an airline damages a wheelchair it's more than a simple inconvenience—it's a complete loss of mobility and independence. We cannot rest until every airline finally treats our wheelchairs as what they are: complex medical devices not just suitcases to be tossed around.""

Reacting to the airline's apology Morris told Insider that ""apologies don't solve the problem"" and calls for new policies and a ""sustainable solution"" to the frequent mishaps that disabled people repeatedly suffer when flying.

""I'm the top tier of frequent flier in American's loyalty program I'm an Executive Platinum member but I have not had a substantive conversation with anyone with any power at American Airlines"" said Morris who writes about his travels. He wanted a ""seat at the table"" for himself and other disabled people.

Department of Transportation data shows an average of 35.8 wheelchairs are broken or damaged on US flights daily.

View the current offers here.

As a longtime member of the editorial team here at The Points Guy it's no surprise that I love credit cards — and aviation.

So when I first learned about the limited-edition card design on the Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card — made (in part) from the metal of a retired Delta 747 — I just knew I had to add this card to my wallet.

Here's why I applied for the card — and why anyone who loves aviation should as well.

The card art

My first trip on the Boeing 747 was back in July 2007. I had been accepted into a summer school program to teach English to young Chinese students in Shenzhen China and our routing involved flights from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to Tokyo's Narita International Airport (NRT) on (now-defunct) Northwest Airlines. I already loved taking to the skies in any plane but boarding that double-decker beauty was incredible.

Since then I've flown a number of additional flights on the venerated ""Queen of the Skies"" — including:

Cathay Pacific from Bali to Hong Kong.

Virgin Atlantic from Manchester England to Orlando.

Lufthansa from Frankfurt to Washington D.C.

I was crushed every time I read about another airline retiring these planes.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

But now I get to carry around a piece of a 747 in my wallet — thanks to the limited-edition art on the Delta Reserve card which was made with 25% recycled metal from the plane.

Earlier this month Delta and American Express released a short video on just how these cards were fabricated and I may (or may not) have watched it a few dozen times.

I may be overly sentimental (and thus a sucker for these things) but just holding the card in my hand feels like I'm reaching back into aviation history.

Note that this limited-edition design is only available through Aug. 3 2022 — and only while supplies last. In fact it was previously available to existing cardmembers but that option has now ended according to Eye of the Flyer.

The welcome offer

Of course it helps that this exciting card design came with an increased welcome offer. If you applied for the card by Aug. 3 you could take home 100000 bonus Delta SkyMiles after you spent $5000 on purchases on your new card in your first three months of card membership (Note: This is no longer available).

The current offer earns 50000 bonus miles and 10000 Medallion® Qualification Miles (MQMs) after you spend $5000 in purchases on your new Card in your first six months of account opening.

This haul is worth $705 based on TPG's most recent valuations this will be a great boost as I look ahead to planning fall travel.

It's true that SkyMiles aren't the most valuable currency for international redemptions in premium classes but I've frequently been able to get a solid value when using my Delta miles for domestic flights and even a WestJet-operated itinerary to Toronto — where 25000 miles offset a ticket priced at over $800.

Plus when it comes to flying around the U.S. it's hard to compete with Delta's superior airport experience and inflight product.

The elite status potential

I'm hoping to use the card to snag elite status — and at least one upgrade to first class. (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Last year Delta announced that all Medallion Qualification Miles earned in 2021 would be rolled over to the 2022 qualification year. And it just so happened that I flew Delta a fair amount last year including flights to Minneapolis and Salt Lake City — the latter as part of an incredible summer trip to Twin Falls Idaho.

This year I added round-trip flights to Seattle plus a business trip to New York putting me at 21651 MQMs as of mid-June.

Fortunately the Delta Reserve card offers status boosts. I can earn 15000 MQMs by spending $30000 on my card in a calendar year (up to four times for a potential of 60000 total MQMs with $120000 in a year). I can't reach all of these spending thresholds but I should be able to get at least one if not both of these:

By spending $30000 by the end of the year I'll earn 15000 MQMs — pushing my total to 36651 MQMs and earning Silver Medallion status.

By spending $60000 by the end of the year I'll earn a total of 30000 MQMs — pushing my total to 51651 MQMs and earning Gold Medallion status.

Note that my Medallion Qualification Dollar number is well short of qualifying but by spending at least $25000 on the card I'll earn an MQD waiver — so that becomes a moot point.

Related: Here's how to earn more Medallion Qualification Dollars by booking Delta partner tickets

The situation becomes a bit more complicated next year as I'd expect Delta to go back to normal rollover MQMs (only for elite members and only for those earned beyond a certain qualification threshold). However I could still earn Silver Medallion status solely by spending $60000 in 2023.

That may not seem like the best target to maximize my spending but there's another potential angle here: Delta lifetime elite status.

In a previous job I was a road warrior and fiercely loyal to Delta (I was actually a charter Diamond Medallion member when that tier first launched in 2010). And as part of writing this article I happened to notice that my Million Miler Qualification number stands at 702828.

As a result if I can combine spending on the Reserve with some semifrequent flying on Delta or its partner airlines I have the potential to earn annual complimentary Silver Medallion status within a handful of years.

The additional perks

I'll have a guest pass for my daughter to access the Sky Club when we next fly Delta. (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Finally I'm excited to utilize some of the additional perks of the Delta Reserve card on my upcoming travels. Two in particular stand out:

Complimentary upgrades : While I work on spending to earn the bonus MQMs (and status) I am now eligible for complimentary upgrades to first class and Comfort+ after all Medallions have cleared. I am aware that this is very rare but given that I plan to use Delta for leisure trips rather than business-heavy routes I'm hoping to have at least one clear. And once I do reach Silver status I'm prioritized above others who don't have the card.

And once I do reach Silver status I'm prioritized above others who don't have the card. Two Sky Club guest passes: The Delta Reserve gets me access to the Sky Club when flying Delta but I also get two guest passes per year. I already enjoyed this privilege by virtue of carrying The Platinum Card® from American Express and my wife is an authorized user on that card and thus gets access in her own right. However I'd have to pay $50 for my daughter to get in. Now I'll have at least two of those guest fees waived — putting $78 back in my pocket.

And if I keep the card open next year (which I plan to do) I'll also receive a companion ticket valid for select fares in first class Comfort+ or economy. This perk by itself could easily offset most if not all of the card's $550 annual fee (see rates and fees) — so I'll be excited when this posts to my account upon renewal.

Bottom line

Call me a sucker for marketing but I was thrilled when I learned about Delta and American Express launching a limited-time card design made in part of metal from a retired Boeing 747. And now that I have the Delta SkyMiles Reserve American Express Card in my wallet I'm even more excited — thanks not only to the aviation history of the card but the welcome bonus and ongoing perks it offers.

Roula Khalaf Editor of the FT selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Leading US credit card lenders are signalling their confidence in the American consumer stepping up marketing efforts to attract new borrowers even as the economy slips into a technical recession.

After rising 47 per cent in the first quarter the volume of paper and digital mail solicitations sent by US credit card issuers increased again in the second quarter according to preliminary data from marketing research firm Competiscan putting it on track to reach a record high this year.

The wave of offers follows an 85 per cent surge last year from the depressed levels of 2020 and comes as many big card issuers said during their second-quarter earnings reports this month that they were increasing marketing spending.

JPMorgan Chase the largest US card issuer highlighted the ferocity of the competition for borrowers when it blamed higher customer acquisition costs for a 45 per cent fall in second-quarter card income.* Capital One the second-largest issuer said its quarterly marketing expenses rose 62 per cent from last year’s levels and pledged to remain aggressive.

“We continue to see opportunities to book accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns and we continue to lean into marketing to drive growth” Capital One chief executive Richard Fairbank said calling the competition “more intense than pre-pandemic levels”.

The increase in marketing activity is particularly noteworthy at this stage of the economic cycle. During uncertain times lenders typically send out fewer card offers — targeting potential borrowers with the highest credit scores — and focus on selling premium cards or making other offers to current customers.

However even as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down the highest inflation rate in more than four decades credit card lenders believe they have room to increase the size of their loan books because unemployment is low and consumer balance sheets appear healthy.

Credit card balances held by the seven largest issuers — JPMorgan Capital One Citigroup Bank of America American Express Discover and Synchrony — rose 13 per cent to $739.8bn compared with last year but remain about 9 per cent lower than they were at the end of 2019.

American Express last week raised its already bullish revenue outlook for the year as it reported higher-than-expected earnings and said its annual marketing spending would come in above its prior guidance of $5bn.

“I don’t see [a recession] in my numbers at all” chief executive Stephen Squeri told Yahoo Finance. “It’s really hard for me to get my head around that in quarter three or quarter four we’re going to have a big slowdown.”

To attract new customers issuers are embracing flashy tactics. Last month Amex rolled out a limited-edition card made from the scrap metal of retired planes. Sign-on bonuses tied to travel have become more generous although consumers so far are showing a preference for cashback cards.

Many of the marketing efforts are targeting so-called “revolvers” or borrowers who carry a balance from month to month instead of paying their statements off in full.

During the first quarter there was a 62 per cent increase in the volume of balance transfer offers that would enable consumers to consolidate debt on to a credit card interest-free for a time Competiscan said. The terms are also getting more generous. The interest-free period rose on average to 16 months this year from 14 months in 2021.

Sara Rathner an analyst at NerdWallet a personal finance website said the combination of growing balances and rising interest rates could land consumers in trouble.

“If you have credit card debt currently or you’re taking on debt for a large upcoming purchase interest rates are high they are getting higher” Rathner said. “It can spiral out of control pretty quickly.”

Complicating the task for lenders is the difficulty that they face in gauging the impact of government stimulus and debt forbearance programmes on consumers over the longer term.

“You have seen a dislocation between what had been very correlated metrics” said Brian Doubles chief executive of Synchrony the largest US store credit card issuer which increased its marketing spending by 18 per cent last quarter in line with pre-pandemic levels. “That’s really because of the effects of the stimulus and the forbearance that comes through.”

Lenders argue that new targeting tools and data analytics have made it easier to lend through a downturn without taking outsized losses.

Many lenders now analyse factors such as education employment history and checking account balances in addition to the traditional credit score to determine creditworthiness which increases the pool of potential borrowers said Megan Cipperly senior director of client services at Competiscan.

Incentives such as rate discounts for setting up automatic payments or making several consecutive on-time payments are also becoming more popular for unsecured loans.

“It reduces their chance of having delinquencies and then it creates a positive customer-lender relationship” Cipperly said. “That’s a great strategy if we’re heading into a recession.”

Usually once a year most major cities will hold a restaurant week showcasing major restaurants throughout the city where you can find great deals to experience the menu. Mastercard has partnered with NYC Restaurant Week to offer a $10 statement credit for every $45 you spend at one of the participating restaurants.

Mastercard’s NYC Restaurant Week Promo

Each restaurant participating in NYC Restaurant week offers a $30 $45 or $60 prix fixe meal. The price of your meal is dependent on the restaurant when you go and what meal you’re eating; be sure to call the restaurant ahead of time to confirm.

Mastercard is offering $10 back on every $45 you spend on an eligible Restaurant Week meal up to 3 separate times. So for example if you spend $45 once and then come back a second time and spend $45 you’d receive a $20 credit however if you spent $90 in 1 meal you’d only receive $10 back. If you’re going to a restaurant offering the $30 meals consider taking another person with you so you can exceed the $45 minimum.

To enroll you need to hold an eligible Mastercard. While the enrollment website doesn’t specify which specific Mastercard credit cards are eligible it’s likely that any major branded Mastercard will be accepted. To enroll your card check out the official enrollment page.

You can redeem the offer for any meal served Monday through Friday however Saturdays are exempt from the program so you won’t receive any statement credit for meals eaten then. Sunday meals may be included but it is up to the restaurant.

It’s worth noting that the prix fixe menu price doesn’t include beverages or tax and tip so you’ll want to account for these on top of the menu price.

This offer expires July 31 2022 so be sure to complete your visit prior to this date.

There are a few other things you should note about NYC Restaurant Week and the Mastercard offer:

While some meals include multiple courses the meals are intended for 1 person so if you come with 2 people you’re expected not to share and will need to order 2 meals.

Some restaurants include a mandatory gratuity in the cost of the meal.

There’s a long list of eligible restaurants and which meals are included so check out the options online.

The final day of the 2022 U.S. National Championships is here. On tap we have the men and women’s 200 IM and 50 freestyle this morning.

Wisconsin’s Beata Nelson and Longhorn Aquatics’ Leah Smith lead the field in the women’s 200 IM with Smith coming off a strong 2nd place finish in the 400 IM earlier. On the men’s side it’s Shaine Casas who had a lifetime best swim in the 100 fly on Thursday to win the event and become the third fastest American man of all-time. Kieran Smith the Tokyo Olympic bronze medalist in the 400 free was seeded 2nd but scratched to focus on the men’s 800 free final tonight.

Polish four-time Olympian Katarzyna Wasick of Team Rebel Aquatics is the top seed in the 50 free followed by two-time U.S. Olympian Abbey Weitzeil. They’re seeded within .08 of each other and have a comfortable cushion of .24 between them and the rest of the pack. Michael Andrew is ranked first in the men’s 50 free by half a second followed by recent 50 back world champion Justin Ress. Andrew finished 4th in the 50 free in Tokyo and this is his second event of the meet. He is coming off a 4th place finish in the 100 breast ‘B’ final last night.

The fastest heats of the men’s 800 free and women’s 1500 free will be contested at finals tonight.

Casas came within .8 of the lifetime best time he posted in April to rank himself as the 7th fastest American of all time in the event. This was a lifetime best swim for House by .06 outdoing the time he swam at the International Team Trials in April. He was the only swimmer to join Casas under the 2:00 mark this morning.

La Mirada’s Kevin Vargas demolished his lifetime best time to earn a spot in the ‘A’ final taking 1.8 seconds off his previous best from the 2020 Olympic Trials Wave II where he placed 21st in the event.

People who have always thought that Republican Matt Gaetz is a lout got their confirmation on July 23 when the Florida Representative for the 1st Congressional district addressed students of the right-wing association 'Turning Point USA ' during a meeting in Tampa. Former president Donald Trump who dreams of making a comeback in 2024 and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis also spoke at the convention. But as Mr. Gaetz preened it was his speech that ""attracted the most attention.""

Mr. Gaetz 40 elected in 2016 in the ""MAGA"" (Make America Great Again) wave was pleased that abortion is no longer a constitutional right. ""Our America is proud to be a pro-life nation"" he said. He then went on to make unflattering remarks about women who showed their hostility to the Supreme Court's decision to leave abortion legislation to the states.

'Nobody wants to impregnate you if you look like a thumb!'

""Why is it that the women with the least likelihood of getting pregnant are the ones most worried about having abortions?"" he asked before turning to the protesters. ""Nobody wants to impregnate you if you look like a thumb!"" Returning to his audience the Congressman continued ""They're like 5'2"" 350 pounds and they're like 'Give me my abortion or I'll get up and march and protest.' (…) A few of 'em need to get up and march. They need to get up and march for like an hour a day swing those arms get the blood pumping maybe mix in a salad.""

The students of Turning Point USA had a good laugh. But not 19-year-old Olivia Julianna a Texas activist who works on political strategy at Gen-Z for Change a coalition of more than 500 creatives on TikTok whose goal is to use the power of the Internet to change minds. Gen Z for Change ('Generation Z' is the name given to the generation of young people born between 1997 and 2010) claims a collective audience of 540 million more than CNN Fox News and MSNBC combined.

Ms. Julianna who has spoken about a lifetime of weight problems reacted on Twitter: ""I'm actually 5'10"" 6'4"" in heels. I wear them so the small men like [Gaetz] are reminded of [their] place."" For good measure the activist mentioned the charge that has dogged Mr. Gaetz since his arrival in Congress. He is currently under federal investigation for sex with an underage girl he allegedly paid to cross state lines.

The Congressman rose to the bait retweeting Olivia's photo with the comment ""Dander raised."" Was he unaware of Gen-Z for Change's digital firepower? The activist immediately declared herself a victim of ""body shaming"" and launched a fundraising campaign in support of abortion rights associations in all 50 American states. She added some further provocation on social networks: ""Am I not a little too old for you Matt? I know you have a thing for targeting teenagers but 19 is on the cusp don't you think?""

SOUTHPORT — An American landmark off the coast of Brunswick County is gaining attention and a donation from a worldwide e-commerce company. Amazon recently put $25000 toward the preservation efforts of the 58-year-old Frying Pan Tower. Once a lightship for the Coast Guard today it provides an outlet for education research and daring entertainment.

Tower owner Richard Neal hopes to raise $1.5 million to continue his mission. Primarily the wind-and-solar-powered tower is used for ecological and environmental exploration in offshore wind marine-life and university research as well as a weather resource for mariners.

FPTower a 501(c)3 has partnered over the years with John Hopkins University MIT the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management and miscellaneous marine biologists for studies on weather shark tagging birds and bat monitoring and wind turbine analysis.

To continuously fund and run the nonprofit Neal takes donations recruits volunteers and sells Black Powder Coffee a small batch craft roaster who designed the blend specifically for Frying Pan Tower. Neal also has branded merchandise and even has branched into ecotourism with Frying Pan offering overnight stays for adventurous travelers.

All the money goes back to its upkeep and maintenance.

“We only need one or two people who would really get behind this and make it so we can very carefully make the modifications and repairs needed things like pipes falling off” Neal said. “So I brazingly jumped out there on the internet to tell people ‘This is what we’re doing.’”

There’s an air of mystery surrounding the Oklahoma native whose career has a rich and varied past. He has dabbled in everything from chemistry and engineering to transportation and electronics to the Alaskan pipeline.

Not really knowing what he was getting into Neal said he purchased the ocean-bound landmark over a decade ago.

Today it’s an ongoing labor of love.

“When you have something you love to do you do have a tendency to dwell on it” Neal said. “I often have to ask my friends ‘Is it OK if I talk about the tower?’”

Sole bidder

Built in 1964 Frying Pan Tower was constructed by the U.S. Coast Guard as a light station to warn passing ships of the rocky shallow Frying Pan Shoals nearby. When the station was abandoned in 1992 the government stopped manning and maintaining it.

In 2009 the tower was sold at an auction to the highest bidder for $515000 site unseen. When the original buyer backed out the government put the tower back up for sale this time through a sealed bid process.

The only one to take the bait was Neal. He offered up $11262 though ended up paying eight times the amount.

“It was the best $85000 I’ve ever spent” he said

The government estimated in 2009 it would take $1.5 million to restore the tower. Neal said the longer he’s out there working on it the more he tends to agree.

To date he has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into it and has received twice that in donations. Though he admitted he “stopped keeping track” about five years ago.

“We’ve done over $500000” Neal estimated toward restorative measures. “If we had $1 million at our disposal we could make physical improvements to the structure. Engineers don’t think it will fall down any time soon but it’s increasingly degrading.”

Since the tower was not maintained for nearly two decades Neal said the structure is rusting in all areas and non-vital pieces have come loose. It has lived through numerous hurricanes and been exposed to saltwater for six decades adding to its vulnerability.

“We don’t need a lighthouse anymore” Neal said. “But we do need advance warning of hurricane conditions or what’s going on with the waves or current temperatures if you’re a mariner.”

The tower has come a long way since it was decommissioned. Today it has a weather station that publishes live information about wave height weather and water temperature and storm warnings for boaters.

The U.S. Coast Guard too uses surveillance installed on top of it to locate divers or boaters in distress. The agency asked Neal to install a permanent phone for emergency situations.

There are only two ways to get to Frying Pan Tower: by boat or helicopter. (Courtesy photo)

Volunteer or vacation

Neal formed the nonprofit FPTower Inc. in late 2020. He divested his ownership of the tower in 2018 to focus on the nonprofit efforts. Today he said many anonymous donors continue backing Frying Pan.

“When you work on something yourself you never stop working” he said. “I started recruiting begging and asking people to come help.”

Neal spends every other week year-round rain or shine at the tower and usually has anywhere from four to eight people helping him. FPTower Inc. asks volunteers who want to take part in its preservation for a recommended donation of $850 to $1500 used toward travel to and from the location as well as for needed materials such as cables paint and equipment.

Volunteers assist with anything from welding wiring to cleaning.

“The biggest problem is people don’t believe they can be out here and be part of it without having a particular skill” Neal said.

But that’s not true he assured. Individuals with disabilities can also be accommodated.

The Frying Pan Tower is outfitted with modern amenities such as internet and with eight bedrooms.

For those who would rather experience the tower but not necessarily do work during a visit Neal rents it out for an “adventure weekend” Friday to Sunday for $1550. All proceeds collected are used toward rehab endeavors.

Vacationers are responsible for their own meals and cleanup. Many amenities are listed including fishing skeet shooting hitting biodegradable golf balls into the ocean playing pool or darts or watching the sunrise and sunset from the helipad which takes up the entire top of the tower.

Neal said the temperate weather makes it a haven for visitors.

“It can be 95 on shore and a nice 82 out here” he explained. “In the winter it can be bone-chilling cold there but a cool 55 degrees here.”

The daring have even been known to take the plunge from the highest elevation — 135 feet above the ocean — into the shark habitat below.

Marine biologists venture out to use the destination for tagging and monitoring sharks which gravitate to the tower.

The sea floor in a 1-mile radius around the site is a protected reef making it a magnet for scuba divers.

Vacationers sign liability release waivers ahead of the trip and Neal kicks off every venture with a safety briefing among visitors.

“You can do stupid things out here and I try to prevent that” he said.

‘It’s incredible and it’s beautiful”

Located 30 miles off the coast there are two ways to reach the tower: by helicopter and boat. Neal makes the trip every other week to go home and see his wife. When he returns it’s to restock and pick up volunteers or visitors along the way.

Helicopters are rented privately and can carry up to three individuals but it’s limited on what it can transport per supplies. It costs FPTower Inc. about $2000 a roundtrip by chopper and $3800 by boat.

The benefit to using a watercraft is that it can carry up to six people as well as more goods and resources. The downside is it’s a longer trip up to eight hours depending on the boat.

Another challenge is the action needed to get onboard the tower from a water vessel. Neal said it’s his job to hoist individuals up on a cable from the boat but first he takes a leap of faith — literally onto a rusty tower ladder.

After traversing up 65 feet of handrails and climbing into the belly of the structure he opens the doors and lowers a hoist device to other passengers who are then individually pulled up to the site.

“And we pull up 4-foot-by-4-foot bags stuffed with goodies gear and supplies” Neal said “And the occasional donated keg of beer.”

Neal confirmed he places orders every few days or weekly. Goods have been traveling to Frying Pan over the last eight years from Raleigh to a regional jetport in Oak Island. A boat captain or helicopter picks up the packages for the final leg of the trip.

“Using Amazon we get it the next day” Neal said.

Frying Pan Tower is considered one of five remote locations to which Amazon delivers.

The company’s $25000 donation will be used to buy more equipment such as upgrading Neal’s underwater shark camera installed about eight years ago. Right now it’s offline due to a cable needing replacement. Anyone can tune in online when it’s functioning.

“A lot of people contact us and say ‘We have it on in the classroom’” he explained. “Just watching the sharks swimming around.”

The self-proclaimed “life learner” said he trained in scuba diving to implement the tower’s underwater tools — the shark camera and weather-measuring buoy both of which provide information to the public.

Neal also will purchase a remote operating vehicle to submerge on the ocean floor to be driven online from anywhere in the world.

“It’s a really great tool” he said. “It can be used for marine biologist researchers and help us educate on marine life.”

He would like to utilize it to compel younger students to gain an interest in science. Growing up in the Midwest Neal said he never understood what ocean life entailed.

“It wasn’t until I started lowering my GoPros down there I learned my God there’s a zoo under here — and it’s incredible and it’s beautiful” he said.

This idea that livestock operators and wildlife can live in harmony with good stewardship practices rings true throughout the West. In Montana using funds from the Sage-Grouse Initiative TNC collaborated with two ranches in the High Divide to provide socio-economic and ecological benefits on over 45000 acres of sagebrush grasslands. And in other communities throughout the Sagebrush Sea there is ongoing work with public and private partners to provide resources to help landowners improve their management practices and restore degraded habitat.

Sometimes development impacts to wildlife habitat can’t be avoided so it's important we work with partners to develop programs to help offset – or mitigate – the impacts by protecting or restoring land in different locations or offering financial compensation for the new disturbance that can be used on restoration protection or land acquisition elsewhere. For example TNC helped design Oregon’s sage-grouse mitigation program to steer energy development away from sensitive breeding areas.

In the American West consensus on land water and wildlife issues is rare. The sheer number of stakeholders with diverse motivations and complex connections to the land makes for a melting pot of opinions and agendas. Yet the plight of the Sagebrush Sea and its importance to rural communities and to wildlife like the greater sage-grouse is a proving a powerful catalyst for unity. Using TNC’s deep West-wide relationships and 70-year track record of land protection we are scoring big on-the-ground wins for people and nature.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMzEvdXMvb2FzaXMtbW9iaWxlLWhvbWUtcGFyay1jb2FjaGVsbGEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When There's Arsenic in the Water but 'We Have Nowhere to Go' (Published 2022),"THERMAL Calif. — Three times a week Pascual Campos Ochoa 26 loads up a duffel bag with a brown fleece blanket and a plastic container of oatmeal. A van picks him up from the dusty trailer park where he lives — where stray dogs wander among the carcasses of old cars and working electricity is not a given — and takes him to a clinic for kidney dialysis.

Mr. Campos Ochoa is the youngest person to require the treatment at the clinic; he has been on dialysis since he was 18 and is waiting for a kidney donor.

Still it was not until recently he said that he considered that his health problems may be tied to the trailer he has shared with his family for 16 years at the Oasis Mobile Home Park — and the water tainted with high levels of arsenic that spewed for years from its aging pipes.

For years people living at the park home to a little more than 1000 residents in about 230 units have suffered from a variety of health problems.

Freshwater lakes and rivers across America may have a deadly parasite lurking in them this summer that rapidly eats away at the brain - and experts warn that if it gets into your nose it has a 97 percent chance of being fatal often within five days of feeling symptoms.

Naegleria fowleri lives in fresh water across the world. It thrives in warmer temperatures of around 115 degrees Fahrenheit which causes cases to usually emerge during the summer months. This means that lakes and rivers around America are at risk of carrying the dangerous organisms. Even splash parks could be a risk: a Texas three-year-old died after being exposed to it at a local splash park last year.

Contaminated water ingested through the nose gives the amoeba a direct route to the brain where it is almost always fatal but swallowing contaminated water causes no harm because stomach acid is strong enough to kill the bacteria a parasitic disease expert told DailyMail.com.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports 154 known cases on infection over the past 60 years - with almost all in southern states that reach scalding temperatures over summer. All but four of those cases resulted in death - a survival rate of only three percent. These cases are clustered in Texas and Florida in particular which have recorded 40 and 36 infections respectively since 1962 when the CDC started tracking cases.

Two cases have been detected already this year including a Missouri man who died after being infected in an Iowa lake and a Florida teen who has been left fighting for his life after swimming in a local river.

After a person is exposed to the amoeba they will likely feel symptoms such as a headache nausea and fatigue within the next one to nine days. Once symptoms begin death will almost always occur within five days.

Dr Anjan Debnath a parasitic disease expert at the University of California San Diego tells DailyMail.com that because of how rare it is doctors also often misdiagnose symptoms as meningitis - wasting valuable time that could be used treating the parasite.

Cases are not only reserved for lakes and rivers either. Improper water treatment in pools private ponds and even tap water can lead to deadly exposure to the amoeba as well - causing multiple deaths among children in recent years.

Debnath a parasitic disease expert at the University of California San Diego said that the amoeba thrives in temperatures of around 115 Fahrenheit meaning it will be most active on the hottest days of summer in states where high temperatures are not uncommon.

He explained that it enters through the nose's olfactory nerve giving it a short and direct route into the brain. If water that contains the amoeba enters the nose then it will likely lead to infection.

Ingesting water through the mouth is ok though because stomach acid is strong enough to kill the amoeba.

Once a person's olfactory nerve is exposed it can take around one to nine days for them to start experiencing symptoms. They will usually die within five days of symptoms first appearing.

Dr Anjan Debnath (pictured) a parasitic disease expert at the University of California San Diego told DailyMail.com that people should avoid swimming in fresh water lakes and rivers this summer and if they do they should use a nose plug to stop water from entering

'It's quite rapid it's very progressive. It literally eats the brain tissue' Debnath explained.

He describes the infection as taking part in two stages. The first is relatively minor with the person experiencing a headache and other flu-like symptoms. This means that unless a doctor is aware that a person had been swimming in untreated water they may not even suspect the amoeba.

Once symptoms reach the second stage a person will start experiencing severe neurological issues like seizures. A doctor will then likely find out about the infection through a spinal fluid test.

By that point a person has likely already experienced symptoms so severe that death is near-guaranteed.

A similar situation occurred with Caleb Ziegelbauer 13 of Port Charlotte Florida.

The teen was swimming in a river near his home on July 1 for a family outing to escape the Florida heat. When he was ill doctors first diagnosed him with meningitis - delaying the time it took for his to get treated for the infection.

Five days later fever struck Caleb and he complained of hallucinations. His parents rushed him to the hospital in Fort Myers where doctors diagnosed him with meningitis in the pediatric intensive care unit.

'Unfortunately it appears that the amoeba Naegleria fowleri is responsible for his illness' Katie Chiet the boy's aunt said on his crowdfunding page.

More than a week after he entered the hospital doctors finally realized that he was suffering from the 97 percent fatal parasite.

'They plan to reintubate him to take some pressure off him breathing so he can focus on just resting and healing his brain' Elizabeth Ziegelbauer wrote on GoFundme.

The inflammation to his brain has gotten progressively worse. Normally the parasite kills its host within 17 days but Caleb has survived 11 days past that.

Caleb Ziegelbauer (pictured) 13 of Port Charlotte Florida is currently fighting for his life hospitalized after suffering an infection from the brain eating amoeba

Ziegelbauer is the second confirmed case of the brain eating amoeba causing an infection in the United States this year.

At the start of the month an unnamed Missouri man was infected while swimming in the lake at Lake of the Three Fires State Park in Iowa. In response health officials shut down the beach.

While these cases are rare with under three being detected per year on average Debnath still advises against swimming in untreated water over summer especially in places like Florida and Texas where temperatures get exceptionally high.

Because the amoeba only resides in fresh water swimming in the ocean is generally safe.

If families do choose to visit a fresh water beach anyone entering the water should wear a nose clip to prevent water from entering their nose.

Debnath also recommends against kicking up dirt or sand from the bottom of the lake as warmer areas deep down are where the microscopic beings usually lie.

Cases are not always spawned out of fresh water lakes and rivers either. In 2020 a six-year-old boy in Texas died after being exposed through the water supply in his home city of Lake Jackson.

Last year a three-year-old child in the state died after being exposed to the brain eating amoeba in a splash park. His family later sued for negligence saying operators should have taken better care to sanitize the water.

A North Carolina child whose age was not revealed died last year after being exposed to an improperly sanitized private pond.

Debnath said that these cases could have been avoided with proper chlorination and sanitation of the sitting water alone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzY2llbmNlLmNvbS80MzY0MS1jb3BwZXJoZWFkLXNuYWtlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Copperhead snakes: Facts bites & babies,"Copperhead snakes are some of the more commonly seen North American snakes. They're also the most likely to bite although their venom is relatively mild and their bites are rarely fatal for humans.

These snakes get their name fittingly from their copper-red heads according to the biology department at Pennsylvania State University. Some other snakes are referred to as copperheads which is a common (nonscientific) name. Water moccasins (cottonmouths) radiated rat snakes Australian copperheads and sharp-nosed pit vipers are all sometimes called copperheads but these are different species from the North American copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix).

Copperheads are pit vipers like rattlesnakes and water moccasins. Pit vipers have ""heat-sensory pits between eye and nostril on each side of head"" which are able to detect minute differences in temperatures so that the snakes can accurately strike the source of heat which is often potential prey. Copperhead ""behavior is very much like that of most other pit vipers"" said herpetologist Jeff Beane collections manager of amphibians and reptiles at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.

What does a copperhead look like?

Copperheads are medium-size snakes averaging between 2 and 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters) in length. According to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park female copperheads are longer than males; however males possess proportionally longer tails.

According to Beane copperhead snake bodies are distinctly patterned. Their ""dorsal pattern is a series of dark chestnut-brown or reddish-brown crossbands each shaped like an hourglass dumbbell or saddlebag … on a background of lighter brown tan salmon or pinkish"" Beane said. He further described the saddlebags as ""wide on sides of body narrow in center of back — the crossbands typically have darker margins and lighter lateral centers."" Meanwhile ""some crossbands may be broken and sometimes small dark spots may be in the spaces between the crossbands.""

Several other nonvenomous species of snakes have similar coloring and so are frequently confused for copperheads. However copperheads are the only kind of snakes with hourglass-shaped markings.

In contrast to its patterned body the snake's coppery-brown head lacks such adornments ""except for a pair of tiny dark dots usually present on top of the head"" said Beane. He described copperheads' bellies as ""whitish yellowish or a light brownish stippled or mottled with brown gray or blackish often large paired dark spots or smudges along sides of [its] belly.""

Copperheads have muscular thick bodies and keeled (ridged) scales. Their heads are ""somewhat triangular/arrow-shaped and distinct from the neck"" with a ""somewhat distinct ridge separating [the] top of head from side snout between eye and nostril"" said Beane. Their pupils are vertical like cats' eyes and their irises are usually orange tan or reddish-brown.

Young copperheads are more grayish in color than adults and possess ""bright yellow or greenish yellow tail tips."" According to Beane ""this color fades in about a year.""

Copperhead bite

Copperheads bite more people in most years than any other U.S. species of snake according to the North Carolina State University Cooperative Extension Service. Fortunately copperhead venom is not very potent.

Unlike most venomous snakes copperheads give no warning signs and strike almost immediately if they feel threatened. Copperheads have hemotoxic venom said Beane which means that a copperhead bite ""often results in temporary tissue damage in the immediate area of bite."" Their bite may be painful but is ""very rarely (almost never) fatal to humans."" Children the elderly and people with compromised immune systems may have strong reactions to the venom however and anyone who is bitten by a copperhead should seek medical attention.

Despite this Beane thinks you should still let a Copperhead snake live in your back yard. He told North Carolina's Blue Ridge Public Radio that ""if you encounter them and they're coiled up somewhere where they want to be they'll remain completely still and hope that you don't see them or bother them... If you do disturb them the first thing they'll probably do is try to get away. If you move them... they're going to try to get back to something that's familiar.""

Bean also talked about the benefits of having a Copperhead near your house: ""They eat a lot of species that we don't like like mice and rats that can cause diseases and problems. And [by] eating a lot of rodents snakes are swallowing a lot of ticks. And ticks cause things like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease. One study showed that snakes are significant tick destroyers in Eastern forest sites.""

Where do copperheads live?

Copperheads reside ""from southern New England to West Texas and northern Mexico"" said Beane advising those interested to check out range maps in a number of field guides.

There are five subspecies of copperhead distributed according to geographic range: the northern northwestern southern and two southwestern subspecies. According to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park the northern copperhead has by far the largest range from Alabama to Massachusetts and Illinois.

According to Beane copperheads are happy in ""an extremely wide range of habitats"" though usually ""at least some semblance of woods or forest habitat is present."" They are ""particularly fond of ecotones"" which are transition areas between two ecological communities. They like rocky wooded areas mountains thickets near streams desert oases canyons and other natural environments according to Penn State; Beane added that they like ""almost any habitat with both sunlight and cover.""

According to the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory copperheads are ""quite tolerant of habitat alteration."" This means that they can survive well in suburban areas. Copperheads can sometimes be found in wood and sawdust piles abandoned farm buildings junkyards and old construction areas. They ""often seek shelter under surface cover such as boards sheet metal logs or large flat rocks"" said Beane.

Behavior

Copperheads are semi-social snakes. While they usually hunt alone they usually hibernate in communal dens and often return to the same den every year. Beane said that populations in the ""montane"" (a forest area below the timberline with large coniferous trees) often spend the winter hibernating ""with timber rattlesnakes rat snakes or other species."" However ""Piedmont and Coastal Plain snakes are more likely to hibernate individually"" Beane said. They also can be seen near one another while basking in the sun drinking eating and courting according to the Smithsonian Zoo.

According to the Ohio Public Library Information Network copperheads are usually out and about during the day in the spring and fall but during the summer they become nocturnal. They especially like being out on humid warm nights after rain. While they usually stay on the ground copperheads will sometimes climb into low bushes or trees in search of prey or to bask in the sun. Sometimes they even voluntarily go swimming.

According to Animal Diversity Web (ADW) a database maintained by the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology scientists have hypothesized that copperheads migrate late in the spring to their summer feeding area then return home in early fall.

What do copperheads eat?

He described copperheads as being ""mobile ambush predators."" Mostly they get their prey by ""sit-and-wait ambush""; however they sometimes do hunt using their heat-sensing pits to find prey.

The ADW explains that when attacking large prey copperheads bite the victim and then release it. They let the venom work and then track down the prey once it has died. The snakes usually hold smaller prey in their mouths until the victim dies. Copperheads eat their food whole using their flexibly hinged jaws to swallow the meal. According to Penn State adult copperheads may eat only 10 or 12 meals per year depending on the size of their dinners.

Reproduction

Copperhead mating season lasts from February to May and from late August to October and it can be a dramatic affair. ""Males may engage in ritual combat (body-shoving contests) when two or more meet in the presence of a receptive female"" said Beane. According to Penn State the snakes that lose rarely challenge again. A female may also fight prospective partners and will always reject males who back down from a fight with her.

Copperheads are ovoviviparous which means that eggs incubate inside the mother's body. Babies are born live. After mating in the spring females will give birth to ""from two to 18 live young in late summer or fall"" said Beane. According to The Maryland Zoo after mating in the fall the female will store sperm and defer fertilization for months until she has finished hibernating. Baby copperheads are born with fangs and venom as potent as an adult's according to the Smithsonian Zoo.

Young copperheads are 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) long and are born with both fangs and venom according to Penn State. They eat mostly insects especially caterpillars.

Beane pointed out that young copperheads may exhibit different hunting patterns than adults. ""Young snakes may sit otherwise motionless flicking their yellow tail tips"" he said. ""This is known as 'caudal luring'; the tail resembles a small caterpillar or other insect and may attract a lizard or frog [to come] within striking range.""

Classification and taxonomy

According to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) the taxonomy of copperheads is:

Kingdom: Animalia Subkingdom: Bilateria Infrakingdom: Deuterostomia Phylum: Chordata Subphylum: Vertebrata Infraphylum: Gnathostomata Superclass: Tetrapoda Class: Reptilia Order: Squamata Suborder: Serpentes Infraorder: Alethinophidia Family: Viperidae Subfamily: Crotalinae Genus & species: Agkistrodon contortrix Subspecies:

Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (Southern copperhead)

Agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus (broad-banded copperhead)

Agkistrodon contortrix mokasen (Northern copperhead)

Agkistrodon contortrix phaeogaster (Osage copperhead)

Agkistrodon contortrix pictigaster (trans-Pecos copperhead)

Research

According to recent research on the US National Library of Medicine snake venom in general is ""recognized as a potential resource of biologically active compounds"" that can be used in cancer treatments. Scientists have found that a chemical in copperhead venom may be helpful in stopping the growth of cancerous tumors. Researchers at the University of Southern California injected the protein contortrostatin from the southern copperhead's venom directly into the mammary glands of mice where human breast cancer cells had been injected two weeks earlier.

The injection of the protein inhibited the growth of the tumor and also slowed the growth of blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients. The venom's protein also impaired the spread of the tumor to the lungs one site where breast cancer spreads effectively.

More facts about copperheads

The length of a copperhead's fangs is related to the length of the snake — the longer the snake the longer the fangs.

When touched copperhead snakes sometimes emit a musk that smells like cucumbers.

The penny is sometimes called a copperhead.

Northern Democrats who opposed the U.S. Civil War were called Copperheads according to the Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association.

AI tools are changing the way we use data and computers in an array of fields from medicine to traffic control. New research shows how we can make AI even more efficient and useful.

The name “artificial intelligence” often stirs the imagination and incites imagery of sentient robots. But the reality is different. Machine learning does not emulate human intelligence. What it does do however is mimic the complex neural pathways that exist in our own brains.

This mimicry is the key to which AI owes its power. But it is power that comes at great cost – both financially and in terms of the energy required to run the machines.

Research coming out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and published in Science is part of a growing subset of AI research focused on AI architecture which is cheaper to build quicker and more energy efficient.

The multidisciplinary team used programmable resistors to produce “analogue deep learning” machines. Just as transistors are the core of digital processors the resistors are built into repeating arrays to create a complex layered network of artificial “neurons” and “synapses”. The machine can achieve complicated tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing.

Humans learn through the weakening and strengthening of the synapses which connect our neurons – the brain cells.

Whereas digital deep learning weakens and strengthens links between artificial neurons through algorithms analogue deep learning occurs through increasing or decreasing the electrical conductance of the resistors.

Increased conductance in the resistors is achieved by pushing more protons into them attracting more electron flow. This is done using a battery-like electrolyte which allows protons to pass but blocks electrons.

“The working mechanism of the device is electrochemical insertion of the smallest ion the proton into an insulating oxide to modulate its electronic conductivity. Because we are working with very thin devices we could accelerate the motion of this ion by using a strong electric field and push these ionic devices to the nanosecond operation regime” says senior author Bilge Yildiz professor in the Nuclear Science and Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering departments at MIT.

Using inorganic phosphosilicate glass (PSG) as the base inorganic compound for the resistors the team found their analogue deep learning device could process information one million times faster than previous attempts. This makes their machine about one million times faster than the firing of our own synapses.

“The action potential in biological cells rises and falls with a timescale of milliseconds since the voltage difference of about 0.1 volt is constrained by the stability of water” says senior author Ju Li professor of materials science and engineering. “Here we apply up to 10 volts across a special solid glass film of nanoscale thickness that conducts protons without permanently damaging it. And the stronger the field the faster the ionic devices.”

The resistor can run for millions of cycles without breaking down thanks to the fact that the protons don’t damage the material.

“The speed certainly was surprising. Normally we would not apply such extreme fields across devices in order to not turn them to ash. But instead protons ended up shuttling at immense speeds across the device stack specifically a million times faster compared to what we had before. And this movement doesn’t damage anything thanks to the small size and low mass of protons” says lead author and MIT postdoc Murat Onen.

“The nanosecond timescale means we are close to the ballistic or even quantum tunnelling regime for the proton under such an extreme field” adds Li.

PSG also makes the device extremely energy efficient and is compatible with silicon fabrication techniques. It also means the device can be integrated into commercial computing hardware.

“With that key insight and the very powerful nanofabrication techniques we have been able to put these pieces together and demonstrate these devices are intrinsically very fast and operate with reasonable voltages” says senior author Jesús A. del Alamo a professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). “This work has really put these devices at a point where they now look really promising for future applications.”

“Once you have an analog processor you will no longer be training networks everyone else is working on. You will be training networks with unprecedented complexities that no one else can afford to and therefore vastly outperform them all. In other words this is not a faster car this is a spacecraft” Onen adds.

Analogue deep learning has two key advantages over its digital cousin.

Onen says computation is performed within the memory device rather than being transferred from memory to the processors.

Analogue processors also perform operations simultaneously rather than needing more time to do new computations.

Now that the effectiveness of the device has been shown the team aims to engineer them for high-volume manufacturing. They also plan to remove factors which limit the voltage required to efficiently the protons.

“The collaboration that we have is going to be essential to innovate in the future. The path forward is still going to be very challenging but at the same time it is very exciting” Professor del Alamo says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8va290YWt1LmNvbS9hbmFsb2d1ZS1wb2NrZXQtamFpbGJyZWFrLWdhbWUtYm95LWFkdmFuY2UtbmludGVuZG8tMTg0OTM1MTIzMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,There It Is: Analogue Pocket Just Got Its Long-Awaited Jailbreak,"Analogue Co.’s Pocket has always turned heads: first for being the most authentic-seeming Game Boy replacement ever announced then for taking an extraordinary length of time to finally come out. But come out it did and it was pretty good. For some its biggest drawback was that it required old increasingly expensive physical cartridges to play games as (for the most part) it couldn’t just load convenient ROM files. The Pocket really needed something the kids call a “jailbreak” at least if it was going to fulfill the fantasy of being the ultimate Game Boy device. Today that jailbreak just slipped in the side door.

A little place-setting: When the Pocket finally shipped last December it had only the most barebones operating system and lacked many of the system’s promised features like save states that backed up your game progress. (Analogue also didn’t release the originally announced Atari Lynx Neo Geo Pocket or TurboGrafx-16 cart adapters.) Early adopters glad as they were to have their uber Game Boys with beautiful retina-quality screens realized it’d be quite some time before the device in their hands was actually finished.

The same was true for would-be developers eager to make the powerful portable do fun new stuff. The Pocket contains two field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) which programmers can reconfigure to closely approximate the hardware of another device. They are wonderful for simulating classic video game systems and hobbyist developers could surely put them to great use perhaps by developing new FPGA cores—meaning software that tells the FPGAs how to configure themselves—to simulate even more consoles. But that feature was delayed too.

Fast forward to today. At 8:01 a.m. PT Analogue finally released a new version of the Pocket’s Analogue OS. Today’s Analogue OS v1.1 beta adds the long-promised “Library” and “Memories” features; the first displays information about games you insert the second is basically save states. The v1.1 beta also finally opens the system up to developers under the moniker “openFPGA.” As an example of what hobbyists can accomplish with the newly unlocked FPGAs Analogue released an openFPGA core that simulates Spacewar! one of the first video games. Neat.

And that was it. A nice and necessary update but it wasn’t the jailbreak many folks’d been hoping for either. See you in another six months! (Actually Analogue being Analogue more likely eight.)

But then.

Some three hours later at 11:23 a.m. a Github account called Spiritualized1997 created less than 24 hours prior uploaded a repository called openFPGA-GBA; one minute later it uploaded another called openFPGA-GB-GBC. Each repository contained a single downloadable file. “To play Game Boy Advance on your Pocket follow these instructions” said the instructions accompanying the GBA repository outlining five steps to install a v1.0.0 Spiritualized1997 GBA core on the Pocket and get it running ROM files. The second repository offered similar instructions but for a core that ran Game Boy and Game Boy Color ROMs.

So to recap: Today Analogue Pocket got the ability to run third-party FPGA cores. Three hours and 22 minutes later the Pocket’s three most popular supported handhelds mysteriously received new third-party FPGA cores that could Do The Thing that everyone’s wanted the Pocket to do since it came out: load games from ROM files stored on a microSD card. Was this…was this finally the jailbreak?

Yes yes it wa s. Or rather the jailbreak’s finally started because today’s two v1.0.0 Nintendo cores are just the first wave of what is clearly going to be a longer more sustained rollout.

So what is happening here? Who is Spiritualized1997 and how the hell did they develop and release GBA and GB/GBC cores for the Analogue Pocket just three or so hours after today’s Analogue OS v1.1 beta release made running such things possible? Why is their account so new?

Most observers’ theory—which to be clear Kotaku cannot confirm—is that Spiritualized1997 is Kevin “Kevtris” Horton a legend in the emulation scene and the FPGA emulation guru behind all of Analogue’s FPGA-based game machines. He’s worked on the Analogue NT mini (which played 8-bit NES games) the Super NT (SNES games) the Mega Sg (Sega Genesis games) and of course the Pocket.

Horton has a history (you’re now thinking of a Dr. Seuss book) of releasing unofficial “jailbreak” firmware for the Analogue Co. consoles he’s helped develop starting back in 2017 when he uploaded the first jailbreak firmware for the NT mini. “The Core Store is officially open for business!” he wrote on the AtariAge forum referring to the potential to make the NT mini run games from a variety of systems when until then it had only played 8-bit Nintendo games loaded off of physical cartridges.



In case that left any doubt he added “Yes this means that it runs ROMs now!”

And that’s how it’s gone for all the Analogue consoles since. Horton (and Analogue) got a little more discreet after the NT mini jailbreak instead releasing the jailbreak firmwares through intermediaries like emulation scene mover-and-shaker SmokeMonster. But folks in the scene with a wink and a nudge understand where these popular hardware-enhancing bits of software really come from. (Prior Analogue consoles have been closed platforms so who else could have made them?)

That’s why many people considered it a given that the Analogue Pocket’s wonderful hardware would itself get liberated to play games from ROM files. It’s been a long eight months but today’s surprise Spiritualized1997 FPGA cores are pretty much exactly what Pocket owners wanted just in a slightly different form than usual—discrete FPGA cores loadable through the Pocket’s new openFPGA feature. That’s made this “jailbreak” seem a little more subtle than usual. It’s not a firmware replacement but alternate cores you run off the microSD card. The end result is the same.



Again this is only the start of a longer jailbreak process that will play out over the coming months. After all Game Boy Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance are just three of the handhelds people want to play on Pocket not to mention folks clamoring for it to support TV-based consoles like Genesis and SNES. The Spiritualized1997 FPGA cores both at a nascent v1.0.0 are also missing a few features enjoyed by the Pocket’s official built-in cores most notably screen filters. These and further enhancements are coming; the missing filters are apparently just because the openFPGA API is still immature.

Spiritualized1997 whoever they may be is also being quite active on Reddit. One user bemoaned the lack of a Sega Game Gear core to which Spiritualized1997 replied “coming soon.” This seemingly supernaturally helpful individual also released an 80MB archive containing 6959 title screen images of Game Boy Game Boy Advance and Game Gear games that are in wouldn’t you know it exactly the special file format that the Pocket’s new “Library” feature expects. So now you know how to make your Library look pretty.

“This is fantastic! Finally the Pocket awakens from its deep slumber” said a Reddit user in response to news of the two new FPGA cores. “I haven’t powered on mine [in] months!”

“Today has been a roller coaster” said another. “Sincerely thanks!”

So while the heavens didn’t part and there was no neon sign flashing “the jailbreak is here!” make no mistake on July 29 2022 the Analogue Pocket finally got the key feature owners have desired since December. But this jailbreak isn’t once and done; this is slow and steady and now that the pump is primed more ROM-friendly cores will come with time. Game Gear first seemingly.

Kotaku reached out to Analogue Co. for comment.

At the end of today’s Analogue OS v1.1 announcement the company tweeted “Analogue does not support or endorse the unauthorized use or distribution of material protected by copyright or other intellectual property rights.”

It was just one day ago that we shared our article about the changes coming to the Analogue Pocket’s firmware.

Check that out here: Analogue Reveals new “openFPGA” For Their Pocket Handheld.

We discussed some of the important details about FPGA technology and the difference between software and hardware “emulating” game play from some of our favorite retro game consoles.

Well as we predicted things just got real exciting for the Analogue Pocket.

So how did we get here?

The Analogue Pocket was launched with the ability to play original Game Boy Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance game cartridges on a hardware setup that would perfectly mimic the performance of original Nintendo hardware.

If you purchased one of Analogue’s adapters you could do the same with Game Gear Neo Geo Pocket Neo Geo Pocket Color and Atari Lynx cartridges as well.

Analogue is always sure to clarify that their device is not designed to offer software emulation and that the use of game ROMs is not an officially supported function.

The Analogue Pocket “emulates” original hardware. It does not emulate game play through software.

It’s an important difference though most users won’t know or care about that.

Well the launch of Analogue’s new software feature openFPGA sooooort of opens the door to something that feels a lot like software emulation (it’s technically not but still).

That didn’t take very long

Typically when a major company is about to launch a product or update they will contact media and influencers and give them the heads up.

That gives folks like us the chance to write our articles about the exciting news and have everything ready to launch at the time and date that the company specifies.

So details about the new features for the Pocket have been known to some of us for a little while.

This includes developers who could create new openFPGA cores for the Analogue Pocket.

News about the Analogue Pocket update was under embargo until July 29 at 8am PDT.

Well it was about three and a half hours later that the Github account Spiritualized1997 launched with two new FPGA cores for the Pocket: openFPGA-GBA and openFPGA-GB-GBC.

Presumably Spiritualized1997 was in the know about the new openFPGA features and had been working on these features for a while now.

What does that all mean?

So yeah within hours of the firmware update the Analogue Pocket can now play ROM files directly from the SD card slot much like some of the Best Retro Handhelds (the ones that focus on retro game emulation).

You can play any one of the Best Gameboy Games Best Gameboy Color Games or Best Gameboy Advance (GBA) Games on the Analogue Pocket without a game cartridge.

And because you are playing those games using FPGA hardware not software emulation those games should theoretically perform identical to original hardware performance.

It’s not like many of us can tell the difference. Game Boy emulation has been pretty much perfect for years now. If it plays it plays.

But what makes this new third-party feature so exciting is that now finally we can play game ROMs on one of the most beautiful handheld consoles that has ever been released.

The Pocket was already insanely beautiful and one of the most desirable consoles on the scene.

That screen alone was reason to prefer it to any other game console you have in your collection.

But the main complaint about the Pocket was that you also had to have a bunch of original game carts.

So as expected the community has delivered the feature that Analogue couldn’t (legally): ROM game play straight from the SD card slot.

What’s next?

It’s just a matter of time before we get Nintendo Super Nintendo and whatever other retro game consoles are compatible with the Analogue Pocket’s button configuration and hardware capabilities.

If you were on the fence about the Analogue Pocket in the past now is the best time to get yourself on the pre-order list or try to get one that is already out in the wild.

The Analogue Pocket just became one of the most beautiful retro game emulators on the market… sort of.

Still hardware level emulation. An important distinction. But the users won’t notice the difference."

Nigeria airlines have increased fares for domestic flights from the Abuja to Lagos to N100000 over the rising cost of aviation fuel and foreign exchange (FX) crisis.

Heritage Times (HT) gathered that Air Peace economy ticket for Sunday at 10:40 a.m. and 7:50 p.m. was priced at N100000 while seats in Max Air flights scheduled for 8:30 a.m. and 9:10 a.m. were priced at N125000 and N130000 respectively.

Also prices for economy tickets in Arik ranged between N80595 and N93452 with Ibom Air’s only available Sunday flight selling its economy ticket for N78000.

The increase in fares may not be unconnected to the multiple challenges in Nigeria’s air travel sector. The aviation industry is faced with a surge in the prices of jet A1 fuel which is significantly affecting operations.

The industry is also battling high cost of facility maintenance caused by constant inflation and the depreciation of the country’s currency.

Earlier in July Nigeria’s oldest airline Aero Contractors temporarily suspended operations due to the scorching impact of skyrocketing price of aviation fuel.

The airline said operations in the past few months had been challenging citing high cost of maintenance skyrocketing fuel prices inflation and forex scarcity as some of the challenges faced by airline operators.

During an emergency meeting with Hadi Sirika minister of aviation on Tuesday the Airline Operators Association of Nigeria (AON) decried that aviation fuel has surged to about N1000 per litre from N180 per litre.

Abdulmunaf Yunusa Sarina president AON said the forex crisis was also a huge burden on the industry.

On his part Sirika said the variables impacting the crises in the aviation sector were beyond the industry’s control and as such “there is no immediate solution”.

He however said the federal government is working to end the hike in aviation fuel prices through the revitalisation of refineries and coming on stream of the Dangote refinery.",,,,,,

That was in large part thanks to the iPhone which generated sales of more than $40bn in the latest quarter.

Yet as the worldwide smartphone market matures the iPhone’s dominant role in Apple’s fortunes is diminishing. Whereas at its peak the device made up two-thirds of the firm’s revenue in the latest quarter its contribution was just under half (see chart). In Apple’s flying-saucer-like headquarters in Cupertino California engineers are working on all manner of gadgets that might one day succeed the smartphone.

The Cupertino giant's intentions were revealed after recruiter Elad Wertheimer posted on LinkedIn that Apple is planning to open a new development site in Jerusalem and is looking for chip engineers. They will participate in Israel-based flagship projects specifically the development of Mac processors.





Apple opened its first site in Israel in Herzliya in 2015 a few years after taking over the Israeli flash-memory startup Anobit . The company also acquired 3D sensing Israeli company PrimeSense in 2013 . There is also an R&D center in Haifa’s Matam high-tech park which welcomed 100 employees who were laid off by Texas Instruments.





Apple's senior vice president of hardware technologies Johny Srouji who is from Haifa played a key part in setting up R&D centers in Israel which employ around 2000 people. Srouji had previously worked at Intel and IBM. He joined Apple in 2008 and was initially tasked with the development of iPhone chips. In 2015 he was given a leadership role and now leads the team that makes chips for Apple products. Some of those team members reside in Israel.





The Israel teams contributed greatly to the development of Apple's first M series processor the M1. The company is currently looking to fill more than 100 positions in Israel.





Apple announced last month that it was expanding its engineering R&D hub in Rawabi Palestine where it currently employs more than 60 engineers. The Palestinian team works with Israeli centers in Herzliya and Haifa.

Do These Before Going on Extreme Activities With Your Apple Smartphone,"iPhone IP ratings are life savers if you know the limit of your device when it comes to dust and water.

LONDON ENGLAND - SEPTEMBER 24: LONDON ENGLAND - SEPTEMBER 24: Apple launches the iPhone 13 in the UK at its Regent Street store on September 24 2021 in London England.

However many users don't know how to read these codes and where to find them.

Since iPhones are considered among the most advanced handsets in the market users tend to bring these devices with them during vacations.

Well who doesn't love capturing images of themselves going on a beach diving or climbing mountains?

In 1976 the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) decided to release the IP (Ingress Protection) rating so that people would know if they were already putting their smartphones in environmental conditions that were too extreme.

How To Check Read iPhone IP Rating?

According to The Wired's latest report it is pretty easy to identify your iPhone's IP rating. First you need to know the code's pattern.

Customers gather as they take part in a class to learn how to use their iPhones at an Apple Store on January 7 2019 in Beijing China. Apple Inc. lowered its revenue guidance last week blaming China's slowing economy and weaker than expected iPhone sales.

Also Read: Apple iPhone 14 Increases Suppliers Ahead of its Launch Says Ming-Chi Kuo! Here's Why

Most of the time the Ingress Rating contains the ""IP"" code which is followed up by two numbers. The first character denotes the device's dust resistance and the last number denotes its water resistance.

But there are some instances when the IP is followed by an X letter or has the last character as an X letter. If you see this it is only dust-resistant or water-resistant.

IEC clarified that the X character doesn't mean that the device failed. It only means that the water or dust rating is absent in the device.

Now here are all the meanings of the numbers on your iPhone's IP rating:

First Digits

0 - No protection against contact and ingress of objects

1 - Any large surface of the body such as the back of the hand but no protection against deliberate contact with a body part (50 mm and larger)

2 - Fingers or similar objects (12.5 mm and larger)

3 - Tools thick wires etc (2.5 mm and larger)

4 - Most wires screws etc (1 mm and larger)

5 - Dust Protected

6 - Dust Tight

Second Digits

0 - Not Protected

1 - Dripping water

2 - Dripping water when tilted up to 15° 3 - Spraying water

4 - Splashing water

5 - Water jets

6 - Powerful water jets

7 - Immersion up to 1m

8 - Immersion beyond 1m

Where To Find Your iPhone's IP Rating?

If you can't find your IP rating on the back of your device or settings then the best you can do is to visit the official Apple Support page.

On this website you will see the models that are water splash and dust resistant. These include the new iPhone 13 iPhone 12 as well as other older models including iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro.

Meanwhile the iPhone 13 in Japan is now more expensive with its price increasing by around 20%.

On the other hand experts provided their predictions on the official iPhone 14 Pro Max release date.

Blade falls off wind turbine in Gloucester

GLOUCESTER -- A blade fell off a wind turbine in Gloucester Sunday morning. It happened at Applied Materials on Dory Road in the Blackburn Industrial Park around 7 a.m. according to a statement from city officials.

The turbine has three blades and is 492 feet tall.

The Gloucester Fire Department set up a 450-foot collapse zone around the turbine as a precaution.

Applied Materials which owns and operates the turbine told the city that multiple inspections of the tower and remaining blades revealed no imminent structural concerns.

The company also said built-in safety mechanisms performed as they should when an issue was detected stopping the turbine. The remaining blades are now locked in place.

No injuries were reported.

The Gloucester Fire Department and Gloucester Mayor Greg Verga confirmed Sunday that a roughly 160-foot blade had fallen from the turbine at Applied Materials on Dory Road in the Blackburn Industrial Park shutting down access to nearby Great Republic Drive.

No injuries were reported and officials said that aside from the structure itself losing a blade no nearby property was damaged.

Applied Materials -- which owns and operates the turbine -- informed the city Sunday that the cause of the failure remains unknown but that there are no imminent structural concerns after multiple inspections of the turbine tower and remaining two blades.

Great Republic Drive was reopened to traffic once the company deemed it safe. An exclusion zone remains in place around the tower though it is entirely on Applied Materials property.

According to city and fire officials Applied Materials reported that it appears from preliminary inspections that built-in safety mechanisms caused the turbine to shut down when an issue was detected and that the safety mechanisms functioned as designed to stop the turbine.

The remaining blades of the turbine have been locked into place and the blades are under far less stress than they are when they're operational the company added.

From her youth until today her life has revolved around social activism.

“It is in my DNA” she says as she tells the recent story of her dropping everything to volunteer on the Polish border to help Ukrainian refugees. “I simply couldn’t sleep at night and felt the need to actively do something.”

“We were taught to take notice of what is happening around us and never turn our back on people in need.” Anthea Kessel

Kessel was born in South Africa and grew up in a Jewish-Zionist home in Sydney. Her mother a teacher and her father an entrepreneur instilled strong family and social values in their three children. “We were taught to take notice of what is happening around us and never turn our back on people in need” shares Kessel. “My father would always say ‘you can always help in some way.’”

Already in seventh grade Kessel set up a school-wide fundraiser to help poverty-stricken African families.

After high school Kessel’s friends went to do a gap-year in Israel. She chose a different path. She went to Japan to teach English. “At the time there were so few English-speaking foreigners in the country so lack of qualifications was not an issue. I was immediately employed to teach executives of major corporations” she laughs.

After traveling to Israel and then through Europe with her friends she returned to Sydney to study law and international relations. She spent a year as an exchange student at Hebrew University. Her dream was to work for the United Nations and to help reduce inequalities at a global level. A conversation with one of her professors opened her eyes to the reality of this work and she changed her path.

Kessel began working in community education and lobbying for the Law Society in Sydney. At the same time she met her future husband Ohad an Israeli from Kibbutz Na’an who was traveling and working in Australia. He continued to India and Kessel decided to join him.

Never one to pass up a volunteer opportunity Kessel began volunteering with Mother Teresa’s organization in Calcutta to help orphaned children. “This was a real turning point for me” says Kessel. “I saw what a difference you can make on a one-to-one level and how meaningful small-scale grassroots volunteering can be.”

Making aliyah

In 2000 at the age of 29 Kessel made aliyah and joined Ohad on Kibbutz Na’an. She was looking for work in the nonprofit sector when she came across an ad for an English marcom position at Applied Materials. “I thought I would apply for this job while looking for my dream job” says Kessel with a smile. “Little did I know that I would work for this wonderful company for over 20 years.”

A FEW months into the job Kessel received an offer from a nonprofit and was ready to leave. Her boss stepped in and asked her what her dream job was. She told him that she wanted to work in social services. “Surprisingly he said that there may be such an opportunity within the company as this type of role existed in other Applied sites” recalls Kessel. “Fortunate for me corporate HQ agreed the role was created and I stayed.”

Kessel is responsible for the development and management of the company’s corporate social responsibility program in Israel as well as external communications. Applied Materials is a Silicon Valley-based global semiconductor industry company that employs over 27000 professionals in 19 countries (with over 2000 employees in Israel).

“Applied Materials is a company with deep seated social values” she says. “I have a lot of freedom to innovate and to work on projects that speak the company’s social pillars of education sustainability basic needs and gender equality. When we choose projects we are in for the long-run which we believe is essential to make a long-lasting impact.”

Ofanim is an organization that Applied Materials has been partnering with for over 15 years. It gives children from the geosocial periphery access to cutting-edge STEM education through mobile science labs that travel from community to community.

“STEM is one of the key economic drivers for Israel’s economy” says Kessel. “It is important for us to give technology learning opportunities to children from underserved areas and to close educational and social gaps.”

Another groundbreaking program was Aroma Applied Café in the company’s Rehovot-based headquarters. Launched in 2003 this community café was a model for employing at-risk youth and helping them to get on track to normative lives.

Over 1500 youth have been employed at the café accompanied by a full-time social worker. Many were tutored by Applied Material’s employees to help them complete their high school studies a condition for joining the program.

“We did not stop in high school. We also provided scholarships for those that continued to higher education” explains Kessel. “There are amazing stories from this project of kids who completely turned their lives around. They write to us all the time and it is wonderful to see that today some are doctors lawyers work in hi-tech small business owners and simply on track to better futures.”

Kessel says that these projects are also beneficial for company employees. It gives them pride in their place of work the opportunity for meaningful contribution to give back and the ability to make a difference.

“As we are a B2B company we are able to choose projects based on real social needs without other considerations such as marketing and PR” she says. “And this is a tremendous benefit. But the need is huge and unfortunately I spend a lot of time having to turn amazing projects down.”

Kessel has three daughters aged 16 13 and 9 and hopes to pass on the values she cherishes to them. “A drop in the ocean seems so inconsequential but it always has ripple effects” she says with a smile. ■

It might seem like sacrilege to those who have been a fan of the team long enough to remember the old Boston Garden which stood just feet away from where the TD Garden of today currently stands.

But completed in 1995 it is now one of the oldest arenas in the league. That in itself isn’t reason enough given the holding company Delaware North that runs it just renovated the arena. But the holding company that runs TD Garden also owns it not the Celtics. And therein lies the reason Boston might want to consider building their own arena.

On top of the convenience of being able to decide when to schedule their games versus other pro sports teams and events it also confers a financial advantage in that they would be the one charging fees to others while taking in a greater share of the door revenue.

While perhaps not as deep-pocketed as some franchises in the league Boston’s ownership group is by no means poor with some members even putting themselves in the hunt to buy expensive European soccer clubs.

Instead they might consider shoring up their crown jewel of sports investment with the same competitive advantages enjoyed by some of the other cornerstone ball clubs in the NBA. Of course the Celtics know their business — but from the outside looking in it seems like a no-brainer.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

(1:02)

Open Extended Reactions

Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft were front and center Sunday in what appeared to be a happy reunion during the live roast of Tom Brady.

But according to two former players who attended the roast the former New England Patriots coach and the longtime team owner also shared some awkward moments offstage.

Julian Edelman and Drew Bledsoe discussed the three-hour roast during the latest episode of Edelman's ""Games with Names"" podcast and described the scene in the green room before the event.

""Preshow we're in the green room -- remember that? Were you in there?"" Edelman asked Bledsoe. ""Bill's opening up. He's having fun he's talking war stories talking rookie skits talking fun s--- doing s--- we know what Bill's all about but it was like amplified because he was excited to see you guys because he doesn't have a job anymore.""

Edelman and Bledsoe said they were both in the green room with Belichick along with former Patriots stars Rob Gronkowski and Randy Moss when Kraft arrived.

""Then Kraft walks in ... Belichick's kind of holding court"" Bledsoe recalled. ""As he's in the middle of the story Kraft walks in and so you guys all go over to say hi to Kraft.""

""The tension in that room though could cut f---ing glass"" Edelman said.

Edelman said he tried to give Belichick a ""head's up"" when he saw Kraft walk into the green room but that Belichick did not pick up on the cue.

""[Kraft] came in and I was like 'Oh s--- there's gonna be some fireworks'"" Edelman said. ""I just walked away. I didn't want to get in there.""

Bledsoe added that Belichick and Kraft did at one point ""break it down and got together for I don't know 10 minutes at least."" But the former Patriots quarterback agreed with Edelman's assessment about the tension in the room saying ""it was very real it was very real.""

Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft drank a shot together on stage with some coaxing from comedian Kevin Hart during the live roast of Tom Brady. Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Netflix

Belichick and Kraft drank a shot together on stage at one point with some coaxing from comedian Kevin Hart during Sunday's made-for-streaming live comedy show on Netflix titled ""The Greatest Roast of All Time.""

Belichick left the Patriots in January after 24 seasons with the team and there has been reported friction between the six-time Super Bowl-winning coach and Kraft over the past couple of years.

As part of an ESPN report published last month that detailed Belichick's departure from the Patriots and his inability to land the Atlanta Falcons' head-coaching job a source said Kraft called Falcons owner Arthur Blank ""to warn him not to trust Bill.""

The Falcons interviewed Belichick twice this offseason for their vacant head-coaching position before ultimately hiring Raheem Morris for the job.

After joking about the event being like a reunion and that ""unlike many family reunions there are some people I am desperately trying to avoid"" Kraft praised Belichick for what the two accomplished.

The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtYmFza2V0YmFsbC9uZXdzL2pvaG4tY2FsaXBhcmktaGl0cy1ncm91bmQtcnVubmluZy1pbi1hcmthbnNhcy1hZnRlci11Z2x5LWZpbmFsLWNoYXB0ZXItYXQta2VudHVja3ktdGhhdC1zdWNrcy_SAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Jzc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlLWJhc2tldGJhbGwvbmV3cy9qb2huLWNhbGlwYXJpLWhpdHMtZ3JvdW5kLXJ1bm5pbmctaW4tYXJrYW5zYXMtYWZ0ZXItdWdseS1maW5hbC1jaGFwdGVyLWF0LWtlbnR1Y2t5LXRoYXQtc3Vja3MvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Calipari hits ground running in Arkansas after ugly final chapter at Kentucky that 'sucks',"FAYETTEVILLE Ark. — The new guy in town regrets the optics. A sterile corner office overlooking Arkansas' Bud Walton Arena is for now a muted tribute to what is about to take place.

""They've got this a little bit like a dentist's office so I apologize"" John Calipari says stepping out from behind an empty desk.

Things will soon be cluttered complicated and all-consuming for the Hogs' new basketball coach — just not today. Coach Cal has his first new job in 15 years. He must meet people reveal the personality that comes up on you like a three-quarter court press. Not all of those people are the much-scrutinized recruits who are populating that empty roster Calipari referred to in his introductory press conference.

Some of them are holy.

""We sleep pig and wake pig"" said Father Jason Sharbaugh who has already spotted Cal on campus at mass. ""It's all the more sweet having Coach in.""

Some of them are tolerated. For now the hall-of-fame coach is sharing a temporary condo with his son Brad near the center of the campus entertainment district Dickson Street.

""They said to me 'It may get a little loud. It's down by the strip' Calipari explained. ""I was there Monday Tuesday Wednesday. No problem. Friday? One place has live music the other has karaoke the other has a DJ.

""The whole room is like shaking from [the noise]. I'm sleeping with ear plugs.""

Some — well one — is a billionaire.

""One of the things Coach Cal does is he out-cares any coach in America"" said John Tyson chairman of Tyson Foods close friend and driving force behind Calipari taking the job. ""If you do it the right way the derivative of that is you might win the national championship.""

That's really what this is all about isn't it? Not just the possibility of a natty the actual documented proof of concept. Calipari has won one among his 855 career victories. His bona fides also include six Final Fours 12 Elite Eights and 15 Sweet 16s.

None of them lately of course but at age 65 Arkansas has become the next podium from which Cal can preach. Yes Calipari has reached retirement age but looks 55 and has more left in the tank than an Escalade. Never one to leave flair on the bench the coach's departure from Kentucky was as shocking as his arrival here was spectacular.

It was both the suddenness — and the destination — that astounded. Arkansas? Hogs everywhere love their hoops.

""I grew up on that action"" said Sharbaugh pastor of University of Arkansas Newman Center Parish. ""I just love the game. Next to Jesus it's the hottest thing in the universe.""

But it's also fair to point out Arkansas' place in the sporting universe. The Razorbacks last won 11 football games in 2011. A few months later coach Bobby Petrino crashed his motorcycle with a woman on board from the staff who was not his wife. Scandal ensued.

Nolan Richardson won Arkansas' last and only basketball championship in 1994. Eric Musselman contributed two Elite Eights in five seasons before leaving last month for … USC.

""You could see that coach Musselman had a desire — if maybe the right job opened up on the West Coast — to go home"" Tyson said.

It's additionally fair then to assert this is the biggest hire in the school's athletic history. Arkansas coaches have come from Kentucky (John Pelphrey played for the Wildcats) and gone to Kentucky (Eddie Sutton) but there has been nothing like this.

The likes of Frank Broyles Sutton and Richardson pretty much made their bones here. Lou Holtz won a conference title but bolted to Minnesota before finding the crest of his career at Notre Dame.

Legends all of them but Calipari comes prepackaged — oozing championship pedigree. He's got the blueprint stored in the synapses somewhere underneath that perfectly quaffed 'do. Just step aside and let him show you. It's expected actually.

""I made the analogy this like you have a worldwide company and it's in New York … and you're being encouraged by another area"" Calipari told CBS Sports. ""So you move the headquarters.""

From CBS Sports' Matt Norlander to Jay Bilas virtually all the game's tastemakers hailed Calipari's move as a multi-level win — for Cal for Arkansas for Kentucky — for college basketball.

All of them got a reset. Of course Cal's move can't be recounted without a reminder that a sizable amount of Big Blue Nation wanted him gone. To that well Calipari can't wait to respond.

""I think some people were happy"" the coach said of his departure from Kentucky. ""[Some were saying] 'We've had this guy 15 years and we've only won 500 games.' [Actually 410] We only won one national title and four Final Fours and eight Elite Eights? What the hell is going on here?'""

The sarcasm might as well be dripping from the ceiling. Calipari then launched into slice-of-life memories from going back to Lexington Kentucky for a day before his exit. Folks were yelling ""We love you."" A couple pulled their car over to wish him well. At Panera ""one of the ladies came from the back in tears to hug me"" Cal said.

And now he is theirs again only here.

""I'm a poor miserable sinner"" Calipari said. ""Please That's who I am. I hope I have a good heart for kids and their families. I'm not a magician and I don't have a magic wand.""

If not he's got rights to the best set of card tricks ever seen.

Regardless Arkansas has proved it is all in. There is already talk of a monster NIL war chest. As of Tuesday the once-depleted Arkansas roster now includes seven scholarship players. Two Kentucky players have transferred to Arkansas — Adou Thiero and Zvonimor Ivišić. FAU transfer Johnell Davis one of the best talents in the portal led the Owls to the 2023 Final Four. Tennessee transfer Jonas Aidoo averaged 11 and 7 for the Vols. 247Sports currently has Calipari's first Arkansas class No. 6 nationally third in the SEC.

Think of what is at stake not only Arkansas' basketball future but Kentucky's basketball brand. What if the Hogs edge past the Wildcats on the national scene at some point with Calipari?

The transition has been swift and impressive. It was made clear by Cal there will be competition at Arkansas for a tight rotation. The Division I maximum is 13 scholarships per team. Who actually plays is another thing.

""I enjoyed coaching last year. I had a ball but that was hard"" Calipari said. ""Then Reed Sheppard decides to become [SEC] Freshman of the Year. I asked him after the season 'How much did you expect to play?' He said 'Ah I thought I'd be carrying water.' Did you expect to leave here after the season? He said 'Coach I expected to be here all four years.' ""

That's a roundabout way of Cal saying he still has it. Sheppard left for the NBA after a year and is projected as a top-10 NBA Draft pick.

""My thought was 'We're going to get this' and we had a good group coming in … "" Calipari continued. ""It wasn't like we were 15-15. But there's an expectation where it's only winning championships and winning that 'ship.

Arkansas fans couldnt wait to meet new basketball coach John Calipari. Getty Images

The Calipari rollout came on a recent rainy Wednesday night at Bud Walton. Calipari looked out of place at his introductory press conference. Watching him wear red Arkansas gear was like watching Derek Jeter in a Padres uniform instead of pinstripes. Some things just need getting used to. This was life-changing in a basketball sense. Ted Owens the 94-year-old former Kansas coach who gave Calipari his first job signaled that by making the trip over from Tulsa Oklahoma.

The only thing missing was Cal's first public calling of the hogs. That's coming too and will be a major event in these parts.

""It gave [fans] a chance to really thump their chests and say 'Hey we got a blue blood's head coach to come to our university and coach our men's basketball team'"" Arkansas AD Hunter Yurachek said.

An athletic department whose budget was 10th among 14 SEC teams last year has a modern superstar on the bench. A state of only 3 million people is hungry to rally around a gregarious legend from Moon Township Pennsylvania who was once fired by the New Jersey Nets.

""I'm not going to try to get spiritual"" Calipari said. Then of course he did.

""Something nudges you and you don't know what it is"" the coach continued. ""But I've been there [at Kentucky] 15 years. Maybe it's 'You've done what I needed you to do there for the kids for the state. Now I need you to do something down there [at Arkansas].' ""

The earth-bound driving force behind the hire certainly doesn't want to be considered the driving force behind the hire. Tyson 70 is certainly the basketball patriarch of this endeavor. Yes he is the money man of many things in Arkansas. This one happens to be personal.

This is Tyson's second run at Calipari. While Calipari was at Memphis in 2007 Tyson and Broyles reached out. Calipari couldn't make himself leave his players — especially Derrick Rose — back then. Memphis then played for a national championship in 2008.

""I think we were close [to getting him] but that's when Cal said 'I'm committed to my kids' Tyson said. ""Back then kids couldn't move. Nowadays kids can move.""

Which kind of explains the game the climate and the reason for the move.

Neither Calipari nor Tyson can remember the circumstances of their first meeting two decades ago. They bonded over talk of leadership. Tyson oversees a global food company headquartered in Springdale Arkansas that is second nationally in the processing of chicken beef and pork. He reminisces lovingly about his late father Don who admired Harry Truman so much his office is built in an oval shape for two reasons.

That imitates both Truman's Oval Office and the shape of eggs laid by chickens that are so important to the company.

Calipari specializes in shaping 18-year-olds into champions for the one of the biggest brands in college basketball. His players have signed NBA contracts worth more than $4 billion.

That should be relatable to any CEO — or recruit. When Kentucky came to town Calipari would go out of his way to have Tyson at his courtside seat. Never mind Tyson being a huge Arkansas benefactor.

""He's my friend first"" he said of Calipari.

They call each other youthful nicknames of endearment — Johnny. That's why when Tyson said it's fair to say things had gotten stale between the two parties at Kentucky it means something.

""I talk to my folks around here. There are cycles"" Tyson said. 'Don't tell me you're going to retire at 65. There are business cycles. When we get to the end of the cycle do you want to sign up for another cycle?' ""

You don't have to be dunked on to get the connection. Cal has signed up for another cycle at Arkansas. And stale has different definitions. Calipari once consulted former Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall who lasted 13 years in the Big Blue maelstrom.

""I stayed three years too many"" Calipari quoted Hall as telling him.

Cal stayed at Kentucky two years beyond that. At the end of last season Tyson estimated there were three options for his friend – stay with the Wildcats chase a championship elsewhere or go do TV.

""But he's a competitor"" Tyson said.

""Last year revived me. I had so much fun with those kids and they celebrated each other"" Calipari said. ""The way it ended … I'll just say sucks.""

The first-round loss to Oakland marked the third straight year UK finished short of the Sweet 16. The last time that happened was 2006-2008 under Tubby Smith and Billy Gillespie.

The Arkansas' hiring process took less than three days. On April 4 Yurachek was in Phoenix for the Final Four. About 1 pm PT Musselman informed the AD he was taking the USC job.

Tyson first called his coaching friend to ask if he'd speak to Yurachek about vetting candidates. Yurachek called Calipari that night.

At some point Yurachek cut to the chase and asked Calipari if he was interested.

""In my judgment as a businessman either you go big [or not]"" Tyson said. ""When we were talking big I threw out three names. I said 'Do you call Bill Self? Do you call Danny Hurley or do you call Coach Cal?

'Or do you [hire] Chris Beard Jerome Tang. In the business world you call that a lateral move. You go get somebody who knows how to do the business. You're probably going to have to pay them a little more.""

It wasn't until Yurachek and Calipari talked that they found out they were in the same city for unrelated reasons. Cal was in Phoenix for an NABC meeting. (He is the current president of the coaches' organization.) Yurachek was also there for a meeting as a member of the College Football Playoff selection committee.

Calipari said any face-to-face meeting would have to happen quickly.

Tyson then told Yurachek he'd better have a plan. That is aligning the support and resources of the university to make such a hire. In other words John Calipari doesn't have to interview for the job. He just has to want it.

""Swing big … who would you hire?"" Tyson emphasized. ""Coach Cal of course.""

The two sides connected. Calipari vetted Yurachek with Houston coach Kelvin Sampson who had worked under Yurachek the former Cougars' AD.

Cal didn't want the news to leak that he had been talking to Arkansas stealing the spotlight from the Final Four. Then of course it leaked.

""I'm not mad about it"" Calipari said ""but it wasn't me and then it was like an avalanche.""

Speculation and anticipation ran wild. By that Saturday night an oral agreement was close. Only a tight circle knew – Yurachek Calipari Cal's lawyer Tom Mars and an Arkansas board member. That in itself was unique. Yurachek had once been named in a lawsuit filed by Mars who was representing former football coach Bret Bielema against the Arkansas Razorback Foundation.

""Hunter was a real pro. He was hands-on. I guess he forgave me for all the horrible things I said about him in the Bielema lawsuit"" Mars joked.

Attorney Matt McCoy who oversees athletic department legal affairs was looped in.

""We just kept at it and got the contract finished Monday night"" said a source involved in the talks. ""A land-speed record.""

It helped that Cal didn't have an agent a rarity for someone of his stature. An agent would have taken approximately $1.225 million of the $35 million Calipari is earning over those five years in fees. An agent would have possibly extended the negotiations by weeks.

Arkansas was indeed all in. The basketball world — no American sports — gasped. Dickson Street had a new inhabitant.

In the middle of the interview in that sterile office a familiar face ducked in the doorway.

""You good?"" he said.

It was not some assistant doing a preplanned drop by to make sure the interview didn't run too long. This was Brad Calipari that 27-year-old coaches' son and roommate who has moved over from the staff at Vanderbilt.

John Calipari indeed was good. For now.

""His mom is telling him to check on me every 30 minutes to see if I'm still alive"" the coach said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vU3BvcnRzL3dpcmVTdG9yeS9oYWxsLWZhbWUtZGVmZW5zaXZlLWJhY2stamltbXktam9obnNvbi1kZWFkLWFnZS0xMTAwODMwMjTSAWVodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9TcG9ydHMvd2lyZVN0b3J5L2hhbGwtZmFtZS1kZWZlbnNpdmUtYmFjay1qaW1teS1qb2huc29uLWRlYWQtYWdlLTExMDA4MzAyNA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hall of Fame defensive back Jimmy Johnson dead at age 86,"Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Jimmy Johnson a three-time All-Pro and member of the All-Decade Team of the 1970s has died

Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Jimmy Johnson a three-time All-Pro and member of the All-Decade Team of the 1970s has died. He was 86.

Johnson's family told the Pro Football Hall of Fame that he died on Wednesday night at home in the San Francisco area after a lengthy illness.

Johnson inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1994 played his entire 16-year pro career with San Francisco. He appeared in 213 games more than any other 49ers player at the time of his retirement.

“Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented” Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said. “The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs. Once he settled in at left cornerback he flourished. The notion that a ‘lockdown’ cornerback could cut the field in half for the opposition was true with Jimmy. Only rarely would other teams’ quarterbacks even look his direction and more often than not regretted the decision if they challenged him.”

The 49ers drafted Johnson sixth overall in 1961 out of UCLA — the Chargers of the upstart AFL took him in the fourth round of that league’s draft — and he became a starter almost immediately as a cornerback. He had five interceptions as a rookie.

But he was so versatile that the Niners used Johnson on offense in 1962 when he made 34 receptions for 627 yards and scored four touchdowns.

Preventing opponents from compiling such stats was his forte however and by 1964 Johnson was a fixture on the corner. He remained there until retiring after the 1976 season totaling 47 interceptions returning two for scores and earning a reputation as a stingy cover man with a nose for the ball.

“Jimmy embodied the essence of what it meant to be a 49er"" the team said in a statement. “He was the ultimate gentleman and will be remembered for his humility kindness and loveable demeanor.”

In 1971 in the midst of a three-year run as an All-Pro Johnson won the George Halas Award for courageous play.

“You have to be worked on cornered in and cornered out to become as good as you can be” Johnson said when he entered the Hall of Fame. “So actually I feel standing here today that I never reached that level I never reached as good a player as I could be. But thanks to God and inner talent I was able to present a picture to those individuals who were voting for the Hall of Fame and my longevity and the level of game that I played from my rookie season to my last. That on this wondrous year of 1994 I’ve been given the opportunity the glorious opportunity to become a member of the most wonderful society: The Hall of Fame.”

It reached the point when Johnson was at his peak that opponents rarely threw his way. He was Deion Sanders long before “Prime Time” hit the NFL.

“Jim doesn’t receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible” San Francisco quarterback John Brodie once said. “Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they’ll tell you they call few pass patterns in Jimmy’s area. The only reason Johnson doesn’t lead the league in interceptions is he doesn’t get the chance.”

Former 49ers coach Dick Nolan once said Johnson was a better cornerback than two of his other players (Hall of Famer) Mel Renfro and (two-time All-Pro) Cornell Green with the Cowboys.

The brother of Olympic decathlon champion Rafer Johnson Jimmy Johnson played two ways at UCLA. He was a wingback on offense and a defensive back while also competing in track as a hurdler and broad jumper.

His brother was Johnson’s presenter for enshrinement in the Canton Ohio hall.

“Rafer Johnson is in fact my hero and that is an amazing thing in itself” Jimmy Johnson said that day. “Most young men growing up usually have a hero in another town another city another country and they will write to this individual receive an autographed photo and then tack that photo up on the wall and worship that photo play for that photo and get inspiration from that photo. No such problem for me.

“I had a brother living with me on a day-to-day basis that I was able to talk to ask the pertinent questions get the pertinent feedback and get corrected in my direction if needed. I must say I must give brother Rafer credit for everything that I have accomplished in the field of athletics. And I just wish that we could split this trophy this bust of myself right down the middle because he surely deserves half of it.”

Methane gas is a fossil fuel that pollutes our air and poses risks to public health. But you wouldn’t know it from the way the gas industry portrays it.

What most people call “natural” gas is actually primarily made up of methane a short-lived but super-potent greenhouse gas. Over the first 20 years after it’s released into the atmosphere methane causes 80 times the climate-warming harm of carbon dioxide.

When natural gas is extracted from the ground and transported through pipelines  it releases climate-heating methane into the air. Then when it is burned natural gas releases even more global warming pollution into our air in the form of carbon dioxide.

Methane is responsible for nearly half of global warming to date. Not only does methane gas use threaten to destabilize our planet’s climate system but burning gas in the home can also be damaging to our health. Cooking with gas for example can produce air pollution levels indoors that would exceed outdoor standards.

Sadly most Americans are not fully aware of the dangers associated with burning methane gas to heat our homes and cook our food. One of the reasons for that is that utility companies have greenwashed natural gas to make it appear safer and cleaner than it really is. Here are ten examples of how gas companies use misleading language to advertise gas to consumers.

‘Clean’ gas

Some utilities tell their customers that gas is a ‘clean’ fuel. They claim this because burning gas is cleaner when compared to burning coal. This reasoning fails to account for all the ways that gas pollutes at every stage of its life cycle. When it comes to global warming methane pipeline leaks mean that gas can have a similar climate impact compared to coal over the short term. A new study from the Harvard T. Chan School of Public Health found that the gas we burn in our homes contains many health-damaging air pollutants and the impacts that fracking for gas has had on our nation’s waterways and natural landscapes is anything but clean.

Gas companies like Philadelphia Gas Works in Pennsylvania describe gas as the “most sustainable energy choice” because it’s the “cleanest” fossil fuel. A truly clean source of energy is one that doesn’t pollute our air at all. Gas companies like this one ignore truly clean energy options like solar wind and geothermal power.

‘Safe’ gas

Utilities work hard to disguise the dangers of gas. For example Xcel Energy in Colorado describes gas as a “safe” form of energy when in reality gas is prone to disaster. Methane gas is highly explosive putting communities at risk. Unfortunately gas leaks and pipeline incidents occur more often than you’d think leading to death and injury. In fact we know that 2595 gas pipeline incidents occurred from 2010 to 2021 – and those are just the leaks that were reported to the federal government. The total number is much higher. Reliance on gas puts public health and safety at risk but Xcel would lead you to believe otherwise.

‘Renewable’ gas

“Renewable natural gas” (RNG) is what the industry calls biomethane a climate-warming pollutant. RNG is created by capturing waste methane from landfills manure and sewage. While that means it does reduce emissions compared to traditional methane gas when it’s burned biomethane still emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere just like regular gas. And there isn’t even close to enough of it to keep up with our current demand for methane. Still companies like Nicor Gas in Illinois say that “renewable natural gas” is an option that benefits the environment. The sun that powers our solar panels and the wind that turns turbines are abundant truly renewable resources.

‘Net-zero’ gas

To reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions we must stop using fossil fuels for energy. Atmos Energy in Texas for example touts their ability to build “zero net energy” homes as “a part of the solution to achieve our low carbon energy future.” Directly burning gas in buildings and other fossil fuels in the home is a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions. To actually get to a net-zero emission home would require installation of electric technologies powered by renewable energy. A true clean energy home would use a mix of electric space and water heating and electric appliances powered by the sun and wind resulting in zero emissions.

‘Non-toxic’ gas

A New Jersey gas company PSEG claims that if natural gas is inhaled in small amounts it is not harmful or poisonous to humans. But even if it’s true that it isn’t harmful in small amounts that’s not how this plays out in real life because cooking with gas without ventilation can produce air pollution levels indoors that would exceed outdoor standards. That means that doing something as simple and innocuous as making a meal can release pollutants into our homes that some studies show lead to the development of asthma especially in children and may worsen symptoms for those with preexisting respiratory illnesses. One report compared the effects of using an unvented gas stove around kids to those of second-hand smoke exposure.

‘Organic’ gas sources

Gas companies often use misleading language to disguise the harm that their products do to the environment. Utilities like PG&E in California describe their biomethane as a fuel that comes from “non-hazardous” and “organic” sources. These words have positive connotations with consumers that may cause them to overlook the damage that biomethane combustion causes. The use of this language masks the fact that biomethane is still methane which leaks often and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere during combustion and warms our planet. Using words that deceive customers about supposed environmental benefits is called greenwashing – and PG&E is guilty of it.

Using gas to meet our climate goals

In the United States President Joe Biden has set a goal of 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030. Many other states and localities have committed to 100% renewable energy. Gas companies like Washington Gas which serves Washington D.C. and the state of Maryland claim “natural gas is a foundational fuel that can help us achieve our climate goals.” This contradicts a new study from Princeton University that found that for the U.S. to reach net zero emissions by 2050 (which is necessary to prevent the worst effects of climate change) methane gas production would need to decline by up to 90%. Methane gas cannot continue to be a “foundational fuel” if we need to reduce production to that extent and instead we need to focus on powering our homes and buildings with clean electricity.

More efficient than electrification

Advances in electric technologies have made them much more efficient than their fossil fuel counterparts. Electric technologies like heat pumps heat pump water heaters and induction stoves are efficient options to replace fossil fuel powered appliances in the home. Yet the Texas Gas Service website claims that gas excels at efficiency. In reality electric technologies powered by the sun and wind can be much more efficient than those using natural gas. For example an electric heat pump produces 3-6 times as much heat per unit of energy as a gas furnace. A sustainable future lies in electricity from renewable energy sources not fossil fuels.

Methane gas vehicles as clean transportation

Gas companies would like you to believe that transportation requires burning fossil fuels. In Maryland Washington Gas markets compressed natural gas as a clean alternative to gasoline and diesel claiming the emissions “dissipate seamlessly into the air”. But compressed natural gas vehicles still emit climate pollution that warms our planet. The company fails to mention even cleaner transportation options – such as electric vehicles. Cars that run on electricity have zero tailpipe emissions making them essential to reducing emissions in the transportation sector.

Gas propaganda in children’s coloring books

Perhaps the most insidious marketing strategy that gas companies use is directed at children. NW Natural in Portland Oregon sends free activity booklets to schools that praise the benefits of natural gas. Within these books the company refers to natural gas as a “clean” transportation fuel. What the book doesn’t mention is that cleaner forms of transportation exist – for example electric buses that do not emit harmful emissions. Gas companies know that children are the next generation of consumers and are trying to influence how kids perceive gas through childhood education. NW Natural is not alone. Evrersource in Massachusetts has provided similar books to schools and Xcel in Colorado has similar downloadable classroom materials.

Americans are increasingly concerned about climate change and they deserve the facts about the impacts of gas when they are making their energy choices. It’s time gas companies stopped greenwashing methane gas.

Some of this information can be extracted from the speaker’s voice and it may be particularly relevant for interpreting the message as it projects speaker-related characteristics such as their identity age gender and emotional state. Existing evidence suggests that this information can directly modulate sentence processing. For example listener’s expectations about the speaker’s language can help decode the speech signal and predict upcoming information (see for general discussion4 and for example of predictive processing5). Yet although many studies examined different psycho- and neurolinguistic processes underpinning language comprehension little is known about the involvement of speaker-related features during this process.

The speaker’s voice provides the listener with a quick and reliable source of information that can facilitate sentence comprehension6. Among key characteristics which can be identified from the speaker’s voice is their apparent gender789101112. Voice gender is known to be processed by distributed brain networks; for instance Junger et al.9 registered voice gender processing correlates in cingulate cortex and bilateral inferior frontal gyri with activation particularly increased for opposite sex in fronto-temporal regions relatively early. This result suggests that when comprehending the message the listener takes into consideration both their own and the speaker’s gender at the first stages of voice processing. Furthermore many languages mark the grammatical gender explicitly adding another source of gender information and further complicating the interplay between these factors. Attempts to investigate how the listener integrates gender information from these different sources have shown for example that listeners process sentences faster when the grammatical gender is congruent with their own gender13 resulting in shorter reaction times in congruent conditions. An ERP study of semantically gendered words also showed an early response—an enhanced mismatch negativity (MMN)—to words whose semantic gender matched the gender of the speaker14 presumably reflecting facilitated activation of the underlying memory traces. Furthermore an interaction between the speaker’s and the listener’s genders during sentence comprehension was documented as an early (at around 150–250 ms) increase of the MMN amplitude in listeners presented with opposite gender voices compared to gender-matching stimuli14.

Other ERP studies have reported diverse neurophysiological responses to inconsistencies between the message meaning and the speaker’s representation typically manifest as a modulation of the N400 and/or P600 components151617. Different patterns of ERP results reported in these studies are likely related to the nature of the mismatch manipulations used. For instance whereas the P600 component is typically associated with a reanalysis/repair of syntactic incongruences and grammatical violations18 in experiments modulating the speaker’s voice it can also be elicited by the violations of the stereotypical noun roles in the absence of grammatical incongruencies as such (e.g. “face powder” or “fight club” produced by male and female voices respectively16) as well as the general assumptions based on the pronoun processing during sentence comprehension19. In contrast the semantically-related N400 effect has been typically found for the semantic-pragmatic incongruences (e.g. “I am going to the night club” by child’s voice17).

Interestingly these ERP effects offer support to two models of pragmatic language comprehension—the standard two-step model and the one-step model. The two-step model claims that listeners compute meaning first in isolation and that the communicative context is considered at the second stage (speaker’s information in particular1620) as reflected in the late P600 responses. More recent findings showed however that this pragmatic (extralinguistic) integration is likely happening in a single-step manner already during semantic processing as reflected in the N400 effect1721. Nevertheless other studies also reported the overlap of both processing stages showing an N400 effect elicited by expectation error and a late P600 effect for overall reanalysis of this expectation22.

Understanding how gender information is integrated by the listeners is particularly important when one considers the differences in how different languages signal grammatical gender. In some languages such as in English Finnish or Mandarin overt grammatical gender marking is almost completely absent. Many other languages such as Slavic languages explicitly mark grammatical gender in nouns verbs and adjectives often in a complicated interdependent manner. Russian is one of such languages offering an optimal testbed for investigating linguistic and extralinguistic gender integration. As far as we know there is only one study addressing this question in a Slavic language: using Slovak Hanulíková Carreiras23 found that during an active-listening task the integration of speaker-related information and morphosyntactic information occurred rather late during complex sentence processing. Additionally a conflict between the speaker’s and the word’s genders (e.g. “I- \(stole_{MASC}\) plums” in female voice) was reflected in the modulation of the N400 component. Given that N400/LAN modulations have been consistently found for morphosyntactic violations in particular for number person and gender agreement as well as in phrase structure violations (e.g.24 see also for review25) this result may suggest that extralinguistic information is directly integrated during online (morpho)syntactic processing (such as speaker’s sex converted into subject’s gender in (morpho)syntactic processing). However N400 is also known to be related to conscious top-down controlled integration of linguistic information2426. Indeed in the study described above the participant’s overt attention to the stimuli was required and the effect generally appeared rather late in the comprehension processes. Thus the question of whether such findings reflect the involvement of genuine online parsing mechanisms or secondary post-comprehension processes (such as repair and reanalysis2427) still remains unsolved. Importantly syntactic parsing has been shown to commence much earlier and to take place in a largely automatic fashion as demonstrated in studies focused on early left-anterior negativity (ELAN) or syntactic MMN. In particular ELAN modulation around 200 ms or earlier has been reported during outright violations of the obligatory structure reflecting an automatic early analysis of the syntactic structure like phrase structure errors28293031 and it is considered to reflect the brain’s response to the word category violations.

As the onset of ELAN may be quite early (100 ms) some researchers have questioned whether this component actually reflects syntactic processing since even lexical access has been argued to commence around 200 ms post-stimulus onset3233. Some authors have also argued that ERPs occurring before the onset of a critical word may introduce spurious shifts in downstream ERPs when applying a baseline correction leading to artifactual ELAN-like activity34. On the other hand it has also been shown that language comprehension system can predict the syntactic structure from some characteristics at an initial stage thus leading to very early syntactically-related activations35. These processing events are often referred to as basic syntactic parsing starting with pre-processing of the syntactic structure and it is often assumed that they necessarily precede semantic processing3637. Finally early first-pass syntactic parsing stage is believed to have a high degree of automaticity as it has been shown to be independent of focused attention on the input taking place even when the subject is not focused on the language stimuli29.

Similar early morphosyntactic effects have been found reflected in the MMN response. This component originally related to acoustic change detection and auditory short-term memory38 is also considered to index higher-level language processes3940. For instance the so-called syntactic MMN (sMMN) was found to be elicited by syntactic violations in the left-hemispheric language systems3041424344. Previous studies found that whenever the deviant sequence included a verb person/suffix agreement violation (e.g. “we *walks”) it caused a larger sMMN in comparison with the same verb presented in agreement with the pronoun (“he walks”). These studies suggest that the auditory sMMN reflects similar early automatic processes as ELAN based on the pre-activation of morphosyntactically plausible representations45. Crucially all of these effects were registered when participants’ attention was diverted away from the auditory stimuli typically using an active visual task. Furthermore when directly comparing conditions with attention focused on vs. diverted away from the syntactic inputs it was found that this early sMMN/ELAN deflection was not affected by attention allocation until approximately 200 ms implying a strong degree of automaticity in early syntactic parsing44. Such early automatic (morpho)syntactic activity may reflect processes associated with the listener’s attempts to maintain efficient alignment with the speaker and associated prediction (priming) mechanisms46. As such they may have to rely upon activating syntactic templates and junctions as early as possible and often in a highly predictive and automatized fashion4247.

Although such early automatic (morpho)syntactic processing has been repeatedly demonstrated in neurophysiological research it remains unclear whether the listener’s brain makes use of extralinguistic speaker-related information during syntactic parsing in a similarly rapid automated fashion. It has been suggested that the integration of gender information during speech might happen at the sub-lexical and lexical levels48. Given the reflection of these processes in the MMN responses14 it stands to reason that such gender integration takes place at the early stages of morphosyntactic processing although the experimental evidence for this is still scarce.

Furthermore studies focused on extralinguistic processing are also limited with regard to the language in which the materials are presented. Languages with a shallow inflectional system (such as English the most often used language in psycho- and neurolinguistic literature) lack key grammatical features to tackle the processing of speaker-word gender incongruences. The present study is aimed at filling these gaps by examining the neurophysiological correlates of automatic extralinguistic processing using subject-verb agreement in a language with overt gender marking (Russian) under non-attend design while carefully balancing acoustic psycholinguistic and voice-related properties of the stimuli.

In particular we investigated how and when linguistic and extralinguistic gender information (subject’s gender) such as speaker-dependent voice congruency is integrated during sentence processing. For this purpose we developed an auditory passive presentation protocol similar to those previously employed in both sMMN and ELAN studies (see e.g.30). Participants were presented with short auditory phrases while their attention was diverted away from the auditory stimuli to a primary visual task. Furthermore by using male and female voices that either matched or mismatched with the grammatical gender agreement of the linguistic stimuli (e.g. “I \(walked_{MASC}\)” recorded in male or female voice) we directly assessed the integration of voice-related extralinguistic information (subject’s gender as perceived through voice) into automatic morphosyntactic processes. Since both grammatical verb-gender agreement parsing and gender-voice processing may occur quite early14 one may hypothesize an interaction and integration between the two processes ensuring the efficiency of early automatic morphosyntactic analysis.

Our hypotheses were motivated by previous findings showing early automatic morphosyntactic and speaker’s gender processing starting before 200 ms [morphosyntactic41424349; speaker’s gender14]. In case of simultaneous integration of extralinguistic information expressed by speaker’s gender (in)congruency with standard automatic morphosyntactic processing based on pre-activation of a particular morphosyntactic feature by preceding speaker’s gender we expected to observe a similarly early automatic ELAN-like modulation in the voice-gender mismatch conditions supporting concurrent one-step processing of different information types. If the extralinguistic information integration in line with two-step pragmatic models is slower than early automatic morphosyntactic processing no effects should be expected at early stages either only modulating later responses in the N400-P600 range (similar to23) or showing no modulation at all in our non-attend design.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmt0ZWNocG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8zMS90b3AtYXV0b21hdGVkLW1hY2hpbmUtbGVhcm5pbmctYXV0b21sLXRvb2xzLXBsYXRmb3Jtcy1mb3ItMjAyMi_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrdGVjaHBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMzEvdG9wLWF1dG9tYXRlZC1tYWNoaW5lLWxlYXJuaW5nLWF1dG9tbC10b29scy1wbGF0Zm9ybXMtZm9yLTIwMjIvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) Tools/Platforms For 2022,"Reddit Vote Flip Share 0 Shares

To improve the efficiency of the traditional single-front AFM method in generating the isotropic triangles the idea of ADFM is proposed in section ‘Formulation of the improved advancing double-front method’. However the environment around the fronts to be advanced is complex and changeable and the classification process needs large human judgment. So the multi-classification method of ANN is adopted here to identify and classify the external environment in this study which is helpful to improve the intelligence level of mesh generation.

The procedure of the ANN-based ADFM can be summarized in Fig. 7. An ANN model is trained to establish the mapping relationship between inputs and outputs. Training neural network model is essential to determine the weights matrix and the bias terms between neurons in different layers. This new method consists of the establishment of a neural network and mesh generation. The samples of ANN training are extracted from mesh data generated by traditional methods the trained model is utilized to predict patterns in mesh generation.

ANN model design

The design of a neural network directly affects the performance of the algorithm. The ability of ANN is greatly dependent on the architecture. The input of ANN is the coordinates of five points the two fronts to be advanced and the points on the left and right adjacent fronts the output layer is designed to solve the 10 classifications of mesh generation. For a multi-classification neural network system the one-hot encoding (OHE) is used because all states are equidistant without bias in Euclidean space33. The logistic regression model can be expressed as follows:

$$h(x) = \frac{1}{{1 + e^{{ - (w_{1} x_{1} + w_{2} x_{2} + ... + w_{n} x_{n} )}} }}$$ (2)

where the value of the function is 0–1 x 1  x 2  … x n are the components encoded by OHE and w 1  w 2  … w n are the weights of the corresponding components.

In the training stage of ANN an error will be sent backward through the backpropagation process to optimize the weights and biases of the ANN the error is defined by the mean square error (MSE) which defined as

$$MSE = \frac{1}{n}\sum

olimits_{i = 1}^{n} {(y_{i} - k_{i} )^{2} }$$ (3)

where y i and k i are the network output value and the target expected value respectively n is the total number. When the MSE reaches a minimum or training steps reached the set value the training process is finished.

For the hidden layer design although there are some works contributed in this area34 there is still no mature way to determine the number of hidden layers in an ANN and the number of neurons in each hidden layer for optimal architecture. In this work the architecture of ANN is designed by the traditional empirical method with 10 neurons on the input layer 10 neurons on the output layer two hidden layers with 25 neurons in the first hidden layer and 18 neurons in the second hidden layer.

Extraction and preprocessing of training sample data

The purpose of ANN is to learn the rules of mesh generation from existing mesh data generated by some traditional methods such as the Delaunay method and AFM and so on. In this work a variety of complex geometry mesh data are used to extract training data. For the convenience of introduction a simple shape is used to describe the process of training data extraction. As shown in Fig. 8 there are two training samples. The red lines represent the fronts to be advanced according to the right-hand rule the first active front is composed of Point 17 and Point 16 denoted as Front1617 the second active front denoted as Front1622 the red points (Point 25 and Point 19) are mesh points advanced by the corresponding active fronts. The blue lines represent the left and right adjacent fronts of the double fronts. In Fig. 8a case 1 corresponds to pattern 3 in Fig. 4 in this case the first active front will generate a new mesh point (Point 25) and the second active front will use the existing point to form a triangle (Triangle161922) with no new point generated. In Fig. 8b case 2 is different from case 1 in which it generates two new points this case belongs to pattern 1 in Fig. 4.

Figure 8 Extract training samples generated by the traditional method. Full size image

As shown in Fig. 8 the input data of ANN are the coordinates of five points on the active fronts and the differences in these coordinate values are very large some of them can reach several orders of magnitude which are not beneficial to the convergence of ANN. Therefore it is necessary to preprocess the training data. The most popular method of data preprocessing is data normalization which is used to reduce data with different representations to the same scale. The common scale ranges are [−1 1] and/or [0 1]. For ANN or support vector machine (SVM) it is essential to use normalization in data preprocessing. Of course data normalization is not required for some machine learning methods such as decision trees. In this study the transition scaling and rotation operations are used for data normalization35 and Fig. 9 presents the normalized data graphs of the two extracted training samples in Fig. 8.

The training verification and test of ANN

The experiment was implemented on a computer with an Intel Core i5-3230 M 16 GB of random memory and a graphics card with 4 GB. An open-source machine Learning Framework TensorFlow was used to train the network parameters of the proposed mesh generation pattern recognition algorithm. The software environment is as follows: WIN10 Tensorflow-1.10 and Python-3.6 from the Anaconda-3 distribution to create an independent Python environment.

Figure 10 shows a 2D mesh over a fighter with a store and a RAE2822 airfoil as training sample data the numbers of the isotropic triangles are 8708 and 10352 respectively any two connected edges and their left and right adjacent points will be used as a set of training data. The mesh training samples were randomly divided into the training set test set and verification set according to the proportions of 70% 15% and 15%.

Figure 10 Training samples generated by the traditional AFM. Full size image

The early stage of ANN design mainly consists of training and verification the Adam optimization algorithm is used to minimize the loss function value during training. when the loss of the network is less than 1.0e-4 it indicates that the ANN has converged and the weights and biases of all the layers will be saved as a model. At last the test set will be utilized to check the prediction performance of the system. The verification is similar to the test process except that the test process does not adjust the weights and biases of ANN. Figure 11 shows that the loss value changes significantly and has a decreasing trend indicating that ANN gradually converges and tends to be stable.

Mesh size control

Mesh size control has a great influence on mesh quality and flow solution accuracy. It is usually expected that the grids should be refined in key areas such as geometric curvature and large flow gradient while in the outer far-field grids can be very large since the flow gradient is almost zero and the transition from the solid wall to far-field should be as smooth as possible.

Generally the control methods of unstructured mesh size mainly include the background mesh method interpolation method function designation method and adaptive method of flow field characteristics. In this study the exponential function method is used to determine the mesh step size in the computational domain36. The mesh size can be written as:

$$y = \frac{{e^{Ax} - 1}}{{e^{A} - 1}}\\\\\$$ (4)

where x is the distance between the active front and the nearest initial front on the wall the parameter x has been normalized to between 0 and 1 and y (0 ≤ y ≤ 1) is the normalized mesh size calculated for the corresponding front the desired mesh size is obtained by the anti-normalization process of y. In the actual mesh generation process the mesh size of the first layer and the far-field boundary should be given the Newton–Raphson iteration method is used to obtain the value of A. Figure 12 shows the relationship between the distance x and mesh size y with different values of A. It should be noted that when x = 0 the mesh size needs to be given separately according to the current fluid environment and the geometry considered.

Mesh quality enhancement options

Generally the initial grids generated by ANN-based ADFM need to be optimized to improve mesh quality. In this paper the Delaunay criterion is introduced to carry out diagonal transformation for elements with poor quality37 as shown in Fig. 13. Meanwhile the spring relaxation method is introduced to optimize the coordinates of non-boundary nodes3839 which improves the element’s regular shape by repositioning a node at the barycenter of the polygon formed by its neighbor elements as shown in Fig. 14. Numerical experiments show that better mesh quality can be obtained by alternatively using the two optimization methods after several iterations.

Colloquially known as the ‘Vette secretly dreamt of by an entire planet of automotive enthusiasts enjoyed by many and reworked as their own by a select few. And this is just one of the nutshells that might try to engulf almost seven decades of legends and history. Alas we are not here to debate its fully established icon status but rather play a little upon the custom possibilities.So have you seen the madness surrounding the C8 Stingray and Z06 iterations? Unless you have been living under a rock in a galaxy far far away this question was rhetorical. But it serves a purpose – if you are willing to go back a couple of iterations or already own a cool C6 that needs to be transformed to be enjoyed again we might have stumbled upon the perfect alien-like customization idea.Has anyone heard of Valarra a little Pinellas Park Florida-based innovation and customization outlet? Well back in 2019 they made the headlines with their supercar-style take on the C6 Chevy Corvette that was labeled as the most insane body kit ever by some or the bonkers next-level widebody by others. Anyway one can easily take a hint – it is bat-shit crazy to the point of people suggesting this could work as the Dark Knight’s next Batmobile when simply dressed up in black and Valarra itself praises the “alien overloads who blessed us with this widebody spaceship .” Of course something is definitely amiss here.And by that we do not mean just the fact that we are dealing with a “complete custom kit car based on the Chevy C6 Corvette platform (that is) fabricated with high-quality parts (and) contains all you need – including interior - for a complete transformation.” Yep they did say this morphing is valid for the cockpit as well. So after securing a 2005-2013 Chevy Corvette  one can get to building something that allows for limitless customization.Naturally some might be eager to discard this as another small outlet full of vaporware. We might have thought the same though if not for this green and black Valarra Corvette standing like an extraterrestrial piece of art in front of a custom dedicated mural! Though on the other hand they did get one thing wrong – “less extensive fabrication required” does not bode well at all for “a three-year project in the making!” Well sort of considering the level of extensive work involved…Anyway it seems that performing the Valarra transformation was just one of the steps required by the owner to properly make this C6 his own. According to the available information this performance kit car is also equipped with suspension products from FlyyAir Suspensions and was also made to fully warrant its alien spaceship praise by the Miami Florida-based experts at MetroWrapz.The team along with a little help from a full custom Avery Dennison Graphics chrome wrap (you know them these are the same folks that “set the industry standard in vinyl graphic design and automotive wrap graphics worldwide”) went out of their way to make this an interesting blend between an outrageous piece of custom kit car and fully-fledged urban street art. Yep that qualifies as car art because of one fine detail.At the end of the three-year-long custom project a celebration was probably in order. So the MetroWrapz photoshoot also included something that would bode well for the effort – such as an entire custom mural painted by Patrice Moretti (aka Smog One – or smogoneart as he is known on social media). Yep Corvette things are certainly being done differently out there in Miami!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJpbnQuaW4vZmVhdHVyZS9lYXJseS1iaXJkcy1hcmUtbGluaW5nLXVwLWluLWpld2FyLWFpcnBvcnQtZ29sZC1ydXNoLXZpdm8tbHVsdS10by1iaWthbmVydmFsYS8xMDYwODY2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Early birds are lining up in Jewar airport Gold Rush. Vivo Lulu to Bikanervala,"Called the ‘logistics gateway’ of Northern India there is now a race to be the early bird investor in this National Capital Region (NCR) suburb. From Bikanervala to Kent RO to Avery Dennison many businesses are lining up to profit off the new Gold Rush.

“No matter what Yogi ji will make sure at least one flight takes off in 2024 before (the Lok Sabha) elections” said Pawan Sharma from Rohi village which was acquired by the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA).

Every second sentence uttered by people in Greater Noida these days has the word ‘airport’ in it. It is the connecting word of their aspiration now the crown jewel of Uttar Pradesh’s development mantra. Countless flex boards flap in the wind on a drive toward Jewar with the unmistakable image of an aircraft taking off.

The sense of anticipation in Jewar roughly 100 kilometres from Delhi is palpable. Everyone from families running local businesses to industries are waiting for ‘development’ and the wealth it will usher in.

Nearly 17 years after the idea of Jewar airport was first floated in 2001 by then-UP chief minister Rajnath Singh construction has begun in what is slated to be the fourth-largest airport in the world triggering a buying spree.

Rising opportunity

From Vivo to LuLu investors are queuing up to fund projects in Noida Greater Noida and Jewar.

Six months after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath approved the design and logo for Jewar airport in December 2020 Surya Global owner of the popular Indian biscuit brand Priyagold started the construction of its manufacturing facility in August 2021. It has invested Rs 953.39 crore in an area of 38.10 acres. Restaurant chain Bikanervala also set up shop in the same area Sector 32 roughly 10 km from the airport. It has invested Rs 160.27 crore for a 25-acre plot of land. Construction work on the facility began in January this year.

While approvals came in some time ago the definitive news that the airport will be operational by 2024 became the catalyst for the construction process” said Vinay Gupta chief managing director at Bikanervala.

The packaging and labelling company Avery Dennison which has invested Rs 231 crore has already started manufacturing while Haldiram’s (Rs 245 crore) will also be setting up a facility in the area.

But the largest investor so far is Vivo with a whopping Rs 5200 crore investment in an area spread over 169.5 acres. LuLu Group International a Middle East-based retail company announced its export-oriented food and agriculture-produce processing park on 20 acres of land in Greater Noida. The facility is expected to generate 700 jobs and give indirect employment to 1500 people. LuLu Group plans to invest Rs 2500 crore in Uttar Pradesh. While two malls will open in Prayagraj and Varanasi the third will be in Greater Noida closer to the airport.

This flurry of investments has given an impetus to other sectors as well. Rajkiya Mahavidyalaya the region’s first co-educational college will start holding classes from the end of August. Students from Jewar will no longer have to travel to Bulandshahr Ghaziabad Meerut or Delhi for higher education.

Real estate boom and scams galore

Phones have not stopped ringing in the offices of real estate developers in the area. Most agents told ThePrint they get at least five calls a day from potential investors. “People from NCR to Mumbai to Chennai are lining up to buy land here” said Mohit Chaudhary a local real estate dealer. With the cynicism of an agent who knows his market and his clients he adds “Many want to convert black money to white but there are those who just want to invest in some way.”

On an average at least two sales a week go through. Investors range from those willing to pour in crores to those with a budget of Rs 15-20 lakh.

And with good reason too.

In less than three years property rates have increased by 36 per cent in Greater Noida West. Along the Yamuna Expressway real estate rates have shot up by 31 per cent from Rs 1600 per square foot in 2019 to Rs. 2200 per square foot according to a recent report by Anarock Property Consultants.

As for the area near the airport industry experts predict prices appreciating by 50-100 per cent. Additionally residential prices are likely to increase by 40-50 per cent over the next 5-7 years.

For now only agricultural lands can be bought in areas not designated for any government work pertaining to the airport. However that hasn’t stopped people from trying to scam potential buyers by selling notified land that cannot technically be sold. Others try to flog plots by claiming they are ‘next to the airport’.

This was especially rampant during the first phase of land acquisition in villages such as Jewar Bangar Modelpur and Gopalgarh. Unsuspecting buyers were unaware that the land they had bought was in fact contested. YEIDA recently demolished 11 unauthorised colonies that had come up in the region.

By the time Sudheer Sharma a resident of Noida’s Sector 150 was ready to get a piece of the pie he had heard of horror stories of buyers being scammed. “There are a lot of hacks out there trying to sell land. So one has to be careful” said Sharma who is treading carefully in his hunt for the perfect plot of land.

Ready to take on Gurugram

For decades Noida has been seen as the less endowed sibling of Gurugram (formerly Gurgaon); the absence of an airport was a sore point. Delhi’s Aerocity itself is the by-product of the lucrative space near the airport. But Noida and Greater ‘Noidavaasis’ have their hopes pinned on the upcoming airport— it is their golden goose. Conglomerates are investing as much as Rs 5000 crore in Jewar.

“Noida has competed with Gurugram as the premier suburb of Delhi with one hand tied behind its back. Even though it has better infrastructure and access to Delhi corporates and MNCs [multi-national corporations] always preferred Gurugram due to its proximity to the Indira Gandhi International Airport. Over the next few years this differential will disappear” said Pankaj Bajaj president Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) NCR.

People are holding on to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise of the prosperity this airport will bring to the region. At the foundation stone laying ceremony in November 2021 Modi said it would make the region the ‘logistics gateway’ of northern India and provide new employment opportunities to thousands of people.

Villagers gun for profit

At Sabota village roughly 3 km from Jewar villagers anticipate a rise in land prices as more industries are set up. According to Pawan Sharma they will probably get more money per ‘bigha’ (0.3 acre) of land than residents of Rohi and others that were acquired by YEIDA during the first phase. At the time land owners received about Rs 21 lakh per bigha of land. Many in the area missed the windfall because their land was not part of the acquisition.

Having seen how the system works villagers in Sabota are eager to reap the benefits. “Why should we not get a slice of the cake too? But we will sell to private owners they will pay more. Let 2024 come” said Hukum Singh a villager. Sabota is close to the airport and with industry predictions of prices soaring by upwards of 50 per cent villagers will not sell their land to the first prospective buyer.

Sharma whose land in Rohi was acquired at Rs 21 lakh per bigha and was given a cumulative total of roughly Rs 1 crore has decided to invest some of his money in the third phase of land acquisition. “We should also make money. After all we gave our land [for much less]” he adds.

Employment is a distant dream

So far employment opportunities for locals have yet to open up and thousands line up for the few jobs available to them. At the makeshift Tata office on the airport construction site there’s a snaking queue of job aspirants all hoping to become security guards. At present the only available jobs are those of site engineers construction workers electricians security guards and drivers.

“I completed my Bachelor’s last year and need a job” said Akhil Singh who lives in the vicinity of the RR Site–the place Rohi village was relocated to after land acquisition.

While jobs are not easily available Chaudhary the real estate dealer sees this as an opportunity for entrepreneurship. He realised the airport would need a steady supply of ready-mix cement and started his own venture Jewar RMC Infrastructures Private Limited to supply all the construction work that started. He too prefers not to hire locals and instead chooses labourers from far-off places who will not be ‘distracted’ by family living close by.

But people in Jewar and nearby areas are waiting for the promised boom. If the airport is the golden goose then the conglomerates and chains setting up houses in their backyard will lay the golden egg.

Bank of America has filed paperwork with federal regulators to close an area branch.

The North Carolina-based bank chain filed paperwork with U.S. Department of the Treasury independent bureau Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that they will be closing their location along South Oxford Valley Road in the Queen Anne Plaza shopping center in Bristol Township’s Fairless Hills section.

Bank of America said the location will close for good on October 25. It advises residents to close safe deposit boxes during branch business hours.

The Philadelphia Business Journal reported Bank of America has 78 locations in the Philadelphia area. It recently closed locations in Montgomery County Philadelphia and Ocean City New Jersey.

Bank of America has spend time over the past decade closing branches in the region.

The bank is the fourth largest deposit taker in the region the Philadelphia Business Journal reported.

The pandemic forced consumers to become more involved with virtual and mobile banking options which has sped up a trend of major banks consolidating locations.

Bank of America operates an existing branch at the Marketplace at Oxford Valley on East Lincoln Highway and several area ATMs. Outside of the Levittown area the bank has nearby branches in Bensalem Township Lower Southampton Township Newtown Township and Trenton.

Now they profit big,"Shubham Saharan

Bloomberg

The last time inflation burned hot consumers could put money in the bank and watch it grow like the prices on store shelves easing much of the pain.

Not this time – and that’s stoking profits for U.S. lenders.

The gap between what banks pay depositors and what they earn from lending money to borrowers hasn’t been so wide in the past half-century with the average savings account paying a skimpy 0.06%. Many banks are telling shareholders that so-called deposit betas measuring how quickly deposit rates rise in the wake of Fed hikes will remain advantageous for banks in the months ahead as they’re not yet feeling much pressure to pay savers more.

Betas are now the buzziest bit of jargon across the financial industry. The phrase was invoked more times during Bank of America Corp.’s analyst briefings in the past two months than in the prior two years combined. This month the lender’s executives predicted interest income may climb by as much as $1 billion in the third quarter from the second as they stay “disciplined” in what they pay customers.

“Our consumer-banking segment continues to see good momentum” Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan told analysts July 18. “We grew loans at the fastest quarterly pace in nearly three years.”

The reasons that savers are getting so little relief are myriad starting with the Federal Reserve which waited until inflation was strong before it began raising interest rates from longtime lows. From there it takes time for deposit rates to rise too. The result is pain: The consumer price index jumped 9.1% in June while banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co. offered deposit rates as low as 0.01% according to their websites.

While deposit rates are widely expected to tick incrementally higher as the Fed’s rate hikes for borrowers take hold there’s ample evidence that the benefits for savers will come slowly. That’s because many banks face little competitive pressure to pay more. Many are flush with cash thanks in part to a surge in deposits that piled up during Covid-era lockdowns and stimulus programs.

Even big clients that aren’t doing a lot of business with a bank aside from parking their money will have little leverage to push for a higher interest rate on their deposits.

“Banks have plenty of room on the funding side” said Erika Najarian a banking analyst at UBS Group AG. That means they can allow “more rate-sensitive deposit-only relationships to walk because they don’t necessarily need that funding.

While deposits have been slipping somewhat at many banks it’s unlikely that enough consumers will switch lenders to ratchet up pressure quickly even as online and community-based institutions burnish rates to attract inflows. Synchrony Financial and American Express Co. for example each offer rates of at least 1.5%.

One reason for that inertia is that only people of a certain age can remember an era when banks routinely paid much more interest on deposits blunting the impact of inflation. Another is that accounts aren’t as portable as they were decades ago. Many customers have their paychecks deposited directly and arrange for bills to be paid automatically making switching to a new bank a hassle.

To be sure the more generous rates banks paid for deposits in the 1980s were a result of longstanding inflation and the Fed’s efforts to tame that with much higher interest rates for borrowing.

This time both interest and deposit rates are coming off ultra-low levels said Greg McBride chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com which tracks the deposit rates banks offer. Banks will want to see the benefit from higher borrowing rates before they start to pass that along to savers he said.

Getting to higher deposit rates will also depend on how long the Fed keeps borrowing rates elevated Najarian said. She suggests deposit rates might reach 1.2% before the Fed starts to ease again."

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

BATH Maine — To address a growing need for diverse housing options a new affordable apartment complex was built in Bath and on Wednesday locals got to take a look during a grand opening.



Made possible through several tax credits and the guidance of MaineHousing the new 60-unit complex was developed by The Szanton Company and sits on the corner of Front and Summer streets.



Forty-two units will be reserved for those 55 and older and cost between $800 and $1500 a month to rent according to the developers.

""The mission of The Szanton Company is to create rental apartments that are moderate- to low-income which our tenants are proud to call home"" company President Nathan Szanton said at the grand opening.



The building also features several community spaces a rooftop deck and some mixed-use retail spaces some of which have already been renting before renovations and changes.

Kaizer Chiefs have filled the void left by Lee Baxter in their technical team ahead of the 2022-23 season.

The British-Swedish goalkeeper coach parted ways with the Soweto giants at the end of the 2021-22 campaign and the club was said to be looking to replace the 46-year-old.

Former Orlando Pirates goalkeeper coach Alex Heredia was linked with Amakhosi this week but the club's head coach Arthur Zwane has now stated that Rory Minnaar and Aubrey Mathibe will fill the void left by Baxter.

""We've got Rory Minnaar and Tladi (Aubrey Mathibe). These two guys come from our development ranks"" Zwane told the media.

""Tladi was part of the team at that time of operation 'Vat Alles' so he knows the team inside and out. Rory has worked with all the development goalkeepers you see today that are doing well in the MDC and under-17 side while also in the first-team.

""He worked with Rainer Dinkelacker so he has got vast experience and this will be his chance to showcase his talent and they both have done tremendously well so far.""

Minnaar has been in the Chiefs setup for many years having also worked with legendary goalkeeper Rainer Dinkelacker at the Naturena-based giants.

Rowing duo just set a brand new World Record in Italy!!!

Varese Italy (30 July 2022) – South African rowers Damien Bonhage-Koen and Christopher Baxter have set a new world record in the U23 men’s heavyweight pair event at the U19 and U23 World Rowing Championships currently underway in Varese Italy.

The pair took gold in 6:1999 beating the previous world record by 007 seconds.

“We are delighted to see the current team of managers and coaches building the next generation of Olympic hopefuls” says team manager Darryn Roff. “We are tremendously proud of Damien and Christopher and look forward to more great rowing over the next two days.”

South Africa fielded a team of 18 athletes at the championships who qualified for participation in May.

The RMB National Rowing Squad will participate in two more events this weekend: the women’s double sculls (Katherine Williams and Courtney Westley) on Saturday the 30th of July at 16:02 (SA time) and the junior men’s coxed fours (Jayden Thomson Dilano Sà Cristiano De Freitas Braden Howard and Ethan Romburgh) on Sunday the 31st of July at 11:55 (SA time).

“As partners of South African rowing at all levels of the sport we are proud to play a role in making it possible for our professional team to represent our country internationally. It is not only an honour to support these talented men and women but a humbling experience to witness their resilience and strength through adversity” says RMB.

The results will be released on Monday the 1st of August.

Special to USA TODAY

Hundred-year floods. Wildfires. Hurricane season. Hurricane after hurricane after hurricane. It's been a summer of extreme and unpredictable weather hasn't it?

So how do you keep Mother Nature from turning your next vacation into a disaster?

""As images of travel disasters flash across their screens this summer travelers are looking to make plans with peace of mind"" says Carol Mueller vice president of strategic marketing at Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection.

But that's easier said than done.

Avoiding a natural disaster means knowing where disruptive weather is likely to happen. It also means taking all the right precautions. That includes careful planning and buying travel insurance. And you need a contingency plan just in case the weather gods throw you a curveball.

Your Southwest flight credits won't expire: Airline's new policy applies to all tickets

How do I know when disaster will strike?

It's almost impossible to predict a natural disaster. If I could then I would have avoided the wildfires that ravaged the West Coast during the summer of 2020 or skipped the European heat wave this June. But you can assess the risk of any destination.

""For example coastal San Diego County has some of the most temperate weather in the world with a low risk of storms fires or unrest"" says John Rose chief risk and security officer for the travel agency ALTOUR. ""The same can be said for many global destinations such as the Canadian Rockies.""

When is hurricane season? Stay prepared for the next hurricane or storm

So where do you go?

Jonathan Porter AccuWeather's chief meteorologist says certain parts of the world are more vulnerable to disasters. For example you might want to think twice about traveling to the Bahamas in September which is the height of the Atlantic hurricane season.

""It may be less expensive"" he adds ""but it's more likely a hurricane could pose a threat.""

Porter also recommends looking at recent disasters for guidance. For example California has a wildfire season but it has experienced severe fires outside the traditional May-October window too. The same thing goes for tornadoes in the Central and Eastern U.S. as evidenced by the historic tornadoes that ravaged Kentucky in December 2021.

""Closely monitor weather forecasts for your vacations and be alert for any weather warnings"" he says.

AccuWeather predicts an active severe weather season in the United States extending well into the summer. The likelihood of hurricanes and tropical storms is above average. The threat of wildfires floods and other natural disasters also looms large.

Will travel insurance help in a disaster?

Travel insurance can't save you from a vacation disaster – but it might protect you. Experts say you need to know a few things about how insurance coverage works though

Many travel insurance policies cover prepaid nonrefundable travel deposits and apply to natural disasters like fires and floods.

""You can cancel and reschedule your vacation for another time or destination"" says Daniel Durazo a spokesman for Allianz Partners.

Read your policy carefully says Jeff Rolander director of claims at travel insurance startup Faye.

Is travel insurance worth it? What to know before you book your next trip

""Some may not cover a disaster"" he warns. ""For example if you've only purchased health coverage only for your trip it would not cover a wildfire or hurricane.""

""One important thing to keep in mind is that it can only provide coverage for unforeseen events"" explains Narendra Khatri a principal for travel insurance company Insubuy.

For example if a hurricane hits your resort in Florida before your trip starts you have coverage only if you bought a policy before the storm received a name.

""Once it becomes a named storm it becomes a foreseeable event and would not be covered"" Khatri says.

How to plan for a vacation disaster

Planning for a natural disaster is more important than ever.

""Being proactive and preparing for the possibility of a security emergency could mean the difference between a safe departure and being trapped in a dangerous situation out of your control” said Harding Bush manager of security operations for Global Rescue a company that provides evacuation and travel risk management services.

Now more than ever you need to know what to do experts say.

""Specifically what's your backup plan?"" asks Chris Emery editor of the outdoor site Ordealist.com.

A travel adviser can help. Kimberly Davis founder of Trouvaille Travel International says a qualified agent can help you find the right travel insurance or medical evacuation coverage. A travel pro can also prepare you for a possible vacation disaster. It helps if your travel adviser has local contacts who can assist you if you run into trouble.

""We often arrange travel with local destination management companies who have boots on the ground"" she says. ""They can monitor events and assist with rapid changes or emergency situations.""

The best contingency plans do two things. First they answer the questions ""What if disaster strikes?"" and ""How will you get home safely?"" A travel agent and travel insurance company can help you get out of harm's way when a wildfire approaches your resort.

The best plans also address the possibility that your vacation will get canceled. Is there a Plan B – maybe a substitute vacation destination in a less risky spot? There too a travel adviser can help. But ultimately it's up to you to answer both of those questions.

Is 2022 too disaster-prone to even bother with a vacation?

Given all the uncertainties should you even bother with a vacation this summer? Yes if you avoid the disaster hot spots buy the right insurance and have an escape plan you can still go. And given that many Americans haven't traveled in two years of pandemic lockdowns maybe you should go.

Is your travel insurance disaster-proof?

What kinds of questions should you ask before you buy travel insurance? Here's what the experts say.

What's the coverage if I'm at my destination? Travelers don't always know what insurance does – and doesn't – cover when disaster strikes during vacation. ""Trip interruption coverage will cover the unused prepaid nonrefundable costs left on your trip and the additional costs of getting home early"" says Stan Sandberg co-founder of travel insurance site TravelInsurance.com. Review the trip interruption benefits before you buy insurance. A reliable policy covers up to 150% of unused trip costs and sometimes allows you to rejoin the trip if practical.

What about my property? That's something a policy should be able to cover. ""If your belongings are damaged lost or destroyed travel insurance will help cover those losses"" says Melanie Musson a travel insurance expert with Clearsurance.com. But again check the fine print. Some policies cover more some less. Make sure your coverage is adequate. You'll find it under the baggage and personal items loss benefit in your policy.

What doesn't travel insurance cover? Insurance won't fix everything. For example travel insurance companies generally won't evacuate you from a disaster area. For that you'll need a MedjetHorizon membership or a policy through a company like emergency CAP Tripside Assistance. In fact I used my MedjetHorizon membership to get evacuated back to the United States from France at the start of the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9vaWwtcHJpY2VzLXN0YXktaGlnaC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLTEyMTUwMDI5NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oil prices will stay high as production constraints keep supplies tight top CEOs say,"Atef Hassan/Reuters

Oil prices will continue to stay high as production constraints look to keep crude supplies tight according to the world's top energy giants.

""There is more upside than downside when it comes to the oil price"" Shell's CEO said.

""Clearly to lower prices the industry needs to increase investment and catch up to recovering demand. Unfortunately this will take time"" Exxon's CEO said.

Oil prices will continue to stay high as production constraints look to keep crude supplies tight according to CEOs of the world's top energy giants.

That should sustain massive profits at oil companies with second-quarter earnings reports so far showing record hauls for the sector. Although oil prices have seen a downtrend in the past few months due to recession fears crude staged a rally over the last week and West Texas Intermediate is still up more than 30% for the year.

""There is more upside than downside when it comes to the oil price"" Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said in an interview Thursday with Bloomberg TV after his company's quarterly report. ""Demand hasn't fully recovered yet and supply is definitely tight.""

He noted OPEC and US shale companies have limited capacity for additional oil production while Western sanctions on Russian oil have yet to fully kick in. The European Union's partial embargo will take effect by the end of the year potentially removing another 2.2 million barrels from the market.

TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Thursday that global markets will struggle to develop spare production capacity for oil and liquefied natural gas in the coming year.

""This implies medium term support for high prices"" he said on a conference call.

Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods also pointed to production constraints as he sized up the oil price outlook on Friday.

It takes about three to five years for investments to translate to additional supply he told CNBC. Meanwhile there are still no signs of significant demand destruction for fuel.

""Clearly to lower prices the industry needs to increase investment and catch up to recovering demand. Unfortunately this will take time"" Wood said on an earnings conference call Friday.

ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance also told an industry group earlier this month that OPEC and US producers are limited in how much more oil they can pump.

""Ultimately demand will go back to pre-pandemic levels"" he said according to Reuters. ""There is a supply crunch coming.""

China’s spaceflight agency said the vast majority of wreckage from the last stage of Long March 5B burned up upon re-entry. The U.S. Space Command tweeted that while it could confirm the booster had re-entered over the Indian Ocean it referred to China for details on technical aspects including impact location.

“The People’s Republic of China did not share specific trajectory information as their Long March 5B rocket fell back to Earth” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said separately. “All space-faring nations should follow established best practices and do their part to share this type of information in advance to allow reliable predictions of potential debris impact risk especially for heavy-lift vehicles like the Long March 5B which carry a significant risk of loss of life and property.”

#USSPACECOM can confirm the People’s Republic of China (PRC) Long March 5B (CZ-5B) re-entered over the Indian Ocean at approx 10:45 am MDT on 7/30. We refer you to the #PRC for further details on the reentry’s technical aspects such as potential debris dispersal+ impact location. — U.S. Space Command (@US_SpaceCom) July 30 2022

In the days before the crash Western space experts warned about the uncontrolled descent of the rocket booster weighing 25.4 tons. China is unusual in conducting launches that result in the uncontrolled re-entry of rocket segments said Jonathan McDowell an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics which is operated by Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution. The US and others design their rockets so that debris falls “in a very predictable location” he said.

Aerospace Corp. an El Segundo California-based nonprofit that provides technical advice for space missions and receives US funding had said there was a “non-zero probability” that debris would land in a populated area estimating that more than 88% of the world’s population lives under the re-entry’s potential debris footprint.

Experts had cautioned that that while much of the massive booster would burn up upon reentering Earth’s atmosphere huge chunks — as much as 40% — would survive and fall to oceans or the ground. Some projections had shown a ground track that crossed parts of Mexico and Brazil then skirted the Cape of Africa before passing over land in Southeast Asia.

This is the third uncontrolled entry by a Chinese rocket booster in as many years. In May 2021 pieces of another Long March rocket landed in the Indian Ocean. Nelson issued a statement at that time criticizing China’s handling of space debris and lack of transparency.

China has dismissed Western concerns over debris calling it a smear effort as the US-China space race escalates.

US and Western media “deliberately exaggerate” the loss of control of China’s rocket debris and the probability of injury “obviously with bad intentions” Shanghai-based news site Guancha.cn said last week. The Global Times newspaper said Western media were projecting a “sour grapes” mentality toward China’s aerospace sector.

The Long March 5B rocket took off July 24 carrying one of the heaviest payloads in recent years a module for China’s under-construction Tiangong space station. The Chinese space station was started after the US barred Beijing from participating in the International Space Station.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdnByZXNzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcGFydGljaXBhbnRzLWxlYXJuLXNraWxscy1hdC1jYWwtY2l0eS1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWNhbXAvYXJ0aWNsZV9hMmU5ZGJhMC0wZmQwLTExZWQtOTlhOC01MzA1ZTZiNzE4NDkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Participants learn skills at Cal City Basketball Camp,"Thank you for reading!

Between photos of her teenage self posing with family members and laughing with friends familiar faces appear.

There’s Rita meeting Ozzy Osbourne. Rita hugging Tommy Lee. Rita chatting with Steven Tyler. Rita flashing a grin with Bret Michaels. She pulls out scrapbooks filled with concert ticket stubs and backstage passes from the 1980s. The walls around her are filled with framed set lists guitar picks and the faces of the biggest rock stars of the 20th century.

Kucirek points at a signed photo of Pamela Des Barres the famous rock groupie.

“She urges women to write and to be writers and I love that about her” Kucirek said. “To tell their stories whatever it is.”

Rita’s story is this: She’s a well-known longtime waitress at Omaha’s Gorat’s Steakhouse — the waitress who usually serves the old-school steakhouse’s most famous customer Warren Buffett. She’s a mom. She’s a published author of a wild memoir under her pen name Rita Rae Roxx a book that details running away to Los Angeles partying with KISS and riding on the back of David Lee Roth’s motorcycle.

This 57-year-old’s den of memories holds the tales of a young girl from Omaha who loved rock and roll then spent decades as one of America’s most dedicated rock groupies.

She hates the word “groupie.”

“It’s kind of dismissing me it’s kind of just like she’s just a groupie so I don’t like it” she said. “To me I’m a professional guest. Because look … I’ve hung out with everybody I’ve gone out with a lot of people. I still get to people.”

Born in 1965 the Omaha girl loved “American Bandstand” the Jackson 5 and Cher. She was grounded often and listening to records in her bedroom became her favorite pastime. On a hot August night in 1980 Kucirek and friends went to see Alice Cooper at Civic Auditorium. Billy Squier then an up-and-coming musician opened the show. As he left the stage Kucirek leaned over the railing and asked to meet him. Security guards invited her and her friends backstage and eventually Squier brought Kucirek to his tour bus.

She had just turned 15.

Kucirek began high school that year at Omaha Central. During class she watched out the windows as bands pulled into Civic Auditorium for sound check. After the school bell rang Kucirek hung around the stagehands and security guards forming friendships that became her ticket to backstage access.

She started to attend concerts across the Midwest driving to see her favorite bands. Kucirek made her way backstage with Foreigner Ozzy Osbourne Mötley Crüe Poison and many others often bribing crew members with drugs or receiving a spot on the guest list from a musician. Kucirek fell in love with Roth of Van Halen sold one of her earrings to Tyler for $100 and was asked by Jon Bon Jovi to sew clothes for his upcoming tour.

“I felt like a sex symbol” Kucirek said. “I didn’t have any goals or really a life plan at that time because I thought I was going to be married to a rock star. But now I realize it’s a very toxic abusive environment for at least some people.”

In 1987 Kucirek moved to Los Angeles and immersed herself in Sunset Boulevard’s music scene. She heard bands like Guns N’ Roses and Warrant before their mainstream breaks. She partied with Sylvester Stallone and Rick James. She dated Prince’s half-brother Duane Nelson and Eddie Murphy’s brother Charlie Murphy — she has a framed love poem to prove it.

Kucirek says she once confronted Suge Knight about a poor tip getting an extra $40 out of the infamous Death Row Records co-founder.

Kucirek also started doing stand-up comedy about her time as a cocktail waitress attending open mics at The Comedy Store and Hollywood Improv.

There was glitz in Kucirek’s Hollywood lifestyle but darkness too. By the 1990s she was using cocaine regularly. In 2002 she made her way back to Omaha.

“I just felt like I needed to get back to who I was and do some healing” she said.

She quit drinking cut back her smoking and started roller skating and biking all over the city. Kucirek became a mother and raised two children.

In 2005 she got a waitressing job at Gorat’s. She’s been there since building a group of loyal customers — Rita’s own restaurant groupies if you will.

In 2011 one of those regulars passed away leaving Kucirek $2000 in his will. That $2000 allowed Kucirek to buy a MacBook and write her story.

“People have been telling me to write a book about all my rock n’ roll stories and meeting all the rock stars all these years” Kucirek said. “I figured that was my sign to do it.”

Kucirek wrote in the pre-dawn hours before her kids awoke.

Published in 2012 “Once Upon a Rock Star: Backstage Passes in the Heavy Metal Eighties-Big Hair Bad Boys (and One Bad Girl)” told the story of her wild young years in Omaha featuring photos and scanned tickets of concerts and rock stars.

When it came out fans of featured bands started reaching out to Kucirek over social media. Some are in awe at her time spent with their idols. Others get mad at her unfavorable characterizations like the Mötley Crüe fan angered by her story about an unconsented groping from Nikki Sixx.

“First of all Nikki Sixx is a public figure” Kucirek responded. “Second of all this is my story about my life and he happened to be in it. Third of all it’s not like he wrote ‘Girls Girls Girls’ sitting in church on a Sunday morning.”

While working at Gorat’s Kucirek sold a copy of her book to Buffett’s security guard. The following week Buffett came to lunch three days in a row at Gorat’s each time asking for the rock n’ roll waitress. Now Kucirek is Buffett’s server whenever he dines at Gorat’s.

“Her t’s are crossed her i’s are dotted when she waits on customers” said Lisa Caveye Gorat’s hostess for the past 58 years. “Mr. Buffett included.”

Kucirek’s love of live music remains. She still sees her old favorite bands when they tour though rising ticket prices and meet-and-greet passes bug her. She’s added Post Malone and Machine Gun Kelly to her list of new artists she rocks out to.

This summer Kucirek went to a Mötley Crüe concert in Kansas City. Drummer Tommy Lee came onstage and asked women in the crowd to lift up their shirts which was then broadcast on the stadium Jumbotron.

The woman once known as Rockin’ Rita no longer finds that cute.

“It’s so weird how the double standards are. It just really ruined the concert for me” she said. “Listen … who am I to speak now you know for all the stuff that I did. But come on man! This is a different time.”

On nights when there’s no concert you can find Kucirek whirling through Gorat’s. She drops drinks off at one table and steaks at the next. She teases the line cooks and lugs a cardboard cutout of Buffett for out-of-town guests. One table gets her talking about a recent concert and Kucirek whips out a copy of her book — the book has appeared as if from nowhere — for them to gawk over.

Rita has dreams beyond the steakhouse.

She’d like to have a movie or TV series adapted from her book. She’d like to attend more shows like her very first — Aerosmith in 1979 — and feel what she felt then.

“It’s the adrenaline because when you’re in front of a concert they’re taking you into their world” Kucirek said. “I just absorb it all so it’s … entering another realm of consciousness.”

Best Buy PS5 restock time

The Best Buy PS5 restock on is weekdays from 9:55am ET and 5:05pm ET

The most popular Best Buy PS5 restock time is 12pm ET

The PS5 was in stock for almost an hour recently; demand is down

The next Best Buy PS5 restock time may be 12pm ET because that’s been the most popular time in which Best Buy restocks next-gen consoles. Best Buy has restocked the PS5 outside of this exact time window but it always has stock during work hours.

This means Best Buy has consistently done PS5 restock events on weekdays from 9:55am ET to 5:05pm ET my in-depth research has revealed. No weekends and no nighttime restocks have happened in 2021 or 2022. Only once has it had an in-store restock nationwide (back on September 23 of last year).

Of course while this information is reliable it makes the exact Best Buy PS5 restock time harder to nail down than the Target PS5 restock (which is almost always in the early morning once per month) or Sony Direct PS5 restock (late in the afternoon). The Amazon PS5 restock invitation system has done away with random PS5 restock times while the Walmart PS5 restock always comes with advance notice.

Best Buy PS5 restock Disc vs Digital

The Best Buy PS5 Disc restock is far easier to get than PS5 Digital

Best Buy sells bundles but they’re from the same inventory so you won’t better your chances at buying a PS5 by opting for a bundle

The advantage of shopping at Best Buy is that you won’t be forced to buy a PlayStation 5 bundle. Unlike each Antonline and GameStop PS5 restock Best Buy is one of the stores in the United States that offers PS5 Disc at $499 and PS5 Digital at $399. Any PS5 game bundles you see on the Best Buy website are always optional and come from the same inventory (meaning they all run out at the same time).

Of course as we point out in our PS5 Disc vs Digital comparison PS5 Digital is being produced by Sony far less today and it’s therefore almost impossible to buy in July.

With that said it’s not all roses when it comes to buying a PS5 from Best Buy.

Best Buy PS5 restock problem

There’s a big catch to some Best Buy PS5 restock dates. The Sony console is often limited in quantity and in addition to that limited to Best Buy Totaltech members. Watch out for that upcharge.

Best Buy Totaltech is a hefty $199 yearly fee which is a far higher price than other memberships – $14.99 a year for GameStop PowerUp Reards Pro $139 a year for Amazon Prime and $12.95/mo for Walmart Plus. Best Buy Totaltech is only worth it if you’re going to take advantage of the other included perks and even then there are some restrictions I’ll outline below.

Perks include GeekSquad tech support AppleCare Plus free delivery and standard installation on new Best Buy purchases extended 60-day return windows and free two-day shipping. So this service does offer more than just access to the PlayStation 5 and hard-to-find restock items what’s left? Truth be told Nvidia GPUs are easier to get now and the Xbox Series X price has stabilized (although avoid the Xbox Series X GameStop restock because it’s still being bundled for some reason).

Why Totaltech is hardly worth it

Best Buy Totaltech is the least convincing of memberships in which a PS5 restock is locked behind a paywall:

It’s by far the most expensive at $199 for one year half the price of a PS5 Digital console at Best Buy

PS5 is becoming easier to purchase at other retailers so is $199 worth it?

AppleCare Plus only includes Apple tech purchased at Best Buy yet the lowest Apple AirPods price is from Amazon and B&H Photo. The same for iPad deals MacBook deals iPhone deals and the best AirTags price in the US

GeekSquad support is for asking IT questions but labor and parts will still cost you money. I think some people buy into this membership thinking that will get GeekSquad to fix their computer or phone for free if something goes wrong

Other PS5 restock events besides Best Buy

The Best Buy PS5 restock is far from the only one we’ll see in the coming days. I fully expect more Amazon PS5 restock invitations to go out to customers in the coming days. Both Amazon and Best Buy want to drive as much awareness to the other deals during the two-day deals marathon.

The one thing I’ll be looking at is whether or not this PS5 restock at Best Buy ever does an in-store restock in the US. Given the Totaltech requirement it may last a lot longer each time Best Buy does this especially if people read this critical tech advice.

Rochester Rd.

Amazon officials are mum saying only as spokesman Austin Stowe did: “There are no updates for launching an Amazon Fresh in Michigan.”

Multiple media outlets have reported the online retail giant has plans for Amazon Fresh outlets in Rochester Hills and Troy in Oakland County Grand Blanc in Genesee County and Shelby Township in Macomb County.

But you won’t find “Amazon Fresh” in any Rochester Hills public-facing planning documents. Instead building permits for 2651 S. Rochester Road simply state “new plan Hampton Village LLC / 2651 S. Rochester Rd.” In some cases permit details available on the city’s website refer to “new grocery store” or “national grocery chain.”

Some permits are for electrical or mechanical work others for interior alterations. The most recent permits visible on the city’s website

June 6: Gallant Building Solutions of Crystal Lake Illinois for installing electrical components and devices.

June 13: Grand Rapids-based Vanguard Fire & Security Systems for installation of a kitchen hood and fire suppression system.

June 20: Shelby Township-based Discover Plumbing owner Jeffrey VanPamel received a permit for new commercial construction plumbing at the future grocery store.

“We do not comment on future road maps” said Stowe the Amazon spokesman.

Company officials also provided links to Amazon job listings. While they are hiring warehouse associates in Pontiac and elsewhere none of the 208 jobs listed on Tuesday were for Michigan-based Amazon Fresh opportunities.

Amazon’s Pontiac Robotics Fulfillment Center opened in September and currently employs just over 3000 people Stowe said. Starting pay is $15.50 an hour.

Rochester Hills Mayor Bryan K. Barnett said he can’t talk about Amazon Fresh in any way adding that some corporations “choose to keep their information close to the vest. I don’t want to make any guess as to any particular company but I’m sure it’s corporate strategic planning.”

From the city’s standpoint he said Best Buy closing at that site “left a significant vacancy in a very popular shopping center.”

Seeing the area revived in any way is good from a purely economic development standpoint he said.

“Having any significant national retail grocery invest in the city is a good thing” he said.

A Yelp! Review page for the Rochester Hills Amazon Fresh store exists for the South Rochester Road address and includes an Amazon toll-free number. That page remains unclaimed.

Company officials announced during this year’s first-quarter report to stockholders that there are 46 Amazon Fresh grocery stores and the number is expected to grow. In 2017 the company bought the grocery chain Whole Foods. Some Amazon Fresh stores are not far from Whole Foods outlets but company officials have not commented on the future of the two brands..

Amazon officials’ second-quarter earnings call will be a webcast at 5:30 p.m. (Eastern) Thursday July 28. Audio and related slides will be online at www.amazon.com/ir for up to three months according to the company’s announcement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3dhdGNodHYuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMzAvYmVzdC1idXktb3BlbnMtdXAtZmlyc3Qtc21hbGwtZGlnaXRhbC1maXJzdC1zdG9yZS_SAVVodHRwczovL25ld3N3YXRjaHR2LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzMwL2Jlc3QtYnV5LW9wZW5zLXVwLWZpcnN0LXNtYWxsLWRpZ2l0YWwtZmlyc3Qtc3RvcmUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Buy Opens Up First Small Digital-First Store,"By: Nick Gambino

Best Buy is doing its best to keep up with the times. That means updating their format and offering what the public is looking for. That’s the idea behind their newest endeavor. They just opened their first digital-first store in Monroe North Carolina.

Unlike a typical Best Buy that fills a massive footprint this new store is only about 5000 square feet and carries a limited inventory though not as limited as you might think. They will still sell most smaller electronic products as well as large TVs but they won’t carry large appliances or other such big-box products. And as we said it’s “digital-first” which needs some explaining.

“[It] will feature a curated selection of our best-in-category products the expert services customers know and love like Geek Squad and new ways to pick up your tech” a Best Buy blog post reads. “Plus we’re testing a new digital-first shopping experience that encourages customers to do everything from the shop select your product and get advice digitally while in the store.”

It looks a lot like Best Buy’s answer to the Apple Store. It’s not surprising as that model has been copied by a ton of tech companies including Microsoft. When you first enter the store you’ll be greeted by a 7-foot digital display that will explain all the new stuff and how you might engage with the space.

Part of this digital-first model will include grab-and-go items where shoppers (users?) will simply pick up the product scan it with their Best Buy app pay for it through their phone and walk out. This will mainly apply to smaller items like charging cables gift cards and phone cases.

Any larger items that aren’t grab-and-go are still easy to purchase. Scan the QR code on the price tag with your phone and a Blue Shirt will grab it from the back room and ready it at the checkout counter for you.

For now this smaller store is just a pilot in the Charlotte area. If it proves successful they might just roll them out to rest of the U.S. If they downsize their current stores to this new model and place larger appliances and products online this could significantly reduce their overhead.

Unfortunately large appliances usually require an in-person perusal before you purchase it so I don’t know if this would work out in reality.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvc2Ftc3VuZy1xbjkwYi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Samsung QN90B Is the Best TV for Bright Rooms,"In TV land excellent black levels have been the name of the game for nearly a decade. By providing better contrast via new backlighting technologies like organic LEDs (OLED) or mini LEDs companies have slowly given us a more realistic (and less gray) view of our favorite images.

For years now high-end TVs like the new Samsung QN90B have had nearly perfect delineation between light and dark. However many models lacked the powerful brightness you might need to overcome a sunny California afternoon in a modern glass living room.

That’s why if I were shopping for a new high-end screen I’d be sure to consider this model specifically. The thin pedestal-mounted TV has excellent mini LED–driven contrast but at brightness levels that might downright hurt your eyes in a dark room. For watching inside during summer there is probably no better viewing experience.

All Class

Photograph: Samsung

The QN90B is thin but not too thin to easily grip by two people when assembling and mounting it. That's why I’m ashamed to admit that I bonked the corner of my first review unit on my coffee table when mounting it to the included pedestal thus ruining it. (Ed. note: It had to happen sometime Parker!) A few weeks a new unit and a slightly bruised ego later and I repeated the process without incident.

Get it set up and you’ll be impressed by the QN90B’s looks. The pedestal mount really makes it look like the TV is floating behind my soundbar with the screen just high enough to peek over the top. It's a design that's surprisingly rare in modern screens many of which end up getting slightly blocked at the bottom.

Because I use a Samsung phone setup was nearly instantaneous. I just signed in to my Samsung account on my phone told the TV what apps I wanted to download and was off to the races. You still have to sign in to individual apps like Netflix Amazon Prime Video and more but all the apps you’ll need are likely to be here. It even has Paramount+ and Plex apps.

One criticism of Samsung’s Tizen smart TV interface is that it can be a bit difficult to navigate for newbies. You get used to the weird assortment of menus below the single app bar that you’ll actually want to use but it’s easy to get lost among Samsung's free content. Heck to this day I can’t figure out how to add the aforementioned Paramount+ and Plex apps to the home screen. I’m sure there’s a way but I’ve yet to be motivated enough to find it.

I’d encourage Samsung UI designers to take a deeper look at what people actually use these interfaces to do. I don't really need endless lists of suggested items to watch below the actual apps. One thing I absolutely won’t complain about? The remote which is rechargeable via a solar cell on the back. I never have to hunt for pesky AAA batteries again. Eureka!

Looking Good

Once you’ve found something to watch you're sure to be impressed with how it looks on the QN90B. The TV features quantum dot technology for bright colors in high dynamic range.

No we’re not talking about the covid vaccine. DeepMind the UK-based AI laboratory owned by Alphabet released the source code for AlphaFold2. This potential Nobel-winning piece of software can now predict the three-dimensional structure of nearly all proteins the molecular machines that underpin every biological process. And it can do in days that once took scientists years to unravel.

The ability to predict protein structures will enable scientists to develop drugs that can map to these origami-like shapes with atomic accuracy. It shows the full potential of what artificial intelligence is capable of doing to advance human health. Perhaps that’s why there’s been a lot of buzz around – and lots of bucks going to – AI drug discovery companies. Earlier this year we took another look at four publicly traded AI drug discovery companies – all of which are trading at deep discounts thanks to the downturn in tech stocks and the market in general. We decided that only one of them appeared to offer a tolerable amount of risk for our taste. But we’re constantly challenging our assumptions and we’ve never really done a deep dive into Exscientia (EXAI) another UK-based AI company we’ve been tracking since 2019.

Let’s see if we’re missing anything from this particular story.

About Exscientia Stock

Founded 10 years ago Exscientia describes itself as a pharmatech company with an end-to-end AI-powered platform that leverages experimental technologies for identifying potential disease targets and then designing drugs that would be the most effective and safe. It also applies AI throughout the testing and experimental phases including patient selection for clinical trials. (We’ll unpack all that more in just a bit.) Before its October 2021 IPO Exscientia had raised more than $374 million in disclosed funding from names like SoftBank BlackRock and Celgene (before it was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb which is also an investor). The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also added some grant money to the mix.

Last year’s upsized IPO raised $350 million along with another $160 million in private shares bought by SoftBank and the Gates Foundation bringing in a grand total of about $510 million. Today Exscientia stock is trading at less than half of its $22 debut with a market cap of about $1.24 billion. The company ended the first quarter of this year with about $720 million in cash and other liquid assets. While far from profitable Exscientia is not burning crazy amounts of cash – posting a net loss of about $20 million in Q1-2022 and just $66.5 million for all of last year after a fat tax rebate. At that rate the company has years of life left to bring a drug to market though the financial picture is far more complex than that – and our chief complaint about Exscientia in an earlier piece we wrote about it and other AI drug companies.

Before we revisit that argument let’s dig into exactly what Exscientia is doing in AI drug discovery.

The Advantages of Using AI for Drug Discovery

In the company’s own words its AI capabilities include a “wide range of deep learning and machine learning algorithms generative methods active learning and natural language processing.” These different methods determine which diseases to target and how to design the potential drug molecule. The platform also uses AI to analyze individual patient tissues to prioritize which drug molecules will have the best effect – a significant step toward precision medicine.

Just like with AlphaFold2 one of the big advantages is that algorithms can generate drug targets and candidates in just a fraction of the time compared to the business-as-usual approach. Indeed Exscientia claims its platform can generate a likely drug candidate in about one year synthesizing just a fraction of the 2500 molecules that is the industry standard.

Faster to the punch. Credit: Exscientia

One oft-quoted study estimate is that it costs about $1.8 billion and takes more than a decade to develop a new drug. With a success rate of less than 5% one can quickly see the economics of shaving years off the upfront costs especially if automating the process can also boost the chance of success. That’s what the following rather confusing graph tries to illustrate.

AI can not only discover new drugs faster but with (allegedly) a better chance of success which puts more money in the pockets of the pharmaceutical industry. Who can’t get behind that concept? Credit: Exscientia

Yeah we couldn’t quite follow the math either but you can pore over the company’s 404-page SEC filing to learn more. The bottom line: AI can generate drug candidates faster and cheaper with less risk of failure than the lab-based iterative process mainly used today. As we’ll discuss next some big names are big believers in the technology.

The Exscientia AI Drug Discovery Pipeline

Exscientia is running full steam ahead with more than 30 projects in the pipeline. It partners with large pharma companies engages in joint ventures with other biotechs and pharmaceutical companies and also runs its own programs. The majority are focused on oncology and inflammation/immunity.

The company’s most advanced drug EXS-21546 is a cancer immunotherapy treatment that it developed in just nine months out of only 163 compounds. Exscientia claims that it is the first AI-designed drug to enter human clinical trials. The Phase 1a clinical trial began in December 2020 and initial results were released in June 2022 as promised. It didn’t kill anybody so they’re now moving on to Phase 1b/2 to test the drug in patients with solid tumors. In a pre-clinical study EXS-21546 compared favorably to an already-approved anti-tumor drug.

While roughly a third of the current projects are backed by big pharma that’s pretty much where all the revenue is coming from at the moment. Partners include Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) Sanofi Bayer and Evotec. Let’s take a quick look at each partnership.

Exscientia and BMS are collaborating on eight oncology autoimmunity immunology and inflammation projects that originally began with Celgene but was expanded in 2021. So far Exscientia has collected $65 million in upfront payments along with another $20 million in Q3-2021 after BMS opted to license an immune-modulating drug candidate. The deal is potentially worth $1.3 billion not including potential royalties if any of these drugs go all the way.

For Sanofi Exscientia initially delivered a lead drug candidate in the area of inflammation and fibrosis in 2019 for a project worth up to $250 million in preclinical clinical and sales milestone payments. Sanofi must have liked what it saw so far because in January 2022 it entered into a new collaboration to discover and validate up to 15 novel targets in oncology and immunology. It also handed over $100 million in upfront payments in a deal worth up to $5.2 billion.

Bayer is on board for three projects that will target therapeutic areas including pain inflammation and oncology in a deal worth up to about $250 million.

An early investor in Exscientia Evotec has been working with the AI drug discovery company since late 2017. It is a minority owner on the EXS-21546 project as well.

In addition Exscientia has joint ventures (or co-owned business) with another half-dozen biotechs and pharma companies.

Financial Fuzziness

These various business models make it difficult to assess the full financial picture for Exscientia. For instance the company often talks more about its cash flow than its revenues but there is a difference. The former refers to the amount of cash being transferred into and out of a company and is more of an indicator of liquidity. Revenue of course refers to the money earned from the sale of products and services. Both are legitimate ways for investors to measure the financial health of a company though we prefer to stick to revenues – and favor business models like software-as-a–service (SaaS) that provide reliable and consistent recurring revenue streams. You just don’t get that with Exscientia’s business model.

Last year for example the company had more than $85 million in cash flow from collaborations and only $9 million in net cash outflows from operations. Sounds like it barely lost a dime. But when we’re talking about actual revenues it’s a different story: The pharmatech had about $37 million in revenue but losses of more than $75 million before taxes.

Credit: Exscientia

Contrast that to an AI drug discovery company like Schrödinger (SDGR) that has a business model with more consistent revenue streams. It also sports a market cap that is less than twice that of Exscientia but with $100 million more in revenue making it more reasonably valued. Though that $100 million from Sanofi will count as revenue in Q2-2022 likely giving Exscientia its first-ever profitable quarter and putting it on pace with Schrödinger at least for one quarter. Of course we’re not investing in a single quarter but for the long haul. The Exscientia business model is just too fuzzy. While there is potential for some big payoffs each milestone represents a big “if” in terms of success especially with a platform that still remains largely unproven. Like AbCellera and Recursion (two AI drug discovery stocks we like) we want to see more traction before considering an investment.

Conclusion

Exscientia is at the vanguard of the AI drug discovery revolution. It is working with some impressive pharma companies on some potentially highly lucrative deals. Its first clinical trial offered encouraging results. Unlike many early-stage biotechs Exscientia is pulling in meaningful revenue. But it’s very much a feast or famine business model with the big pharma deals (and the company’s own significant war chest) financing the rest of the pipeline related to the co-owned and solo projects. While the company can save upfront time and money in the drug development process it will still take years to find out if its AI platform can design marketable pharmaceuticals. Until then investors will likely see their money ride the ups and downs of clinical trials going nowhere fast.

Laurence Kinlan’s son Orén looked just like a chip off the old block as he appeared in a scene opposite Eve Hewson in his first major film role.

Orén turned 15 last week and Laurence surprised him on the set of the flick ‘Flora and son’ with a birthday cake and a balloon emblazoned with the numbers marking his age.

The teenage actor was pictured with Eve in various street scenes throughout the week during which Bono’s daughter also took after her own father by carrying a cased guitar on her back.

Orén donned a baseball cap for much of his scenes and is playing Eve character’s Flora’s son in the John Carney directed movie.

Given Eve is aged 31 her role as mother to a teenage boy obviously makes her out to be a young mum.

Laurence (39) is best known for playing Elmo Creed in Love/Hate and has also starred alongside Heath Ledge in Ned Kelly as well as Veronica Guerin and The Guard among others.

Married to wife Charlene he has another younger son Ollie and previously revealed that several years ago Orén used to thrive in mortifying him in public by shouting ‘It’s Elmo from Love/Hate!’.

Orén had a small part in 2018 the RTÉ drama drama series Taken Down which created by the makers of Love/Hate and centred on asylum seekers living in Dublin and landlords and starred Orla Fitzgerald Brian Gleeson and Don Wycherley.

He previously had another small role in the independent Irish film Derry which starred Barry Ward and Liam Carney.

Last week we reported on how Amy Huberman dodged a lengthy commute to work as she filmed scenes with Eve for the same movie in a house just six doors away from her south Dublin home.

Stunning Amy could be seen sporting a pair of denim shorts as she went back to work for the first time since her father’s death nearly two months ago.

However unlike the rest of the cast and crew Amy didn’t have far to travel as the scene was shot just six doors away from the home she shares with husband Brian O’Driscoll and their three children in Dublin’s Rathmines.

Dundalk-born Carney’s wife Marcella Plunkett who starred in Bachelor’s Walk is also in the flick and was seen taking part in scenes on Monday in Smithfield in the capital.

The director of photography for the Irish-made film is John Conroy who is boyfriend of Yvonne Connolly Ronan Keating’s ex-wife.

After finishing her scenes Amy changed out of her clothes she was wearing for her part and chose a pair of blue denim shorts matched with a red t-shirt and sandals while clutching a jacket and carrying a rucksack and her phone.

Even though the smiling actress lives just six doors away she hopped into a people carrier before being whisked a short drive home. Her husband Brian was seen going to and from from their home earlier.

Eve whose hair was in a bob was also pictured on the steps of the house wearing the clothes she wore for her role which included an orange jacket white cardigan blue crop top black joggers and white trainers.

In late May Amy mourned the death of her 84-year-old father Harold who passed away four days after his birthday and had a traditional Jewish Kaddish ceremony at a funeral home in Blackrock in south Dublin.

Amy’s husband Brian helped carry the coffin into the hearse before it was removed to Shanganagh cemetery.

Mourners at the time included Laurence Kinlan who starred alongside her in the TV series on Home Ground.

Others at the service included comedian Deirdre O’Kane actress Leigh Arnold and Stanley Townsend father of actor Stuart Townsend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cG9zdC5jby51ay9uZXdzL25vcnRoLXdhbGVzLW5ld3MvdHlwZXMtamVsbHlmaXNoLXlvdXJlLW1vc3QtbGlrZWx5LTIxMDk5NTc20gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlwb3N0LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvbm9ydGgtd2FsZXMtbmV3cy90eXBlcy1qZWxseWZpc2gteW91cmUtbW9zdC1saWtlbHktMjEwOTk1NzYuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The jellyfish you're likely to see on Welsh beaches this summer - and which can sting,"The school summer holidays are in full swing and with more hot weather predicted to hit the region in August we're all headed to the beach. But regardless of whether you plan to dip your toe in the water or dive right in you never know what is lurking around.

Unusual and mysterious creatures frequently wash up on the shores of North Wales. Most are harmless but there are some that could pose a threat and leave you with a nasty injury.

Jellyfish are one of them. The creatures aren't an uncommon sight. There have been numerous occasions where hundreds have washed up on our shores after storms.

We've previously reported how hundreds of giant barrel jellyfish were found scattered on the sand at Glan Don beach in Pwllheli after a stormy weekend. There's also a jellyfish warning for Conwy beaches.

It's important you know what type of jellies you're likely to encounter and what type of threat they pose so that you can keep yourself your little ones and even your pets safe. Especially as the warm weather increases the likely hood of sightings claims experts.

Have you ever been stung? Share in the comments

Wales Online shared a warning from Gower Coast Adventures urging people not to ""freak out"" as some sting and others don't. Posting on Facebook they said: ""A little bit of knowledge about the different types (and whether they sting or not!) can go a long way to helping everyone appreciate the beauty of these creatures. Jellyfish are mesmerising to watch pulsing through the water.

""They are 95% water and have no brain blood or heart. They don’t have eyes but they can sense light. We encounter a variety of different species here often seen on our trips. Some sting and some don’t so if you can tell them apart there’s no need to be afraid of them.""

Six jellyfish you may see on beaches across Wales:

Lion's mane jellyfish

With its large reddish-brown umbrella-shaped bell and mass of long thin hair-like tentacles the lion's mane jellyfish is a striking and beautiful creature. Despite its good looks it has a potentially severe sting which can be painful and could cause some people to go into anaphylactic shock. They can be found off all UK coasts in the summer months.

Portuguese man o' war

Portuguese man o' war are only occasionally reported in UK waters but they are known for their venomous and powerful sting. While it isn’t actually a jellyfish it is closely related and consists of a floating colony of hydrozoans - several tiny marine organisms living together and behaving collectively as if one animal.

They are a blue/purple/pink colour with an air-filled bag which floats on the surface with very long tentacles. Although rare many have washed up in Gower a few years ago in the autumn. Their tentacle-like polyps cause an agonising and potentially lethal sting so they should be avoided and reported to the Marine Conservation Society immediately.

Moon jellyfish

Moon jellyfish are a very common species in the UK. They are transparent umbrella-shaped bell-edged with short hair-like tentacles and four rings towards the centre.

Their sting is mostly harmless though it may have a more severe effect on sensitive skin. Moon jellyfish numbers can increase rapidly as cool seas begin to warm up and large mating aggregations can be found in late summer.

Barrel jellyfish

The barrel jellyfish is surprisingly large. They are robust and spherical with no tentacles but eight thick frilled arms. This jellyfish is quite common in Welsh waters. Its sting like the moon jellyfish is mainly harmless to humans causing little more than mild discomfort.

Blue jellyfish

With purplish-blue lines that radiate visibly through its bell-shaped body the blue jellyfish is another attractive sight in clear waters. It is similar in body shape to a lion's mane but much smaller with a relatively mild sting. Apparently the sting is slightly worse than a nettle sting.

Compass jellyfish

This jellyfish has a variable colour but usually has a pale umbrella-shaped bell with brown V-shaped markings - like the divisions on a compass. The Compass jellyfish has a slightly stronger sting than many of the milder jellyfish species so don't get too close.

Under the agreement New Mountain will take over PerkinElmer’s analytical instrumentation food safety and enterprise services businesses which include a laboratory field services and a portfolio of entities that serve those industries.

When completed the deal will be the largest transaction within the diagnostic-equipment vertical since 2020 and the sixth largest within the broader life sciences vertical according to PitchBook data.





The deal announced Tuesday is New Mountain’s first investment in the sector since January when the firm acquired a majority stake in Covaris a manufacturer of advanced tools enabling life science innovations.

In July 2021 New Mountain acquired Flexan a medical device contract design and manufacturing company through one of the private equity firm’s portfolio companies.

The largest recent deal in the umbrella life sciences vertical came in 2020 when Blackstone The Carlyle Group and Hellman & Friedman acquired Medline a manufacturer and distributor of healthcare supplies for $30 billion.

The FAA approved Boeing (BA)’s proposal that requires specific inspections to verify the condition of the airplane meets requirements and that all work has been completed a move that should allow Boeing (BA) to resume deliveries in August after it halted them in May 2021 the sources said.

On July 17 Boeing told reporters it was “very close” to restarting 787 deliveries.

The FAA referred questions about the approval to Boeing. “We don’t comment on ongoing certifications” the agency said.

Boeing did not confirm the approval Friday but said it “will continue to work transparently with the FAA and our customers towards resuming 787 deliveries.”

Boeing has faced production issues with the 787 for more than two years. In September 2020 the FAA said it was “investigating manufacturing flaws” in some 787 jetliners.

In the aftermath of two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 the FAA pledged to more closely scrutinize Boeing and delegate fewer responsibilities to Boeing for aircraft certification.

Boeing suspended deliveries of the 787 after the FAA raised concerns about its proposed inspection method. The FAA had previously issued two airworthiness directives to address production issues for in-service airplanes and identified a new issue in July 2021.

Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West said this week on an investor call that it had 120 of the 787s in inventory and was “making progress completing the necessary rework to prepare them for delivery.” Boeing is “producing at very low rates and we’ll continue to do so until deliveries resume gradually returning to 5 airplanes per month over time.”

The planemaker had only resumed deliveries in March 2021 after a five-month hiatus before halting them again. Friday’s approval came after lengthy discussions with the FAA.

The regulator had said it wanted Boeing to ensure it “has a robust plan for the re-work that it must perform on a large volume of new 787s in storage” and that “Boeing’s delivery processes are stable.”

The FAA said in February it would retain the authority to issue airworthiness certificates until it is confident “Boeing’s quality control and manufacturing processes consistently produce 787s that meet FAA design standards.”

The agency’s then-administrator Steve Dickson told Reuters in February the FAA needed from Boeing “a systemic fix to their production processes.”

A plane built for American Airlines (AAL) is likely to be the first 787 airplane delivered by Boeing since May 2021 sources said. That could come as soon as next month. American Airlines (AAL) said last week on an earnings call it expects to receive nine 787s this year including two in early August.

Boeing in January disclosed a $3.5 billion charge due to 787 delivery delays and customer concessions and another $1 billion in abnormal production costs stemming from production flaws and related repairs and inspections.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMzAvYnVzaW5lc3MvYm9laW5nLTc4Ny1kcmVhbWxpbmVyLWZhYS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing Gets F.A.A. Go-Ahead for Plan to Resume Deliveries of 787 Dreamliner (Published 2022),"Federal regulators on Friday cleared the way for Boeing to restart deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner which were paused more than a year ago because of quality concerns.

Boeing had submitted a plan to the Federal Aviation Administration this spring to inspect and repair those issues which the agency approved on Friday in a major milestone on the path to delivering the planes according to a person familiar with the decision who wasn’t authorized by the agency to share the news. The F.A.A. will still inspect the jets before they are handed over to Boeing customers.

The Dreamliner is a twin-aisle plane commonly used for long international flights and is an important part of Boeing’s fleet. It appeals to airlines in part because it is more fuel-efficient than older wide-body planes.

The delivery delay had taken a toll both on Boeing and its customers. In January Boeing estimated the cost of performing the repairs and compensating customers for the delay to be about $3.5 billion. Earlier this year American Airlines said that the delivery freeze had forced it to cut several international routes it had planned to fly this summer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vbGVnYWN5LXBvc3RzL2JvZWluZy10by1yZXN1bWUtNzg3LWRlbGl2ZXJpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing Set to Resume Dreamliner Deliveries,"DALLAS - Reports have surfaced that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has informed Boeing that it would approve the company's procedures for validating fixes to each plane before they are delivered to airline customers.

While the decision has not yet been made public by Boeing or the FAA Airways has received confirmation from a reputable source that yesterday (Friday) the FAA approved Boeing’s certification plan for inspections and any rework needed for undelivered 787s to meet the standard to return to delivery. This is one step in the regulatory process.

The next step will be for Boeing to submit documentation that an individual airplane meets the standard and request ticketing.

Boeing would benefit from approval to resume deliveries because it receives a sizable portion of the purchase price of each plane at delivery. About 120 Dreamliner orders from Boeing have not yet been delivered.

Depending on size the Boeing 787 Dreamliner lists for US$248m to US$338M although airlines typically spend much less than that.

Dreamliner Woes

The aircraft has been beset by a number of production challenges since late 2020. Small gaps were discovered between carbon composite panels of the fuselage that year which was when problems with the Boeing 787 first surfaced.

Inspections were initiated as a result and they uncovered issues with a pressurization bulkhead at the front of the aircraft.

Following the discovery that an Italian Boeing supplier had utilized alloys that did not comply with FAA regulations the company also had to replace titanium components including fasteners.

The Dreamliner Backlog

The length of time it will take Boeing to deliver all 120 backlog 787s which were produced in South Carolina and Washington state factories is unknown.

American Airlines (AA) chief financial officer Derek Kerr stated last week on a conference call to discuss quarterly earnings that the carrier anticipates receiving its first two 787s ""in early August"" but won't be adding them to the schedule until November.

If the reports are true the American aerospace company will have overcome a significant regulatory hurdle to get its new 787s into the hands of its customers. The last deliveries of the Dreamliner took place in May 2021.

We've reached out to Boeing for comment. The company states that none of the issues it is addressing have an immediate safety impact on the in-service fleet.

According to the planemaker the 787 is performing well and has been ""the most utilized widebody through the pandemic because of its fuel efficiency; also many airlines used it to carry cargo when passenger traffic was low.""

Boeing CEO David Calhoun stated last month that he was confident the deliveries of the type would resume this summer.

This is a developing story.

Boeing and Muilenburg did not return messages seeking comment. Smith could not be reached. No attorneys for the defendants are identified in court documents.

Following the crashes that killed 346 passengers and crew Boeing in early 2021 agreed to pay $2.5 billion in to resolve a Department of Justice charge alleging a conspiracy to defraud the FAA's evaluation of the airplane—a settlement that has been challenged by families of victims.

The 737 Max was an upgraded model of the workhorse 737 that used larger engines to add efficiencies in an effort to compete with rival Airbus. But the change affected the plane's aerodynamics and critics charged that Boeing opted for a cheap fix and didn't fully inform pilots about it.

""Rather than fix the aerodynamics through structural changes to the airplane—which would have been time consuming expensive and prevented the 737 MAX from being quickly certified as a remodeled version of one of Boeing’s other airplanes—Boeing added a Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) to the airplane’s flight control software"" the suit says.

When Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea in October 2018 killing all 189 aboard ""the cause of the crash was a mystery to everyone except (the) defendants"" the complaint says citing ""serious qualify and safety concerns"" raised by a whistleblower over ""schedule pressure"" put on employees.

""Nevertheless over the next five months defendants repeatedly reassured investors that the 737 MAX was safe"" the lawsuit alleges. ""Defendants also cast aspersions on the Lion Air pilots and told flight crews that they could deactivate MCAS by simply following 'existing procedures' set forth in the 737 MAX’s flight manual. But MCAS was neither described in the 737 MAX’s flight manual nor had it ever been used on one of Boeing’s commercial airplanes before.""

When Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed in March 2019 killing 157 the 737 Max was grounded by regulators and the Securities & Exchange Commission launched a probe into Boeing's disclosures to investors.

Muilenberg is now CEO of blank-check company New Vista Acquisition which raised $240 million in a 2020 initial public offering but has yet to acquire any holdings in its target aerospace and defense sectors.

Some cat lovers have reacted emotionally to this month’s decision and put the key scientist behind it on the defensive.

Wojciech Solarz a biologist at the state-run Polish Academy of Sciences wasn’t prepared for the disapproving public response when he entered “Felis catus” the scientific name for the common house cat into a national database run by the academy’s Institute of Nature Conservation.

The database already had 1786 other species listed with no objections Solarz told The Associated Press on Tuesday. The uproar over invasive alien species No. 1787 he said may have resulted from some media reports that created the false impression his institute was calling for feral and other cats to be euthanized.

Solarz described the growing scientific consensus that domestic cats have a harmful impact on biodiversity given the number of birds and mammals they hunt and kill.

The criteria for including the cat among alien invasive species “are 100% met by the cat” he said.

In a television segment aired by independent broadcaster TVN the biologist faced off last week against a veterinarian who challenged Solarz’s conclusion on the dangers cats pose to wildlife.

Dorota Suminska the author of a book titled “The Happy Cat” pointed to other causes of shrinking biodiversity including a polluted environment and urban building facades that can kill birds in flight.

“Ask if man is on the list of non-invasive alien species” Suminska said arguing that cats were unfairly assigned too much blame.

Solarz pushed back arguing that cats kill about 140 million birds in Poland each year.

Earlier this month the Polish Academy institute published a post on its website citing the “controversy” and seeking to clarify its position. The institute stressed that it was “opposed to any cruelty towards animals.” It also argued that its classification was in line with European Union guidelines.

As far as categorizing cats as “alien” the institute noted that “Felis catus” was domesticated probably around 10000 years ago in the cradle of the great civilizations of the ancient Middle East making the species alien to Europe from a strictly scientific point of view.

The institute also stressed that all it was recommending was for cat owners to limit the time their pets spend outdoors during bird breeding season.

“I have a dog but I don’t have anything against cats” Solarz said.",,,,,,

He was trying to find molecules to fight HIV and to better understand drug resistance.

“I remember this idea struck me that there must be a better way to do drug discovery other than the complex and expensive way everyone was following” he says. “Why couldn’t we design an automated approach to drug design that would use all the information in parallel so that even a humble PhD student could create a medicine? That idea really stuck with me. I remember almost the exact moment to this day. And that was the genesis of the idea that eventually became Exscientia.”

It was to prove a lucrative brainwave. Hopkins set up the company in 2012 as a spinout from the University of Dundee where he was by then working as a professor. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) systems which are being trained to mimic human creativity to develop new medicines. This involves the use of automated computer algorithms to sift through large datasets to design novel compounds that can treat diseases and to help select the right patients for each treatment.

Best advice he has been given “My dad worked in a factory. He said to me: ‘Get a good education and get a job you enjoy doing. It’s worth an extra six grand a year.’ And I definitely got a job I enjoy doing.”

Biggest career mistake “It’s too early to tell.” He quotes Miles Davis: “It’s not the note you play that’s the wrong note – it’s the note you play afterwards that makes it right or wrong.”

Words he overuses “Fundamentally”; “the heart of the matter”.

How he relaxes Reading and dog walking. “I am a bibliophile. I immerse myself in books to relax.”

This approach drastically cuts the time of drug development. Hopkins says that for Exscientia’s pipeline it has typically taken 12 to 15 months from starting a project to identifying a drug candidate compared with four and a half years in the traditional pharmaceutical industry.

The average cost of developing a medicine is $2bn according to Deloitte’s latest pharma report and many drugs fail – the failure rate is 90% for medicines that are in early clinical studies (where they are tested on humans).

Typically pharma companies make 2500 compounds to test them against a specific disease while AI enables Oxford-based Exscientia to whittle down that number to about 250 Hopkins says. “It’s a much more methodical approach.”

We are British. But to be seen as a global company we listed on what is the global technology index which is Nasdaq Andrew Hopkins

Last autumn the Welsh scientist became one of Britain’s richest entrepreneurs with a paper fortune of £400m after the company achieved a $2.9bn stock market debut on Nasdaq in New York making it one of Britain’s biggest biotech firms. Hopkins’s stake of nearly 16% is now worth £170m as the share price has lost 60% of its value in a bloodbath for Wall Street stocks.

Exscientia was part of a transatlantic trend that is defying government attempts to build a biotech powerhouse in the UK. Abcam a pioneering Cambridge antibody company recently announced it was moving its stock market listing from the UK to the US. “We are a British company; we choose to be in Oxford because we can attract global talent” Hopkins says. “But to be seen as a global company we listed on what is the global technology index which is Nasdaq. What we have now is an incredibly international shareholder base from across the world.”

The business came up with the first AI-designed drug to enter clinical trials – a treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder in partnership with Japan’s Sumitomo although Sumitomo later decided not to proceed with it. The Japanese firm is currently studying another drug developed by Exscientia for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease psychosis in early human trials.

Hopkins now 50 fell in love with science thanks to an inspirational chemistry teacher. He has worked as a scientist since the age of 16 when he did a stint in industrial chemistry at the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales which he says taught him about the benefits of automation in boosting productivity.

He spent nearly a decade at the US drug giant Pfizer where he was on a “data warehouse” project that led to some of the first machine-learning applications in the pharmaceutical industry with the findings published in Nature in 2006.

During the subsequent five years at Dundee University he further researched applying data mining and machine learning to drug discovery. He says “being a professor is actually one of the best jobs in the world” and gave him the freedom to research AI methods at length. He maintains his links with the university where he is honorary chair of medicinal informatics at the School of Life Sciences.

Exscientia (which means “from knowledge” in Latin) soon moved to the Schrödinger Building at the Oxford science park and now employs 450 people worldwide from Vienna to Boston Miami and Osaka equally split between AI engineering chemistry and biology.

It is building a new robotics laboratory at Milton Park near Oxford focused on the automation of chemistry and biology to accelerate drug development and its declared goal is “drugs designed by AI made by robot”. Other pharma companies have also introduced some automation into their processes but generally lab technology is similar to how it was when he was a student in the 1990s Hopkins says.

The firm is involved in 30 projects some in partnership with big pharmaceutical companies including France’s Sanofi and the US firm Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS). It is also working with Oxford University on developing medicines that target neuroinflammation for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Among the firm’s solo projects a cancer drug for solid tumours is about to go into early clinical trials.

Exscientia is also working on a broader coronavirus pill to rival Paxlovid the Covid-19 treatment made by Hopkins’s former employer Pfizer. This work is funded by a $1.5m grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which took a stake in Exscientia. The company’s other investors include BMS Celgene (now a BMS subsidiary) and Germany’s Evotec as well as Japan’s Softbank the US fund manager BlackRock and the life science investor Novo Holdings.

Hopkins says the team has identified a set of molecules that could work as a broader treatment for Covid-19 new mutations and other coronaviruses and that there will be more news later this year. The firm is aiming for a low-cost pill that could be distributed globally and given quickly to people who fall ill to prevent serious illness and hospitalisation. Covid-19 infections are rising again in 110 countries and the World Health Organization’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned that the pandemic is far from over.

Firms across the pharmaceutical industry have started using AI in recent years. AstraZeneca is investing heavily in it for its entire research and development infrastructure and GSK has built an AI team of 120 engineers with plans to reach 160 next year making it the largest such in-house team in the industry.

AI systems require a lot of computing power and enormous datasets. Their use should boost the number of new drugs being approved every year – typically 40 to 50 in the US – to many more. Hopkins confidently predicts: “This is the way all drugs will be designed in the future. In the next decade this technology will become ubiquitous.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzlhYmQyNjQ2LTU1NjItNGEzMi05YmI4LTE5NjQ1ZWQ4NjAxZtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chinese anger over Taiwan visit grows after Nancy Pelosi departs on Asia tour,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

No we’re not talking about the covid vaccine. DeepMind the UK-based AI laboratory owned by Alphabet released the source code for AlphaFold2. This potential Nobel-winning piece of software can now predict the three-dimensional structure of nearly all proteins the molecular machines that underpin every biological process. And it can do in days that once took scientists years to unravel.

The ability to predict protein structures will enable scientists to develop drugs that can map to these origami-like shapes with atomic accuracy. It shows the full potential of what artificial intelligence is capable of doing to advance human health. Perhaps that’s why there’s been a lot of buzz around – and lots of bucks going to – AI drug discovery companies. Earlier this year we took another look at four publicly traded AI drug discovery companies – all of which are trading at deep discounts thanks to the downturn in tech stocks and the market in general. We decided that only one of them appeared to offer a tolerable amount of risk for our taste. But we’re constantly challenging our assumptions and we’ve never really done a deep dive into Exscientia (EXAI) another UK-based AI company we’ve been tracking since 2019.

Let’s see if we’re missing anything from this particular story.

About Exscientia Stock

Founded 10 years ago Exscientia describes itself as a pharmatech company with an end-to-end AI-powered platform that leverages experimental technologies for identifying potential disease targets and then designing drugs that would be the most effective and safe. It also applies AI throughout the testing and experimental phases including patient selection for clinical trials. (We’ll unpack all that more in just a bit.) Before its October 2021 IPO Exscientia had raised more than $374 million in disclosed funding from names like SoftBank BlackRock and Celgene (before it was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb which is also an investor). The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also added some grant money to the mix.

Last year’s upsized IPO raised $350 million along with another $160 million in private shares bought by SoftBank and the Gates Foundation bringing in a grand total of about $510 million. Today Exscientia stock is trading at less than half of its $22 debut with a market cap of about $1.24 billion. The company ended the first quarter of this year with about $720 million in cash and other liquid assets. While far from profitable Exscientia is not burning crazy amounts of cash – posting a net loss of about $20 million in Q1-2022 and just $66.5 million for all of last year after a fat tax rebate. At that rate the company has years of life left to bring a drug to market though the financial picture is far more complex than that – and our chief complaint about Exscientia in an earlier piece we wrote about it and other AI drug companies.

Before we revisit that argument let’s dig into exactly what Exscientia is doing in AI drug discovery.

The Advantages of Using AI for Drug Discovery

In the company’s own words its AI capabilities include a “wide range of deep learning and machine learning algorithms generative methods active learning and natural language processing.” These different methods determine which diseases to target and how to design the potential drug molecule. The platform also uses AI to analyze individual patient tissues to prioritize which drug molecules will have the best effect – a significant step toward precision medicine.

Just like with AlphaFold2 one of the big advantages is that algorithms can generate drug targets and candidates in just a fraction of the time compared to the business-as-usual approach. Indeed Exscientia claims its platform can generate a likely drug candidate in about one year synthesizing just a fraction of the 2500 molecules that is the industry standard.

One oft-quoted study estimate is that it costs about $1.8 billion and takes more than a decade to develop a new drug. With a success rate of less than 5% one can quickly see the economics of shaving years off the upfront costs especially if automating the process can also boost the chance of success. That’s what the following rather confusing graph tries to illustrate.

AI can not only discover new drugs faster but with (allegedly) a better chance of success which puts more money in the pockets of the pharmaceutical industry. Who can’t get behind that concept? Credit: Exscientia

Yeah we couldn’t quite follow the math either but you can pore over the company’s 404-page SEC filing to learn more. The bottom line: AI can generate drug candidates faster and cheaper with less risk of failure than the lab-based iterative process mainly used today. As we’ll discuss next some big names are big believers in the technology.

The Exscientia AI Drug Discovery Pipeline

Exscientia is running full steam ahead with more than 30 projects in the pipeline. It partners with large pharma companies engages in joint ventures with other biotechs and pharmaceutical companies and also runs its own programs. The majority are focused on oncology and inflammation/immunity.

The company’s most advanced drug EXS-21546 is a cancer immunotherapy treatment that it developed in just nine months out of only 163 compounds. Exscientia claims that it is the first AI-designed drug to enter human clinical trials. The Phase 1a clinical trial began in December 2020 and initial results were released in June 2022 as promised. It didn’t kill anybody so they’re now moving on to Phase 1b/2 to test the drug in patients with solid tumors. In a pre-clinical study EXS-21546 compared favorably to an already-approved anti-tumor drug.

While roughly a third of the current projects are backed by big pharma that’s pretty much where all the revenue is coming from at the moment. Partners include Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) Sanofi Bayer and Evotec. Let’s take a quick look at each partnership.

Exscientia and BMS are collaborating on eight oncology autoimmunity immunology and inflammation projects that originally began with Celgene but was expanded in 2021. So far Exscientia has collected $65 million in upfront payments along with another $20 million in Q3-2021 after BMS opted to license an immune-modulating drug candidate. The deal is potentially worth $1.3 billion not including potential royalties if any of these drugs go all the way.

For Sanofi Exscientia initially delivered a lead drug candidate in the area of inflammation and fibrosis in 2019 for a project worth up to $250 million in preclinical clinical and sales milestone payments. Sanofi must have liked what it saw so far because in January 2022 it entered into a new collaboration to discover and validate up to 15 novel targets in oncology and immunology. It also handed over $100 million in upfront payments in a deal worth up to $5.2 billion.

Bayer is on board for three projects that will target therapeutic areas including pain inflammation and oncology in a deal worth up to about $250 million.

An early investor in Exscientia Evotec has been working with the AI drug discovery company since late 2017. It is a minority owner on the EXS-21546 project as well.

In addition Exscientia has joint ventures (or co-owned business) with another half-dozen biotechs and pharma companies.

Financial Fuzziness

These various business models make it difficult to assess the full financial picture for Exscientia. For instance the company often talks more about its cash flow than its revenues but there is a difference. The former refers to the amount of cash being transferred into and out of a company and is more of an indicator of liquidity. Revenue of course refers to the money earned from the sale of products and services. Both are legitimate ways for investors to measure the financial health of a company though we prefer to stick to revenues – and favor business models like software-as-a–service (SaaS) that provide reliable and consistent recurring revenue streams. You just don’t get that with Exscientia’s business model.

Last year for example the company had more than $85 million in cash flow from collaborations and only $9 million in net cash outflows from operations. Sounds like it barely lost a dime. But when we’re talking about actual revenues it’s a different story: The pharmatech had about $37 million in revenue but losses of more than $75 million before taxes.

Credit: Exscientia

Contrast that to an AI drug discovery company like Schrödinger (SDGR) that has a business model with more consistent revenue streams. It also sports a market cap that is less than twice that of Exscientia but with $100 million more in revenue making it more reasonably valued. Though that $100 million from Sanofi will count as revenue in Q2-2022 likely giving Exscientia its first-ever profitable quarter and putting it on pace with Schrödinger at least for one quarter. Of course we’re not investing in a single quarter but for the long haul. The Exscientia business model is just too fuzzy. While there is potential for some big payoffs each milestone represents a big “if” in terms of success especially with a platform that still remains largely unproven. Like AbCellera and Recursion (two AI drug discovery stocks we like) we want to see more traction before considering an investment.

Conclusion

Exscientia is at the vanguard of the AI drug discovery revolution. It is working with some impressive pharma companies on some potentially highly lucrative deals. Its first clinical trial offered encouraging results. Unlike many early-stage biotechs Exscientia is pulling in meaningful revenue. But it’s very much a feast or famine business model with the big pharma deals (and the company’s own significant war chest) financing the rest of the pipeline related to the co-owned and solo projects. While the company can save upfront time and money in the drug development process it will still take years to find out if its AI platform can design marketable pharmaceuticals. Until then investors will likely see their money ride the ups and downs of clinical trials going nowhere fast.

After the 2023 season wrapped Brown was ready to take his game to the top level of college football in the Southeastern Conference. He turned down scholarships from Auburn Louisville and others in favor of heading to Columbia.

“I came here to be a complete receiver” Brown said during a recent appearance on The Garnet Trust Hour.

Brown arrived in January going through winter workouts before spring ball got ramped up. Once practice began Shane Beamer and his staff made the decision to shift Brown from an exclusive slot player to an outside receiver.

He’s enjoyed the transition so far.

“I feel like if I can play inside and outside that’ll be better for me. I would say the big difference for me is having somebody in front of you the whole game. I’m not really used to that. I’m used to free access” he explained.

Playing outside has also opened up more route options for Brown who had identified his route running as an area that he wanted to improve after last season.

“That’s really one thing that I need to work on” said Brown. “Like at Coastal we were in a triple option offense so I wasn’t really running routes like that. One thing I’m really going to harp on this summer is the route tree and the mental aspect of the game.”

Brown noted that the competition level – facing off against guys like OD Fortune Judge Collier and other South Carolina defensive backs this spring – is making him better.

“I love to compete. I go against OD every day and OD really opened my eyes. I was like this is what I’ve got. I feel like Judge is really going to make me take that next step.

Starr Brown a Black transgender woman was killed in Memphis Tennessee on April 19. She was 28 years old.

Police found Brown’s body at approximately 9:30 a.m. inside a crashed car on Rolling Woods Drive according to reports from local news station WHBQ which misgendered Brown and used her legal name in its initial coverage. Brown had been fatally shot in the side.

On April 28 Alexavier Williamson 20 reportedly confessed to the killing in a statement to Memphis police telling homicide investigators he had shot Brown in a wooded area near the roadway. Williamson worked with Brown at a local restaurant where surveillance footage allegedly showed the two entering Brown’s car together at around 2:30 a.m. on the morning of her death. Williamson has been charged with second-degree homicide.

Jasmine Tasaki founder of trans-led nonprofit WeCareTennessee said she was saddened to live “in a time where Black transwomen are murdered with no outrage” in a statement to the Human Rights Campaign this week.

“Our community continues to suffer yet we find ways to go on” Tasaki said. “It is with deep hurt that I say Starr Brown’s name. She is now with the ancestors and can rest. It’s our duty to push harder for liberation for our people; we can only save ourselves.”

As HRC’s report noted news of Brown’s death prompted an outpouring of grief among friends and family who remembered her as a “beautiful soul” and someone who uplifted those around her. In addition to her restaurant work Brown’s social media profiles indicate that she was an adult content creator as well and had garnered a large following on X formerly Twitter. Local news reports (which also used Brown’s legal name) also indicate that Brown had previously been shot as recently as October when she was the target of an attempted armed robbery.

Brown is among the latest victims in a rising tide of violence targeting trans communities particularly Black trans people. Her death came barely two weeks prior to the hit-and-run killing of local icon Kita Bee in Kansas City MO.

Justin Brown who was appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt in 2019 will resign Aug. 19.

During his tenure at DHS the agency successfully clinched $32.5 million in new funding to clear the state's developmental disabilities waiting list which was widely praised as a landmark achievement.

Under Brown's leadership DHS has also earned high marks for its implementation of the Pinnacle Plan according to a news release. The Pinnacle Plan was the result of a unique settlement in which the state agreed to reform its child welfare system in key areas following a 2008 class-action lawsuit on behalf of children who were allegedly neglected and abused in foster care.

DHS also recently reinvested some of its unspent Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program funds by awarding $27 million to various nonprofits that offer family stability programs.

In an attempt to determine how DHS could better serve its customers Brown helped craft a new vision for the agency called True North.

A news release from the agency said Brown's tenure at DHS was defined by increased transparency and government innovation.

DHS permanently shuttered dozens of its offices across the state during the pandemic which the agency said was done to modernize its operations.

Brown thanked Stitt for the appointment. The governor will pick Brown's successor.

“It has been my great honor to have the opportunity to serve alongside some of the most kind-hearted people who are also warriors for vulnerable children and adults"" Brown said in a news release. ""I also can’t say enough to convey my genuine thanks to our state legislative partners for their support these last three years.”

In a series of tweets Stitt praised Brown's leadership at DHS and his willingness to step away from the private sector to work in state government. Prior to the appointment Brown was the CEO of Choice Capital Partners an ownership group for a chain of senior living facilities.

One of the largest state agencies DHS is responsible for helping some of the state's most vulnerable residents. The agency helps people with developmental disabilities aging populations and oversees adult protective services child welfare programs child support services and the licensing and monitoring of child care assistance programs.

Musk Lawsuit,"The bird versus the billionaire. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer. Photo: Patrick Pleul - Pool/AFP via Getty Images

At one point in my life not that long ago during my tenure as a lawyer at a large New York firm I spent my days trying to persuade judges that the word and really meant or.

In one particular case billions of dollars turned on the distinction which was at the center of a set of lawsuits that had been filed by lenders to the gaming company Caesars Entertainment owner of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and a bunch of other casinos. In early 2015 the company’s main operating subsidiary filed for bankruptcy which set off sprawling legal maneuvers by the holders of roughly $18 billion in Caesars debt. Basically they were looking to get their money back after the company was gutted. A key front in the court battle was a provision that relieved the parent company of liability if three specific conditions had occurred.

Two of the three had. In the contracts the conditions were separated by the word and so the bondholders argued that all three conditions had to occur in order for the parent company to skate free. The logic of the provision however suggested that the word and had been intended to be disjunctive rather than conjunctive — meaning that the occurrence of any one of the conditions (as opposed to all three) would suffice to terminate the guarantee. In other words and really meant or.

The defense — that is my side — was reasonably successful. In the end the parent company avoided being held liable bondholders took a modest hit and the whole thing has been relegated to the annals of high-stakes corporate litigation — once closely followed by the financial press but now mostly forgotten.

All of this is to say that I have a deep and hard-earned understanding of cases like Twitter v. Musk — seemingly ridiculous maneuvering in court battles between rich people and companies. This recent lawsuit of course was brought by Twitter over Elon Musk’s effort to withdraw from his agreement to buy the company. On Thursday the court announced trial dates: the action will happen October 17–21 before a judge in Delaware. Late Friday Musk filed a 164-page answer and countersuit that is currently under seal pending the resolution of redactions for sensitive non-public information.

Whether we actually get a trial remains to be seen. On the surface these major corporate cases tend to look like intractable conflicts headed toward a dramatic final verdict that will give one side total victory and the other total defeat. But from the inside they tend to be subtle tactical battles where the only real stakes are slightly more or less favorable terms of an inevitable deal. Most major corporate cases settle before trial — the actual litigation functions as a sort of proxy drama over the eventual terms. If things are going well for your side in the early going you adjust your settlement demands upward and vice versa. Billionaires and large public companies generally do not like uncertainty and for that reason they tend to avoid trials with huge amounts of money on the line which can be the most uncertain of undertakings. (Of course one question that looms over this particular proceeding is whether the world’s richest man might be playing by a different set of rules.)

We are still in the early stages of this jostling. So what are they both trying to achieve in their various maneuvers and legal gambits?

Twitter is likely to seek a ruling from the court that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the terms of the agreement with Musk. A decision like that would be a best-case scenario allowing the company to head off a trial that Musk has every incentive to make as protracted and embarrassing for the company as possible.

For Musk’s lawyers’ part their principal job at the moment is to head off a quick ruling against their client which means they need to create the appearance of as many legitimate and legally material factual disputes as possible — which likely helps to explain the absurd length of Musk’s response. They have claimed that before a trial they would need “at least 30–40 fact depositions and at least 12 expert depositions in total” including “the principals and advisors that negotiated the merger top management board members data science and audit personnel familiar with Twitter’s spam and false account detection procedures finance and advertising executives and executives knowledgeable about Twitter’s operational changes.” In its particulars this position is absurd — cases of this complexity can be resolved by far fewer depositions and experts (if any) — but directionally the argument is consistent with the strategy of someone who is on the defense in a case that has the potential to move very quickly and not in their favor. It’s not wrong to say that their top objective here is to plausibly find ways to waste everyone’s time. Twitter has claimed that the “uncertainty” caused by the Tesla billionaire’s efforts to get out of the deal adversely impacted the company’s most recent quarterly-earnings figures so the longer this drags out the better it ends up being for Musk and his efforts to wriggle out of a deal with a company that is not faring well at the moment.

There are two factors — even beyond Musk’s celebrity and Twitter’s familiarity — that amp up this dispute and make it much more interesting to observe than the average high-stakes corporate scrap. The first is Musk’s aforementioned wild-card psychology — it’s not at all clear that he will do the things that 99 percent of participants in cases like this do. The second is Twitter’s peculiar bind. There has been much talk in the press about how awful the public fight with Musk has been for Twitter’s business but even if that is true this does not mean that Twitter should — or even can — try to settle the case as quickly as possible. For better or worse the company’s legal claim against Musk may now be its single most valuable asset and the board has a fiduciary duty to its shareholders to maximize the value of that claim even if that ultimately means trying to force Musk to go through with a deal to buy a company that he may no longer want and that he has thoroughly trashed since agreeing to buy it.

What follows is an overview of the landscape of this case based on my time in the corporate-litigation game.

.

The two sides are nicely lawyered up for this fight. Twitter is represented by Wachtell Lipton which is famous for maintaining just one office in midtown Manhattan and for overworking its junior lawyers (even by the standards of large New York firms) which is why it may be the most profitable firm in the country. Simpson Thacher represented Twitter in its deal negotiations with Musk and continues to represent the company’s board. The firm once had a (dubious) reputation for being a slightly kinder and gentler workplace amid the general hellscape of life at big firms in the city.

Musk is represented by Skadden another highly profitable member of the New York–based Big Law elite as well as Quinn Emanuel which has represented Musk in the past and has a reputation for being particularly mercenary and aggressive — at least by the standards of bloodless white-collar lawyering. The lead Quinn Emanuel lawyer representing Musk once found himself in hot water after speaking with victims of Harvey Weinstein about representing them while he was in the process of leaving the law firm that was working for Weinstein himself. (I once litigated against him when I was still a prosecutor — a perfectly amiable affair that ended rather awkwardly for the firm.)

Expensive lawyers with impressive pedigrees in a high-profile legal battle can seem gladiatorial and intimidating. The reality tends to be a lot less glamorous. Most of the pretrial work will take the form of youngish paunchy lawyers no one has ever heard of drafting things at their desks until late in the night (briefs discovery requests deposition outlines a 164-page answer/countersuit and the like) with the older lead lawyers providing strategic direction and the final changes to all of those documents. It used to be that these legal foot soldiers — the associates and junior partners — at least had to get dressed up and go to the office to do this but plenty of them are still working in their pajamas much of the time.

No one on the outside can say for sure how much all of these lawyers will cost but one estimate puts it at “a potential eight-figure legal bill” for each side divided among the legal teams. That sounds about right and it sounds like a lot but it is a drop in the bucket for these firms. Skadden’s revenue last year alone exceeded $3 billion.

The reason is not simply that these firms do a lot of work for a lot of different clients but also because the most lucrative white-collar litigation work involves representing companies in protracted years-long lawsuits and investigations (of both the internal and governmental variety) — ideally with no real time constraints. These are the sorts of undertakings that involve lots of documents lots of witnesses lots of obscure and debatable legal issues and procedures — and in turn lots of billable hours at rates that can now reach upward of $2000 per hour for the most experienced lawyers and around $1000 per hour for even relatively junior ones.

.

Twitter v. Musk does not have the hallmarks of one of these cash-cow disputes — to put it mildly. After Twitter filed its lawsuit against Musk most legal observers quickly concluded with good reason that Twitter is on much stronger legal footing than Musk is. (One expert I spoke with before Musk’s filing on Friday who asked not to be quoted by name went so far as to say that Skadden “should be feeling a little embarrassed” about the weakness of Musk’s defense.)

Twitter filed its lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery which specializes in arcane corporate litigation but the case is a conceptually simple one: a single breach-of-contract claim premised on Musk’s effort to terminate the merger agreement that the two sides executed back in April. Twitter sought an expedited pretrial schedule over Musk’s objection so when the presiding judge first ruled that she would set aside five days for a trial in October it was an early win for Twitter.

At the time of the agreement Musk agreed to pay $54.20 per share — a 38 percent premium over where the stock was trading at the time. After the parties signed the deal however the market continued its year-to-date slide Tesla’s stock price took a huge hit and Musk’s wealth along with that of the rest of the billionaire boys’ club shrunk significantly. Meanwhile Musk loudly claimed that Twitter may have misled regulators and the public about the number of bots on the platform which the company has consistently said in public filings represents less than 5 percent of the company’s monetizable daily active users (“mDAU” for short).

As many observers have noted by now this all seems to have been quite backward. Musk’s deal with Twitter had no due-diligence condition so when he executed the merger agreement he effectively signed away his ability to quibble with the company over its financial condition and operations. Musk nevertheless claims that Twitter’s possible misrepresentations about bots might amount to a “material adverse effect” on the business which under the terms of the merger agreement would allow Musk to get out of the deal.

Delaware courts have proven extraordinarily reluctant to make such a finding. “There’s been exactly one in the history of Delaware” noted Ann M. Lipton a law professor at Tulane who studies corporate governance and once worked as a securities and corporate litigator. “It was big headline news” she explained but “the differences between that case and this one are quite stark.” In that case which involved the acquisition of a drug manufacturer there was “not only a dramatic drop in revenues” on the part of the acquisition target but “the company turned out to be dramatically and horrifically out of compliance with FDA requirements.” Here Musk has thus far offered no real evidence that Twitter’s figure based on its proprietary metrics is actually wrong — much less so wrong that the truth would effectively destroy the company’s business prospects.

Musk has claimed that Twitter violated an “information covenant” in the merger agreement which required Twitter to “furnish promptly … all information concerning the business properties and personnel of” Twitter “for any reasonable business purpose related to the consummation” of the deal. Morgan Ricks a law professor at Vanderbilt who once worked as a mergers and acquisitions lawyer at Wachtell and conducted merger arbitrage for the hedge fund Citadel took a similarly dim view of this argument telling me that Musk was apparently “trying to do a proctology exam on the company and that’s not what an information covenant in an M&A deal is about. It’s not a way to do diligence. It’s a way to get the deal done.”

Finally Musk has claimed that Twitter violated the “ordinary course” covenant in the deal which required Twitter to use “its commercially reasonable efforts” to conduct its operations “in the ordinary course of business.” Musk has complained about a handful of Twitter’s recent personnel decisions but the phrase “commercially reasonable efforts” is notoriously loose and company-friendly so Musk is likely to face an uphill battle on this front too.

For the moment the details of what is in Musk’s countersuit from Friday are unclear but the length and quality of a legal filing are often inversely correlated and again Musk’s overriding strategic objective is to make this litigation as unwieldy and convoluted as possible even if he ultimately has little to work with. After the filing the Wall Street Journal reported based on discussions with “people familiar with the matter” that one of Musk’s counterclaims “is expected to center on the allegation that Twitter changed its number of monetizable daily active users shortly after agreeing to the deal and then didn’t provide thorough responses to request by Mr. Musk’s team for data on the spam number” — an assertion that suggests the unsurprising possibility that Musk has converted some of his legal defenses (that Twitter violated its obligations under the merger agreement) into affirmative mirrored legal claims of his own. To the extent that is what Musk’s lawyers have done it will not necessarily make the arguments any better.

It is also not clear that Musk’s latest salvo will slow things down at all. The filing was made pursuant to a scheduling order that contemplated the filing as part of a broader case management plan and that gives Twitter until the end of the day on August 4 to file a response.

.

If you were to strip out the identities of the parties in this little fact pattern — the Twitter and Musk of it all — this would not be a particularly attractive or suspenseful dispute except perhaps for corporate litigators and academics whose jobs are to follow minute developments in Delaware court interpretations of M&A law. The legal issues are perhaps novel but not terribly interesting and the most salient factual dispute concerning Twitter’s measurement of bots on the platform is likely to be a technical morass if it really needs to be fully explored.

In the ordinary course it is not even clear that a court would allow the case to go to trial since a judge could conclude that Musk’s factual claims — the questions about the bots the complaints about the information that Musk received from the company the gripes about the personnel decisions — are legally insufficient to terminate the deal under the language of the contract — even assuming that his assertions are correct.

“I’m not convinced the case needs discovery” Lipton told me. “He hasn’t even made a good case that he actually needs the spam information.”

Ricks noted that the presiding judge would likely feel some pressure to “give both parties a fair hearing” at trial — including by allowing each side “to put on the stand people who are involved in the deal just to get to the bottom of what was meant by particular contractual terms and what actually happens in the supply of information after the deal was signed and everything. I personally think it’s really unlikely that there’s not a trial” — assuming that there is not a settlement.

Twitter’s lawsuit seeks “specific performance” of the agreement which would mean a court order that Musk has to go through with the deal at the price set forth in the merger agreement. Rulings like this in Delaware have historically been very rare but as it happens the judge presiding over Twitter’s lawsuit issued one of the few rulings like this in a case last year — another bad sign for Musk’s litigation prospects. The court might also rule against Musk but conclude that the company is only entitled to the $1 billion termination fee provided by the contract — a figure that at least with the benefit of hindsight was far too low. (One very rough and unscientific way of understanding the gross inadequacy of the fee is that the delta between the company’s current market cap and the $44 billion valuation reflected in the Musk deal is more than $10 billion.)

Of course an out-of-court resolution remains very possible — perhaps even likely. Conceptually a settlement in which Musk agrees to pay a higher termination fee or Twitter agrees to accept a price lower than $54.20 per share are both possible. This does not necessarily need to happen before the presiding judge rules — even after a trial. A ruling on the merits of the case one way or another would shift the parties’ negotiating leverage and they would be free to settle the case afterward using the court’s ruling as a lodestar.

Many industry observers have noted that Twitter will want to resolve this mess some way or another sooner rather than later since Musk has proven to be an extraordinary nuisance to the company and its shareholders the company’s board and its employees but that operational imperative will have to be balanced against the board’s legal obligations given the hand they currently hold. As a matter of law the board is basically obligated to its shareholders to wring as much money out of Musk as possible.

As for whether it is realistic to expect Musk to follow a court order that requires him to complete the deal I think the concerns in some quarters that he would refuse to comply are slightly overblown. Even terrible people usually comply with court orders after exhausting their options. Samuel L. Bray a professor at Notre Dame Law School who specializes in the law of legal remedies told me over email that the court “would have a wide array of means to enforce its decision … The tools that the Court would have in its toolbox to ensure that compliance are varied. They include fines (so many dollars per day) the loss of certain legal arguments seizure of property imprisonment and litigation costs and attorneys’ fees” though Bray stressed that “courts would not use imprisonment unless they had to and would be more likely to rely on fines and similar measures.”

Lipton noted other more practical obstacles to noncompliance on the part of Musk particularly since Tesla is incorporated in Delaware. “I do not believe that he can function as the head of a Delaware public company which constantly has business in Delaware and continue to do that while antagonizing the Delaware courts” she told me. She noted that Skadden’s lawyers are “always before the Delaware courts” so a major client defying a court order would be a problem for them too (though clients sometimes do not care about such things). “I don’t think he’s going to defy a court order after of course he exhausts appeals” she concluded.

For now Musk’s situation is less a problem for him than for his lawyers who have to be well aware that this is someone who does not actually respect them much — if at all. Lawyers are sometimes paid handsomely to debase themselves in the service of their well-heeled clients and this may ultimately prove to be one of those situations but it is still early in the going and in any case no one should feel bad for anyone involved. Twitter may be highly influential among the media and political classes but it also might be a terrible socially destructive force that deserves to die a natural death. Musk’s litigation position looks pretty poor at the moment but he has plenty of money to lose and appears to be largely indifferent to the public and media perceptions of him and his antics. On some level the two sides deserve each other.

Meanwhile like other recent high-profile legal fights this may prove to be a largely guiltless indulgence for those of us following along from home.

On Thursday night the entire Strip which houses some of the world’s most famous casinos and hotels was flooded as the city put a flash flood and severe thunderstorm warning in place.

And it seems as though the city’s not out of the woods yet.

At least 16000 people suffered power outages in the Las Vegas area Friday night according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

Rainfall battered the city in the afternoon into evening with the potential for gusty winds lightning and even small hail over the weekend.

Yet another severe thunderstorm warning was put in place for Las Vegas on Friday which lasted until 11 p.m. People were urged not to drive through floodwater.

The warning impacted Las Vegas and its surrounding cities of Henderson Mesquite and Boulder City.

Rain is forecast to keep pouring from midday Saturday with a brief break from the extreme weather before the rain resumes on Sunday afternoon meaning more flood trouble might be on the way.

The highs for Saturday are expected to be in the high 90s which is below the 105 average for this time of year — a trend that can continue into next week.

Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman rushed to Twitter on Friday to thank emergency services for their quick response to the floods.

“Thank you to our first responders & Regional Flood Control for keeping residents & visitors safe” she tweeted. “Las Vegas has beautiful weather but we do have large storms in monsoon season. Knowing this we have flood control infrastructure to quickly move water out of the city to Lake Mead.”

“While some of our properties in Las Vegas did experience minor damage due to last night’s storm all of them are operating as normal today” Caesars Entertainment told The Post. “Repairs are already underway and we do not expect them to impact our guest experience.”

During the storm seven people were rescued from swift water and one house caught fire according to Las Vegas Fire & Rescue. There were also 22 crashes and 15 outside fires reported.

Alexander Wolf a Las Vegas resident told The Post he saw “curtains” of rainfall outside his window.

“Lightning was nearly constant and the power went out several times” he told The Post. “Electric surges set the fire alarms of several buildings off causing fire responders to have to head out into the storm to respond to them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL2Zvb2QtZHJpbmsvYmVsbGFnaW8tbGFzLXZlZ2FzLWNvbnNlcnZhdG9yeS1ib3RhbmljYWwtZ2FyZGVucy1kaW5uZXItYnJ1bmNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Can Book a Private Dinner Inside This Popular Las Vegas Attraction for the First Time Ever,"Las Vegas is getting a new dining venue and it's just as exclusive as you'd expect (and want) in Sin City.

Out Magazine listed at least seven LGBTQ+-related characters and projects that were unveiled at San Diego Comic Con. Some of them include Michaela Coel (from TV’s I May Destroy You) as a queer character in the film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever; the gay teens in the horror TV series Chucky; the upcoming Anne Rice adaptation Interview With the Vampire which is going to be even more queer than the original movie; and Dream’s genderqueer sibling Desire played by non-binary actor Mason Alexander Park in the upcoming series The Sandman.

Diana Taurasi scored 30 points in Phoenix’s 90-80 win over the Los Angeles Sparks becoming the first WNBA player in league history to score 30 or more at age 40 or older ESPN noted. The out player also joined Michael Jordan and Dirk Nowitzki as only the third to do it in NBA/WNBA history. It was also Taurasi’s 52nd career 30-point game—20 more than any other player in WNBA history.

Oscar-nominated actor Timothee Chalamet is starring in director Luca Guadagnino’s new coming-of-age/romance/horror film Bones & All reuniting him with the Call Me By Your Name helmer Out Magazine noted. The film which is going to be making its grand debut in Venice later this summer and which will be released Nov. 23 is described as a cannibal-themed love story between two young people in Reagan-era America and co-stars fellow “Call Me” alum Michael Stuhlbarg as well as Taylor Russell Mark Rylance Chloe Sevigny and more.

Kate McKinnon revealed why she quit Saturday Night Live after 10 years on the hit sketch show Page Six noted. “I thought about it for a very long time and it was very very hard” McKinnon told Ryan Seacrest and Kelly Ripa on Live With Kelly and Ryan. “I loved it I had the best decade and then I was just like my body was tired and I felt like it was time.”

Pop singer Shawn Mendes has canceled the rest of his tour weeks after he postponed concert dates to tend to his mental health CNN noted. The Grammy nominee “wasn’t totally prepared for the toll that being back on the road would take on [him]” and decided to cancel the tour after consulting with “an incredible group of health professionals” he told fans in a statement shared to his social media accounts. Mendes performed a number of shows already appearing in Sacramento California as well as cities around Canada.

Roula Khalaf Editor of the FT selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Leading US credit card lenders are signalling their confidence in the American consumer stepping up marketing efforts to attract new borrowers even as the economy slips into a technical recession.

After rising 47 per cent in the first quarter the volume of paper and digital mail solicitations sent by US credit card issuers increased again in the second quarter according to preliminary data from marketing research firm Competiscan putting it on track to reach a record high this year.

The wave of offers follows an 85 per cent surge last year from the depressed levels of 2020 and comes as many big card issuers said during their second-quarter earnings reports this month that they were increasing marketing spending.

JPMorgan Chase the largest US card issuer highlighted the ferocity of the competition for borrowers when it blamed higher customer acquisition costs for a 45 per cent fall in second-quarter card income.* Capital One the second-largest issuer said its quarterly marketing expenses rose 62 per cent from last year’s levels and pledged to remain aggressive.

“We continue to see opportunities to book accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns and we continue to lean into marketing to drive growth” Capital One chief executive Richard Fairbank said calling the competition “more intense than pre-pandemic levels”.

The increase in marketing activity is particularly noteworthy at this stage of the economic cycle. During uncertain times lenders typically send out fewer card offers — targeting potential borrowers with the highest credit scores — and focus on selling premium cards or making other offers to current customers.

However even as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down the highest inflation rate in more than four decades credit card lenders believe they have room to increase the size of their loan books because unemployment is low and consumer balance sheets appear healthy.

Credit card balances held by the seven largest issuers — JPMorgan Capital One Citigroup Bank of America American Express Discover and Synchrony — rose 13 per cent to $739.8bn compared with last year but remain about 9 per cent lower than they were at the end of 2019.

American Express last week raised its already bullish revenue outlook for the year as it reported higher-than-expected earnings and said its annual marketing spending would come in above its prior guidance of $5bn.

“I don’t see [a recession] in my numbers at all” chief executive Stephen Squeri told Yahoo Finance. “It’s really hard for me to get my head around that in quarter three or quarter four we’re going to have a big slowdown.”

To attract new customers issuers are embracing flashy tactics. Last month Amex rolled out a limited-edition card made from the scrap metal of retired planes. Sign-on bonuses tied to travel have become more generous although consumers so far are showing a preference for cashback cards.

Many of the marketing efforts are targeting so-called “revolvers” or borrowers who carry a balance from month to month instead of paying their statements off in full.

During the first quarter there was a 62 per cent increase in the volume of balance transfer offers that would enable consumers to consolidate debt on to a credit card interest-free for a time Competiscan said. The terms are also getting more generous. The interest-free period rose on average to 16 months this year from 14 months in 2021.

Sara Rathner an analyst at NerdWallet a personal finance website said the combination of growing balances and rising interest rates could land consumers in trouble.

“If you have credit card debt currently or you’re taking on debt for a large upcoming purchase interest rates are high they are getting higher” Rathner said. “It can spiral out of control pretty quickly.”

Complicating the task for lenders is the difficulty that they face in gauging the impact of government stimulus and debt forbearance programmes on consumers over the longer term.

“You have seen a dislocation between what had been very correlated metrics” said Brian Doubles chief executive of Synchrony the largest US store credit card issuer which increased its marketing spending by 18 per cent last quarter in line with pre-pandemic levels. “That’s really because of the effects of the stimulus and the forbearance that comes through.”

Lenders argue that new targeting tools and data analytics have made it easier to lend through a downturn without taking outsized losses.

Many lenders now analyse factors such as education employment history and checking account balances in addition to the traditional credit score to determine creditworthiness which increases the pool of potential borrowers said Megan Cipperly senior director of client services at Competiscan.

Incentives such as rate discounts for setting up automatic payments or making several consecutive on-time payments are also becoming more popular for unsecured loans.

“It reduces their chance of having delinquencies and then it creates a positive customer-lender relationship” Cipperly said. “That’s a great strategy if we’re heading into a recession.”

Pat Carroll Who Voiced Ursula in The Little Mermaid Dead at 95,"The post R.I.P. Pat Carroll Who Voiced Ursula in The Little Mermaid Dead at 95 appeared first on Consequence.

Pat Carroll who famously voiced the villainous Ursula in Disney’s The Little Mermaid has died at the age of 95.

According to Deadline Carroll passed away on July 30th while recovering from pneumonia.

Carroll’s career spanned over seven decades beginning with her work as a a civilian actress technician in the United States Army in the 1940s. Upon leaving the military Carroll became a mainstay in the world of TV variety shows appearing on programs like The Steve Allen Show The Red Skelton Show and The Carol Burnett Show. Notably her work on Caesar’s Hour earned her an Emmy Award in 1956.

In the late 1970s Carroll’s one-woman theater show on on Gertrude Stein earned universal praise including a Grammy for Best Spoken Word Documentary or Drama.

Carroll continued to appear on television throughout the 1970s and 80s including playing Shirley Feeney’s mother on Laverne & Shiley.

But Carroll will no doubt be most remembered for her role as the voice of Ursula in the 1989 animated film The Little Mermaid. She reprised the character on several other occasions including in a direct-to-video sequel film a spin-off television series and various Disney theme parks attractions and shows.

Carroll’s other voice credits included A Goofy Movie two Garfield specials and the 2005 re-release of My Neighbor Totoro.

Its hub is located (as you'd imagine) in Tel Aviv and currently serves six airports in North America:

Boston Logan International Airport (BOS).

Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR).

John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York City.

Miami International Airport (MIA).

Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ).

The airline has a notoriously bad loyalty program — but that doesn't mean you can't easily fly it for free. It's one of the most convenient options to get to Israel — and it can be one of the cheapest if you use Qantas points to book it.

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

Let's take a look at how to use Qantas points to book El Al flights and why you'd want to in the first place.

Why it's special

Qantas utilizes a distance-based award chart. That means the farther you fly the more you'll pay. Here's a look at its partner award chart which it implements for El Al flights.

(Screenshot from qantas.com)

Depending on your U.S. origin airport you'll spend the following to get to Tel Aviv:

Between 37800 and 50000 points in economy.

Between 70800 and 93500 points in Premium Economy.

Between 90000 and 119200 points in business class.

The sweet spot here is any flight under 5800 miles. That relegates you to these choices:

Boston.

Newark.

New York City.

Toronto.

If you fly from any other airport you're better off using a different award currency.

Related: Here's how to get to Israel using points and miles

Generally your biggest savings will be in economy. Spending 90000 points for a business-class seat is higher than many airlines such as United Airlines and American Airlines charge — but the ability to spend as little as 37500 points for an economy ticket to Israel is solid.

For example an economy flight on other airlines would cost:

Another reason this is a great deal is that Qantas doesn't incur fuel surcharges when booking with El Al. So you'll pay minimal fees when booking this seat.

How to book this award

Step 1. Estimate your flight distance (optional)

Because Qantas uses a distance-based award chart you can know what you'll pay for your flight before you even begin the booking process. Simply head to Great Circle Mapper and enter your origin and destination airports.

A flight from New York City to Tel Aviv is a distance of 5677 miles. That means the flight should cost:

37800 Qantas points in economy.

70800 Qantas points in Premium Economy.

90000 Qantas points in business class.

Step 2. Enter your travel information on the Qantas site

Navigate to the Qantas website and input your desired route.

When searching be sure the ""Use points"" toggle is switched. You'll have to log into your account to search for award seats. Selecting ""Flexible with dates"" is always helpful as well.

(Screenshot from qantas.com)

Step 3. Find dates with your desired cabin

The Qantas search tool leaves plenty to be desired. You can't filter by airline price or number of stops — but the award calendar does show you which dates offer economy Premium Economy business class and first class. If you're interested in say business class this shortens your hunt for the perfect flight.

Select a date and click ""Continue.""

Step 4. Find an El Al flight

An El Al flight between the U.S. and Israel is nonstop and will therefore be sorted at the top of the results page when available.

However you may find El Al seats that include a connection lower on the page. For example your first leg may be to London with British Airways then on to Tel Aviv with El Al. If you select one of these mixed partner flights beware of fuel surcharges.

How to earn points for this award

The easiest way to earn Qantas points quickly is by transferring flexible rewards points. Your options are:

Because of all these options you can accrue Qantas points with relatively little effort by opening cards such as:

The Platinum Card from American Express: Earn 80000 points after spending $8000 on purchases within the first six months from account opening.

Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card: Earn 75000 miles after spending $4000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening.

Bottom line

Because El Al has such an inconvenient and mediocre frequent flyer program there's really only one viable option if you're looking to fly El Al for free: Book it with Qantas points.

If you keep your flights under 5800 miles in distance you can get a great deal on coach flights — and a competitive to slightly overpriced seat in Premium Economy and business class.

Qantas points are easy to earn and El Al is a comfortable nonstop way to reach Tel Aviv. If you've been wanting to try the airline out there's no better way to do it than with Qantas points.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhaXJwbGFuZXQub3JnL3N0b3J5L3doaWNoLWNvdW50cmllcy1oYXZlLXRoZS1kZWF0aC1wZW5hbHR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which countries still have the death penalty?,"While global trends of capital punishment have decreased in the past 20 years as more countries abolish the death penalty or reform their legal systems at least one third of countries (governing 60 percent of the world’s population) have not outlawed the death penalty outright.

This past week the government of Myanmar executed four pro-democracy activists (the first execution in the country in over 30 years) including former-MP and rapper Phyo Zeya Thaw. Meanwhile in Japan a normally pacifist country the culprit of a stabbing rampage in 2008 was hanged despite international pressure from activists to abolish capital punishment. More grimly yet in March of this year Saudi Arabia executed 81 people in a single day. This trend extends to countries that are regarded as more humane: in the US state of Oklahoma will begin an execution spree in September scheduling one execution every month between then and December 2024 (25 executions total). These recent occasions have spurred activists to decry the excessive use of inhumane capital punishment especially in cases where the culpability of the defendant is not confirmed.

Capital punishment in countries where a strict checks and balances system is not in place can easily be misused or expoloited by government officials for fascist abuses of power. In others it is used as a demonstrative warning for citizens about what offences are intolerable or compromise civil order which will not be overlooked or forgiven. Whether this looming threat truly prevents crime and abuses to human rights more than it participates is widely contested among civil activists.

What is the death penalty and a capital offence?

The death penalty or capital punishment is the state-enacted execution of a person as punishment for a capital crime. Countries that allow the use of capital punishment have for the most part defined capital offenses the punishment for which is death. In most cases capital punishment is reserved for extreme crimes such as terrorism mass murder war crimes crimes against humanity and sometimes murder and rape.

However in totalitarian regimes or even in countries where legal systems are not sturdy capital punishment can be used to silence dissent or to punish smaller crimes like drug posession desertion or even cowardice. Singapore for example hanged a man this week merely for cannabis trafficking. For this variation in mortally punishable crimes many activists argue that governments should not hold this lethal punitive weapon that can easily be abused.

A brief history of death penalty

Histories of capital punishment can be traced back to some of the earliest civilisations. The Torah or Old Testament for example authorises the death penalty for crimes like murder the practice of magic kidnapping and even the violation of the Sabbath. In Ancient Greece the death penalty was instated under Draconian law as far back as 621 B.C. and later Plato defended capital punishment as a means of purification for the defilement of a crime.

Capital punishment survived well past these civilizations and could be found in infamous cases like widesweeping witch trials in Europe and North America the punishment of homosexuals for sodomy in early Islamic caliphs and the mass executions of King Henry VIII in England who is said to have despotably executed over 72000 during his reign. These examples show how in the hands of tyrants or misguided ideas and religions capital punishment is a dangerous tool when it falls in the wrong hands. In fact genocides and mass executions are often justified as punishment for some crime or transgression of ideology.

Which countries still have the death penalty?

By the end of 2021 a total of 108 countries had abolished the use of the death penalty more than two thirds of the world; nevertheless 55 countries still have the death penalty in their penal toolbox. Most notable are the USA Iran Saudi Arabia Japan Somalia South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

In 2021 recorded state-sanctioned executions totalled 579 while 2052 death sentences were served worldwide. Iran was the biggest executioner accounting for 314 people followed by Egypt (83) Saudi Arabia (65) Syria (24) Somalia (21) and the USA (11). This however does not include the real number of executions committed in China which is estimated to be well over 1000. While most of these countries performed their executions by hanging and shooting the USA China and Vietnam preferred lethal injection while Saudi Arabia continues to use beheading as their method.

Which states in the US still have the death penalty?

Despite its reputation as a humanitarian leader the United States has not abolished the death penalty at the federal level instead allowing states to determine their approach to abolition and execution. 27 US-states continue to allow the death penalty including:

Alabama Arizona Arkansas California Florida Georgia Idaho Indiana Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada North Carolina Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah and Wyoming.

The US Federal government and military also retain the ability to condemn someone to death. Texas Oklahoma Florida and Virginia are the states that have used the death penalty the most.

Movements towards abolition

Many abolitionist movements from the past 500 years can be accredited to the thought of Cesaria Beccaria’s treatise “On Crime and Punishment” in which he argues that capital punishment is the “war of a nation against a citizen” and that it hypocritically commits the same crime that it seeks to punish or deter. Beccaria influenced many luminaries like Thomas Jefferson and Voltaire and his arguments remain at the core of abolitionist movements.

Since then many modern countries have completely outlawed capital punishment. The UK abolished it after a 5 year experiment (to verify its effectiveness on deterrence) in 1969; Australia followed shortly after in 1973 and Canada in 1976; France completely abolished it in 1981. By 2003 the European Convention of Human Rights instated Article 13 which forbids the use of the death penalty for any offence which was expected to be ratified in any European member-states.

Despite the overall trend towards abolition the movement is often met with resistance on the way. Zimbabwe offers the perfect example as former-President Langu - who favoured abolition and provided clemency to hundreds of convicts on death row - faced resistance in 2016 from his constituents whose attitudes strongly defend capital punishment as a tool to make criminals pay for their offences and to prevent more criminality.

What are the arguments for and against the death penalty?

The most obvious argument for keeping capital punishment instated is that it serves to deter serious crimes like murder and terrorism rightly punishing them to prevent new ones. However opponents of this view state that criminals who are set on committing a crime do not verify the possible punishment for it and sometimes do not even care what punishment they may receive for it. A person set on committing mass murder or terrorism has already accepted that they may perish while they commit the crime so the threat of death one way or another changes little for them; in fact it may give them the ending that they wanted and creates them into celebrated martyrs encouraging their followers to avenge them.

Other arguments state that capital punishment reduces the finiancial burden of keeping criminals alive in prison systems at the expense of tax-payers. Opponents of this view contend that the protection of the human right to life should not be determined by cost-cutting punishments and also stipulate that inmates on death row represent less than 1 percent of convicts the execution of which would result in negligible savings to taxpayers.

Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York earlier this week and needed to get a good bit of work done before going on an airport tour later that afternoon.

Knowing I had about four hours to kill in JFK's Terminal 8 I checked to see if there were any Amex Centurion Lounges nearby as I have complimentary access thanks to recently adding The Platinum Card® from American Express to my wallet. Unfortunately for me JFK's Amex Centurion Lounge is in Terminal 4.

The closest lounge to me was an American Airlines Admirals Club.

Weighing the cost versus my need to be productive and comfortable over a few hours I decided it was worth spending $59 on a one-day pass to the club.

This ended up being a good decision because the lounge was quiet and there were numerous seats available — including places to work eat charge my devices and make phone calls.

What I did is something you may not be able to do in the future depending on what airline you're flying and what club you're near. To combat overcrowding at lounges many have implemented or considered adding policies covering everything from how early you can enter to who can enter whether you can use the lounge after arriving on a flight and whether one-day passes are even an option.

However if you do find yourself near a lounge that sells one-day passes and you are wondering whether it's worth shelling out a chunk of cash to get single-day access to the lounge and its amenities there are a few things you should consider.

3 reasons why a 1-day lounge pass might be worth it

When there are mass flight disruptions

One occasion when you might want to consider a one-day pass to a lounge is when you desperately need to speak to a live customer service agent in the midst of significant flight disruptions but wait times are long in the main terminal and over the phone.

By paying for a one-day pass you may be able to get quicker and easier access to lounge-based airline customer service agents. Since there's a good chance you'll be spending quite a bit of time in the airport on a day like this you'll also have a better place to wait out delays.

Keep a couple of things in mind though. First of all you may not need a live customer service agent at all. It's always worth trying to go through the airline's app first to rebook in the midst of disruptions often without any associated cost.

Secondly on those days when mass disruptions happen the lounges are likely to be quite crowded because of the many members waiting out flight disruptions. That means access to the lounge itself the customer service agents inside and seating may be limited.

When you really need to be productive on a long layover

This would be the category I used to justify my spending $59 on a day pass to the Admirals Club last week. Maybe you've got a long layover or work you must get done and the chaos of the terminal its sparse outlets and sometimes spotty Wi-Fi service just isn't going to cut it.

For the price of a day pass you'll have good internet access a quieter and more comfortable place to work and complimentary food and drink options.

When you have a long layover but don't fly all the time

We all hope for those shorter layovers just long enough to allow us to deplane grab something to eat and walk to the new gate with a little time to spare. Of course that's not always the reality. Sometimes (particularly when booking award flights) you can end up with an itinerary that's downright strange leaving you with hours to kill between flights.

Want to wait out your layover in a bit more comfort but don't fly enough to warrant an annual membership? This could be an occasion where it's worth splurging on the day pass.

4 reasons why a lounge pass for the day likely isn't worth it

You find yourself buying the pass multiple times per year

If you find yourself making this purchase multiple times per year it might be time to consider whether you're overspending on one-time passes when you'd really be better off just purchasing an annual membership.

Keep in mind though that some airline credit cards give you lounge access for an annual fee that's considerably less than the annual membership fee you would pay if you were to just sign up for the club outright.

If you purchased one Admirals Club day pass in January of one year and another later that year you will have spent $158 on single-use passes. At that point you've already shelled out a quarter of what you'd have paid for the Citi®/AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard® annual fee ($595 see rates and fees) which gets you complimentary Admirals Club membership (a deep discount over the standard $850 rate).

This may also be a situation where you might want to consider a credit card like the United Explorer Card which doesn't come with a hefty annual fee or a full annual membership to United Clubs but does give you two one-time-use passes for the airline's clubs and could help cover you for those occasional instances where you really need the lounge access.

You're at an airport that already has good working space

Amid terminal upgrades in many parts of the country we're seeing a growing list of airports with much better working space outside of lounges. While in the terminal at Tampa International Airport (TPA) earlier this month for example I was able to sit in a comfortable leather chair to work with my electronic devices plugged in and charging.

Other airports have added at-gate desk setups with charging ports and outlets along with improved in-terminal Wi-Fi.

Add to that the respite you can sometimes find in airport coffee shops — I sat at a table in a Starbucks at St. Louis Lambert International Airport (STL) and felt like I was at any run-of-the-mill Starbucks — and you may be able to find a convenient place to work at no cost other than any refreshments you decide to purchase.

You're traveling with multiple people in your party

Nothing makes the decision to pursue lounge day access quite as expensive as having others in your traveling party. If for instance you're paying $59 times three or four those day pass costs really start to add up.

On the other hand if you were to just pay the annual membership fee for the lounge some clubs will allow you to bring in a guest — sometimes even multiple people — per visit which can end up being a much more efficient use of money (though be warned that the rules for this are getting tighter at a number of clubs).

It's crowded in the lounge already

Lounge members are quick to point out that the clubs can get downright crowded even without the added burden of travelers purchasing day passes.

While it's inconvenient for members when this happens it also means you may not get the tranquility you think you're paying for as a walk-in guest.

While a comfortable chair with outlets and a quiet atmosphere may be worth the hefty day fee a single seat in between a sea of other members that's not near any charging ports might end up feeling like a waste of money.

Bottom line

Given adjustments some airlines are making to their lounge access policies to cope with overcrowding it's possible that you won't even have the option of buying a day pass for lounge access. But it's good to keep the single-day pass as an option in the back of your mind for when the right circumstances present. Just remember to weigh whether it's truly a worthwhile expense."

Donald told USA TODAY the decision came as part of an ongoing planning and leadership development process at the company.

""I've been in the role for nine years"" he said. ""And I'm also you know getting to an age where it makes sense to have the next generation step in and so that's how we got there.""

Carnival Corp. announced in April that Donald would transition to vice chair and a member of the company's board of directors after his tenure as CEO and president was completed.

Donald who started in the role in 2013 and led Carnival through the COVID-19 pandemic will be succeeded by Josh Weinstein who previously served the company as its chief operations officer.

The CDC ended its COVID-19 program for cruise ships:What does that mean for travelers?

Cruises are a cheaper way to travel right now:Here's what to know when to book

In a statement shared with USA TODAY Weinstein said that he feels privileged to have been given the opportunity to take on the role adding that succeeding Donald is ""quite an honor.""

Carnival Corp. is the parent company of flagship Carnival Cruise Line Princess Cruises Holland America Line Seabourn P&O Cruises Costa Cruises AIDA Cruises and Cunard.

How did Arnold Donald arrive at Carnival Corp.?

When Donald started in the role in 2013 he anticipated taking it on for only around three years – he had actually already semi-retired after spending more than 20 years at Monsanto and later forming the Merisant Company where he served as CEO and chairman.

Arnold then spent a semi-retired period in leadership positions at nonprofits and served on various boards including Carnival Corp. until he stepped into the president and CEO position at the cruise giant in 2013 which he said seemed like a good opportunity.

When he took the lead at Carnival he had specific goals to meet. Donald wanted to bring the company's various brands together to behave like a federation – to share practices and strengthen the company as a whole.

Donald implemented three practices: Communication collaboration and coordination.

""If you look at the leadership team in the management team how we work together that has dramatically changed"" he said. ""The brands have extensive communication collaboration and coordination and they didn't have it before from a diversity standpoint. The majority of our fleet now a commercially is led by women.""

Leading the company through COVID-19

During his tenure Donald led Carnival Corp. through the COVID-19 – and he said there actually has been some positive outcome of the pandemic that shut the cruise industry down for more than a year.

""(There) is nothing like a crisis to bring people together"" he said noting the communication collaboration and coordination that they worked so hard to improve across brands pre-pandemic was brought to a new level thanks to the pandemic.

The company is still recovering after having taken on debt during COVID-19 but Donald has confidence that things are moving in the right direction.

And Donald believes the industry as a whole is on the up and up: ""There's no question industry is on its way to an even better place.""

What's next for Arnold Donald?

As vice chair and a member of the company's board of directors Donald said his number one job is to ""help make sure that Josh is wildly successful.""

After that he's hoping to have a bit more ""me time"" which he said he plans to fill with commitments to several external boards throwing out several names including The National WWII Museum and Bank of America among others.

And after that he said he'll consider what's next noting he may consider other boards – or perhaps private equity which Donald was involved with when he ""retired the first time.""

On the personal side he's looking to his family legacy.

""I'm going to take some time and personal development and leave something for my grandkids and great grandkids"" he explained. ""So I'm not looking to publish but I'm going to do some writing.""

To pursue this goal he's enrolled in a nonfiction writing course ""so they will actually want to read it.""

He'd also like to pick his saxophone back up he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA3L2Nhcm5pdmFscy1tYXJkaS1ncmFzLWNvbXBsZXRlcy1vbmUteWVhci1pbi1zZXJ2aWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival’s Mardi Gras Completes One Year in Service,"The new Mardi Gras from Carnival Cruise Line has just completed its first year in service. As the first ship in Carnival Cruise Line’s XL-Class the vessel welcomed its first guests on July 31 2021.

At the day it departed Port Canaveral on an inaugural cruise to the Eastern Caribbean.

The seven-night voyage included visits to San Juan Amber Cove and Nassau in addition to three full days at sea.

Continuing its debut season the 5200-guest ship offered additional cruises in the region over the last year also visiting the Western Caribbean and other destinations such as Cozumel Roatán Grand Turk Mahogany Bay and more.

As the first LNG-powered cruise ship to be homeport in the United States the Mardi Gras is considered one of the most eco-friendly vessels sailing from the country.

With several new features the 183900-ton ship is also the largest and one of the most innovative vessels ever built for Carnival.

Among its attractions is BOLT the industry’s first roller coaster and a selection of new dining venues including Emeril’s Bistro 1396 Shaq’s Big Chicken Chibang! and Street Eats.

The Mardi Gras is set to be joined by the second XL-Class vessel later this year when the new Carnival Celebration enters service.

Currently under construction in Finland the vessel is set to debut in November kicking off a program of Caribbean cruises departing from PortMiami.

Marking the arrival of the XL-Class to Texas the Carnival Jubilee will be the third ship in the series. Based in Galveston the ship is currently scheduled to enter service in November 2023.

In addition to the XL-Class vessels the Carnival Cruise Line fleet is also receiving three extra ships over the next few years.

Presently sailing for Costa the Carnival Luminosa will debut for the brand this November with a series of cruises in Australia.

In 2023 and 2024 respectively Carnival is also receiving the Costa Venezia and the Costa Firenze.

This not only impacts cruisers debarking the vessel but also embarkation for the ship’s next sailing.

Debarking passengers are being offered limited reimbursements for airline change fees. Few details are available about the cause of the delay but there could be several factors.

Five Hour Delay

Guests expecting to board Carnival Glory on Sunday began receiving email and text notifications late Saturday afternoon announcing the possibility of delayed embarkation. At first the notifications only notified passengers about the delay and advised them to stay alert for additional information to come by 8 a.m. Sunday morning.

These initial notifications did ask that guests not proceed to the cruise terminal until they had received further information about embarkation times.

The morning notification which guests began to receive shortly before 8 a.m. detailed that embarkation would be delayed by five hours. To accommodate that delay guests were asked to shift their arrival appointments by five hours and not arrive at the terminal until their new embarkation time. Guests arriving too early have been turned away and advised to return at the proper time.

All guests are required to be onboard the ship no later than 8 p.m.

No details have been released about whether or not guests may receive any compensation about the delay as their cruise begins. These types of delays do happen occasionally but will not dramatically impact the cruise ship’s schedule as it departs for the next sailing.

The Conquest-class Carnival Glory is currently offering 7-night roundtrip sailings from New Orleans. Both Eastern Caribbean and Western Caribbean itineraries are offered though more of the sailings – approximately 80% – are Western Caribbean schedules. Different sailings offer different ports of call including Jamaica Grand Cayman Cozumel Roatan and Belize.

The ship has a guest capacity of 2980 passengers at double occupancy and up to 3806 guests when fully booked.

Debarking Passengers

Guests onboard Carnival Glory were notified of the delay for their Sunday debarkation via letters delivered to their staterooms as well as public address announcements made by the ship’s captain Domenico Calise.

The letter which was delivered on Sunday morning reads “We are now expecting to dock in New Orleans at 12:30 PM. We sincerely apologize for this unexpected delay.”

Guests are being offered up to $200 USD reimbursement per person for independent non-refundable air change fees with appropriate documentation. Guests were also advised to be mindful of debarkation processing time and travel time to the airport when rebooking flights.

“Thank you for your understanding” the letter concluded. “We wish you a safe journey home.”

No details were provided about why the ship was so significantly delayed but strong storms or thick fog in the region could have played a role in the ship’s schedule as cruise ships must be very careful when navigating their entrance into the Mississippi River as they approach the Port of New Orleans.

Rumors circulating onboard also hint that a broken propeller may be the reason for the delay or there may have been minor cleanup issues at the river mouth that delayed the ship. No confirmation has been made for either of these theories.

Two of the world's largest cruise lines Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruise Line have each made the decision to ease various testing requirements and restrictions for sailings. The cruise industry has been through significant upheaval throughout the course of the pandemic with their entry requirements rules and restrictions changing several times as businesses fought to keep cruises open for business and safe for all travelers. However following the CDC's decision to drop its cruise program earlier this month restrictions have been to ease once more.

The next steps towards normality the two cruise giants' decisions to ease their testing requirements are set to be welcomed by travelers and could help to make cruises more popular than ever in the coming months – particularly as air travel remains a mess at present. Here's everything you need to know about the changes being made by Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruise Line plus a look at recent changes made by other cruise lines.

Royal Caribbean Requirements Changes – Information For Travelers

Royal Caribbean's recently announced changes to its entry requirements are set to make sailing much more inclusive than it has been at any other point during the months of the pandemic. The cruise line giants – home to the world's largest cruise ship Wonder of the Seas are set to change the rules so that unvaccinated guests of any age are allowed to partake in their cruises once more for the first time during the pandemic putting cruise trips back on the map for millions of potential passengers.

Unvaccinated cruise passengers will be permitted to sail on Royal Caribbean cruises once more providing that they take a Covid-19 test within 3 days of the cruise's departure. The change is set to go live from August 8th and will apply to all unvaccinated travelers – not just those under 12 as the previous rules decreed. Whilst exact details such as the type of test and specific destination-related requirements are yet to be confirmed the cruise line announced they will be releasing more details on August 1st.

It's not just good news for unvaccinated cruise guests either – vaccinated travelers have also been given something to celebrate recently too. Until now vaccinated guests were required to take a PCR or rapid antigen test up to 2 days before sailing. However starting from August 8th cruise guests who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer need to take a pre-departure test if their cruise is fewer than six nights long. The policy change is another great leap back towards business as usual as cruise lines across the country take a measured approach to repealing their Covid-19 related restrictions.

Carnival Cruise Changes – What Travelers Should Know

Much like Royal Caribbean Carnival Cruise Lines have also made changes to the testing requirements making sailing a more attractive proposition to the masses. The company announced that from August 4th they will be removing all pre-cruise testing requirements for fully vaccinated guests on short cruises of 5 nights or less. The cruise line also added that they would be introducing further changes in the future giving hope to the idea that all Covid-19 era policies would soon be phased out.

Carnival also changed testing requirements for cruises that are bound to make sailing easier for unvaccinated guests. Previously unvaccinated passengers were required to take a PCR two days prior to embarkation. However this is no longer the case. Now unvaccinated guests can take either a PCR or antigen test up to three days before embarkation – giving them a more comfortable window to get tested in and saving them some money at the same time.

Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruise Line aren't the only cruise lines to make changes recently. Virgin Voyages have also gotten in on the act removing pre-embarkation testing for EU cruises on July 24th and from July 27th on U.S. based trips as well as dropping their vaccinated passengers quota to 90% from 100%. With the CDC no longer controlling the policies of cruise lines we're expecting to see even more changes coming over the next few months.

After over a decade of construction India's first indigenous aircraft carrier the Vikrant was handed over to the Indian navy by its constructor Cochin Shipyard on Thursday. Chinese experts said on Friday that although there is still a big gap between the Vikrant and China's third aircraft carrier Fujian which was launched in June India's long and arduous road to producing the Vikrant shows New Delhi's ambition and determination to become a maritime power.According to the Indian media the aircraft carrier is 262 meters long with a full displacement of close to 45000 tons and a maximum speed of 28 knots.With an indigenous content of 76 percent the carrier cost about $3.13 billion Indian media reports said. Citing an Indian Navy spokesperson Indian media reports said the delivery of the ship signals that India has joined the club of nations that have the capability to design and build aircraft carriers independently.The design of the aircraft carrier began in 1999 and the keel was laid a decade later in 2009. It then took over 12 years before the start of sea trials in August 2021 and the final delivery in July 2022 according to Indian media reports.During the long period of time from 1999 to 2022 China made a breakthrough by launching three aircraft carriers. India's slow pace in building its first indigenous aircraft carrier shows the difficulty of the process. China and India's indigenous development of aircraft carriers started from the same place - the former Soviet Union.The design of the Vikrant is based on Vikramaditya the former Soviet Union's second-generation carrier. The Chinese Type 001 aircraft carrier Liaoning is a refurbished and upgraded version of the Varyag a third-generation Soviet carrier.Chinese military expert Song Zhongping told the Global Times on Friday that the Liaoning is a large carrier while the Vikrant is only a medium-size carrier. In addition the Liaoning has stronger carrier-based aircraft capabilities than the Vikrant Song said.Zhang Zhaozhong a retired military expert at the PLA National Defense University who conducted research on aircraft carriers for many years once said that India's aircraft carrier development process has been full of twists and turns including policy instability. This led to changes in design thinking instability in funding and a lack of continuity in the manufacturing process.The base of India's military industry is relatively weak so indigenous aircraft carrier development is a challenge Song said noting that China can design whole aircraft carriers by itself but India can only do part of the design.But India is not unfamiliar with aircraft carriers as it has a relatively long history of using them Song said.India bought two aircraft carriers from Britain in the 1960s and 1980s both of which have since been decommissioned. The Vikramaditya a 45000-ton active carrier of the Indian Navy was purchased from Russia in 2004 media reports said.India has always believed that ""the Indian Ocean is India's ocean"" and that there is a need to develop a carrier-centric navy. However India is not much threatened by external countries so it does not have a particularly urgent need for aircraft carriers. In addition its own industrial support is not very complete so its aircraft carrier design needs a relatively long period Song said.With the commissioning of the Vikrant India will have dual carrier battle groups which will greatly contribute to India's overall maritime capabilities Song said.India sees itself as an important part of the world's major political and military powers so it is inevitable that the country will make aircraft carriers an important part of its power strategy Song said noting that India's determination to pursue an independent national defense should not be underestimated.For a country like India which has never independently designed an aircraft carrier before the Vikrant can provide a technical basis for the planned homegrown nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the Vishal Song said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vY2hhcnRlci1hbGJhc3Rhci10YWtlcy1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7/30/2010: Spanish Charter Carrier AlbaStar Takes Flight – Airways,"DALLAS - Today in Aviation Spanish charter carrier AlbaStar (AP) operated its inaugural flight in 2010.

The flight from the carriers Palma (PMI) base to Milan Malpensa (MXP) was operated by a Boeing 737-400 (EC-LAV) 'Pino D'Urso' named in honor of the airline's founder.

AP was established on November 30 2009 by former LTE International Airways (XO) and MyAir (8I) staff led by Michael Harrington the former CEO of XO. The aim was to provide charter services for Spanish Italian and other European tour operators.

Expansion

In January 2011 the carrier diversified by adding a Boeing 737-400 freighter (EC-LKB) to the fleet.

By 2014 the airline had opened a second base at Milan's Malpensa Airport (MXP). It also has hubs at Milan's Bergamo Airport (BGY) and on the island of Sicily at Trapani–Birgi Airport (TPS).

AlbaStar has also established itself as the leading European airline in pilgrimages and religious trips to the holy city of Lourdes France. Today AP serves Tarbes–Lourdes–Pyrénées Airport (LDE) from over 45 destinations.

Birthday Celebrations

By its tenth birthday in 2020 AlbaStar was operating a fleet of six 737-800s the first of which it received in June 2017. It also has a single -400 series still in service. Since its inception the airline has carried over 2.9 million passengers.

In July 2022 AP became the European launch customer of the 'WheelTug' an electric system fitted to its aircraft's nose wheel to allow pilots to taxi without the need for engines to be running.

Speaking of the innovative product Albastar CEO Michael Harrington said: ""For Albastar to be the European launch customer of such an important project for cutting CO2 emissions is a great honor and we very much hope this will set a game‐changing example with other European airlines.""

He wanted to be a pilot.

""It dawned on me this feeling of regret that I could have been doing something I loved and I wasn't and it hurt me"" said Berk who is 28. ""I decided then and there to pursue the dream.""

Today with flight school done and nearly all of the required 1500 hours of flying time built up Berk's timing is turning out to be perfect. This year U.S. airlines expect to hire 10000 pilots.

A shortage of pilots is one of several constraints on airlines as demand returns to normal two years after the coronavirus pandemic brought air travel nearly to a halt. Ground agents and other workers are also in short supply. But the supply of pilots more directly affects airline operations because they perform the actual work of flying and can't be rapidly replaced.

For much of the 2010s airlines pilot groups and analysts debated pilot numbers. Even before the pandemic air travel demand appeared to be outgrowing pilot staffing. And after it hit airlines slashed schedules and staff in part by encouraging pilots to retire early.

Delta Air Lines the dominant carrier at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport offered early retirement packages and lost 2000 of its 14000 pilots in 2020.

Delta's chief executive Ed Bastian said it lost more pilots to early retirement than any other airlines — and most of the 2000 pilots were among its most seasoned veterans.

""That means everybody the other 12000 pilots underneath all had opportunities to move up"" Bastian said last month at an investment conference.

For pilots to move up they could be going from first officer to captain or are often switching aircraft. Pilots have to be trained on every new type of jet they are approved to fly.

""So we're having to train the entire pilot workforce as well as recruiting in from the bottom"" Bastian said. Delta is now hiring 100 to 200 pilots a month.

Minneapolis-based Sun Country Airlines the second-largest carrier at MSP retained most of its pilots thanks to a new cargo contract signed just before the pandemic with Amazon.com. The new business gave Sun Country pilots something to do when people weren't booking leisure trips.

To woo talent Sun Country agreed to a new pilots contract in December that offered higher pay and better schedules. By the contract's fourth year pay for senior captains is above the scale for Delta which has had the highest pay for pilots of the Boeing 737 — the most common commercial aircraft in the skies. The airline is now hiring 20 pilots a month versus five before said Jude Bricker its chief executive.

Even so Bricker added that no one in the airline industry is able to come back as rapidly as they'd like. ""And the reason we're not able to grow as much as we think we should be able to mostly has to do with relying on past experience in a new environment"" he said.

Regional carriers are responding to the pilot shortage by upping starting salaries sometimes by 50% from a previous average of around $50000. The median annual wage for airline pilots is $207200 according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Meanwhile pilots on the job are working more than ever.

""At the current rate by this fall our pilots will have flown more overtime in 2022 than in the entirety of 2018 and 2019 combined our busiest years to date"" the Air Line Pilots Association which represents Delta's pilots said in a letter to customers last month.

The union said it has been asking Delta's leaders to exercise restraint when adding back flights.

Delta isn't having any problem recruiting pilots Bastian said. But getting them through training is a challenge. He said he expects it will take between eight and 12 months before enough pilots are trained to comfortably add flights.

The amount of pilot training happening right now is ""at a scale that no one has seen before"" said Bob Mann an airline analyst and former industry executive. That also means flight instructors and simulators are also in high demand.

Sun Country's pilot training process now takes 110 days versus the usual 75 days because of bottlenecks with instructors and simulators Bricker said.

Flight instructor Capt. Chris VanderHorck gave instructions to two new Sun Country pilots on a 737 flight simulator at the CAE Training Center in Eagan earlier this month.

At the CAE Training Center in Eagan two new Sun Country pilots trained in a simulator on a recent afternoon. The sessions are four hours long and come as part of training that includes procedures and systems work and runs up to eight weeks said Joe Houghton Sun Country's vice president of flight operations.

The carrier leases simulators in other states as well but still has a backlog of new pilots that need training. Sun Country is planning to launch its own training center in fall.

Employment of airline and commercial pilots is projected to grow 13% from 2020 to 2030 faster than the average for all occupations according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Last year the FAA reported that about 164000 Americans held airline transport certificates down about 1000 from 2019. Those numbers include pilots not currently working.

Kit Darby a retired United Airlines pilot believes the obvious solution for easing future shortages would be to raise the retirement age. Congress raised the retirement age from 60 to 65 in 2007. Last week Sen. Lindsay Graham R.-S.C. proposed legislation to raise it to 67.

The FAA requires pilots over 40 to have medical checkups semi-annually to maintain certifications. ""There's no good medical reason not to fly if you can certify"" Darby said.

Congress could also consider reducing the 1500-hour training requirement which was put in place after a 2009 crash of a regional jet. Pilots who've been in the military or who received aviation education already have exceptions to the requirement.

Delta earlier this year joined other airlines by dropping a requirement that pilots hold a bachelor's degree. That move is drawing some people to flight training schools.

""People are looking at the field thinking 'I don't need a four-year degree'"" said Trever Rossini owner of Inflight Pilot Training in Eden Prairie where the cost to get a commercial license is around $70000.

Even so a record number of students applied to the University of North Dakota's John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences. A class of 500 students will start this fall and pay $72000 for flight training on top of the regular costs for a four-year bachelor's degree.

""We had to stop enrollment in January because we only have so much airspace so many aircraft and so many instructors"" said Elizabeth Bjerke associate dean and professor of aviation at UND.

Sophia Jensen a recent graduate from the school is nearing 1000 flight hours by working as a trainer. She's also interviewing to join a regional carrier where she'll continue her training next year in Delta's Propel pilot career path program.

Jensen's already been recruited by a Delta competitor and heard about airlines scouting at UND. ""They're knocking on our doors because they're so desperate for pilots"" she said.

Jacob Berk right a flight instructor earning hours in his job toward meeting the requirement to fly for a major carrier talked with student Jeetan Karki of Richfield as they walked toward their plane at Flying Cloud Airport in Eden Prairie.

At Flying Cloud Airport in Eden Prairie on a recent afternoon Berk continued working on getting his 1500 hours as he instructed student Jeetan Karki 26 of Richfield who also hopes to work for an airline someday.

Berk guided Karki through a Cessna 172 flight display and a checklist of procedures. It was the student's first flight on the Cessna 172.

""I like to say it's like when you're driving someone else's car and looking for the windshield wipers but worse"" Berk said.

Berk led Karki around the exterior of the plane checking the wings and underside. Then the two got into the plane lined up for takeoff and flew for an hour.

These hours of flight instruction are helping Berk near his goal as he begins interviewing for jobs at regional airlines.

He's working 12- to 14-hour days but says he doesn't feel depleted by it. ""Now I come out of it feeling good and that's something I've never felt before"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMjA3LzEyNzE3OTQuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China reveals footage of launch of missile resembling ‘aircraft carrier killer’ hypersonic weapon celebrating Army Day ...,"A video celebrating August 1 the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army released by China Central Television on July 30 2022 displays the live-fire launch of a missile from a transporter erector launcher on a highway in a desert. The missile resembles the DF-17 hypersonic missile which is publicly displayed at the National Day military parade on October 1 2019 in Beijing. Photo: Screenshot from China Central Television

Shortly prior to the 95th founding anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) on Monday China for the first time revealed a video featuring the launch of what resembles a DF-17 missile in a move experts said on Sunday displayed the flexibility of the ""aircraft carrier killer"" hypersonic weapon that is almost impossible to intercept at a time when tension is rising in the Taiwan Straits amid US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's possible visit to the island of Taiwan.State broadcaster China Central Television on Saturday released a video titled ""The capabilities of the Chinese troops shown in 81 seconds"" celebrating the upcoming China's Army Day which falls on August 1.A scene in the video showing live-fire launch of a missile from a transporter erector launcher on a highway in a desert attracted particular attention by military enthusiasts who said the missile resembles the DF-17 hypersonic missile which has been publicly displayed at the National Day military parade on October 1 2019 in Beijing.

If the missile shown in the video is indeed a DF-17 this would be the first time China has publicly revealed a footage on the DF-17's live-fire launch observers said.Being able to launch on a highway in a desert demonstrated that the new-type missile does not require a preset launch position to launch Song Zhongping a Chinese military expert and TV commentator told the Global Times on Sunday.The missile can be launched independently at any time and any place making it very agile and flexible Song said.It also means that enemies will have a hard time locating this road-mobile missile and hitting it before launch analysts said. After launch since the DF-17 uses a hypersonic glider as its warhead which flies faster than Mach 5 with an unpredictable trajectory it is almost impossible to intercept for contemporary missile defense systems they said.The DF-17 will play a vital role in safeguarding China's territorial integrity as regions including the South China Sea the Taiwan Straits and Northeast Asia are all within its striking range Yang Chengjun a Chinese missile expert told the Global Times when the missile made its debut in 2019.In addition to stationary targets the DF-17 can likely also hit slowly moving targets Song said referring to aircraft carriers.With Pelosi's possible visit to the island of Taiwan on the horizon tension in the Taiwan Straits has been rising. The PLA in showing its capabilities is telling the US that if it insists on provocation the PLA will take every manner of countermeasures Song said.Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and the PLA is unequivocal on this question that it can fight and win Song said."

If you want to attract butterflies to your property you need to grow plants they like. The ancient herb rue is an easy to grow woody perennial that can help lure beautiful butterflies to your yard.

Rue was a popular herb in medieval times known as the herb-of-grace during the Middle Ages. Shakespeare refers to rue in several plays as the “sour herb of grace”. Today in addition to its long list of historical uses we can add butterfly magnet to its favorable characteristics.

A member of the Rutaceae or Citrus family rue takes part of its botanical name Ruta graveolens from the family name. Rue is certainly not as popular as her citrus tree cousins and definitely not as tall or as woody. Since classification is done by the sexual parts of the plants rue’s fruit that resembles a tiny segmented orange may be the key to her membership in this large family.

The species name greaveolens is Latin for “having a strong or offensive smell.” The leaves of rue plants do have a strong aroma that is offensive to some people as well as to dogs cats and insects. The leaves are often used as a repellent.

Care should be taken when handling the leaves however as they can cause an allergic rash in some people that is made worse in hot sun. These same leaves are the primary host for the Asian swallowtail butterfly (Papilio xuthus). The adult lays eggs on the rue leaves. When their caterpillars hatch they eat the foliage grow pupate and become another beautiful butterfly.

Rue is indigenous to parts of southern Europe and was prized in both the Greek and Roman empires. It was commonly grown and consumed for its bitter flavor that was thought to have medicinal properties including stimulating the digestive system. Rue was also used to provide protection from the plague as well as from evil witches and poisonous potions. As threats from poisonous potions the plague and witches diminished rue’s popularity declined.

Today rue often provides an attractive addition to an herb garden where it offers culinary and medicinal uses as well butterfly appeal. It is small shrub-like plant that can grow to around three feet tall and just as wide. It has small blueish green leaves and puts out sprays of yellow flowers in the longer days of summer. The small fruits that follow flowering are segmented and look like a miniature green orange.

Though its leaves are certainly edible they are very bitter and have a strong aroma that some find unpleasant. As tastes have changed over the centuries rue’s bitterness and strong aroma are less appealing today than they once were. Rue leaves are still used in salads egg dishes and cheeses throughout the Mediterranean however. They are also used to impart a slight bitterness to tomato sauces. A few rue leaves are used to add a slight citrusy flavor to some Ethiopian coffee recipes.

Dried rue leaves have historically been made into smudge sticks to burn as an insect repellent or for general cleansing. Sprigs of rue leaves are sometimes used by Catholic priests to sprinkle holy water on worshippers seeking repentance. It is the leaves of the rue plant that were used as the model for the suit of clubs in playing cards.

Recipes for the ancient cure-all ‘four thieves vinegar’ are still available. Most include rue. The four thieves were grave robbers during the plague who never contracted the disease. Their parents were herbalists who made a vinegar with garlic and herbs that seemed to protect the brothers from the plague. Today it is used for protection and healing. More on this is available on the internet.

Centuries of traditional use and anecdotal evidence include many uses for the rue plant. It was used by Leonardo da Vici and Michelangelo to improve their eyesight and their creativity. The leaves also have antifungal properties. Herbalists often recommended using rue tea as a remedy for dizziness headaches anxiety and general tension. A tea made from small quantities of the fresh or dry leaves can help to calm the nerves and boost the appetite.

Rue can be easily propagated from cuttings or from seeds. Cuttings will root in water or in a mix of moist vermiculite and perlite. Seeds that form following flowering should be collected when dry. Place them on top of a seeding mix as they germinate best in full sun.

The plants can be grown in the garden or in a pot. They will do best in full sun though they can tolerate partial shade. Though they will grow in poor soil it must drain well. Once established rue plants are drought tolerant.

Rue requires very little maintenance. Occasional pruning can help control growth and maintain a desired size and shape. Insects are not usually attracted to rue and diseases are rare. A little fertilizer every few months will help the plant thrive.

I found a rue plant among the herbs in a local nursery. You might want to call around to see who has them. According to an old English saying about regret you may “rue the day” that you don’t include a rue plant in your garden.

Insider analyzed the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification's 2021 and 2022 disclosure data for permanent and temporary foreign workers to find out what CBRE paid US-based employees in entry-level to executive roles.

Most of the roles were professional jobs such as software engineers and business and financial analysts; the data did not include maintenance operations or sales staff. Performance bonuses or commission signing bonuses and compensation other than base salary were not reflected in the data.

CBRE hired 298 employees through the H1-B and related visa programs in 2021 a 119% increase from its total in 2020.

The deal which was completed on Friday adds a row of 11 adjoining properties on Mosque Street a pair of buildings one block to the south along Pagoda Street and a Tanjong Pagar shophouse to SilkRoad’s portfolio with the regional fund manager acquiring all 14 properties from privately-held investment firm ACT Holdings on behalf of one of its value-add funds.

Currently occupied by residential retail and office tenants Singapore-headquartered SilkRoad now plans to upgrade or reposition the 43464 square foot (4038 square metre) portfolio Mingtiandi understands. CBRE is understood to have brokered the deal but representatives of the property agency declined to comment.

The multi-asset transaction comes as Singapore’s shophouse market is on track to set a fresh record in 2022 after last year setting an all time high of S$1.94 billion in deals according to a recent report by Knight Frank.

Updated Deal

The purchase price for the deal which was first reported by the Business Times is around 22 percent lower than the S$141 million price which ACT had set when it put 13 of the 14 assets on the market in January 2020 with the Tanjong Pagar property having since been added to the set.

Located near Chinatown MRT station the row of 11 four-storey shophouses at 42 43 44 and 45 Mosque Street span 34238 square feet in combined floor space. The row is located next to the boutique Porcelain Hotel Singapore which the RB Family office a private investment vehicle for tycoon Raj Kumar and his son bought for S$90 million in late 2021.

54 and 56 Pagoda Street add another 9226 square feet to the set while the single shophouse in the Tanjong Pagar Conservation Area occupies a 1558 square foot site at 42 Craig Road.

The shophouses in the portfolio have from 66 years to 79 years left on their respective 99-year land tenures with SilkRoad understood to still be finalising renovation plans.

Tricia Song head of research for Southeast Asia at CBRE told Mingtiandi that shophouses in Chinatown will likely benefit from increased visitor arrivals now that Singapore has reopened given the area’s popularity among tourists.

At a time of rising interest rates and tight yields she said “shophouses could also be seen as a store of wealth or a hedge to inflation due to its vintage charm and scarcity value.”

ACT is the private investment office for the family of the late tycoon Toh Aik Choon also known as AC Toh who headed local trading and property firm Sim Lim Group before setting up manufacturing joint ventures under ACT.

SilkRoad Adds to Strategies

SilkRoad’s shophouse acquisition comes 18 months after the regional fund manager hit a $549 million final closing for its Silk Road Asia Value Partners II which aims to acquire value-add properties with value-add potential in Singapore Hong Kong and Tokyo as well as in key mainland cities.

Among the assets it acquired for the strategy last year were the Smile Centre industrial building in Hong Kong’s Fanling area which it purchased for $41.4 million in February 2021 and the Hang Wai Industrial Centre in Tuen Mun which it picked up for $167.1 million last October.

In a bid to expand beyond its traditional value-add strategy Silkroad earlier launched its first ever core-plus Asia real estate fund and announced a $144 billion first closing in February of this year.

Shophouse Deals Hit S$940M

The Chinatown-Tanjong Pagar portfolio sale follows the 114 shophouses that changed hands between January and June for a total of S$938.8 million based on data from Knight Frank. While the first half total slightly exceeds the S$919 million tally from the same period last year it was 8 percent less than the S$1.02 billion worth of deals reported in the second half of 2021.

Knight Frank predicts that shophouse deals will reach reach nearly S$2 billion in 2022 as the post-pandemic rebound in tourism will likely support continuation of the “upbeat sales performance” in the first half.

“The shophouse market retained its popularity in H1 2022 after the record-breaking total value in 2021” said Mary Sai executive director of capital markets for Singapore with the agency. “Given that conserved shophouses in Singapore are limited in stock the demand for this asset class is unlikely to fade any time soon.”

The report said relaxation of travel restrictions may bring a new wave of investors to Singapore’s shophouse market given the city-state’s reputation as a safe haven.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvdXMtaW52ZXN0b3ItaGVpdG1hbi1idXlzLXUtc3RvcmUtaXQtaW4tMTI1bS1iZW5jaG1hcmstZGVhbC1tMjdncHh3cWLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US investor Heitman buys U Store-it in €125m 'benchmark' deal,"A US real estate company is investing close to €125 million in U Store-it Ireland’s biggest self-storage company.

Air show officials have said more than 30000 people were in attendance on Saturday.

No estimates yet have been determined on people attending the final day of the air show.

Attendees could see different planes fly through the skies all weekend long. They could also meet and talk with pilots and learn more about various aircraft.

The air show will be back again next year as the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds will be the headliner attraction.



A date has yet to be determined.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXl0b25kYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL3doYXQtdG8tZG8vZ2F0ZXMtb3Blbi10by1jcm93ZHMtYXQtY2VudGVycG9pbnQtZW5lcmd5LWRheXRvbi1haXItc2hvdy9VM0RTQTdURVVCRVVSUFFSQ0lTWFZNTUlLSS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CenterPoint Energy Dayton Air Show: Opening day sees perfect weather,"One air show volunteer acknowledged the event was “very full.”

“You’re certainly welcome to say it was a well attended event” said longtime show spokeswoman Shiela Wallace. But she declined to offer any attendance estimates.

Traffic troubles

The strong attendance likely contributed to lengthy traffic snarls on Interstate 75.

“My kid would have loved to see this instead of sitting in his car seat for 3+ hours in gridlocked traffic ... ” Jana Eaton wrote on the show’s Facebook page Saturday.

“Traffic will likely be heavier than some recent shows” the show’s Twitter account said at about 1:30 p.m. “Traffic is currently moving but there is heavy turnout. Please give yourself time and expect slow moving traffic as you get to the lot.”

“Two hours in traffic and gave up not even halfway there” Twitter user David Kirschman replied. “This after paying in advance for tickets and parking. Total mess.”

Wallace referred questions about traffic to the Ohio State Highway Patrol. A patrol dispatcher said nobody was available to comment Saturday afternoon.

Blue Angels return to Dayton

The Blue Angels the No. 1 attraction for many fans began to perform about 3:45 p.m. the final flying act of the day.

The 48th annual show opened at 9 a.m. with clear skies and low humidity — conditions that were just about perfect for the event. A waiting line of spectators gathered on the east end of Dayton International Airport and steadily streamed in all morning.

“I am overcome with how wonderful the weather is” marveled Nancy LaChance who drove to the show from Lebanon Mo. with her husband of 51 years Dale.

Christopher and Nathan Plummer from Missouri and Georgia respectively were among the first waiting to enter. Christopher had driven nine hours to get to Dayton. He agreed that he’s willing to go the extra mile for a good air show.

“And this is a really good one” he said. “It has a great reputation and the history of it.”

It was Jerry Conley’s first visit to the show. Conley is president of Vampire Aviation LLC who was scheduled to fly what his business says is the world’s first single-engine jet fighter Saturday afternoon the DH-115 dubbed by the British “the Vampire.”

“I’ve flown almost every major air show in the United States” Conley said while fueling up on the flight line. “But this is family.”

“This is one of the biggest shows in the United States if not the biggest show” he added. “And so every pilot in the world wants to fly it.”

The first flying acts included the Army Golden Knights parachute team and fly-bys by F-15s which could be seen and heard shortly before 1 p.m.

Jeff Deckman was among the early photographers admitted well before 7:30 a.m. to get photos before the crowds poured in. A photographer for RadarContactPhotography.com Deckman said he has attended more than 300 airshows but this was his first time in Dayton.

“It’s very well organized and very well run” he said. “The amount of static displays here and the amount of aircraft I think are unmatched more than any show I’ve been to this year or last year. It’s a great show if you want to see some unique aircraft from all over the country.”

Kettering resident Brian Crist was also among the early photographers. He said he has been going to the show “since day one.”

“I’ve never missed a show” Crist said. “It’s local it’s our home.”

“You don’t get to walk up to airplanes and look at them like this very often” said Vandalia resident Dennis Mullins. “It’s kind of special and unusual to open the airport up and let everyone walk around.”

Asked what he was most looking forward to Mullins said “Oh the Blue Angels. They’re just so much fun to watch.”

That seemed to be the consensus view.

“The Blue Angels everyone can agree are acting as the No. 1 pull for us” said Troy resident Emily Gudakunst who was at the show early with her husband Lane and their child.

Parking and admission

If you’re going Sunday leave early and be patient as traffic will likely be heavy. Organizers said tickets sold briskly this year.

General admission parking is now entirely on the east side of North Dixie Drive across from the air show’s entrance.

Be aware also that part of North Dixie Drive directly in front of the gateway will be blocked to give general admission patrons a safer walk to the entrance.

Chalet Pavilion and Flight Line Hangar ticket holders with P-Lot parking passes will now park on the south side of the airport off West National Road. More than 30 shuttle buses will shuttle attendees to their chalets or pavilions the show has said.

Handicap Parking VIP Parking and C-Lot Parking lots have not changed.

General admission for parking is $15 per car and $25 for RVs buses and other large vehicles.

Take Exit 64 Northwoods Blvd from I-75. Follow signs to appropriate lots. Stay in right lane.

More information on parking can be found https://daytonairshow.com/parking-and-directions/.

What to expect

On Sunday the feature flying show will be held from noon to 4:15 p.m. But there will be plenty to see on the ground. A few of the ground-based “static displays” include the Air Force B-52 Stratofortress F-15 and the Army CH-47F.

Acts and times are subject to change depending on weather or other factors.

This year the Navy’s Blue Angels are the headline act. With their new F/A-18 Super Hornets the Blue Angels can reach up to 700 mph and fly as close as 18 inches apart.

The Air Force Thunderbirds and the Navy Blue Angels alternate as the show’s crowning performance every other year.

Hurricanes Harvey and Ike are the main events in the past 20 years that led to significant power outages (over 10% of residents lost power) in Harris County. Ike had a higher gust wind observation (~92 mph) when it hit Houston; Harvey was weaker (<50 mph) but lasted longer and brought heavy rainfall43. The wind during Ike broke many more poles leading to a larger power outage. As shown in Fig. 1 for the total impact on Harris County from Hurricanes Ike and Harvey results from the power grid outage and recovery model compare relatively well with the observation (although the model slightly overestimates the initial power outage under Harvey) indicating the model’s success in capturing both large and relatively small power outage events. The model estimates a relatively small power outage (1% [0–1%]) after the 5-day restoration period for Harvey and a large power outage (63% [60–66%]) for Ike for over 5 days agreeing with observations (Fig. 1). The model results at the census tract level for Hurricanes Ike and Harvey compare also relatively well with observations (Supplementary Fig. S2) with a mean error over all census tracts less than 10%.

Post-TC heatwaves

While heatwaves did not follow Hurricanes Ike and Harvey they may become more likely to follow future TCs. Under RCP8.5 the projected change in global mean surface air temperature for the late 21st century relative to the reference period of 1986–2005 is 3.7 °C based on all GCMs in the IPCC report44. The six GCMs used in this study predict an increase of the average global temperature by 3.4 °C in the future climate (2081–2100) compared to that in the historical climate (1981–2000). We analyze the synthetic TC and heatwave datasets to investigate the likelihood and duration of future post-TC heatwaves. Figure 2a shows how the probability of experiencing a heatwave with a certain duration following a TC changes from the historical to future climate for the study area. The probability of a heatwave especially a long-lasting one following a TC is quite small for the historical climate which is consistent with the observation that TC-heatwave hazards have affected only ~1000 people worldwide during 1979–201727. However the probability curve is much higher for the future climate. The probability of a post-TC heatwave lasting over 5 days is 2.7% (1.8–4.2%) under the historical climate but 20.2% (12.0–31.5%) in the future climate. For a post-TC heatwave to last over 12 days is almost impossible in the historical climate but a nonnegligible probability of 7.5% (4.8–11.9%) exists for it to happen in the future climate. To better reveal the time scale of climate change impact Fig. 2b shows the relative climate risk defined as the probability of experiencing a heatwave lasting for a certain duration following a TC in the future climate divided by that in the historical climate. The relative climate risk increases sharply with the duration reaching the peak around 13 days. The probability for a 1-day heatwave following a TC in the future climate would be ~5 (3–9) times larger than that in the historical climate the probability for a 5-day heatwave would be 7 (4–12) times larger and the probability for a 13-day heatwave would be 22 (14–33) times larger. This time scale pattern of climate change impact should be considered when developing maintenance and emergency response strategies for urban infrastructure systems. For example the resilience criteria of these systems should be enhanced to avoid the “resonance” effects of climate change. A typical recovery cycle for the power system is currently 5 days or longer37; the dramatic change in the climate risk may render such a time scale of recovery not resilient.

Blackout and compound hazard risk

Incorporating the power outage and recovery modeling we analyze the TC-induced blackout and TC-blackout-heatwave compound hazard risk for the study area. We apply an agent-based approach and record the largest duration of the hazards each resident could experience during each of the 20000 20-year synthetic simulations. Figure 3a b show the estimated percentage of Harris residents who may not experience post-TC power outages longer than a certain duration over a 20-year period under the historical and future climates respectively. On average the TC-induced power outage could affect 50% of the residents during a 20-year period in the historical climate and 73% of the residents in the future. 12.8% of the residents would not be subject to any post-TC blackout during the 20-year period under the worst case in the historical climate while only 2.7% of the residents would not be affected under the worst case in the future climate. In the historical climate over a 20-year period on average 14% of Harris residents could face at least one longer-than-5-day post-TC power outage which is less than one-third of the expected level of 44% in the future. For 90% of the cases under the historical climate the utility company (CenterPoint Energy) could fully repair the power system within about 15 days which matches recent-year records (e.g. 12 days for Hurricane Irma in 2017 and 13 days for Hurricanes Michael and Florence in 20185). With the same response strategies and resources the utility company might spend over 25 days in repairing the power system in the future under severe TCs. By comparison (with Fig. 1) the probability of experiencing the scale and duration of power outage induced by Hurricane Ike during a 20-year period is about 10% in the historical climate and 35% in the future. Hurricane Harvey is a below-average event in both the historical (87%) and future (96%) climates. These analyses show that climate change may dramatically increase the outage risk of the power system especially the tail of the risk that people will face.

Fig. 3: Analysis of TC-heatwave compound hazard risk for Harris County. The estimated percentage of residents who may not experience outage days after TC landfall in a 20-year period are shown for a the historical climate and b the future climate. The orange dot shows the simulated worst-case power outage over all simulations. The dashed black line shows the 10% worst case of power recovery. The estimated percentage of residents who may not experience TC-blackout-heatwave compound hazard days after TC landfall in a 20-year period are shown for c the historical climate and d the future climate. In all panels the dashed and dashed-dotted curves show expectation and ±1σ range based on all simulations. The shade shows CDF indicating the probability of less than a certain (y) percentage of residents not affected with a darker color corresponding to higher probability and thus higher risk. Green stars highlight the expected percentage of residents not affected 5 days post-TC landfall. Full size image

Figure 3c d show the estimated percentage of Harris residents who may not experience any TC-blackout-heatwave compound hazard longer than a certain duration over a 20-year period under the historical and future climates respectively. The chance for a resident to experience at least one longer-than-5-day compound hazard is almost zero (0.8%) under the historical climate. However the chance for a resident to be affected by at least one such compound hazard in the future climate (18.2%) would be 23 times larger. Recall that due to climate change the 5-day post-TC power outage risk is estimated to increase by 3 times (Fig. 3a b) and the 5-day post-TC heatwave compound hazard is estimated to increase by seven times (Fig. 2b). The 23-time increase of TC-blackout-heatwave compound hazard risk which is larger than the product of the two factors as if TCs and heatwaves are climatologically uncorrelated (21 times) indicates that strong TCs and long-lasting heatwaves may become more likely to co-occur under climate change. In other words strong TCs leading to larger power outages may be more likely followed by longer-lasting heatwaves affecting over 18% of Harris residents towards the end-of-the-century.

To investigate the spatial distribution of the risk we estimate the percentage of residents to experience at least one longer-than-5-day TC-induced power outage (Fig. 4a b) and TC-blackout-heatwave compound hazard (Fig. 4c d) over a 20-year period for each census tract in Harris County in the historical and future climates. Changing from the historical to the future climate the power outage risk of all the census tracts would at least double. The compound hazard risk would increase even more dramatically. Over 95% of people in all census tracts would experience no longer-than-5-day compound hazard in the historical climate; in the future over 95% of census tracts would have over 5% of the residents experiencing at least one such compound hazard during a 20-year time period. The distribution of risk is heterogeneous which implies a heterogeneous distribution of the resilience level of the power system as the heatwave is constant (given the GCM resolution) and TC winds vary only slightly over this relatively small region. The spatial pattern shows that residents near the center of Houston (the middle and lower part of the County) may experience lower power outage and compound hazard risk than residents in rural (e.g. the upper part) areas of the County. The varying densities of power substations and spatial patterns of distribution networks induce most of this difference.

Scaling law of power system failure

To better understand the power system we apply network analysis to investigate links between local disruptions (the failure of a specific pole or distribution/transmission line) and global failures using our large datasets of synthetic storm events. For each storm event we calculate W(x) the percentage of service interruptions induced by all local disruptions that affect more than x customers and P(x) the percentage of local disruptions that affect more than x customers. W(x) also represents the probability for a customer to be subject to a disruption that affects more than x customers and P(x) is the probability for a disruption to affect more than x customers. Figure 5a shows the obtained generalized scaling law8 between W(x) and P(x) for each simulated event and averaged over all the events for the historical climate. Rather than a linear relationship indicating a uniform distribution of damages the concave scaling curve shows that on average the largest 20% of local disruptions are responsible for 72% (71–75%) of the global power outage (measured by the number of affected customers). This result obtained from the synthetic analysis for Harris County is comparable with a previous empirical result for Upstate New York that during Hurricane Sandy the top 20% of local disruptions induced 79–89% of the service interruptions7. In fact the difference in the scaling curves among the full range of synthetic TCs is quite small which confirms the robustness and generalizability of the scaling law in describing a TC-damaged power system. Further ref. 8 found that the scaling curve developed using data on failures in daily operation is also similar suggesting that the power network vulnerability (i.e. local disruptions inducing large-scale interruptions) exists independently of exogenous effects. Thus reliability-based redesign against various TCs may not need to differ fundamentally from the daily-operation-based enhancement as confirmed later (Fig. 6).

Solid curves show the percentage of affected residents in a 20-year period in the future as a function of network enhancement rate with three strategies: randomly undergrounding power transmission networks (green) randomly undergrounding power distribution networks (red) and greedily undergrounding power distribution networks (blue). Curves show the expectation; error bars show the ±1σ uncertainty range. Full size image

Large power outages are usually induced by local damages (as shown in our analysis and previous studies8) and large portions of local damages are due to distribution network failures so we analyze the connection between power outages and local distribution network topology. Figure 5b shows the correlation between the percentage of residents experiencing a longer-than-5-day power outage (averaged over all simulated synthetic storms for the historical climate) and the harmonic mean length of the power distribution network sectors at the census tract level. The results show that the longer the length of the local power distribution networks the higher the risk. The mean length of the power distribution networks is highly related to the pattern of urban development. A region with a lower population density may have a larger mean length of power distribution networks as it may have fewer substations to support residents who live relatively far away. Thus our results indicate that for TC-prone regions the scaling of urban development may have contributed significantly to the spatial distribution of power outage risks. The observed high correlation between the power outage rate and the mean length of distribution networks and the generalized scaling relationship between the probability of local failure and the failure impact shown in Fig. 5 can be explained theoretically and generally for acyclic (the most common) power distribution networks (see theoretical analysis and Fig. S3 in Supplementary Materials).

Efficient undergrounding strategy

Based on an improved understanding of the power network vulnerability we test three network enhancement strategies to mitigate the TC-blackout-heatwave compound hazard risk in the future. Figure 6 compares the reduction of the TC-blackout-heatwave compound hazard risk measured by the percentage of residents affected by longer-than-5-day compound hazard as a function of the enhancement rate for the three strategies; the enhancement rate is the total length of enhanced networks divided by the total length of the network sections that could be enhanced. Random enhancement of the high-voltage transmission network (burying transmission branches randomly) provides limited improvement of the global system performance. This finding confirms that the local distribution networks dominate the global pattern of the power outage and subsequent recovery process. Randomly undergrounding low-voltage power distribution networks improves the system performance linearly which means that the power distribution networks without protection face the same risk as before the enhancement. Given the acyclic topology of the power distribution networks a greedy undergrounding strategy is used to protect a small portion of wires close to the root nodes of the distribution networks. In the simulation the algorithm simply protects the root sector of the longest overhead branches of the distribution network iteratively until the enhancement rate is reached (i.e. “greedy” undergrounding). The greedy undergrounding strategy improves the system performance much more than the other two strategies. For example with the first 5% power distribution networks undergrounded the expected percentage of residents who might face the compound hazard for over 5 days drops to 11.3% from 18.2% (Fig. 3d). This performance improvement (6.9%) is ~15 times more than that of randomly undergrounding distribution networks (0.5%) or randomly undergrounding transmission network (0.1%) demonstrating a superior cost-efficiency of the greedy strategy. The topological law for power outages that we found here may help utility companies to plan resilient power networks to combat the changing climate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS92aWRlby9kYXl0b24tYWlyLXNob3ctc2Vjb25kLWRheS0xODQwMDA3ODAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dayton Air Show: Second day events 'fantastic',"Jul. 31—Day Two of the 2022 CenterPoint Energy Dayton Air Show is under way.

Gates opened at 9 a.m. for today's show and flying acts are about to start their roughly 4-hour featured show.

There from the start was Greg Schwer of Sidney who was accompanied by grandsons Riley and Carson Barrett 14 and 12 years old respectively.

""Came here this year for the Blue Angels"" said Schwer noting he had been to the show at least 10 times before including 2021. ""That was a biggie for us seeing them. It's been a few years since they've been here.""

He said it was a love of aviation and the military that keeps him coming back for more.

""Anything that flies is cool"" said Schwer a Marine who served from 1982 to 1986. ""I could probably spend a day in Helicopter Alley only but I've got to sacrifice and do the whole show.""

Traffic troubles

The traffic problems that plagued motorists during the first day of the air show Saturday seemed to have returned today.

""You need someone directing traffic on Northwoods Blvd."" Stacey Underwood wrote on the show's Facebook page late this morning. ""You have the traffic off of highway 75N after they turn on Northwoods Blvd trying to get over 2 lanes to turn into general admission parking.""

Other patrons reported difficulty getting through traffic to the show.

'I think it's fantastic'

For Robb Cady of Columbus and his son Tyson Cady who spent the morning checking out the show's numerous aircrafts the 2022 event was the first for both.

""I think it's fantastic"" Robb Cady said. ""He's an airplane nut so I think having a display like this and looking all the different models is great. He's just really getting into it now and his brother's a pilot.""

Tyson Cady said they should have come both days ""because there's so much to look at.""

Snapping photos of the shows numerous planes including the CH-53 Super Stallion was Isaac Hargrove of Westfield Indiana who said it was first time at the air show tagging along with with a friend and her family.

Story continues

""They go to a lot of different air shows and me being a photographer I love like just stuff in the air"" said Hargrove. ""I'm a huge fan of the military and things like that so that's why I came out because I thought it would be really cool to actually experience it for myself.""

Today the feature flying show will be held from noon to 4:15 p.m but there will be a host of ground-based ""static displays"" all the way through 6 p.m. including the Air Force B-52 Stratofortress F-15 and the Army CH-47F.

The Navy's Blue Angels are the headline act. With their new F/A-18 Super Hornets the Blue Angels can reach up to 700 mph and fly as close as 18 inches apart. The Air Force Thunderbirds and the Navy Blue Angels alternate as the show's crowning performance every other year.

Ticket information

General admission tickets priced at $20-$30 are available online at a Kroger near you or may be purchased at the gate. Children younger than 5 years old receive free admission. For more information visit daytonairshow.com or call 800-514-3849. — - — - — - — - — -

Investing.com -- China's economy slowed again in July suggesting a rocky road to full recovery. PMIs from around the world point to a generalized slowdown except in India. Stocks are pausing for breath after last week's tech-driven rally and grain and oil prices ease on brighter news out of Europe. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday August 1.

1. China slows; Beijing bristles as Pelosi prepares Taipei visit

China’s manufacturing sector slowed in July amid signs of weak demand from core export markets and lingering disruptions from repeated outbreaks of COVID-19.

The Caixin Manufacturing PMI which tracks activity among private-sector companies fell to 50.4 only just above the 50 line that typically separates contraction from expansion with firms reporting falling output and a sixth straight drop in employment.

The numbers suggest that China’s economy still faces huge challenges to meet an official growth target of around 5.5% this year. They were corroborated by HSBC adding another $150 million in credit loss provisions to its offshore Chinese loan book a reflection of the grinding real estate crisis.

In other China-related news U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi begins a tour of Asia today that is scheduled to include a visit to Taiwan despite strongly-worded warnings from Beijing against it.

2. India bucks worldwide PMI decline trend; German retail sales slump

Purchasing managers indices around the world also pointed to a slowdown broadly confirming the preliminary data released a week earlier except in India where activity picked up strongly.

The Institute for Supply Management’s PMI will be released at 10:00 AM ET and is likewise expected to show a modest slowdown from June albeit staying clearly in growth territory.

That contrast with the Eurozone where manufacturing is already in contraction owing to the acute energy crisis and accompanying inflation problem. Those factors also contributed largely to the biggest annual drop in German retail sales since the country started collecting pan-German data in 1994.

3. Stocks set to open mixed; Shale earnings in focus later

U.S. stock markets are set to open the week flat to lower pausing for breath after a vigorous rally last week in response to the quarterly results from Big Tech names.

By 06:30 AM ET (1030 GMT) Dow Jones futures were down 8 points essentially unchanged while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were both down 0.2%.

Most of the day’s earnings action comes after the close with shale oil and gas producers Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) and Diamondback (NASDAQ:FANG) in particularly sharp focus. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) CF Industries (NYSE:CF) Avis (NASDAQ:CAR) and Vornado (NYSE:VNO) also report late while Jacobs Engineering (NYSE:J) and Loews (NYSE:L) head a thinner slate ahead of the opening.

4. Grain prices ease as first ship leaves Ukraine under UN deal

The Sierra Leone-flagged ship Razoni became the first ship to leave a Ukrainian port carrying grain under a landmark UN-backed deal a tentative sign of progress in relieving a growing food crisis in the emerging world. Russia has been blockading Ukrainian ports since its invasion in February

The BBC quoted Turkish and Ukrainian officials as saying the ship left the port of Odesa early on Monday morning local time. It will arrive in Turkish waters for inspection on Tuesday. It is due to take its cargo of 26000 tons of corn to the Lebanese port of Tripoli.

Grain futures eased again on the news with U.S. corn futures falling 1.5% and wheat futures falling 1.4%.

5. Oil falls on report that marine insurance sanctions will not be enforced

Crude oil prices also eased after a report suggested that the U.K. and Europe will not after all try to stop all seaborne Russian oil cargoes from getting insurance. The initiative had formed a major part of the EU’s sixth sanctions package with the capability to disrupt shipments to third-party countries such as China and India.

However the Financial Times reported that the U.K. has not drafted the legislation necessary for that under pressure from the U.S. which wants to bring oil prices down in time for the midterm elections in November.

By 06:30 AM ET U.S. crude futures were down 1.3% at $97.31 a barrel while Brent was down 0.9% at $102.98 a barrel.

Charter Communications is being ordered by a Texas jury to pay $7 billion in punitive damages.

The damages would go to the family of an 83-year-old woman who was robbed and killed by a Spectrum technician.

A lawyer told WSJ the punitive damages will probably be reduced by the case's judge.

Charter Communications is being ordered to pay a combined $7.37 billion in damages to the family of an 83-year-old woman from Texas who was robbed and killed by a Spectrum technician in 2019.

The jury awarded $7 billion in punitive damages against Charte ""for systemic safety failures"" and ""for using forged documents to try to keep a jury from hearing the lawsuit"" according to a press release from the law firm Hamilton Wingo who represented the plaintiffs.

The case stems from the death of Betty Thomas who was killed by Roy Holden a cable technician for Spectrum in December 2019 the day after Holden had made a service call at her house. Holden returned to Thomas's house after she was still encountering service issues according to the lawyer's release. After catching him stealing credit cards from her purse Holden stabbed Thomas with a utility knife that was provided by Charter Spectrum according to the plaintiff's lawyers. After he killed Thomas Holden began using her credit cards to make purchases the law firm said.

After being arrested for capital murder in December 2019 Holden pled guilty to murdering Thomas in April 2021 and is serving life in prison.

The trial against Charter found that Holden's employment history wasn't verified by Charter Spectrum ""which would have revealed that he had lied about his work history."" Holden had also written to his supervisors about ""severe distress over financial and family problems"" asking for help according to the release.

""This was a shocking breach of faith by a company that sends workers inside millions of homes every year"" said Chris Hamilton a trial lawyer from Hamilton Wingo. ""The jury in this case was thoughtful and attentive to the evidence. This verdict justly reflects the extensive evidence regarding the nature of the harm caused by Charter Spectrum's gross negligence and reckless misconduct. For the safety of the American public we can only hope that Charter Spectrum and its shareholders are listening.""

A jury in Dallas County rewarded $375 million in compensatory damages in June and found the cable company 90% responsible for Thomas's death ""given Charter Spectrum's continued refusal to correct its negligent safety practices despite a repeated pattern of violence against innocent customers by its field techs over a period of years.""

Brian Kabateck a lawyer from California told The Wall Street Journal that the amount of punitive damages is ""breathtaking"" and that the judge will ""probably cut it down.""

Kabateck referenced a previous Supreme Court case that punitive damages shouldn't be over 10-times as much as the compensatory damages.

""Punitive damages like that are never paid—they're always reduced"" W. Mark Lanier a civil-trial lawyer in Texas told WSJ. ""They're a message of how frustrated the jury was with egregious facts.""

The jury also found that after a lawsuit was filed by Thomas's family attorneys for Charter Spectrum ""used a forged document to try to force the lawsuit into a closed-door arbitration"" where damages for Thomas's murder would've only amounted to her final bill.

""The jury found that Charter Spectrum committed forgery beyond a reasonable doubt conduct that constitutes a first-degree felony under Texas law"" the press release said.







A Charter Communications spokesperson told NBC News the company will appeal the verdict of $7 billion in punitive damages and placed sole blame on Holden.

In a statement shared with Insider a Charter Communications spokesperson said ""Our hearts go out to Mrs. Thomas' family in the wake of this senseless and tragic crime. The responsibility for this horrible act rests solely with Mr. Holden who was not on duty and we are grateful he is in prison for life. While we respect the jury and the justice system we strongly disagree with the verdict and will appeal.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjAyMi8wNy8zMC9oaWxsc2RhbGUtYWZmaWxpYXRlZC1jaGFydGVyLXNjaG9vbHMtc3ByZWFkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Hillsdale-affiliated charter schools spread,I recently wrote a piece about a controversy over disparaging comments that Larry Arnn president of the small but influential Christian Hillsdale College in Michigan made about teachers.

What You Need To Know Journey House was founded in Milwaukee in 1969





The nonprofit helps with adult education youth athletics and leadership workforce development and family engagement





It offers ASL classes U.S. Citizenship classes G.E.D. help and more

“Those essential items like notebooks pencils glue crayons things they need just to get started in school"" said Myers who is the director of community partnerships with Journey House.

Myers said the organization is looking to help several hundred students this year.

“We’re looking to secure anywhere between 200 to 400 backpacks; [that] would be awesome"" Myers said.

The school supply drive is just one of many different ways Journey House helps the community.

Journey House is a nonprofit that has been in Milwaukee since 1969. It has ""built and re-imagined high performance programs in the Clarke Square neighborhood — from Adult Education Youth Leadership and Athletics THRIVE Workforce Development and Family Engagement"" according to Myers.

“We use these four core programs to help us help give the neighborhood and the neighborhood vital resources that are much needed"" she added.

Those programs run throughout the entire year. In July it hosted a summer academy for construction and design.

Tucker Sander 17 is one of the students in that academy. On Wednesday he worked to clear space for new development for planting.

He's been involved with this program for just six weeks. He learned about it during a presentation in school.

“I was super interested and it’s paid and it’s a whole lot of fun and great experience and probably the most hands on thing I’ve done throughout the summer"" Sander said.

While he and his friends completed more hands on work Journey House provides a lot of educational opportunities too.

Veronica Sanchez took English as a Second Language classes and a U.S. Citizenship classes; her husband completed G.E.D. classes and her daughter takes dance class at Journey House.

She said she’s grateful for the opportunities.

“The opportunities are [a] better life [to be a] better person and get a better life"" Sanchez said.

And that is something Journey House set out to do more than 50 years ago and hopes to continue for years to come.

When it comes to the energy sector a few names stand above the rest and Chevron (CVX 1.79%) is one of them. With a massive $285-billion market cap it is easily one of the largest oil and natural gas producers on the planet. And it has a long history of operational success and dividend growth. It's a great energy option but only if you are thinking long-term. Here are three reasons you might want to buy it and one reason to avoid it.

1. Diversified portfolio

Although oil and natural gas prices are the biggest driving force behind Chevron's top and bottom lines its business is spread across the energy landscape. That includes everything from upstream drilling operations to downstream chemical and refining businesses. It provides a bit of balance to results often softening the blow when energy prices drop. This is notable because commodity prices are volatile and often move in a dramatic fashion. Having an offset even if modest helps smooth out performance over time.

2. Financial strength

Another notable facet of Chevron's business is that management has long focused on having a rock-solid balance sheet. To put a number on that the oil giant's debt-to-equity ratio is around 0.2 times today. That's lower than all of its closest peers.

The importance of this is that having low leverage allows Chevron to lean on its balance sheet during energy downturns so it can continue to support its capital investment plans and dividend (more on dividends in a second). For example the 2020 pandemic downturn in oil prices pushed Chevron's debt-to-equity ratio up over 0.3 times a trend that has since reversed now that the energy sector is again in an upturn. Clearly the flexibility low leverage provides has been used to good ends.

3. Reliable dividends

This brings the story to Chevron's dividend which has been increased annually for over three decades. That makes the company a Dividend Aristocrat. If you are a dividend investor looking for some energy exposure the 3.9% yield here coupled with the strong payment history should be pretty enticing.

It wouldn't be fair to leave it at that however. Oil and natural gas are highly cyclical and as noted prone to dramatic price swings. For Chevron to have amassed this type of dividend record is quite remarkable. It shows management's commitment to shareholders and that deserves a special highlight.

Minus one

While these are all strong reasons to buy Chevron there is one reason you may not want to. Oil and gas prices are relatively high today and the stock while off of recent peaks is still up materially from its pandemic lows. Since oil prices remain fairly elevated there is potentially more downside risk for the stock over the near term than upside potential.

The company is basically built to navigate the long-term ups and downs of the sector specifically blunting the near-term gyrations. It is a core energy holding that won't maximize the upside like a pure-play producer such as ConocoPhillips (COP 0.27%) would. Chevron is just not the type of investment that you'll want to own if you are looking to time oil price moves.

There's no doubt Chevron will benefit from rising prices just not to the same degree as a name like ConocoPhillips. And while Chevron will protect you to some degree on the downside that's not exactly the point if you are trying to time energy price moves. If you expect an oil decline shorting a stock like ConocoPhillips would probably make more sense than shorting Chevron.

A long-term hold

At the end of the day Chevron is built to be a long-term investment in the energy sector. That's why it has a diversified business model and strong finances and pays extra attention to rewarding investors with dividend increases. However all of those traits generally mean it isn't an ideal way to play near-term oil price moves since Chevron won't maximize the upside or downside with its steady-hand approach. If you are looking to add an energy name to your otherwise diversified portfolio Chevron could be a strong option but only if you are looking to hold onto it for a long time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA3LTMwL3JldmVuZ2Utb2Ytb2xkLXdvcmxkLWVjb25vbXktYXMtYmlnLW9pbC1zLWNhc2gtZmxvdy1yaXZhbHMtdGVjaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Revenge of Old World Economy as Big Oil's Cash Flow Rivals Tech,"Why did this happen?

The US pair along with UK-based Shell and France’s TotalEnergies combined to earn nearly $51 billion in the most recent quarter almost double what the group brought in for the year-ago period. All four have ramped up share buybacks in recent months capitalizing on high margins derived from selling oil and gas.

Exxon outpaced its rivals with second-quarter net income of $17.9 billion several billion dollars ahead of its previous record reached in 2012 which was aided by asset sales in Japan. The fifth major BP Plc reports next week.

The companies posted strong results in their production units helped by the surge in benchmark Brent crude oil futures  which averaged around $114 a barrel in the quarter.

High crude oil prices can cut into margins for integrated oil majors as they also bear the cost of crude used for refined products. However following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and numerous shutdowns of refineries worldwide in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic refining margins exploded in the second quarter outpacing the gains in crude adding to earnings.

“The strong second-quarter results reflect a tight global market environment where demand has recovered to near pre-pandemic levels and supply has attritted” said Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods in a call with analysts. “Growing supply will not happen overnight.”

The results from the majors are sure to draw fire from politicians and consumer advocates who say the oil companies are capitalizing on a global supply shortage to fatten profits and gouge consumers. US President Joe Biden last month said Exxon and others were making “more money than God” at a time when consumer fuel prices surged to records.

Earlier this month Britain passed a 25% windfall tax on oil and gas producers in the North Sea. US lawmakers have discussed a similar idea though it faces long odds in Congress.

A windfall tax does not provide “incentive for increased production which is really what the world needs today” said Exxon Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells in an interview with Reuters.

The companies say they are merely meeting consumer demand and that prices are a function of global supply issues and lack of investment. The majors have been disciplined with their capital and are resisting ramping up capital expenditure due to pressure from investors who want better returns and resilience during a down cycle.

“In the short term (cash from oil) goes to the balance sheet. There’s no nowhere else for it to go” Chevron CFO Pierre Breber told Reuters.

Worldwide oil output has been held back by a slow return of barrels to the market from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia as well as labor and equipment shortages hampering a swifter increase in supply in places like the United States.

Exxon earlier this year more than doubled its projected buyback program to $30 billion through 2022 and 2023. Shell said it would buy back $6 billion in shares in the current quarter while Chevron boosted its annual buyback plans to a range of $10 billion to $15 billion up from $5 billion to $10 billion.

Exxon shares were up 3.2% to $95.60 in morning trading. Chevron shares rose 6.5% to $160.06."

Developed using data from Technomic Inc. a Chicago-based consumer research firm the line-up measure customer preferences towards restaurant brands in various product categories.

The most recent craveability “Top Ten” described consumer sentiments towards a warm-weather staple ice cream and ranks those chains where the ice cream is worthy of “craveable” status.

Among the locally-available brands on the list Friendly’s Restaurant ranked number eight with a third of the survey’s respondents ranking it as “craveable.” Friendly’s sundaes got special mention being described as “awesome” and “delightful” with creations like the Reese’s Pieces sundae the recipient of customer accolades.

Another well-established ice cream brand Dairy Queen earned number six status on the top ten list. DQ’s “Blizzard” ice cream treats were the most commonly mentioned reason for the chain’s craveability although sundae creations like the DQ Banana Split also received kudos.

There is a Dairy Queen location in Greater Springfield on Memorial Drive in Chicopee as well as a seasonal treat DQ Treat Shop on Enfield Street in Enfield.

Scoop shop specialists like Ben & Jerry’s and Carvel tend to dominate the top of the list.

Cold Stone Creamery with its unconventional flavors and customizable mix-ins comes in at number four on the list with more than half of those surveyed describing Cold Stone’s creations as “craveable.” Cold Stone’s ice cream cakes and waffle bowls were additionally cited as customer favorites.

A Cold Stone Creamery location is part of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame complex in Springfield where it does business seven days a week from 11 a.m. until 9 p.m.

Baskin-Robbins which is number one on the craveability list with a score of 66% is cited for the range and intensity of its flavors. The chain doesn’t operate here in Western Massachusetts but does have locations in West Hartford and Glastonbury where they are co-branded with Dunkin’ outlets.

Locally of course there are plenty of ice cream options that would easily find a place on any WestMass “craveability” top ten. Operations like Herrell’s Ice Cream in downtown Northampton and Alvin Rondeau’s Dairy Bar in Palmer have multi-decade histories of satisfying ice cream cravings while a host of newer scoop shops up and down the Pioneer Valley ensure that the region remains an ice cream lover’s Nirvana.

As part of a late-July presentation to Wall Street analysts McDonald’s Corp. executives described the chain as being “cautious” about consumer sentiment.

Though McDonald’s U.S. sales increased nearly 4% in the second quarter of 2022 customer counts were flat suggesting that revenue increases were the result of price increases. McDonald’s continues to report that some customers especially those with lower incomes appear to be trading down to cheaper alternatives on the Golden Arches’ menu.

Nonetheless the chain plans on “pushing through pricing” with small frequent increases in the months ahead.

A major fast casual brand Chipotle Mexican Grill is taking a more aggressive pricing stance.

Though it too admits to seeing lower-income guests “pulling back” Chipotle plans a menu price hike of 4% in August. The chain has most recently increased prices by about 8% in 2021 and by 10.5% earlier this year.

Chipotle’s leadership is reportedly confident that the planned price increases will not have an adverse impact on the company’s financial results since the chain’s customers tend to come from in their words “higher-income households.”

The Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance recently announced a pilot program that will allow restaurants and food trucks to participate in the SNAP (“food stamp”) program.

Garnished with bacon crumbles the fries are also decked out with cheese sauce shredded cheddar red onion diced tomato and sour cream.

There are Red Robin locations at Holyoke Crossing in Holyoke and in the Enfield Square Shopping Center in Enfield.

Unionization efforts at Starbucks continue with the workers at over 200 locations now represented by Starbucks United an affiliate of the Service Employees United Union. An additional 100 to 150 Starbucks stores are currently awaiting National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) action on their individual requests to unionize.

While the number of unionized locations is small compared to the almost 10000 Starbucks outlets in the U.S. the continued momentum of the organizing campaign is worrisome to both Starbucks corporate and the restaurant industry as a whole.

Chipotle Mexican Grill which was facing a unionization effort at an Augusta Maine restaurant has permanently closed that location citing chronic staff shortages.

Employees at a second Chipotle restaurant in Lansing MI have also filed for an NLRB election. That group of workers is coordinating its efforts with the formidable International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

Major restaurant chains whose outlets are primarily company-owned seems to be particularly vulnerable to this current wave of union representation efforts.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

Worship attendance small group attendance and baptisms were up last year in the SBC’s annual statistical report released Tuesday while membership fell below 13 million.

2023 marks 17 straight years of decline for the country’s biggest Protestant denomination. It’s down 3.3 million from its peak with the steepest drops coming during the pandemic. The SBC lost 1.3 million members between 2020 and 2022 alone.

Beyond COVID-19 disruptions Southern Baptists have recently confronted some contentious issues within their convention responding to sexual abuse and clamping down on female preachers which have led some congregations to leave the SBC (including prominent megachurch Saddleback Church).

But statistics indicate that church departures aren’t a significant driver of membership decline; the SBC was down 292 churches last year just 0.63 percent of its total.

In 2023 membership fell by 241000 its smallest decrease since 2018. Yet attendance at SBC churches increased 6.5 percent reaching above 4 million a week for the first time since the pandemic.

Attendance at small groups and Bible studies ticked up 4 percent to 2.4 million.

With fewer Americans than ever attending church and religious disaffiliation on the rise leaders see even small increases in engagement and discipleship as worth celebrating.

It’s the first time in over a decade that SBC worship attendance has grown two years in a row though it still lags behind pre-pandemic numbers. Back in 2019 SBC churches saw over 5 million show up each Sunday.

“Outreach and discipleship are difficult today. They require time and commitment when our culture offers numerous distractions and alternatives. The pandemic was discouraging as fewer people engaged in these activities” said Scott McConnell executive director of Lifeway Research which releases the annual report.

“But as people have re-engaged and new people are participating there is much to celebrate in Southern Baptist churches today while we invite more to join.”

Baptisms the key metric for Southern Baptists also grew for the second year in a row.

“God has been stirring the waters and an upswing in baptisms has solidly begun” wrote SBC president Bart Barber a pastor in Texas.

“Not only have we experienced a second year of increased baptisms but we have also witnessed a year-over-year gain—25.94 percent more baptisms than in 2022—that leaves no room for doubt about what God is doing among our churches.”

Kevin Ezell president of the North American Mission Board said the baptism trend is widespread across regions. Out of 41 state conventions 35 reported more baptisms in 2023 than 2022.

“Pastors are the difference makers here” he said in a statement. “Despite all the distractions and challenges out there they are keeping the focus on evangelism and encouraging new believers to follow up with baptism.”

The report’s release falls about a month before the SBC’s annual meeting which gathers over 10000 messengers in Indianapolis in June. They are slated to address new mechanisms for overseeing abuse reform and reporting as well as clarifications to cooperation agreements and guidance around women in ministry.

The SBC’s current membership of 12982090 is the lowest since 1976. The membership size peaked at 16.3 million in 2006.

One bright spot leaders say is the generosity of members and churches who spent nearly $800 million on missions last year up 9 percent.

“We are sharing the gospel with more people gathering for worship and Bible study in increasing numbers giving billions to support churches serving communities across our country and sending millions to support mission enterprises around the world” said Jeff Iorg the SBC Executive Committee president-elect.

“Southern Baptists are not a perfect people” he added. “But we are a movement making a positive difference in our world and our most recent statistical report underscores this reality and motivates us to press forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhc3RpZGFob25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvY2h1cmNoLWVtcGxveWVlLWFsbGVnZWRseS1zdGVhbHMtb3Zlci0zMzAwMDAtZnJvbS1wcmVzYnl0ZXJpYW4tY2h1cmNoLW9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church employee allegedly steals over $330000 from Presbyterian church organization,"IDAHO FALLS — A 31-year-old church employee was arrested after she allegedly stole over $330000 from a local Presbyterian organization.

Kaitlyn Fisher was charged with three counts of felony grand theft on May 3.

Court documents say on Oct. 14 2022 an employee of the Presbytery of Kendall reported that Fisher the administrative clerk had been embezzling from church funds.

The Presbytery of Kendall is an organization that oversees the Presbyterian churches in the eastern Idaho area. According to a church newsletter obtained by EastIdahoNews.com Fisher was the administrative executive assistant.

EastIdahoNews.com has attempted to contact the Presbytery of Kendall by phone and email for comment and we are awaiting their response.

The reporting party told police the staff had not met for annual financial review meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time she repeatedly asked Fisher who acted as a secretary and bookkeeper for a summary of the church organization’s financials.

In October 2022 the board of trustees chair obtained the organization’s bank statements after asking the banks directly.

In the statements the employees reportedly discovered “numerous unauthorized purchases and transfers out of both accounts via Venmo and Paypal as far back as 2020.”

The two employees confronted Fisher on Oct. 10 where she allegedly admitted to making the unauthorized transfers and purchases.

On Dec. 6 an Idaho Falls Police officer contacted Fisher about the allegations and she denied stealing the money.

Over a week later the officer contacted a criminal investigator with the Idaho State Tax Commission who was able to issue and serve subpoenas for Fisher’s PayPal and Venmo account records.

In the transaction history investigators discovered at least $338458 worth of unauthorized purchases made from Fishers account allegedly using church funds between January 2019 and October 2022.

According to police reports Fisher used the money to buy a red 2018 Honda 4-wheeler from Action Motor Sports to pay The Yard Butler a local landscape designer and debited between $280890.01 and $281474 from the church organization’s Wells Fargo account.

Venmo account records showed Fisher’s Venmo account was linked to the church’s Wells Fargo account as a payment method for transactions.

Transaction descriptions further show Fisher allegedly used the money to pay for child care furniture a dog dog waste cleanup food gasoline her mortgage and supplies/labor to finish the basement of her new house.

Between July and October 2022 alone Fisher allegedly spend at least $38801.84 from the church’s Idaho Central Credit Union account.

A warrant was issued for Fisher’s arrest on May 3 and she was booked into the Bonneville County Jail on May 7. Her bail was set to $30000. She posted bond and was released on the same day.

Fisher is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29. If convicted she could face up to 42 years in prison.

Though Fisher has been charged with these crimes it does not necessarily mean she committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25lYXJseS0xMDAtdGlyZXMtbGVmdC1jaHVyY2gtcHJvcGVydHktdmFuZGFscy1zdHJpa2UtYWdhaW4vTFlSNllUTkVGVkFSNUZQQkMySlpUQ1BDVUkv0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpcm83LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25lYXJseS0xMDAtdGlyZXMtbGVmdC1jaHVyY2gtcHJvcGVydHktdmFuZGFscy1zdHJpa2UtYWdhaW4vTFlSNllUTkVGVkFSNUZQQkMySlpUQ1BDVUkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly 100 tires left on church property as vandals strike again,"We’re Sorry!

Most of the people who signed up to testify addressed resolutions that would add people to the official church calendar. Because the calendar often known as Lesser Feasts and Fasts is considered part of the Book of Common Prayer any changes require action by two consecutive General Conventions.

Resolution C021 would affirm a second reading and place Élie Naud on the calendar. Naud was a French Huguenot who came to New York in the 1700s after spending time as a galley slave. He became a member of Trinity Church Wall Street where for 15 years he worked with Black slaves and Native Americans to prepare them for baptism. He later became a member of Église du Saint-Esprit a French-speaking Episcopal parish in New York and he also started a school for poor children and the children of slaves.

St. Esprit’s rector the Rev. Nigel Massey who has served the church for 30 years spoke in favor of the resolution. Early in his tenure serving the church he read a former rector’s history of the parish and was struck by a sentence that has stayed with him ever since: “Our church can claim at least one who in another community would have been canonized as a confessor and missionary the saintly Élie Naud slave and servant of slaves.”

Parishioners Wendy Range and Joris Burmann also supported the resolution. Range described how the church annually commemorates Naud’s death on Sept. 7 with prayers in French and English at his grave in the Trinity Church Wall Street’s churchyard. Burmann who also is a postulant for Holy Orders in the Diocese of New York said Naud could serve as “an ecumenical bridge” both for individuals and for churches since many people have been members of other denominations before finding The Episcopal Church

Four people three from the Diocese of Hawai’i spoke in favor of A124 which would approve on first reading the addition of Liliʻuokalani of Hawai’i to the calendar. A confirmed member of the Cathedral of St. Andrew in Honolulu she was queen of the Hawai’ian Kingdom when her government was overthrown in 1893 by forces backed by the U.S. Navy. With her people facing such overwhelming force she chose not to fight to hold her crown and urged her people to respect her decision. She later was imprisoned.

The Rev. Steve Costa archdeacon of the Diocese of Hawai’i said that through her selfless service to her people and her surrender to prevent the deaths of others “she personified the beloved community long before we even thought of these things.” He also noted that Liliʻuokalani had composed what is known as the Queen’s Prayer or Ke Aloha o Ka Haku which still is sung by almost every church in Hawai’i on Sundays.

Two other Hawai’i deputies Mary Carpenter and Ryan Kusumoto also spoke in favor with Carpenter calling Liliʻuokalani “a model of the living native Hawaiian spirit for most of us Indigenous Pacifica people” while Kusumoto praised her selflessness in saving her people at the cost of her crown. “She stood down so her people could stand up” he said. “If she did not surrender to the American militant colonizers there may not be native Hawaiians here today.”

House of Deputies Vice President the Rev. Rachel Taber-Hamilton a member of Shacken First Nation said that recognizing Liliʻuokalani would be an important part of “the church’s overall commitment to reparation and reconciliation with the Indigenous peoples of every land in which our church had a part in weaponizing theology to justify genocide.”

The commemoration of Howard Thurman a Black pastor educator theologian and civil rights leader on first reading was proposed in C011 by the Diocese of California and in C012 by the Diocese of Northern California. The two resolutions differ only slightly in their language and Northern California deputy the Rev. James Richardson spoke in favor of both. The explanation accompanying each one describes well his “biography and influence on the civil rights movement which was enormous and the reasons for adding him to the calendar” Richardson said. He noted that while about 300 people currently are commemorated in The Episcopal Church’s calendar only about a dozen are African American and fewer still are African American theologians.

Thoma Lipartiani from the Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe joined the meeting from the Republic of Georgia to support Resolution C020 adding Ilia Chavchavadze of Georgia on first reading. He described Chavchavadze as a public figure journalist publisher writer poet and human rights activist “who united Georgian society around three cornerstones of our nation – language homeland faith.” Chavchavadze was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church in 1987 according to information provided with the resolution.

Turning to matters of liturgy James Frazer a member of St. Stephen and the Incarnation in Washington D.C. suggested a variety of changes to Resolution A114 which would authorize two expansive language versions of the Book of Common Prayer’s Eucharistic Prayer C. Frazer offered some changes in and reorganization of some proposed wording.

Deputies committee chair the Ven. Stannard Baker of Vermont asked Marty Wheeler Burnett associate professor of church music and director of chapel music at Virginia Theological Seminary to speak about two resolutions dealing with hymns and hymn texts – A130 and A131.

Burnett who also is a member of the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music said that A130 came out of a 2022 General Convention resolution mandating the commission to examine colonialist racist white supremacist imperialistic and nationalistic language in hymns. Focus groups since then have shown “widespread interest in and need for alternative versions of problematic texts” she said.

The resolution calls on the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music to develop and for Church Publishing Incorporated to publish a digital collection of alternative versions of hymn texts that congregations could use with permission of the diocesan bishop. Burnett noted that copyrights can be an issue on all hymn texts and any that the commission would include in this new collection would have permissions secured as needed.

She also spoke in favor of A131 which calls on the commission to develop a new supplement to the Hymnal 1982. “It has been 20 years since The Episcopal Church published a hymnal supplement and much has happened in 20 years” she said. “It is time.” Current hymnal supplements are Wonder Love and Praise (1997) and Voices Found (2003).

Among the resolutions that drew no testimony were second readings authorizing calendar additions of the consecration of Barbara Harris; Harriet Tubman; Simeon Bachos the Ethiopian eunuch; and Frederick Howden Jr.

Action will be taken on all these resolutions at a future meeting. They then will be considered by the 81st General Convention when it meets in Louisville Kentucky June 23-28.

Pastilah Dewata akan murka. Begitulah Kebo Garang berbincang dengan dirinya sendiri. Menghibur suasana hatinya.

Kini sang prabu sudah memantapkan hatinya untuk memboyong Retno Gumilang ke istana untuk dijadikan garwa padmi. Keinginan tersebut menjadi polemik di lingkungan istana. Bagi masyarakat Jawa menikahi wanita yang sudah bersuami tidaklah lazim. Sang prabu tidak kehilangan cara. Ia segera mengutus senopatinya untuk membunuh suami Retno Gumilang.

Sudah hampir tiga bulan Prabu Amangkurat tak menyentuh tubuh istrinya maupun garwa ampeyan yang jumlahnya puluhan. Kabar sang prabu kehilangan kejantanannya sempat mencuat menjadi kasak-kusuk di antara para garwa ampeyan. Namun kabar itu ditepis oleh Ratu Kulon. Dari mulut sang ratu barulah diketahui bahwa Prabu Amangkurat sedang kesengsem oleh kecantikan seorang sinden bernama Retno Gumilang sejak pertama kali bertemu.

Kabar keinginan Prabu Amangkurat yang ingin memperistri Retno Gumilang membuat hati Diyah Wulansari resah. Ia pun bergegas menemui Kebo Garang—iparnya.

”Kebo Garang apa kamu tahu jika Prabu Amangkurat akan memperistri Retno Gumilang? Sebelum itu terjadi aku ingin kamu membunuh perempuan itu. Sungguh aku khawatir Kakanda Prabu Amangkurat akan mengalihkan cintanya. Sebab setelah Ratu Kulon akulah garwa ampeyan kesayangan sang prabu. Aku juga khawatir dari rahim Retno Gumilang akan lahir putra mahkota yang akan menggantikan kedudukan Adipati Anom—putra Ratu Kulon” kata Diyah Wulansari sambil berjalan mondar-mandir yang menunjukkan kegelisahan hatinya.

”Jujur hati hamba bergetar hebat mendapat perintah dari Kanjeng untuk menentang keinginan sang prabu. Selama ini tidak ada yang berani melawan Prabu Amangkurat” balas Kebo Garang.

”Apa yang kamu takuti? Di tanah Jawa ini siapa yang tidak mengenal pendekar Kebo Garang orang kepercayaan Pangeran Pekik? Prajurit-prajurit Mataram pun segan jika mendengar namamu.”

”Benar Kanjeng tetapi tetap saja hamba hanya manusia yang pasti tidak akan mampu jika harus menghadapi puluhan senopati Mataram.”

”Itu bedanya pendekar dengan prajurit. Kamu bertarung hanya menggunakan tenagamu bukan pikiranmu.”

”Maksudnya?”

”Kamu bisa menculik Retno Gumilang tanpa seorang pun tahu siapa yang melakukannya. Terserah ingin kamu apakan setelahnya. Asalkan habisi nyawanya. Aku sangat khawatir Prabu Amangkurat terbunuh oleh kecantikan Retno Gumilang yang begitu gemilang.”

Kebo Garang diam usai menerima sebundel emas dari Diyah Wulansari. Dia masih termenung menenangkan hatinya. Sebagai seorang pendekar dia tahu kesaktian Prabu Amangkurat dan para senopatinya. Terlebih kekejamannya tiada tandingannya.

Prabu Amangkurat kali ini gegabah mencintai wanita yang sudah bersuami. Pastilah Dewata akan murka. Begitulah Kebo Garang berbincang dengan dirinya sendiri. Menghibur suasana hatinya.

Sebagai seorang pendekar pantang menyembunyikan keris yang sudah keluar dari sarungnya. Segera saja Kebo Garang mengumpulkan anak buahnya. Telik sandi segera dikirim ke Pasundan untuk memata-matai keberadaan Retno Gumilang.

Sial bagi Kebo Garang belum juga memandikan kerisnya dengan tujuh rupa bunga dia sudah harus berhadapan dengan senopati Prabu Amangkurat.

”Keluar kau Kebo Garang. Jangan bersembunyi di bilik istrimu. Aku Senopati Aji Saka menantangmu bertarung sekarang juga” katanya dengan setengah berteriak.

Mendengar keributan di depan rumahnya segera saja Kebo Garang keluar. ”Banyak sekali Tuan Senopati membawa tamu padahal rumah hamba begitu kecil” kata Kebo Garang dengan tenang.

”Jangan pura-pura bodoh. Kau mengirim telik sandi untuk memata-matai Retno Gumilang bukan? Para telik sandimu sudah aku ringkus.”

”Biar aku jelaskan. Aku hanya menjalankan tugas dari junjunganku.”

”Siapa junjunganmu? Siapa yang berani melawan Prabu Amangkurat?”

”Itu tidak penting. Tetapi keberadaanmu di Pasundan justru membuatku curiga. Misi apa yang kau bawa?”

”Analisismu bagus juga Kebo Garang. Kita sama-sama menjalankan tugas. Dan tugasmu mengacaukan tugasku.”

”Jangan berbelit-belit katakan yang sebenarnya atau keris lekuk pituku yang akan memaksa mulutmu untuk bicara!” kata Kebo Garang yang mulai habis kesabarannya.

”Aku juga mempunyai keris. Apa kau penasaran ingin menguji kerisku?”

”Kalau begitu lekas katakan!”

”Aku diperintah untuk membunuh Ki Dalem suami Retno Gumilang.”

”Bedebah. Berarti kau musuhku. Cabut kerismu. Kita buktikan kulit mana yang lebih keras. Kulitmu atau kulitku.”

Pertarungan pun terjadi dengan sengitnya. Setelah mengeluarkan jurus pamungkasnya masing-masing Kebo Garang berhasil merobek perut Senopati Aji Saka meski dia mengalami luka cukup parah di lengan tangannya.

Kematian Senopati Aji Saka berhasil menggemparkan Istana Mataram. Prabu Amangkurat sangat marah menyaksikan salah satu senopati terbaiknya telentang di hadapannya dengan luka mengerikan. Sang prabu menuding Ki Dalem dan orang-orangnya telah membunuhnya. Segera saja sang prabu memberi titah kepada panglima perang Mataram untuk mengepung pedepokan Ki Dalam beserta pengikutnya dan meringkusnya hidup atau mati.

Kabar penyerbuan pasukan Mataram ke pedepokan Ki Dalem yang dipimpin langsung oleh panglima perangnya terdengar ke seluruh pelosok negeri. Kebo Garang bersyukur Prabu Amangkurat tidak mengetahui peristiwa yang sebenarnya terjadi. Meski begitu nalurinya berkata lain bagaimanapun juga dirinya harus menemui Ki Dalem untuk memberi tahu penyerbuan pasukan Mataram.

Kurang dari setengah hari perjalanan Kebo Garang sudah sampai di pedepokan Ki Dalem. Tanpa tedeng aling-aling dia langsung memberi tahu rencana Prabu Amangkurat yang akan menghancurkan pedepokan dan membunuh Ki Dalem. Itu disampaikan oleh Kebo Garang seusai istri Ki Dalem Retno Gumilang mengobati luka di lengannya yang menganga.

Detik itu juga ia terpesona oleh kecantikan Retno Gumilang. ”Inikah perempuan yang membuat Prabu Amangkurat kehilangan akal warasnya” ujarnya dalam hati.

”Lebih baik Ki Dalem tinggalkan pedepokan ini. Jumlah pasukan Mataram yang diturunkan begitu banyak dengan persenjataan lengkap” ujar Kebo Garang seusai menguasai hatinya yang tiba-tiba bergejolak melihat kecantikan Retno Gumilang.

”Tidak. Sekalipun harus mati aku akan mempertahankan tanah leluhur buyut kami” balasnya tanpa ragu-ragu.

”Bagaimana dengan Retno Gumilang? Terlebih istrimu itu sedang mengandung.”

Ki Dalem diam sebelum berujar pada istrinya ”Bagaimana Dinda?”

”Aku terserah Kang Mas saja. Asal aku tetap bersama Kang Mas.”

”Itu bukan pilihan yang bijak” sergah Kebo Garang.

”Lalu?”

”Jika Ki Dalem tidak keberatan aku akan membawa istrimu menyingkir dari pedepokan sambil mengawasi situasi.”

”Apakah aku turuti saja keinginan Prabu Amangkurat. Karena akulah biang kerok dari semua ini. Dari awal Prabu Amangkurat menginginkanku untuk menjadi istrinya” sela Retno Gumilang sambil menangis.

”Tidak Dinda. Di mana letak kehormatan seorang suami jika menyerahkan istrinya kepada lelaki lain untuk dinikmati biliknya. Biar aku hadapi pasukan Mataram. Kisanak bawa istriku menjauh dari pedepokan.”

”Baik” balas Kebo Garang dengan hati girang.

Segera saja Kebo Garang membawa Retno Gumilang ke rumahnya. Kedatangan Retno Gumilang disambut baik oleh istri Kebo Garang. Namun setelah beberapa hari sang istri mulai cemburu lantaran suaminya tidak lagi memperhatikan dirinya.

”Sedang apa Kang Mas?” tanya sang istri suatu malam di kamarnya.

”Menulis syair” jawab Kebo Garang ringkas.

”Tumben. Sudah lama sekali Kang Mas tidak menulis syair untukku.”

”Ini bukan untukmu. Ini untuk menghibur hati Retno Gumilang yang sedang gelisah.”

Mendengar jawaban suaminya sang istri murka. Ia pun memberi tahu keberadaan Retno Gumilang kepada Diyah Wulansari.

Segera saja Diyah Wulansari menuju rumah Kebo Garang. Sesampainya Diyah Wulansari meminta Kebo Garang untuk menyerahkan Retno Gumilang. Namun permintaan itu ditolaknya dengan alasan jika dirinya akan memperistrinya. Diyah Wulansari sangat marah mendengar jawaban itu. Tanpa menunggu lama Diyah Wulansari mengambil sebilah pisau untuk menghabisi Retno Gumilang. Kebo Garang tidak tinggal diam. Hanya dengan sekali gerakan pisau tersebut telah menancap ke perut Diyah Wulansari.

Istri Kebo Garang begitu sedih melihat kakaknya tewas di tangan suaminya. Tanpa pikir panjang dia mencabut keris suaminya dan menusuknya dari belakang. Seketika Kebo Garang tewas oleh kerisnya sendiri. Kemudian istri Kebo Garang memerintahkan para pengawal untuk membawa Retno Gumilang ke istana.

Kini sudah setahun Retno Gumilang tinggal di istana dan menjadi istri kesayangan Prabu Amangkurat yang telah memberinya gelar Ratu Wetan. Seiring bergulirnya waktu Retno Gumilang akhirnya mengetahui bahwa suaminya sudah lama tewas saat penyerbuan pasukan Mataram. Sejak saat itu dia mulai sakit-sakitan. Sementara keberadaan Retno Gumilang di keputren membuat istri dan para garwa ampeyan terbakar api cemburu.

Pada suatu malam salah satu garwa ampeyan menyuruh dayangnya untuk meracuni makanan Retno Gumilang. Seketika Retno Gumilang tewas dengan mulut berbusa. Kematian wanita yang terkenal dengan kecantikannya itu membuat hati Prabu Amangkurat terpukul. Sang prabu yang mengetahui penyebab kematian istri tercintanya langsung memerintahkan prajuritnya untuk mengurung semua garwa ampeyan dan dayang-dayangnya ke penjara tanpa diberi makan hingga semuanya tewas.

Dalam kesedihannya sang prabu memutuskan meninggalkan kerajaan untuk menemani mayat istri tercintanya di atas bukit Gunung Sentana. Di samping mayat istrinya sang prabu berujar ”Kecantikan adalah kutukan bagi seorang wanita. Dan cintaku padamu adalah korban dari kutukan itu.”

Bismillah wal-hamdulillah wash-shalatu was-salamu ‘ala rasulillah. Amma ba’du

Macam-macam cinta

Terdapat tiga macam cinta yaitu cinta yang syar’i cinta yang haram dan cinta yang diperbolehkan ditujukan kepada makhluk.

Jenis pertama: cinta yang syar’i

Mahabbatullah (mencintai Allah)

Mahabbatullah (mencintai Allah) merupakan kewajiban yang paling wajib. Kedudukan mahabbatullah adalah sebagai dasar agama Islam. Hal ini bisa ditinjau dari:

Pertama pendorong segala bentuk amal ibadah seorang hamba adalah cinta Allah Ta’ala cinta pahala-Nya dan cinta (ingin) selamat dari neraka. Bahkan dua rukun ibadah hati yang lainnya yaitu takut dan harap dasarnya adalah cinta kepada Allah. Karena orang yang berharap kepada Allah saat beribadah hakikatnya berharap sesuatu yang dicintainya berupa keridaan-Nya dan pahala-Nya. Sedangkan orang yang takut kepada Allah hakikatnya adalah takut kepada Tuhan yang dicintainya dengan puncak kecintaan dan takut kehilangan sesuatu yang dicintainya berupa keselamatan dari siksa-Nya.

Tawakal inabah tobat dan ibadah lainnya sumbernya adalah cinta kepada Allah Ta’ala dan tuntutannya yaitu cinta kepada rida-Nya dan cinta kepada pahala-Nya serta ingin selamat dari siksa-Nya.

Kedua setiap peribadahan pastilah dipersembahkan kepada Tuhan yang paling dicintainya dengan puncak kesempurnaan sehingga Dia diagungkan dan ditaati secara mutlak.

Mahabbatur rasulillah (cinta Rasul) shallallahu ‘alaihi wasallam

Di antara bentuk cinta syar’i adalah mencintai Rasulullah shallallahu ‘alaihi wasallam. Ini hukumnya wajib. Tidak sempurna keimanan wajib seorang hamba tanpa mencintai beliau melebihi mencintai diri sendiri dan seluruh makhluk.

Mencintai seluruh yang dicintai oleh Allah

Di antara bentuk cinta syar’i adalah mencintai seluruh yang dicintai oleh Allah yaitu mencintai para rasul dan nabi lainnya ‘alaihimush shalatu was-salamu orang saleh dan mencintai seluruh yang dicintai oleh Allah baik berupa syari’at Allah ucapan baik perbuatan baik (amalan saleh) orang saleh waktu dan tempat baik dan seluruh yang dicintai-Nya.

Cinta syar’i berupa mencintai Rasul dan mencintai yang dicintai Allah adalah al-hubbu fillah (cinta di jalan ketaatan kepada Allah) dan al-hubbu lillah (cinta karena Allah). Atau disebut juga mahabbatu ma yuhibbullah (mencintai segala yang dicintai Allah).

Cinta syar’i mencintai Rasul dan mencintai yang dicintai Allah ini mengikuti “dasar dari seluruh cinta” yaitu mahabbatullah. Sehingga mahabbatullah adalah sebagai dasar dari seluruh cinta lainnya.

Kecintaan kita terhadap sesuatu selain Allah mengikuti kecintaan Allah terhadap sesuatu tersebut. Semakin besar kecintaan Allah kepada sesuatu maka tertuntut semakin besar pula kecintaan kita kepada sesuatu tersebut. Begitu pula sebaliknya semakin besar kebencian Allah kepada sesuatu maka semakin besar pula kebencian kita kepada sesuatu tersebut.

Ar-Rabi’ bin Khutsaim rahimahullah berkata dalam Jami’ul Ulum wal-Hikam karya Ibnu Rajab rahimahullah

لو رأيت رجلا يظهر خيرا ، ويسر شرا ، أحببته عليه ، آجرك الله على حبك الخير ، ولو رأيت رجلا يظهر شرا ، ويسر خيرا بغضته عليه ، آجرك الله على بغضك الشر

“Seandainya anda melihat seseorang menampakkan kebaikan dan menyembunyikan keburukan lalu anda mencintainya karena kebaikannya tersebut niscaya Allah akan memberi pahala kepadamu atas dasar kecintaanmu kepada kebaikannya.

Sebaliknya seandainya anda melihat seseorang menampakkan keburukan dan menyembunyikan kebaikan lalu anda membencinya karena keburukannya tersebut niscaya Allah akan memberi pahala kepadamu atas dasar kebencianmu kepada keburukannya.”

Jenis kedua: cinta yang haram

Syirik besar yang menghancurkan dasar tauhid dan iman seseorang (al-mahabbah ma’allah)

Ini adalah cinta ibadah yang ditujukan kepada selain Allah atau disebut juga al-mahabbah ma’allah. Mencintai selain Allah sebagaimana mencintai Allah adalah syirik dalam cinta. Jadi patokan syirik besar dalam ibadah cinta adalah mencintai selain Allah sebagaimana mencintai Allah. Allah Ta’ala berfirman

وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَّتَّخِذُ مِنْ دُوْنِ اللّٰهِ اَنْدَادًا يُّحِبُّوْنَهُمْ كَحُبِّ اللّٰهِ ۗ وَالَّذِيْنَ اٰمَنُوْٓا اَشَدُّ حُبًّا لِّلّٰهِ

“Dan di antara manusia ada orang yang menyembah tuhan selain Allah sebagai tandingan yang mereka cintai seperti mencintai Allah. Adapun orang-orang yang beriman itu lebih besar cintanya kepada Allah.” (QS. Al-Baqarah: 165)

Cinta jenis syirik besar ini menghancurkan dasar tauhid dan dasar iman seseorang sehingga pelakunya kafir. Karena jika masuk dalam kategori cinta ibadah lalu cinta tersebut ditujukan kepada Allah saja maka bernilai tauhid. Dan jika ditujukan selain Allah maka bernilai syirik besar. Ciri cinta yang merupakan ibadah adalah mengandung puncak cinta dan puncak perendahan diri (puncak pengagungan) dan puncak ketundukan dan ketaatan kepada yang disembah diibadahi dan dicintai.

Haram namun tidak sampai syirik besar (atau setingkatnya)

Cinta yang haram ini merusak kesempurnaan iman/ tauhid yang wajib sehingga berdosa. Namun tidak sampai derajat kafir karena tidak menghancurkan dasar tauhid dan iman seseorang. Patokan cinta yang haram adalah mencintai selain Allah yang tidak sampai tingkatan syirik besar (atau setingkatnya) namun berakibat meninggalkan kewajiban atau melakukan keharaman baik karena asal cintanya itu diharamkan atau asal cintanya itu mubah namun menjerumuskan ke dalam dosa.

Jenis ketiga: cinta yang diperbolehkan ditujukan kepada makhluk

Terdapat beberapa contoh cinta yang diperbolehkan ditujukan kepada makhluk misalnya:

Pertama cinta tabiat atau naluri seperti suka makanan dan minuman pakaian tempat tinggal dan semacamnya.

Kedua cinta karena kasih sayang atau didasari rasa hormat seperti cinta kepada orangtua guru anak dan semacamnya

Ketiga cinta kepada hobi kegemaran atau kesukaan yang halal. Contohnya cinta kepada pekerjaan bisnis hobi dan semacamnya.

Cinta yang diperbolehkan ini bisa berubah menjadi haram jika mengakibatkan seseorang meninggalkan kewajiban atau melakukan keharaman.

Terlebih ungkapnya saat momentum tahun baru Hijriah 1444 yang jatuh hari ini Sabtu (30/7).

""Dalam peringatan tahun Baru Hijriah saatnya kita perkuat semangat cinta Islam dan cinta Indonesia. Hal ini penting sebab bangsa Indonesia merupakan bangsa yang menganut Ketuhanan yang Maha Esa sebagai dasar bernegara dan falsafah hidup"" kata Cak Imin dalam keterangan tertulis Sabtu (30/7/2022).

Ia mengatakan berkat kontribusi nyata terhadap kemerdekaan Indonesia ribuan ulama dan tokoh Islam telah tercatat dan diabadikan dalam sejarah. Cak Imin menganggap mereka telah memberi contoh cara mencintai Islam dan Indonesia yang sepatutnya berjalan beriringan.

""Pahlawan Nasional seperti KH. Hasyim Asy'ari KH Wahab Hasbulloh KH Wahid Hasyim KH Ahmad Dahlan Cut Nyak Dhien Teuku Umar hingga Agus Salim dan sederet ratusan nama-nama lainnya merupakan bukti nyata bahwa cinta Islam dan cinta Indonesia seiring sejalan"" tutur Cak Imin.

Keponakan Gus Dur ini menyatakan Islam dan Indonesia merupakan entitas yang tidak bisa dipisahkan. Hal ini disebabkan karena Indonesia didirikan sebagai negara yang merangkul agama-agama bukan sebagai negara agama. Oleh sebab itu sistem khilafah dan juga sekuler sudah pasti mendapat penolakan lantaran bertentangan dengan nilai Keindonesiaan.

""Refleksi Keislaman dan Keindonesian ini penting kita suarakan karena terjadi polarisasi yang nyata yang mencoba menarik Indonesia sebagai negara khilafah atau pun negara sekuler. Polarisasi yang terjadi di masyarakat tergambar jelas dan kita temukan dalam riset dan survei banyak lembaga. Yang lebih mengkhawatirkan polarisasi juga terjadi pada Generasi Milenial dan Gen Z"" ujarnya.

Mengutip hasil survei Alvara Institute terhadap 1097 generasi milenial Indonesia di 33 Provinsi pada bulan Oktober 2018 Cak Imin menemukan tiga komposisi tipologi milenial Indonesia yang berkaitan dengan hubungan agama dan negara. Adapun tiga tipologi tersebut di antaranya Nationalist-Religious Oriented sebesar 409% Nationalist Oriented sebesar 358% dan Religious Oriented sebesar 233%.

Menurutnya sebanyak 23% generasi milenial yang percaya sistem khilafah dan berusaha menerapkannya di Indonesia dapat dibuktikan melalui temuan itu. Begitu juga sebaliknya ada 35% Generasi milenial dan Gen-Z yang berusaha memisahkan nilai-nilai religius dalam sistem pemerintahan Indonesia.

""Kita harus bergandengan tangan dan semakin menguatkan kaum muda generasi milenial dan Gen Z di sekitar kita agar berorientasi moderat Nasionalis-Religius dalam membangun Indonesia. Dan momentum tahun baru Hijriah tepat untuk meningkatkan kecintaan kita terhadap nilai-nilai Islam sekaligus nasionalisme terutama di kalangan milenial dan Gen-Z karena mereka adalah masa depan bangsa Indonesia"" pungkas Cak Imin.

Swimmers were ordered out of the water at Ladies Miacomet and Cisco beaches on Nantucket for two hours after a shark was spotted the island's harbormaster said.

The Sharktivity app which tracks the fish didn't immediately note a sighting in the area but it did show a shark sighting around the same time about 75 yards off the shore of Nauset Beach.

And a buoy south of Nauset Beach off Chatham's North Beach Island detected nine separate white sharks in the area Saturday alone. It uses technology to note when sharks that have been previously tagged swim nearby -- Saturday's visitors includes sharks called Dylan Fruit Loops Warren Squidward according to the Sharktivity app.

This month also saw the first Apple iOS update in eight weeks fixing dozens of security flaws in iPhones and iPads.

Security vulnerabilities continue to hit enterprise products too with July patches issued for SAP Cisco and Oracle software. Here’s what you need to know about the vulnerabilities fixed in July.

Apple iOS 15.6

Apple has released iOS and iPadOS 15.6 to fix 39 security flaws including an issue in Apple File System (APFS) tracked as CVE-2022-32832. If exploited the vulnerability could allow an app to execute code with kernel privileges according to Apple’s support page giving it deep access to your device.

Other iOS 15.6 patches fix vulnerabilities in the kernel and WebKit browser engine as well as flaws in IOMobileFrameBuffer Audio iCloud Photo Library ImageIO Apple Neural Engine and GPU Drivers.

Apple isn’t aware of any of the patched flaws being used in attacks but some of the vulnerabilities are pretty serious—especially those affecting the kernel at the heart of the operating system. It’s also possible for vulnerabilities to be chained together in attacks so make sure you update as soon as possible.

The iOS 15.6 patches were released alongside watchOS 8.7 tvOS 15.6 macOS Monterey 12.5 macOS Big Sur 11.6.8 and macOS Catalina 10.15.7 2022-005.

Google Chrome

Google released an emergency patch for its Chrome browser in July fixing four issues including a zero-day flaw that has already been exploited. Tracked as CVE-2022-2294 and reported by Avast Threat Intelligence researchers the memory corruption vulnerability in WebRTC was abused to achieve shellcode execution in Chrome’s renderer process.

The flaw was used in targeted attacks against Avast users in the Middle East including journalists in Lebanon to deliver spyware called DevilsTongue.

Based on the malware and tactics used to carry out the attack Avast attributes the use of the Chrome zero-day to Candiru an Israel-based company that sells spyware to governments.

Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday

Microsoft’s July Patch Tuesday is a big one fixing 84 security issues including a flaw already being used in real-world attacks. The vulnerability CVE-2022-22047 is a local privilege escalation flaw in the Windows Client/Server Runtime Subsystem (CSRSS) server and client Windows platforms including the latest Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 releases. An attacker able to successfully exploit the vulnerability could gain System privileges according to Microsoft.

Of the 84 issues patched in Microsoft’s July Patch Tuesday 52 were privilege escalation flaws four were security feature bypass vulnerabilities and 12 were remote code execution issues.

Microsoft security patches do sometimes cause other issues and the July update was no different: Following the release some users found MS Access runtime applications did not open. Thankfully the firm is rolling out a fix.

Android July Security Bulletin

Google has released July updates for its Android operating system including a fix for a critical security vulnerability in the System component that could lead to remote code execution with no additional privileges needed.

Google also fixed serious issues in the kernel–which could result in information disclosure—and the framework which could lead to local privilege escalation. Meanwhile vendor-specific patches from MediaTek Qualcomm and Unisoc are available if your device is using those chips. Samsung devices are starting to receive the July patch and Google also released updates for its Pixel range.

SAP

Software maker SAP has issued 27 new and updated security notes as part of its July Security Patch Day fixing multiple high-severity vulnerabilities. Tracked as CVE-2022-35228 the most serious issue is an information disclosure flaw in the central management console of the vendor’s Business Objects platform.

The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain token information over the network according to security firm Onapsis. “Fortunately an attack like this would require a legitimate user to access the application” the firm adds. However it’s still important to patch as soon as possible.

Oracle

Oracle has issued 349 patches in its July 2022 Critical Patch Update including fixes for 230 flaws that can be exploited remotely.

Oracle’s April Patch Update included 520 security fixes some of which addressed CVE-2022-22965 aka Spring4Shell a remote code execution flaw in the spring framework. Oracle’s July update continues to address this issue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub2xhLmNvbS9tdWx0aW1lZGlhL3Bob3Rvcy9waG90b3MtZ3JhbmQtaXNsZS1yZXNpZGVudHMtcmVmbGVjdC0xMS1tb250aHMtYWZ0ZXItaHVycmljYW5lLWlkYS1yaXBwZWQtdGhyb3VnaC10aGUtYmFycmllci1pc2xhbmQvY29sbGVjdGlvbl84MTY2MWQyNi0xMDNhLTExZWQtYTBkNi0wMzQ0NzRkNzlhMDQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Grand Isle residents reflect 11 months after Hurricane Ida ripped through the barrier island,"When Dee Cheramie reflects on Grand Isle’s plight in the 11 months since Hurricane Ida crashed ashore her eyes almost immediately well with tears.

With the UK economy looking worse by the day traders are less confident that the Bank of England will deliver the biggest rate hike since 1995.Just a few weeks ago a 50 basis-point increase seemed like a sure thing and money markets were signalling 100% certainty in a more aggressive approach to tackle inflation. But now the picture is cloudier. The probability has dropped to 70% and more strategists are saying 25 basis points would be a better choice.It's all because inflation is eating into household incomes and skyrocketing energy costs are set to push more people into poverty. The International Monetary Fund has warned that Britain will have the slowest growth among major industrialised nations next year. In the view of a former BOE official the UK is probably already in recession.""The choice for the BOE is to join the viral trend for upsizing or keep it boring and act with caution into growth headwinds"" said Jamie Searle  strategist at Citigroup Inc. Investors expecting a larger rate hike point to the BOE's pledge in June to ""act forcefully"" if it saw persistent inflation. And the data has certainly backed that up with UK consumer prices rising at the fastest pace in 40 years.

INNOVATION

Moving the Needle

The inventor of a single-use syringe turns his attention to prefilled injection devices.

In the 1980s Marc Koska invented a single-use syringe called the K1 that breaks if anyone attempts to refill and reuse it. Adoption was slow but since it was introduced Koska’s syringe and others like it have saved millions of lives by preventing the spread HIV hepatitis and other pathogens.

Today the British inventor (now co-founder of a Connecticut-based company called ApiJect) is promoting a different type of injection device — a prefilled single-use plastic injector that delivers a vaccine or medication to a patient with a squeeze.

ApiJect’s injectors are manufactured using what’s known as a blow-fill-seal method. Molten plastic resin is poured into a mold filled with liquid medication and sealed in one continuous process.

As it awaits FDA approval ApiJect has opened a 16000-sq.-ft. technology development center in Oakland on the outskirts of Orlando where it will collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotech companies and be able to tap into engineering talent at the University of Central Florida.

Jay Walker a co-founder and CEO of ApiJect says production of the injectors can be scaled up quickly in the event of a pandemic or other emergency. “All you need is pharma graded plastic resin a needle hub and you’re ready to go” says Walker who is best known as a co-founder of Priceline. He says ApiJect will double its Florida footprint by the end of the year.

(Cheryl Pursell)

The Philadelphia Phillies completed a minor trade Saturday afternoon and did so with one of the teams they are competing for a National League Wild Card spot with.

Ken Rosenthal and Katie Woo of The Athletic were the first to report that the Phillies have acquired infielder Edmundo Sosa from the St. Louis Cardinals. The team has since confirmed the trade announcing that left-handed reliever JoJo Romero will head to St. Louis in the deal.

Sosa has slashed .245/.318/.350 with a .668 OPS in 177 games spanning parts of four seasons with the Cardinals. The 26-year-old is an excellent defender as he has 13 career defensive runs saved and seven outs above average at shortstop with some experience at second base and third base as well. As a team the Phillies are 27th in the league with -26 defensive runs saved and -19 outs above average.

Romero — who recently returned from Tommy John surgery — had a 7.89 ERA in 25 career major league appearances. He had been pitching for the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs after allowing three runs in his first two relief appearances with the Phillies in 2022.

It’s definitely an interesting time for the Phillies and Cardinals to complete a trade given that they are both 53-47 and tied for the final Wild Card spot in the senior circuit. The Phillies do own the tiebreaker over the Cardinals given that they won the season series over the Red Birds 4-3.

Competing against some of the most promoted rival brands around the world Double Cola has evolved and survived to celebrate its 100th anniversary this year.

Although a host of drinks have fizzled out against the marketing and distribution power of Coke and Pepsi Charles D. Little and Joe S. Foster created a product in Chattanooga that has stood the test of time.

Sherman Retires￼,"John Sherman president and CEO of Coca-Cola Bottling Company United Inc. (UNITED) since 2016 retired today after more than 32 years with the Birmingham-based bottler and more than four decades with the Coca-Cola System. He will continue to serve on the company’s board of directors as Vice Chairman. Mike Suco who was previously announced as Sherman’s successor will become president and CEO on August 1.

Sherman began his career with Coca-Cola in 1979 while still enrolled at Georgia Tech as a part-time clerk in the accounting department of Atlanta Coca-Cola Bottling Company which was then a part of Coca‑Cola Enterprises (CCE) Inc. In 1990 Sherman joined Coca-Cola UNITED as director of marketing for the East Region based in Augusta Georgia and assumed several leadership positions during the next three decades including Central Region President based in Birmingham.

Under Sherman’s leadership Coca-Cola UNITED completed a multi-year expansion that more than tripled the size of the company.

“John’s leadership and impact on Coca-Cola UNITED for more than three decades cannot be overstated” said Claude Nielsen chairman of Coca-Cola UNITED’s board of directors. “The fact that we were able to triple in size integrate thousands of associates and customers into our business yet still maintain our strong corporate culture where associates are first where excellent service is the basis of our customer relationships and where family is foundational speaks volumes about how he operates and leads.”

“John is a highly regarded and extraordinarily accomplished leader in our industry. Known for his unflagging professionalism commitment to excellence and his passion for our associates and our customers has been instrumental in driving UNITED’s growth. His legacy will live on through the many lives he has touched and inspired along his four decades with the Coca-Cola System.”

Today Coca-Cola UNITED has more than 50 distribution and production facilities throughout the southeast in Alabama Florida Georgia Louisiana Mississippi and Tennessee and employs more than 10000 associates. One of those distribution facilities the South Metro Sales Center is located in South Fulton County.

Coca-Cola UNITED celebrated the grand opening of the facility on Mason Road in February 2020. Former Mayor William “Bill” Edwards Councilmember Helen Willis Sen. Donzella James and Rep. Derrick Jackson were among the elected officials that attended the event. The 456000 square foot facility serves more than 10000 customers through the Atlanta metro area.

The business added a billion incremental transactions in the quarter with its distribution touching 4 million outlets. This growth has come at a time when the country is battling inflation and consumption has dipped. The beverage maker’s strategy says Sanket Ray president (India and Southwest Asia) The Coca-Cola Company has been to play the volume game. “We have managed to hold on to the affordable packs but we have taken price increases in the bigger packs. Almost 80% of our growth has come from volume and 20% from pricing unlike other FMCG companies for which it has been the other way round.”

Ray doesn’t rule out more price increases. “We will cover it through our bridge packs which we are bringing in temporarily so that we don’t lose penetration. Instead of a large two-litre PET which we sell for ₹100 we are giving consumers a pack of six 200 ml bottles at ₹20 which he/she can take home. The consumer will drink less but more frequently and for me it’s a price increase as I am giving six bottles for ₹20 each so it is ₹120 as opposed to a two-litre bottle which is ₹100. That’s how we manage inflation without tinkering with margins” he further explains.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kbmFpbmRpYS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvcmVwb3J0LWZvci1maXJzdC10aW1lLWluLTYwLXllYXJzLXNwcml0ZS1jaGFuZ2VzLWNvbG91ci1vZi1pY29uaWMtZ3JlZW4tYm90dGxlLXdoeS1zaW5nbGUtdXNlLXBsYXN0aWMtY29jby1jb2xhLWNvLTI5NzI2MjfSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZG5haW5kaWEuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3JlcG9ydC1mb3ItZmlyc3QtdGltZS1pbi02MC15ZWFycy1zcHJpdGUtY2hhbmdlcy1jb2xvdXItb2YtaWNvbmljLWdyZWVuLWJvdHRsZS13aHktc2luZ2xlLXVzZS1wbGFzdGljLWNvY28tY29sYS1jby0yOTcyNjI3L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For first time in 60 years Sprite changes colour of iconic green bottle here's why,"For first time in 60 years Sprite changes colour of iconic green bottle here's why

Just like at the round prior in France Aston Martin found themselves with one driver inside the points at the Hungarian GP and the other running just outside of the top 10.

With a few laps to go Stroll conceded P10 and the final points-paying position to Vettel and at the time it was not clear why Aston Martin had made that call.

Vettel explained then that he was judged to have had the best opportunity to take P9 from Ocon and with another corner would have done so.

Ultimately though he ran out of track and finished P10 scoring a point for himself and Aston Martin.

A point in the bag and plenty of positives from today’s race. Let’s keep building that momentum. 👊#F1 #HungarianGP pic.twitter.com/OGh4QuFboV — Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team (@AstonMartinF1) July 31 2022

“We had to fight hard for a point today and we came close to a second point when I was chasing down Esteban in the final laps” said Vettel as per an Aston Martin statement.

“The team switched cars because I had a better opportunity to catch Esteban but obviously the Virtual Safety Car hurt us and we ran out of time. I was very close on the final lap but I needed just one more corner to make a move.

“It was a fun race with lots of fights and overtakes. The middle stint was a bit difficult but the balance was better for the third stint on the mediums.”

With Vettel having started P18 and Stroll P14 it represented another strong Sunday for Aston Martin to follow an underwhelming qualifying display.

So as Formula 1 heads into its summer break Vettel says it is the qualifying performances which Aston Martin still need to work on.

“The race pace was competitive once again so improving our Saturday performance needs to be a focus for the second half of the year” Vettel concluded.

Stroll’s afternoon was certainly not helped by contact with Daniel Ricciardo the McLaren driver sending Stroll into a spin at Turn 2.

Ricciardo picked up a five-second penalty having been deemed responsible.

Stroll accepts that Ricciardo simply lacked grip on the hard tyre Ricciardo having likened it to driving “on ice” while Stroll explained that the soft tyre turned out to be the wrong one to run in the final stint.

“I think I drove a strong race today” he said. “Into the final stint Sebastian was on the medium and I was on the soft – I didn’t have another medium left and he could make that tyre last a little bit longer.

“The soft was the wrong tyre in the circumstances sadly but these things happen in racing. I had fun racing into the top 10. When I came up to pass Daniel I gave him room on the inside at Turn 2 but I think he was struggling for grip on the hard tyre and went a bit too deep. That’s how it goes sometimes.

“We seem to have better pace on Sundays than we do on Saturdays so we need to look at that. But there are plenty of positives to take away from today.”"

Most of the products on the drug store shelf are behind lock and key even everyday items such as deodorant toothpaste candy dish detergent soap and aluminum foil. Manufacturers that supply lock cases and devices to chain stores have seen their businesses boom.

Walgreens and Rite Aid have said that the problem of organized retail crime -- rings of criminals that steal products from stores and then often resell them on online marketplaces -- is causing them to lock more products up and close some stores.

Locking up their shelves is a last resort for stores but it has never been more widely practiced. It's also become a growing irritation for shoppers and a source of frustration for some employees who must walk around the store with keys at the ready.

""It's extremely discouraging to customers"" said Paco Underhill the founder and CEO of behavioral research and consulting firm Envirosell. ""It is a brutal experience for the merchant too.""

The reason why stores resort to locking up these products is simple: to prevent shoplifting. But these decisions are far more nuanced and fraught for stores than you may think. Companies must walk a delicate line between protecting their inventory and creating stores that customers don't dread visiting.

Shoplifting in America

Until the early 20th century locking up products was the norm. When customers visited a store clerks would provide them with the items they wanted from behind a counter.

This changed as the first self-service stores like Piggly Wiggly in the early 20th century discovered they could sell more goods and reduce their costs by spreading out merchandise on an open sales floor.

While having fewer workers in the store increased profits for chains in recent decades it has left stores in some cases without as many visible personnel to deter shoplifting crime prevention experts say.

Shoplifting has been around for centuries but it ""came of age in America in 1965"" author Rachel Shteir writes in ""The Steal: A Cultural History of Shoplifting."" The FBI in 1965 reported that it had jumped 93% in the prior five years and ""was the nation's fastest-growing form of larceny.""

Three years later officials around the country said there had been an additional surge in young teenagers shoplifting. The trend became part of the counterculture as exemplified by Abbie Hoffman's 1971 ""Steal This Book.""

In response an anti-shoplifting industry and corporate ""loss prevention"" (LP) and ""asset protection"" (AP) teams sprang up. Technologies also emerged such as closed-circuit TV cameras electronic article surveillance and anti-theft tags.

'Hot products'

Stores look to protect ""the vital few"" products that are most profitable for them to sell said Adrian Beck who studies retail losses at the University of Leicester. And they're willing to accept higher theft on the lower-margin ""trivial many"" he added.

Shoplifters target smaller items with higher price tags often called ""hot products"" which typically are what retailers most frequently lock up. One criminologist created an apt acronym CRAVED to predict the stuff at highest risk: ""concealable removable available valuable enjoyable and disposable.""

The most commonly stolen items at US stores include cigarettes health and beauty products over-the-counter medications contraceptives liquor teeth-whitening strips and other products.

Drug stores have a higher proportion of the items that are ""hot products"" so they have more stuff under lock and key than other retail formats Beck said.

Organized retail crime

There is only so much that can be done to to stop shoplifting. Companies prohibit retail staff from physically trying to stop a shoplifter for their own safety and must find other ways to protect the merchandise.

These include measures such as security tags on items that set off alarms when someone walks out without paying. But this is less valuable than it used to be because alarms have become part of the general cacophony of store noise and often go ignored.

Stores also use strategies such as shelves that allow a customer to take only one item at a time. This helps prevent shoppers emptying an entire shelf of products.

Locking up a product is the final step a retailer will take before removing it altogether and stores say they are resorting to this measure more frequently as theft continues to increase.

There is no national database on shoplifting which often goes under-reported and stores and prosecutors rarely press charges.

Retailers say organized retail crime has made their theft problems only worse. Crime gangs often look to steal products from stores that can easily and quickly be resold on online marketplaces such as Amazon and through other illicit markets.

""More products today are locked up because the problem has gotten so much bigger"" said Lisa LaBruno the senior executive vice president of retail operations at the Retail Industry Leaders Association. ""Criminal actors can steal high volumes of products and sell them with anonymity.""

Retailers have supported a bipartisan bill that would require online marketplaces to verify state-issued IDs for millions of high-volume third-party sellers. President Joe Biden supports such a measure and this week also called on Congress to impose liability on online marketplaces that sell stolen goods on their platforms.

Amazon said it does not allow third-party sellers to list stolen goods and works closely with law enforcement retailers and other partners to stop bad actors.

""We regularly request invoices purchase orders or other proofs of sourcing when we have concerns about how a seller may have obtained particular products"" a spokesperson said.

Irritated customers and lost sales

Unfortunately many of these time-consuming anti-theft measures wind up irritating customers and cut into sales. One anti-theft device company's CEO told Forbes that locked up stuff can result in sales reductions of 15% to 25%.

Shoppers today are more impatient. Some will walk out and buy the product on Amazon instead of hanging around for a worker.

""You're trying to be as frictionless for the customer but still prevent the loss"" said Mark Stinde a former vice president of asset protection for Kroger and other large retailers. ""You get a lot of pushback from operations and merchandising teams for locking stuff up.""

Stores are working on new ways to lock up products while reducing customer frustration such as a new type of case that any employee can open with a smartphone. Other cases require shoppers to enter their phone number to open or scan a QR code.

""Consumers understand why you have to lock up a fur coat or jewelry. But they say 'why are we locking up deodorant?'"" said Jack Trlica co-founder of trade publication LP Magazine.

Trlica expects companies will develop new technologies that protect products but don't require flagging down an employee to unlock a shelf.

""There's going to be an evolution of security products"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vcG9ldHNhbmRxdWFudHMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMzAvZ2FydG5lcnMtdG9wLTI1LXJhbmtpbmctdGhlLWJlc3Qtc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLXNjaG9vbHMtY29tcGFuaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gartner's Top 25: Ranking The Best Supply Chain Schools & Companies,"The last time research and consulting firm Gartner completed its biennial rankings in supply chain management the world was grappling with the biggest disruptions to getting products to consumers in a generation. Think about the Great Toilet Paper Shortage of 2020.

Two years on we’re still facing pandemic-related shortages (looked at buying a new car lately?). Now we’ve also got the Russian war against Ukraine wreaking havoc on everything from gasoline to food supplies.

The timing of Gartner’s 2024 Top 25 rankings for both universities and supply chain companies couldn’t be more prescient.

“Certainly it’s been a transformational two years for the education sector but also for the companies that we work with” says Caroline Chumakov senior principal analyst at Gartner a research and advisory firm for industry executives.

PREPARING FOR ‘THE GREAT REORGANIZATION’

Gartner’s supply chain Top 25 series releases rankings for both undergraduate and graduate supply chain management programs at universities as well as a ranking of the top companies in the global supply chain. A major trend Gartner is watching is the “great reorganization.”

“Deloitte estimates that the supply chain talent shortage will leave 2.4 million positions unfilled between 2018 and 2028. So orders aren’t shipping trucks aren’t driving lines aren’t running. We see this period of really unprecedented movement and churn in the supply chain workforce that we’ve never really seen before” Chumakov says in a Gartner webinar for industry executives and school administrators.

On top of that baby boomers are retiring and there aren’t enough Gen Z workers to replace them. “So these pressures are essentially providing an opportunity for many companies to take stock of their current approach to university engagement and to do a kind of reset.” (See the list of the Top 25 Companies on page 2).

TRENDS IN SUPPLY CHAIN EDUCATION

In the webinar Dana Stiffler distinguished VP analyst points to three emerging trends in undergraduate and graduate supply chain programs: First Diversity of students and faculty ticked up at both undergrad and graduate programs but particularly at the undergraduate level. Women account for 40% of supply chain undergrads compared to 39% in 2020. “Some programs in fact have a have majority female participation which is really interesting considering the history of our programs” Stiffler says.

Diversity among faculty however is still lagging with only 26% of women up 2% from two years earlier. In terms of ethnicity more than half of schools score at least some points in the ranking for student diversity and 44% for faculty diversity both increases over the previous ranking.

Starting salaries for students in supply chain roles also increased. In terms of compensation U.S. undergraduates finding their first jobs in supply chain roles are earning about $1600 more per year than in 2020. While the average starting salary is $61769 graduates from the top 10 programs can expect around $65000. The highest salary from the ranked schools was $80000.

Finally in terms of curriculum schools are incorporating more environmental social corporate governance and ethics lessons into their supply chain syllabi.

“This makes perfect sense if we look at our overall global supply chain trends” Stiffler says. “A big reason for companies to reorganize their global supply chain networks is resilience in the current environment and cost and sustainability are very close together. So that is right in line with what global supply organizations” are reporting.

TOP 25 GRADUATE PROGRAMS

Gartner’s biennial pair of school rankings are intended to support chief supply chain officers heads of supply chain strategy and supply chain HR partners in their quest to identify the B-school programs from which they can recruit the best talent. A major change for this year’s school ranking was the inclusion of 100% online programs. Traditionally Gartner only covered on-campus and hybrid programs but the rapid change of delivery following the pandemic caused them to react to those changes.

This year University of Tennessee a longtime participant in Gartner’s ranking claimed the top spot for the very first time.

“They are big their graduates get paid and they improved on the curriculum score this year” Stiffler says. The school also has a great alumni network working with faculty and the university board to extend the supply chain community.

The University of Arkansas improved more than any other school since 2020 jumping 19 spots to No. 2 in 2022.

“The reason for their very steep trajectory is their improvements across the board – in their curriculum; in diversity equity and inclusion and especially in their strong growth.”

Other schools with the biggest gains include University of South Carolina (No. 6 in 2022) which jumped 16 spots University of Southern California (No. 10) jumping 13 spots and Rutgers University (No. 5) gaining 12.

The graduate supply chain program list saw six new or re-entrants in 2022. These include University of Houston (No. 11) University of Wisconsin (No. 13) Auburn University (No. 14) HEC Montreal/University of Montreal (No. 16) Indiana University (No. 20) and Syracuse University (No. 25).

Arizona State University (No. 23) dropped the farthest losing 16 points. Others with big drops include Purdue University (No. 24) falling 12 spots and North Carolina State University (No. 21) falling 11.

The $30M bond proposal to be paid back through an up to 25-year property tax of an average of 1.12 mills has been a hot topic in the city in recent weeks as an opposition campaign filled voters' mailboxes and local airwaves.

If the bond proposal passes on Tuesday Holland Board of Public Works will lay fiber-optic cable throughout the city building infrastructure capable of bandwidth up to 10 Gigabits per second though HBPW expects to initially offer 1 Gbps (1000 megabits per second).

As an open-access network private internet service providers will be able to use the city-owned fiber to deliver services to Holland's 16137 potential customers.

The pitch is that with the infrastructure already built by the community internet service providers will have a lower barrier to enter the Holland market and will be able to offer cheaper prices than if they had to lay their own fiber in addition to having to compete with one another to offer the lowest price for residents.

Utopia Fiber often touted as an example of open-access networks promoting consumer choice has 16 internet service providers offering services on its network today. The Utopia Fiber network serves a collective of nearly 20 cities in Utah.

""This allows us to build the city's digital streets if you will as a community to make sure that it is available as a universal service"" said Pete Hoffswell fiber superintendent for HBPW. ""During the broadband task force when we reached out to the community one of the principles we learned from that conversation was that it needs to be available to everyone in the community. It needs to be a ubiquitous service that anyone can get.""

Hoffswell said partner internet service providers who lease HBPW's existing fiber already to deliver internet to businesses have expressed interest in providing services to the rest of the city if the project is approved.

HBPW is also proposing offering its own internet service option over the open-access network as it already does in a limited area of downtown Holland for about 200 customers.

The utility's financial modeling projected a monthly internet bill of $42-45 for 1 Gbps service through HBPW.

That price includes the ""hook-up"" fee to connect a home or business to the common fiber infrastructure. The cost of the hook up is expected to be about $800 but HBPW has presented a plan to Holland City Council under which that cost could be billed in installments of $7 per month over 10 years.

Comcast Corporation (Xfinity Internet) which offers a competitive 1.2-Gigabit internet package to some areas in Holland has spent $110193.12 on mailers radio ads polling and consulting according to campaign finance filings for the ballot question committee Protect Holland Taxpayers.

The other donors to the group are the Michigan Cable Telecommunications Association and Leon Drolet a former Republican state representative and tea party activist who resides in Macomb.

Critics of Holland's fiber proposal point to other cities that have built their own fiber networks and struggled to hit the subscriber numbers needed to pay off the debt incurred to build the network.

""Local governments claim that private businesses are not providing adequate internet access and that they can do better"" wrote Park Township resident and economist Ted Bolema in The Sentinel. ""They make projections about how cheap the service will be and how many people will want to sign on. And then the actual results don’t come close to the rosy predictions.""

More:My Take: Setting the record straight on fiber internet

Holland Board of Public Works representatives said the financial model the city has proposed to the taxpayers — using a millage to pay off the debt incurred for the capital investment — means the project is not reliant on reaching a certain number of subscribers to create enough revenue to pay off its debt.

""We don't know exactly what our revenues will be so it would be risky to borrow money against our future revenues when you're not exactly sure how many people might sign up. That's not a risk the BPW was willing to take without a community commitment and that is what a millage is it's a commitment by the community"" Hoffswell said. ""Our project is not so reliant on future revenue because of that which reduces our financial risk as a community. We as a public utility run our utilities in a very conservative way. We want to make sure that we're doing the right things and that they will be successful and sustainable.""

HBPW's financial models for cost of HBPW-provided internet service are based on a 51 percent ""take rate"" or 51 percent signing up for the service.

The Holland Fiber ""Yes"" Committee has raised $1500 in donations from Holland residents and has spent about $3000 on yard signs according to the group's filings with the Ottawa County Clerk's Office.

""We're fortunate to have internet access but that doesn't mean we should settle"" said Dan Morrison an advocate for the fiber proposal who runs the pro-fiber website hollandfiber.org. ""Since the dial-up days Holland hasn't been a priority for internet providers. By doing this ourselves we can leapfrog most of the country with better cheaper local service.

""COVID showed us that internet access is not a luxury but a necessity. Work school and healthcare are all happening over the internet. The internet is a utility like electricity or water. BPW gives us great reliability and pricing for electricity. They can do the same for the newest utility. They already do downtown and we want everyone else to experience it.""

Another critic of the plan Thomas Volkema said it's an unnecessary tax on residents for speeds average users don't need.

""Most complaints about 'slow' internet are due to your own aging personal equipment"" Volkema said. ""Unless you have 5 or 6 kids all playing high-speed video games at the same time few residential users ever need 1 Gig speed.""

The millage quoted at 1.5 mills to start but expected to average 1.12 mills over the life of the debt service for the bond will cost a taxpayer with a home value of $200000 which is approximately $100000 in taxable value $112 per year.

The Texas Rangers won three out of four from the Los Angeles Angels and wrapped up a 5-6 road trip. Here are three takeaways from the series.

Ezequiel Duran’s Clutch Gene

The Rangers already have a clutch power hitter in Adolis García. It’s starting to appear that rookie infielder Ezequiel Duran is becoming a bit of a clutch contact hitter.

Back in June Duran tripled in a night game against Detroit and drove in the winning runs late in the game at Comerica Park. He had a sense of the moment.

He showed that again on Sunday. In the top of the ninth against the Los Angeles Angels Duran came up with the bases loaded and took a pitch from Raisel Iglesias and went opposite field with it. The ball landed in the right-center field gap took a high carom off the fence and he had a stand-up double as three runs scored to clinch the Rangers’ 5-2 win.

After the game Rangers manager Chris Woodward told Bally Sports Southwest that Duran talked about the type of pitch he was looking for and what he was going to do with it if he got that pitch. Turns out that was the pitch and that was what he wanted to do — go opposite field.

“I think he’s blessed with that trait” Woodward said. “No matter what happens to him he still believes he’s the best player on the planet.”

Duran needed the short memory. He came up empty-handed in three previous plate appearances.

With two months left in the season what seems clear is that Duran isn’t going anywhere. The Rangers look committed to finding him playing time as often as possible. With Corey Seager hurt the past three games he played in the middle infield which is more of his natural position. But he’s playing well at third and at some point I expect the Rangers to test-drive him in the outfield. That’s something he did in his short stint at Round Rock.

Duran is building his case for 2023. What he does the next two months will determine what the Rangers want to do with him next season and beyond.

Nathaniel Lowe’s Impressive Road Trip

Nathaniel Lowe wrapped up the Rangers’ 11-game road trip with a 1-for-4 performance with an RBI giving him hits in 10 of the 11 games of the road trip. By going 14-for-45 he hit .311 for the trip and kept his average above .270 for the season.

The power is there too. He didn’t hit a home run on Sunday but he’s hit 12 of his 15 home runs since June 1 and had seven home runs in June which was a career high. So if you can do the simple math he had five home runs in July.

Lowe was the Rangers Player of the Month in April but his play dipped in May. He has slowly but surely put together an impressive stretch in his last 62 games as his .275 batting average is well above what it was at the start of that stretch — .236.

Lowe’s long-term future in Texas is a bit hazy. The Rangers have plenty of potential more controllable options on the farm (Dustin Harris is basically screaming at the Rangers from Double-A Frisco to find him a spot and he can play first base). But the Rangers don’t have to be hasty. Lowe is under team control in 2023 has three arbitration years and can’t hit free agency until 2027.

For this year Lowe is the team’s best option at first base. And each game he make a strong case for the future too.

Jon Gray Is This Good Right Now

Jon Gray will start Monday’s game against Baltimore the first game of August. The Rangers stand a good chance of winning simply by Gray taking the mound.

In his last three games Gray is 2-1 1.86 (4 earned runs in 19 1/3 innings pitched) six walks 22 strikeouts and a .149 opponent batting average.

But the truth is this has been going longer than three starts. In Gray’s last nine starts since June 12 among American League starters in that span he is tied for second in wins (six) fourth in ERA (2.25) fourth in innings pitched (56) sixth in strikeouts per nine innings (10.6) and sixth in opponent batting average (.206).

After a slow start Gray is having shall we say a Martín Pérez-esque type of June and July.

Between emerging as a favorite in the Juan Soto discussion and needing to upgrade the rotation for a playoff push Cardinals General Manager Mike Girsch has his work cut out for him this deadline.

While the price for Skubal would likely be too high if St. Louis does pull the trigger on a Soto trade the Cardinals are going to need to add an arm one way or another.

Adding Skubal may cost more than some of the other starters available but his team control would be invaluable to a team like the Cardinals who will likely be losing Adam Wainwright in the next couple of seasons and are currently relying on guys with short track records of success or injury histories that make it hard to bet on them from year-to-year.

Another advantage of trading with Detroit is the possibility of acquiring multiple players. The Tigers have multiple quality bullpen arms that would be solid additions to the Cardinals top-heavy bullpen.

After Ryan Helsley Giovanny Gallegos and Genesis Cabrera the Redbirds ‘pen could definitely use an extra arm or two to help out their shaky rotation.

The Tigers have a handful of arms that would be able to join the mix in St. Louis and help out right away. Andrew Chafin Joe Jimenez Michael Fulmer and Alex Lange all make sense as add-ons to a potential Cardinals-Skubal trade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW9ha2xhbmRwcmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8zMC96YWMtYnJvd24tYmFuZC1tYWtlcy1hLXRyaXVtcGhhbnQtY29tZWJhY2stYXQtcGluZS1rbm9iL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW9ha2xhbmRwcmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8zMC96YWMtYnJvd24tYmFuZC1tYWtlcy1hLXRyaXVtcGhhbnQtY29tZWJhY2stYXQtcGluZS1rbm9iL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zac Brown Band makes a triumphant ‘Comeback’ at Pine Knob,"The Zac Brown Band has marked quite a bit of special time in the metro area from a breakout performance at the Downtown Hoedown to ushering in new years at Joe Louis Arena and headlining Comerica Park.

But the Georgia group’s show Friday night July 29 at the Pine Knob Music Theatre was quite possibly its best yet.

Returning to the area for the first time in four years and to the theater for the first time since 2017 Brown and company celebrated its 20th anniversary with a performance unlike any other they’ve tried over the years. The semi-conceptual show tied to the band’s 20th anniversary divided its two and a half hours (plus two 10-minute intermissions) into three “acts” each with a different look and flavor. The troupe made sure fans knew it had a new album playing six tracks from last year’s “The Comeback” but it was overall a celebration of a band that’s remained daring and vital and is as Brown told the more than 14000 fans at Pine Knob retooled and revitalized after the pandemic pause.

Brown started the night solo playing “Toes” on a front-stage set designed like the southeastern bars where the band began complete with HD televisions and fans sitting on stools and family members watching from the side. He then brought on his bandmates a couple at a time — starting with multi-instrumentalist John Driskell Hopkins and fiddler Jimmy DeMartini for the traditional pairing of “Free” and Van Morrison’s “Into the Mystic” and then adding the rest including new member Caroline Jones along with stories about how he met them and what they bring to the band. The full complement crammed into the space for renditions of “Homegrown” “Sweet Annie” “Wild Palomino” and “Same Boat” as well as a country covers medley of Alabama’s “Dixieland Delight” “Randy Travis’ “Forever and Ever Amen” and the theme song to “9 to 5.”

After the first intermission — which included a moving video in which Hopkins spoke about his battle with ALS and the ZBB’s Hop tot the Cure campaign — the group’s ranks swelled to 14 with a three-man horn section and two female backing vocalists for a funk “Keep Me in Mind” and full-scale concert flash on a tiered stage with a backdrop of trees and antlers hanging overhead. That 45 segment was highlighted by the Caribbean flavored-“Jump Right In” a furious jam with opener Robert Randolph on “GA Clay” and a set-closing pairing of “Knee Deep” with Ray LaMontagne’s “You Are the Best Thing.”

But the real best was yet to come.

The concert’s final segment found the ZBB in new more formal(ish) outfits and joined by Randolph and his Family Band for a 25-minute covers medley. The high-spirited and widely ranging romp ran from K.C. & the Sunshine Band’s “That’s the Way (I Like It)” and the Commodore’s “Brick House” (sung by Randolph) to hits by Bel Biv Devoe Prince and Michael Jackson with all of the ZBB members taking a lead vocal some faring better than others but all clearly having as much fun as those in the crowd. Hopkins fronted Lionel Richie’s “All Night Long” and percussionist Daniel de los Reyes came down front for Pharrell Williams’ “Happy” while Brown himself took on Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” and traded verses with bandmates on Silk Sonic’s “Fly With Me.”

And on this night only the group threw in Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin'” as an excuse to hear everyone at Pine Knob sing the South Detroit line.

The night ended with a blend of the ZBB’s “Colder Weather” and the Eagles’ “Take it to the Limit” followed by the group’s 2008 breakthrough hit “Chicken Fried” and promises not to let another four years go by before we see the band again. And while there will certainly be more memorable ZBB moments in the future it will be hard to top what the group delivered on Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdWx0aW1hdGVjbGFzc2ljcm9jay5jb20vcHJpbmNlLWVzdGF0ZS1tYXN0ZXItdGFwZXMtcmV0dXJuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prince's Family Vows to Return His Master Tapes to Paisley Park,"Six years after his death Prince's estate has finally been legally settled.

""We are free at last thank God almighty we are free"" Sharon Nelson Prince's sister said to CBS Minnesota. ""It's been a long long grueling six years.""

Prince's estate valued at $156.4 million will be split between the musician's three eldest siblings and Primary Wave a private music publishing company which already bought out the stakes of three other heirs. ""Our goal is to work collaboratively with them to continue to build and to grow Prince's legacy as a 50% owner"" said Primary Wave's attorney Eric Magnuson (via the Star Tribune). ""We have the best interests of everyone in mind as we move forward.""

Nelson indicated that her first priority is to bring Prince's vast collection of released and unreleased music back to Paisley Park. The tapes were removed from the vault at his longtime Minnesota home and recording studio Paisley Park against the family's wishes after his death.

""What's the most important thing that you think about when you think of Prince? The music absolutely and where is it? It isn't here"" Nelson said. ""So we're going to bring it back that's what we're going to do.""

In December 2017 a judge denied the family's request to move the vault which contains original master tapes back from California where they were concerned about nearby wildfires. (It had been placed there by Comerica Bank & Trust then-executors of the estate.) The judge deemed it a ""non-issue.""

""Once we have the music they are going to get the real good sound that they should have had six years ago"" Nelson said. ""We're going to bring his original music out.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3RoZXNvdXJjZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8zMC9hZnRlci1zaXgteWVhcnMtcHJpbmNlLWVzdGF0ZS1jbG9zZXMtYW5kLWhpcy1oZWlycy1hbmQtYmVuZWZpY2lhcmllcy10YWtlLWNvbnRyb2wtb2YtaGlzLW11c2ljLWFuZC1sZWdhY3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After Six Years Prince Estate Closes and His Heirs and Beneficiaries Take Control of His Music and Legacy,"After Six Years Prince Estate Closes and His Heirs and Beneficiaries Take Control of His Music and Legacy

After Six Years Prince Estate Closes and His Heirs and Beneficiaries Take Control of His Music and Legacy

After more than six years the lengthy and often contentious court proceedings surrounding the Estate of world-renowned recording artist Prince Rogers Nelson have finally reached their conclusion.

Today following a hearing at the Carver County Courthouse in Minnesota Senior Judge Kevin Eide ordered the Prince Estate’s appointed Personal Representative Comerica Bank & Trust N.A. to commence closure of the Estate and distribute Prince’s property to the Estate’s legally-recognized beneficiaries.

Prince died in April 2016 without a will which placed his Estate into probate a complex legal process used by the court to determine how a deceased person’s Estate will be distributed. In May 2017 the court formally recognized six heirs to Prince’s Estate: Prince’s half-siblings Sharon Nelson Norrine Nelson John Nelson Alfred Jackson and Omarr Baker as well as his sister Tyka Nelson. Subsequently the Estate interests of Alfred Jackson Omarr Baker and Tyka Nelson were acquired by Primary Wave a private equity group specializing in receiving music publishing catalogs. Primary Wave currently owns a 50% interest in the Estate.

Before today’s distribution of Prince’s assets to the heirs and beneficiaries Prince’s Estate’s administration continued for more than six years following his death. Sadly during this time two of Prince’s heirs passed away. Alfred Jackson passed away on August 19 2019 and John Nelson died on September 3 2021. John Nelson’s interest in the Estate will pass to a trust created during his lifetime.

Today’s estate closing is the dawning of a new day for Prince’s legacy. Although the Estate released several reissues and compilations of Prince’s music it has proceeded at a comparably slower pace than the catalogs for musicians such as Bob Dylan and David Bowie and many opportunities beyond recorded music have remained unrealized. Going forward Prince’s music and his legacy will be managed jointly by Primary Wave and Prince Legacy LLC a company formed by Prince’s heirs and beneficiaries including Sharon Nelson Norinne Nelson and The John R. Nelson Revocable Trust as well as the heirs’ advisors L. Londell McMillan and Charles Spicer. They together own the remaining 50% of the Estate.

In a statement to The Source Mr. McMillan said “Prince was a great man. He was and still is the greatest artist and musician who ever lived in my opinion.”

He added “we look forward to managing the estate with all stakeholders to preserve Prince’s true legacy.”"

Every year the St. George Theatre hosts a FREE program for young people ages 9-18 designed to up their game when it comes to personal achievement and wellness. The showcase was attended by the students’ family and friends which was followed by an awards ceremony.

Achievement awards are given to the students and three scholarships to attend dance at Mrs. Rosemary’s Dance Studio for one full year. The winners are Mikayla Cappillo Richie Francis are Nyya Mack.

The showcase featured all the students performing the dances songs and spoken word pieces they had worked so hard on learning in the program including: “Fame” inspired by Debbie Allen “Spirit” inspired by Alvin Ailey “Break My Soul” and “Break My Sou” by Beyonce “Swan Lake” inspired by Misty Copeland “Still I Rise” by Maya Angelou and “Change Sings” by Amanda Gorman and “Respect” by Aretha Franklin.

“I had a great time in this program because everyone was very nice and I learned a lot” said student Noah Ocasio. “I enjoy singing and dancing and the other kids and the teachers are very nice. I enjoyed the entire two weeks.”

This program began in 2004 when Mrs. Rosemary and her daughters Doreen Cugno and Luanne Sorrentino invited the neighborhood teens to learn about dance and theater and it has grown to be an impactful youth program funded by the Department of Cultural Affairs and Con Edison held annually. In attendance were Amanda Straniere and Mateamarie Vento specialists for Staten Island Regional & Community Affairs.

The staff and faculty working with the students included Maya Burke Tom Cintula Anna Polyachenko Alyssa Rowan Grace Acquilano Rose Cugno Elizabeth DeLeo Kate DiScalo and Leila Polio.

“Our goal is to share our knowledge of the arts to our students all while we inspire motivate enrich and educate” said Doreen Cugno co-founder of the St. George Theatre and President & CEO of the St. George Theatre Restoration. “The 65 students learned about many techniques in dance while being introduced to theater music and so much more.

“Classes included modern ballet hip-hop music singing spoken word musical theater dance history preparation for auditions and performance.”

The theme for this year’s program was “Inspiring Icons in Music and Dance.” From Aretha Franklin to Beyoncé Alvin Ailey to Misty Copeland and more the students explored the role of influencers in music and dance for the past 50 years and were exposed to a variety of disciplined classes in dance and theater to gain confidence in the real world.

“Our goal since inception was to enrich the lives of our students and spark an interest in the arts” said Luanne Sorrentino co-founder of the St. George Theatre. “Days like today validates the importance of arts programming for our youth and we’re beyond thrilled we’ve been able to contribute in our own way through dance music spoken word and theater.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE SUMMER OUTREACH PROGRAM

The 65 students received a book bag filled with fun and enriching books about dance theater famous performers healthy lifestyles urban planting and positivity all to motivate and inspire. Fan favorite books were the life of Misty Copeland Aretha Franklin and Alvin Ailey. Students were given reading “fun-work” with the books in addition to practicing their techniques in dance and voice.

“Con Edison is proud to support the St. George Theatre and their Summer Outreach Program” said Amanda Straniere of Con Edison. “For more than ten years we have watched this workshop ignite a passion for dance poetry and the arts culminating in a wonderful showcase performance.

“What these students are able to accomplish in just two weeks is incredible. Thank you to the amazing team at the St. George Theatre and bravo to the students!”

On a special day of the program board memeber Dana Walker-Boyd spent time with the amazing summer outreach students sharing her expertise in gardening tips experiencing gardening and how it can relieve stress provide a source of community happiness and can help with healthier eating habits. In addition the participants learned how to garden in their very own space and were gifted herbs and veggie plants.

The neutron star in question is identified as PSR J0952–0607 which was first discovered in 2016 and is located in the Sextans constellation between 3200-5700 light years away from Earth.

The findings of this study were published in the peer-reviewed academic periodical The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Of neutron stars and pulsars

A neutron star is essentially one of the end fates of an extremely large star.

Stars of all kinds are fueled by energy production in their cores which sees energy made by nuclear fission fusing lighter elements to form heavier ones. It is this process that keeps the star hot allowing gases to expand while simultaneously drawing its mass toward the core in a delicate gravitational balance. This image shows a neutron star -- the core of a star that exploded in a massive supernova. This particular neutron star is known as a pulsar because it sends out rotating beams of X-rays that sweep past Earth like lighthouse beacons. (credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)

When a star specifically one between 10-25 solar masses or more can no longer produce this energy a process that takes millions or billions of years it results in the star's collapse.

This results in a supernova blasting everything outward while the intense gravity and mass of the core cause it to collapse in on itself and for ma smaller compact and super dense stellar object: A neutron star.

This is not to be confused with a white dwarf star which is very similar but is the result of the collapse of a much less-massive star.

Now despite neutron stars having once been stars they no longer generate heat since the processes of the cores no longer function. Of course they are still hot since they need to cool down which will take place over a very long period of time. However accretion and collisions can still see them grow larger.

But what makes neutron stars so fascinating is that they don't seem to be made up of normal atoms. Rather the collapse of the star seems to have caused them to be formed entirely of neutrons hence the name neutron star.

Another unique quality of neutron stars is that they still rotate. In fact they rotate incredibly quickly sometimes hundreds of times per second.

When rotating some of these neutron stars actually release beams of electromagnetic radiation which can be visible from Earth if pointed in our direction.

These neutron stars that emit these jets of radiation are known as pulsars. This is generally the best way to spot neutron stars since they otherwise don't really emit much radiation.

Overall there are thought to be several hundred million if not a billion of neutron stars in the Milky Way Galaxy alone.

How massive is a neutron star?

Each neutron star still represents just a fraction of the mass of its original star and they tend to measure just between one to three solar masses.

In addition given how compact they are neutron stars tend to not be very large. Rather they might just measure 20 kilometers wide.

To put that in perspective that's around the size of a city.

To put that even further perspective that means there is something the size of a city that has the same mass as our Sun - or up to three times the size of that.

However that limit is important. It's what astronomers have designated the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit and says that a neutron star must be between just one to three solar masses though the exact number is unclear and there are other factors to consider such as if the star is still spinning and so on. A simulated image of a black hole. (credit: Wikimedia Commons)

So what happens if it exceeds this limit? That means it will collapse and condense even further becoming even more dense. And that could mean forming a black hole. Of course that isn't the only way black holes are formed and it also isn't necessarily the only fate with some scientists hypothesizing the existence of further stars such as quark stars but that remains unclear.

But what's the most massive neutron star that we know of?

That's what the study sought to answer.

The study

The neutron star in question is the pulsar PSR J0952−0607. When it was first discovered it was already noted for how fast it spun. Current estimates say it rotates 707 times per second one of the fastest neutron stars in the galaxy.

But what makes PSR J0952−0607 notable is how massive it is - roughly 2.35 solar masses - and the fact that it actually has grown even more massive.

The reason for this is because PSR J0952−0607 is what is known as a ""black widow."" This is the term used for a neutron star that is in a binary star system with another star - and then subsequently ""eats"" it.

This isn't too unprecedented as binary neutron stars have been discovered before as have black widow binary star systems.

Indeed binary neutron stars and black widows are seen as promising sources of information on the possible growth of neutron stars.

But in order to ascertain just how much more massive PSR J0952−0607 became due to devouring its stellar companion the researchers had to make use of the sensitive Keck 1 telescope in Hawai'i.

And the data they found showed them just how massive it is.

This is important as it further supports the idea of what neutron stars are made of something that is a separate and very complicated topic on its own.

But what is also interesting is how these findings shed light on one of the mysteries surrounding pulsars: The spinning.

You spin me right round like a pulsar baby

The reason neutron stars spin originally is due to the conservation of angular momentum. However that explanation only goes so far only really explaining when they spin around once per second.

But what about the ones that spin even faster than that? What about the pulsars that spin and flash their electromagnetic radiation beams hundreds if not a thousand times per second?

The only explanation possible would seem to be that something had to come into contact with the neutron star pushing it and making it spin faster. But how is that possible? After all not every pulsar is in a binary system.

But the possible explanation is that for all of these extremely fast pulsars they were never alone - at least not at first.

The idea is that every single one of these extremely fast pulsars must have originally had a companion star with that star's evolution and growth impacting the pulsar and making it move faster. Then it ends up getting absorbed with this new material pushing it along even more until they are left all alone.

Currently PSR J0952-0607 is still a binary star technically as its companion is still there albeit very faintly now roughly just 20 times the size of Jupiter and being heated up to temperatures hotter than the Sun. And the researchers think this is exactly what is happening the black widow devouring its partner and possibly driving it to the point of complete obliteration something author Alex Filippenko of University of California Berkley dubs ""cosmic ingratitude.""

But the findings are just a small part of the effort the researchers have gone to in order to measure black widow pulsars as well as other unique cases. The goal is to find more neutron stars pushing dangerously close to the black hole limit. But if they don't find any then that could just mean they've already found the limit - after all anything more massive would just simply have turned into a black hole.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc21vcG9saXRhbi5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2czNzAxMzIyNC9iZXN0LWNyeXN0YWxzLWZvci1saWJyYXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Crystals for Libra Healing Crystals and Gemstones for Libra,"Everyone loves Libras!

Alchemy of Souls season 1 episode 13 recap

As Heo Yeom attempts to return the soul shifter they’re investigating to enough consciousness for an explanation of his situation Seo Yul finds himself disappointed by Park Jin’s revelation that they’re not attempting to bring back these monsters to life as he believes they’re no longer human once they run wild. So the genius suggests the ice stone can be used only to hear back that such power should be “forbidden to mankind.” At that point we head to Jin Mu’s secret room where he mentions that the power of the soul ejector was taken away by the skies. Remembering Bu-yeon’s abilities the assistant gwanju wonders whether she attempted to make the ice stone disappear before explaining that she could have became a great priestess with the ability to control the energy of the skies should she still be alive.

Realising that she has opened the ceiling above the constellation basin which apparently can only be accessed with the energy of a constellation recorder mage Mu-deok understands that her energy has returned due to the water. Discovering that lightning had struck where Jang Uk was based Jin Mu heads back there where we see the energy of the soul ejector in front of the young master. Additionally Mu-deok has been blinded again but the two are set to be bailed out when the yin-yang jade is used to summon the Crown Prince to the area.

Shocked at all that’s happened Jin Mu orders Eunuch Kim’s dead body to be moved discreetly also locking the exits of Cheonbugwan so that Jang Uk can be found and potentially killed. Attempting to then provoke the hiding mage into appearing he ends up receiving some goading himself just as the Songrim rookie decides to come out of hiding. Then following a back-and-forth which sees Jang Uk gain the upper-hand by revealing his yin-yang jade plan (which includes his red jade being allegedly hidden inside the robe of the dead eunuch) the Crown Prince arrives temporarily pulling the assistant gwanju away from his confrontation.

When Jin Mu grasps that he has been duped he returns to hear the Crown Prince expose his attempts at killing Jang Uk so that the secret of Eunuch Kim’s running wild could be kept. However Cheonbugwan’s leader also seems to discover that the person Naksu inherited the body of is indeed Bu-yeon so seems preoccupied even when asked to provide a good excuse for the “misunderstanding.” Meanwhile Master Lee asks for information on Cho Chung from Maidservant Kim who is happy to discuss the man’s friendship with Jang Gang as well as the daughter he had who is presumed to be dead. Then she adds that Jang had left over 20 years ago to find this person never returning after that. Here we see the teases that a member of the Cho family is still around even if Teacher Lee falsely insists on Cho Chung’s daughter being deceased.

While Master Lee becomes concerned by Mu-deok’s labelling as an evil spirit we return to Cheonbugwan where Park Jin has also arrived. In time the whole situation turns into a formal meeting with the details laid bare by Jang Uk only to be dismissed as lies by Jin Mu. At that point Songrim’s leader wants to search for the eunuch to confirm whether there is a soul shifter in the vicinity though both his and the Crown Prince’s requests (the royal wanted to check whether he was in the palace) become fruitless when the supposedly petrified monster appears unscathed alongside the Queen. A quick context-giving scene confirms that the ice stone was used for this which pleases Jang Uk when he begins to surmise that it means Naksu can be saved after she runs wild. Happy to then be deemed a liar in addition to having to take responsibility for the breaking of the constellation basin the young master pulls a stunt to ensure a safe exit from the place he was meant to die in much to the annoyance of the assistant gwanju.

Promising to send people from Songrim to fix the broken basin Park Jin leaves with Jang Uk and Mu-deok smug about their success in avoiding punishment with the help of some dramatic acting to appease the Crown Prince. We do also see the royal’s own suspicions too as he exhibits a lack of belief over the honey biscuit “excuse” as well as just how Chisu could have been used to break the basin when the young master has not reached that yet. “I wonder how this broke” he adds flaring up wonder in Jin Mu’s own mind too. Then the Crown Prince notices the assistant gwanju’s sword appearing rather doubtful about its appearance.

Outside Park Jin praises Mu-deok’s acting skills confessing that he believes Jang Uk too. With Songrim aware that Cheonbugwan must have the ice stone we cut back to the secret room which shows Eunuch Kim talking about how the body containing the soul of Naksu drained his energy how he did not see the ceiling open and that there was no other mage present. However despite his concerns that the young master is unlikely to be hiding the skill of Chisu Jin Mu’s attention turns towards the gloating Eunuch’s happiness over possessing the power of Hwansu. Frustrated by his arrogance the soul shifter is once more killed returning the ice stone to its owner.

Hearing that Park Jin wants to destroy the ice stone due to its powers in returning soul shifters to life Jang Uk is deflated but is still rather content at his punishment of staying at home for a while and avoiding Jin Mu. When Songrim’s leader departs the young master is quick to tell his maid that they need to get to the in-demand item first hearing back that the Danju must be in the palace. Meanwhile the Queen informs the assistant gwanju that Court Lady Han will take the place of the Eunuch so he should relay messages through her.

However the royal is also annoyed at the underestimation of Jang Uk pinning it as the reason Songrim will begin to suspect her. Jin Mu disagrees with this sentiment though pointing to the fact that the young master has changed and was not always like this. Then when the Queen states that it must be because of who he is associating with Cheonbugwan’s leader begins to reflect on the person that has made the once arrogant man find his way.

As Jang Uk deduces the closeness between Mu-deok and Seo Yul we see Park Jin vocalise his worry in Jin Mu wanting to hurt the young master. Here he sends out Dang-gu and Seo Yul as part of the labour team heading to Cheonbugwan so tabs can be kept on the assistant gwanju somewhat securing temporary safety. Later on the genius mage asks whether the soul shifter really did come back to life as well as how Jang Uk reacted to that. Seo Yul subsequently finds out that his friend disagreed with the destroying of the ice stone sparking a feeling of potential understanding in terms of just what he may know about Mu-deok.

Wanting to refrain from being left alone with Jang Uk in case she devours his energy Mu-deok rejects the idea of a trip even going as far as saying to kill her if needed as her consuming him to death would be “unbearable.” Touched the young master takes this as a reply to his love confession vowing to find the ice stone so that the worries his master has can disappear. Meanwhile the Crown Prince continues to weigh up the potential truths of the situation back in Cheonbugwan.

Wishing to forgo fishing so that he can diligently train Jang Uk partially opens up about his probation to Master Lee but leaves some of the details to be revealed by Park Jin. With that in mind the young master is soon convinced to take the teacher up on his offer to fish together when it turns out that he will be taught how to catch a golden fish that grows with Lake Gyeongcheondaeho’s energy and can be caught only when chisu is mastered. As we find out the following day the real reason for such an expedition is for Jang Uk to be able to learn the skill of controlling water for himself.

Following on from seeing Dang-gu’s awareness of Cheonbugwan’s constant use of blind women which turns into an explanation to Park Jin the leader of Songrim discusses the potential for hidden soul shifters with Ho-gyeong in an attempt to have Jinyowon’s relics used to find them. Yet Ho-gyeong does not care to help believing that clear evidence will have to be found first to avoid resentment. Noticing a change in attitude towards Songrim Park Jin confronts Jinyowon’s leader only to be told to leave. Concurrently Dang-gu delivers a gift to Cho-yeon allowing for the two to enjoy a sweet moment together until they realise their respective areas have fought.

In the secret room So-i is prepared for her task to become Bu-yeon physically scarred so that she can be a convincing stand-in. After that we see the original mark on Mu-deok’s arm before we see that she is being tasked with helping Maidservant Kim prepare for Naksu’s memorial service. Elsewhere Master Lee and Jang Uk eat together with the former passing on his wish for the mage to be patient with his learning. The young master then asks why Lee has helped him so much misunderstanding that it may because of his liking towards Maidservant Kim. What follows is then a rather tender back-and-forth about love which eventually gives way to a chat about the history of Naksu and culminates in a notification in regards to the memorial service.

Next Dang-gu refuses to withdraw from Cheonbugwan until he believes the basin is perfect frustrating Jin Mu. In the background So-i listens intently while noticing her one-time saviour Seo Yul eavesdropping on the fact that he is the first person in Jeongjingak to master Chisu. She is told to stay away from him due to his prestigious background though So-i feels confident that she will soon be good enough when she is the leader of Jinyowon.

The ending

Subtly thanking Maidservant Kim for the service put on for Naksu the woman now living as Mu-deok cries in remembrance for her father. Behind her Seo Yul who himself is upset at the fate that has become reality for his former love watches on unable to step up and tell her what he knows and how he feels. Later on the genius mage tells Jang Uk that he will be returning to Seoho Fortress soon now that he has mastered Chisu and wishes to take someone currently not revealed to his friend with him. However it’s obvious that this is Mu-deok.

Returning to Songrim anticipating his final fight now that he has mastered Chisu we see that the opponent awaiting Jang Uk is not Cha-beom nor is the prize a golden toad. Instead the victor claims Mu-deok resulting in Seo Yul stepping forward to compete. With that revelation the episode ends.

She tells him that it would more scary than anything else for her which makes Jang Uk’s heart flutter because this holds a deeper meaning than “I miss you” for him. He assures her that he will get the ice stone for her even if he has to fight Jin Mu so that she will never have to worry again.

Alchemy of Souls Episode 13 Review

The episode had a lot going on and while we want to get into the details of every little thing we can’t. However let us focus on a few things starting with how Jin Mu is making connections between Mu-deok and Jin Bu-yeon. This guy is smart and he knows things but I guess the only reason he can’t complete the connection is because Mu-deok is not blind. But I am sure that he will find out something real soon.

This was also a very emotional episode for Naksu because she is able to properly mourn for her father maybe this is why master Lee pointed the way to Kim Do-ju.

Let’s now talk about Jang Uk and how this guy is an actual genius. He is able to handle pressurising situations train faster than anyone and is able to understand the person in front of him. He has definitely captured something from master Lee’s expression when he asked him if was being kind because of his family but chose to divert the topic.

And our second male lead who is giving us major Second Lead Syndrome I want to cry seeing him feeling so guilty about the past and his incapability of providing the woman he loves a shoulder to cry on. But taking part in this duel is his way of giving himself another shot at making things right. But we all know how things are going to end up.

This particular bZ4x is painted bright red and when it was on the road certainly would have made quite a bold statement. Unfortunately it has been involved in an accident that has left it a little worse for wear.

The Copart listing doesn’t provide any details about the incident that the bZ4x was involved in but the images suggest that the damage is limited to the front end. The inner section of the front fascia has been torn from the electric crossover exposing part of the crash structure. Curiously there are some elements of the front bumper that remain in place most notable being the dark-colored sides that match the front and rear wheel arches.

There are no other obvious signs of damage to the exterior of the car and an image of the cabin indicates that only the steering wheel airbag was deployed in the collision. In all likelihood the EV should be relatively easy to repair.

A look at the odometer reveals that the bZ4x has been driven just 602 miles (968 km) equating to less than three full charges of the 71.4 kWh battery pack. This is roughly half the mileage of another damaged bZ4x that has been listed for sale through Copart. The main difference with that example is that its front end has been completely crumpled and there’s likely no way that it will be fixed and return to the roads.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ryan Obituary,"64 Jeff left us on November 5th 2021. He graduated from North High School and Iowa State with a degree in sociology. He followed his brothers beginning his Job career at Linn's Super Valu. He went on from there to work at Garvis Hondatown as a mechanic. That fueled his love for Motocross and a side hustle as the Wheelie Wizard. He performed at many local events Knoxville Raceway the Ruan Grand Prix Parade and a memorable TV commercial on the Saylorville Dam for Hondatown. He had a yen for traveling and just took off and went to Alaska by himself at a young age. After that experience he wanted to see the other end of the earth and wrangled a job that took him to Antarctica. Not just Antarctica. Of the approximately 10 years he spent on the ice he wintered over at the South Pole three times. Work was still kind of a side hustle because what Jeff really wanted to do was travel. Working in Antarctica was just the ticket for him because the job was 9 months on at McMurdo Base and 3 months off to travel the world! It would be very surprising if he missed visiting anywhere. Along with his regular duties Jeff engaged in a couple of extracurriculars that brought him some notoriety. He hosted a local radio show as the McMurdo McWeirdo and started a recycling office Skua Central for personnel coming and going from the base to pick up and discard useful items in an ecologically difficult place for refuse. It is still in operation today. All of his side hustles apparently caught someone's attention and PEOPLE magazine did a piece on him. The latter part of his working career Jeff was an over the road trucker with Crete Carriers. He lived a good life and didn't understand man's inhumanity to man. With that he donated his body to science. There will be a gathering to remember him at Riverview Park at 6th and Corning in Des Moines on 13 Aug. 2022 at 2 pm. BRING A LAWN CHAIR and a story to share about Jeff in his old neighborhood.

Posted online on July 31 2022 Published in Des Moines Register",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzMwLzE5MzYtaGVhdC13YXZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the worst heat wave in US history prophesies our climate change–ravaged future,"As climate change continues to worsen experts agree that heat waves and wildfires will become much more common. Eventually vast regions of the planet will become uninhabitable at least during heat waves because the wet bulb temperature (a measurement of when the weather becomes deadly) will reach 95 °F (35 °C) which kills healthy humans within a few hours. Even recently Europeans have been fighting historic wildfires while Americans grapple with a massive heat wave including unprecedented temperatures in the Northwest.

This raises an obvious question: What kind of future lies in store for ordinary people as the heat waves get worse and worse? For an answer it is instructive to look to one of the worst heat waves in modern history: the North American heat wave of 1936.

Even by the scorched and sweaty standards of 2022 the heat wave of 1936 produced eye-popping numbers throughout the southeast central and western regions of the United States. On June 20th alone four states achieved all-time temperature highs: Arkansas (113°F at Corning on June 20th) Louisiana (110°F at Dodson on June 20th) Mississippi (111°F at Greenwood on June 20th) Missouri (112°F at Doniphan on June 20th). By the end of the month they had been joined by four more states: Nebraska (114°F at Franklin on June 26) Indiana (111°F at Seymore on June 29) Kentucky (110°F at St. John on June 29) and Tennessee (110°F at Etowah on June 29).

It was also bad luck then as now to be poor during a heat wave... Local newspapers urged them to buck up stating that doctors' main advice was that ""[the] cardinal rule on combating the heat is to forget it remain detached.""

Then things got worse in July. By the middle of that month heat waves had covered virtually the entire contiguous 48 states. On July 6th North Dakota and Minnesota achieved all-time highs of 121°F (in Steele) and 114°F (in Moorhead). By July 10th the heat wave had moved its focus on making historic numbers to the northeastern United States: New Jersey at 110°F (in Runyon) Maryland at 109°F (in both Cumberland and Frederick) Pennsylvania at 111°F (in Phoenixville) and West Virginia at 112°F (in Martinsburg). Before the end of the month historic highs had also been achieved in Wisconsin Michigan Indiana Missouri Nebraska Iowa Kansas and Oklahoma.

Beneath the jaw-dropping statistics of course there was tremendous human suffering. More than 5000 Americans died as a direct result of the heat wave and there was immeasurable damage to agriculture and infrastructure. Exacerbating matters the heat wave coincided with both the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl a natural disaster in which clouds of dust covered large sections of the American midwest. If there is any lesson to be learned from the 1936 heat wave it is that much of it could have been avoided. While the series of droughts that precipitated the heat wave was no one's fault American farmers in the Plains regions used poor land management techniques that allowed wheat fields to become barren. As a result of the lack of vegetation and soil moisture the Plains region wound up acting like a desert and producing more heat. From there it was just a matter of bad luck with the weather to move the heat wave to the north.

It was also bad luck then as now to be poor during a heat wave. In Kansas City during the heat wave authorities did not have adequate ice for people who couldn't afford it and low-income Americans would often wander the streets hang out at movie theaters (which were air conditioned) and spend nights in various shaded parks. Local newspapers urged them to buck up stating that doctors' main advice was that ""[the] cardinal rule on combating the heat is to forget it remain detached."" Yet even former Mayor Ilus Davis later admitted this was easier said than done. He recalled 50 years later that he had used wet rags to cool off his car's steering wheel and sometimes would even need to apply them to his bed. It was ""sort of unreal"" he explained and people ""just sat around and talked about the heat.""

As the planet continues to uncontrollably warm it is more likely than not that people will be having many more conversations about the heat. To understand why one need only look at a recent observation by Michael E. Mann an American climatologist and geophysicist and currently director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University about the recent round of European heat waves.

""Climate change has made the planet hotter and drier"" Mann told Salon by email describing this as ""a combination that leads to more widespread destructive and deadly wildfires. Our own research suggests that human-caused warming has also altered the jet stream in a way that leads to more frequent persistent summer weather extremes like the ones we're seeing play out in Europe at this very moment.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdGVsZWNvbXRhbGsuaW5mby9vbmVwbHVzLTEwci01Zy1sb25nLXRlcm0tcmV2aWV3LXByZXR0eS81Mzg4NDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OnePlus 10R 5G Long-Term Review: Pretty Consistent Performer,"OnePlus 10R 5G was launched in India on April 28 2022. It arrived just a month after the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G. For its entirety OnePlus has launched its flagship series together with multiple devices. However this time the company has launched them separately. The OnePlus 10 Pro 5G (review) was the first arrival; then it was the OnePlus 10R 5G; now it is soon going to be the OnePlus 10T 5G (August 3 2022). Don’t understand what’s the strategy there but here’s the thing - The OnePlus 10R 5G isn’t quite like a flagship device. It's more of a premium mid-range smartphone. Here’s my take on the device.









OnePlus 10R 5G Design Body and Dimensions Review

The OnePlus 10R 5G is the device I like the least among all the OnePlus smartphones when it comes to design and overall look. The camera bump of the OnePlus 9R was a big turn-off for me but with the OnePlus 10R 5G well the disappointment has just grown. Why is OnePlus not giving its ‘R’ branded smartphones a good design is not understandable! To be honest the OnePlus Nord 2 and OnePlus Nord 2T are better-looking smartphones than the OnePlus 10R 5G. Well of course it is subjective to me but there’s just no premiumness when you look at the OnePlus 10R 5G.

The body is made of plastic on the front and back. There’s a dual texture at the rear which frankly doesn’t create a difference for me. The OnePlus branding at the bottom right is almost invisible on the black variant which I had. For lack of a better word the camera bump is just unsettling for me.

The power button of the smartphone is on the right side while on the left you will see volume rockers. The edges are pretty flat and quite thick.

At the bottom there is a USB Type-C port along with the speaker grill on the right bottom and the SIM tray on the left bottom. I like the fact that the bezels are not too big on all the sides especially the chin which could have made the device look really bad. Its dimensions are – 16.33 cm x 7.55 cm x 0.82 cm and the device weighs only 186 grams which means it isn’t too heavy. Let’s take a look at the device’s display.

OnePlus 10R 5G Display Review

The OnePlus 10R 5G comes with a pretty big 6.7-inch Fluid OLED display with support for 2412 x 1080 pixels resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. It has Corning Gorilla Glass on top for protection and can switch refresh rates on an adaptive basis depending on the content on the screen.

The maximum brightness supported by this smartphone is pretty decent. Nothing too big but nothing too small either. One thing that I have always said is that OnePlus delivers a great display interaction experience to the consumers. OnePlus is largely able to do this because of the OxygenOS 12.

There is no bloatware the transitions are pretty smooth and the touch is super responsive as it comes with 360Hz touch response rate. Watching videos on this smartphone would be a decent experience. The audio output is also pretty sweet. The in-display fingerprint sensor has been pretty responsive whenever I tried unlocking the device.

The display has flat edges and the device is quite boxy which can give some people a slightly uncomfortable feeling in holding it for long periods like the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 series.

OnePlus 10R 5G Performance and Battery Review

The OnePlus 10R 5G is pretty good in performance. As mentioned above OxygenOS 12 makes a huge difference in the quality of experience you get from this smartphone. The OS is pretty well optimised and it works like butter. There is one area where I wanted the device to be good but it wasn't.

I wanted it not to overheat fast. But it did when I started playing games or recording videos in high-res even for five minutes. Multi-tasking is an easy experience with the OnePlus 10R 5G. I will say that it is a very consistent performer and it will open applications pretty fast and keep them running in the background if you haven’t closed them completely.

The OnePlus 10R 5G is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 8100-MAX and comes bundled with up to 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 internal storage. The battery drains at a normal rate I would say. It can easily last you a day if you are a light to moderate user.

There are two variants of the OnePlus 10R 5G available. One comes with support for 80W fast-charging and a 5000mAh battery while the other comes with a 4500mAh battery and support for 150W fast-charging.

It is a 5G smartphone. It can support both SA and NSA bands including - SA: n1/n3/n40/n41/n78/n28A/n5/n8 and NSA:n1/n3/n5/n8/n40/n41/n77/n78.

The performance of the OnePlus 10R 5G is excellent in almost every department. Let’s talk a little about the camera now.

OnePlus 10R 5G Camera

OnePlus 10R 5G has a triple-camera setup at the rear with a 50MP Sony IMX766 primary sensor + 8MP ultra-wide-angle sensor and a 2MP macro sensor. There is also an LED flash at the rear. For selfies the device has a 16MP sensor at the front. OnePlus 10R 5G’s back camera can support capturing videos and photos in several modes including – Nightscape 2.0 Super Macro UltraShot HDR Smart Scene Recognition Portrait Mode Pro Mode Video Nightscape Video HDR Video Portrait Timelapse and more.

The camera app is very easy to navigate through and if you have used an Oppo or OnePlus smartphone in the last few years then you know what you will get with the camera app. The camera shots were pretty good. I would say the lack of Hasselblad cameras didn’t make a big difference as the pictures were still pretty good and consistent. Take a look at some of the samples below.

OnePlus 10R 5G Review: Price and Overall Conclusion

The OnePlus 10R 5G is available in India in three different memory variants. The first two with 8GB+128GB and 12GB+256GB come for Rs 34999 and Rs 38999. Both of these variants come with a 5000mAh battery and 80W fast-charging support.

The third-variant comes with 12GB+256GB but with 150W fast-charging and 4500mAh battery for Rs 39999. You can purchase this device from the official retail shops retail partners the official website of OnePlus India and Amazon India. You can get a Rs 1000 instant discount on this smartphone if you get it via an ICICI Bank credit card.

Overall this device is a pretty good value. The only major drawback for me is its design which I didn’t like at all. But that could definitely be a subjective thing. At this price range a plastic body doesn’t feel good and OnePlus should know that. It is supposed to be a OnePlus premium mid-range device not an affordable entry-level smartphone.

Since the device is a pretty consistent performer you can always rely on it to get the job done for you. The camera battery as well as display are decent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlyZXNlYXJjaHBsb3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMzEvYXN1cy1yb2ctcGhvbmUtNi1kZXNpZ24tcGVyZm9ybWFuY2Utc3BlY3MtYW5kLW11Y2gtbW9yZS_SAWVodHRwczovL2RhaWx5cmVzZWFyY2hwbG90LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzMxL2FzdXMtcm9nLXBob25lLTYtZGVzaWduLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLXNwZWNzLWFuZC1tdWNoLW1vcmUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asus ROG Phone 6: Design Performance Specs and Much More,"Asus ROG Phone 6 series smartphones are well-known for their superior gaming performance. Furthermore these smartphones have excellent specifications and features.

The brand’s latest offering the ROG Phone 6 has a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with an aspect ratio of 20.4:9 and a pixel density of 395ppi. In addition the bezel-less display has a resolution of 1080 x 2448 pixels and Corning Gorilla Glass protection.

Asus ROG Phone 6: Design

Asus ROG Phone 6 is one of the more classic gaming phones on the market with its curved smooth pearlesque frosted glass back and rounded metal sides. However if you close your eyes while holding it you’ll notice that despite its size it’s a comfortable premium smartphone – nothing particularly noteworthy.

The phone’s back panel is furnished with glyphs and flourishes reminiscent of sci-fi movie alien mystique. While the phone doesn’t look as angry as previous-generation ROG phones. It’s clear that this is a smartphone designed for gamers.

Display

At first glance the Asus ROG Phone 6 has the same screen as its predecessor with a 6.78-inch Full HD AMOLED display. However if you go into the settings you’ll find the option to increase the refresh rate to 165Hz matching the Red Magic 7.

The ROG Phone 6’s resolution of 2448 x 1080 is low for a smartphone at this price point but it’s adequate for a gaming phone. This is because most games are displayed in Full HD and the lower resolution maintains high frame rates.

Asus ROG Phone 6: Performance

The Asus ROG Phone 6 features Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 a faster version of the Snapdragon 8 found in flagships such as the Sony Xperia 1 IV and Xiaomi 12 Pro. While the original 8 Gen 1 was notorious for overheating under duress. Asus has done a lot to help the ROG 6 maintain its cool despite its more powerful iteration of Qualcomm’s processor.

Asus has also added other thoughtful touches to help with heat management. For example charging phones usually causes them to heat up. Still you can configure the Asus ROG Phone 6 only to draw enough power to keep it alive. So you don’t have to worry about an empty battery or heat interfering with your handheld gaming.

Cameras

While gaming phones have never had cameras that can compete with iPhone or Pixel. The ROG Phone series has always performed admirably. This time we get an improved main camera despite a decrease in pixel count.

The phone’s night mode also does a good job of capturing extra detail with a long exposure. The best part is that it activates automatically when the lights go out. So you don’t have to do anything to use it whether you’re using a primary or ultra-wide camera.

Battery Life

Asus ROG Phone 6 has one of the largest batteries on the market with a 6000mAh capacity. For Android phones the standard capacity is now 4500-5000mAh. While there is no wireless charging. Phone 6 charges quickly with 65W charging going from 0% to 100% in about 45 minutes.

Knowing that you’ll probably want to charge your ROG Phone 6 while playing games Asus included a bypass charging mode as an option. This allows power to be delivered to the system from the charger without actually charging the battery reducing battery wear and improving heat management."

And while it's true the retailer can save you some serious cash chances are you're not taking full advantage of all the money-saving hacks Costco has to offer.

Experienced Costco shoppers can tell you that choosing the Kirkland brand over name-brand products is a great way to save money (and don't even get us started on how great the instant savings deals are) but there are so many other ways to save money that you probably don't know about. From reading secret codes on price tags to learning what not to buy from the retailer these are our best Costco shopping tips to keep both your cart and your wallet full.

Learn Costco’s Pricing System

Most stores use sale or clearance stickers to indicate a price decrease allowing you to compare the original price with the sale price—but Costco doesn't do that. If an item is on sale Costco won't always advertise the original price which means you might not actually be getting a great buy. The good news is there's actually an easy way to tell when you're getting the best deal on anything at Costco.

A longtime employee explained to Business Insider that everything you need to know about a potential price decrease is right on the price tag. Most regularly-priced items end in .99—which means you're paying the highest price for that item. Sale items however will usually end in .89 .79 .69 .59 or .49. These prices indicate a sale that Costco is offering through the item's manufacturer. Additionally items ending in .97 are usually clearance prices meaning it's likely the cheapest it will ever be.

Don’t Buy Everything at Costco

Even though it's so easy to buy everything in one grocery run there are actually things you shouldn't buy at Costco. Almost anything you can buy in bulk is cheaper than buying singles at another store but buying in bulk only saves you money if you can actually use or consume all of it before it goes bad. Grocery items like eggs and fresh produce can be cheaper in bulk but they aren't always a good deal for households with just one or two people because you're not saving any money if you're wasting a fridge full of food every month. For instance a household of eight hardcore Nutella lovers could probably finish this 7-pound Nutella tub from Costco before the expiration date but a single person is probably better off buying a regular-size tub at another store.

Look for Asterisks

In addition to learning Costco's pricing system it can also be beneficial to understand the information on the rest of the price tag. If the price is followed by an asterisk symbol it means the item won't be restocked at that location. According to employees these items have also usually been marked down quite a bit as well.

If an asterisked product is something you regularly purchase consider stocking up before it leaves the store forever. Otherwise you'll have to purchase it elsewhere (likely for a higher price) once the item leaves Costco.

Read the Date Codes

You can also use the price tag to determine the right time to buy an item. If you're buying something that's already been marked down the date code (found at the bottom right-hand corner of the price tag) will tell you the last time the price was marked down. If it's been a few weeks since it was marked down—and if there are still several on shelves—chances are another markdown is coming. You do run the risk of it being snatched up before you come back for the bigger discount so if it's something you really need you may want to get it while you can.

Upgrade Your Membership

A standard Costco membership will run you about $60 a year. But you can earn rewards from upgrading your membership. The executive membership costs $120 a year but you'll earn 2 percent back on qualifying purchases. If you spend $3000 a year at the store the executive membership will pay for itself—and start putting extra cash in your pocket.

Follow Along on Social Media

We won't lie—Costco can be overwhelming. We totally know the feeling of aimlessly roaming the aisles and filling our carts with new and exciting products we didn't plan to pick up (and didn't budget for). Fortunately there are social media accounts specifically designed to help with this. We love the Instagram account @CostcoDoesItAgain which alerts you to new products great sales and instant savings deals so you can have a game plan when you actually arrive at the store. Talk about reigning in impulse control!

Buy Non-Grocery Items

You already know Costco has the best deals on bulk food items rotisserie chickens and household items but next time you need to make a big purchase in other areas check Costco first. You can score deals through Costco on car insurance travel plans and even your mortgage payment!

Buy Returned Items

Costco is well known for its lenient return policy but not every returned item makes its way back onto the floor. Only items that have not been used or damaged can be resold again—but at a discounted price. Look for prices that end in .88 or .00. These items were purchased by someone else returned to the store and now must be sold at a sale price (even though the product is in perfect condition). You might be taking home a product with less-than-perfect packaging but unless you're buying the item as a gift this is totally the way to go.

Ask an Employee

We all have our Costco staples but their seasonal finds can be so good. Since they rotate out products so much it can be hard to locate things which often leads to a lot of mindless wandering through aisles—which also means extra items can end up in your cart. The best money-saving strategy is to plan out what you need and map out your route before you enter the store.

Learning the layout of the store can help cut down on impulse buys. All regular items stay in the same place but non-permanent products are hardly ever in the same place twice. That's because Costco is totally aware of our wandering-and-impulse-buying tendencies. Luckily employees are trained to know exactly where the seasonal buys can be found so ask where seasonal items are located as soon as you enter the store and then continue with your grocery game plan as normal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzMwLzMtY29zdGNvLWl0ZW1zLXdpdGgtaGVmdGllci1wcmljZS10YWdzLWFtaWQtaW5mbGF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Costco items with heftier price tags amid inflation,"As inflation and sizzling temperatures drive up food prices even price tags at supermarkets known for their bargains and deals are getting heftier.

Costco the low-price warehouse chain is no different.

Two menu items at Costco's food courts have gone in price increases which ranged in price from 10 cents to $1 media outlets confirmed this month. The changes are part of ""a national update"" according to Insider.

The warehouse's recent updates spurred conversation among shoppers on social media who discussed the increases in the Costco subreddit.

Here are two food court items at Costco that recently went up in price as well as one pantry staple on store aisles:

01 The Chicken Bake Close-up of signs listing prices at Costco food court. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) The chicken bake — Costco's breaded delicacy stuffed with strips of chicken breast bacon cheese green onions and Caesar dressing — is ringing up for $1 more at the food court. Now the individual bakes which previously cost $2.99 are priced at $3.99. User u/mbz321 who doesn't appear to be a fan of the item said: ""The 'new' chicken bake was barely worth it at $2.99."" Added user u/PM_MeYourAvocados ""I'm surprised they waited that long on the chicken bakes given the cost per unit on our end.""

02 20-Ounce Soft Drinks Pepsi bottles (Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Also at the food court the price of a 20-ounce fountain drink (with refill) has increased by 10 cents — or about 17% — from $0.59 to $0.69. Compared to other fast-food chains Costco's soft drinks are still the cheapest option. A medium-sized drink which is about 21 or 22 ounces runs north of $1.75 at Burger King and Taco Bell according to Fast Food Menu Prices. (Prices of course vary by location.) Meanwhile some McDonald's restaurants have pulled the brand's popular ""Dollar Drinks"" promotion from menus. For years customers could order any cold soft drink for $1. ""McDonald's has promoted $1 cold drinks year-round since 2017 after the offering began as a summertime promotion around 2008"" Restaurant Dive's Aneurin Canham-Clyne reported earlier this month.

03 Kirkland Bottled Water Costco Kirkland purified bottled water cases on display Queens New York. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Elsewhere on store aisles 40-packs of Kirkland-branded water bottles have gone up in price. One Redditor reported that the bulk buy which cost $1.89 as recently as a year ago now costs $4. ""Yeah that used to be the case at the beginning of the year just checked yesterday and $4.29 ridiculous"" user u/ghx16 wrote. ""I can get them at a lower price at other stores now same water since it's all Niagara.""

. . . but one long-standing deal appears to be inflation proof.

Costco still hasn't raised the price of its iconic hot dog and soda combo despite certain online rumors claiming the store had plans to do so. In fact the price tag on the cult-favorite combo hasn't changed since its debut in 1985.

""If you raise the [price of the] effing hot dog I will kill you. Figure it out"" Costco co-founder Jim Singal infamously told Costco CEO Craig Jelinek in what would go on to become a viral exchange.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vOTQ2ODU3L3doeS1hbWVyaWNhbnMtYXJlLXNvLWplYWxvdXMtb2YtdGhlLWNvc3Rjby1zYW1wbGVzLWluLXRhaXdhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Americans Are So Jealous Of The Costco Samples In Taiwan,"Why Americans Are So Jealous Of The Costco Samples In Taiwan

Costco is more than just a U.S. entity – according to the company's website it has locations across the world including in China Australia and Iceland. Costco also operates 14 stores in Taiwan (via Costco Taiwan's website) and the Taiwanese outlets have been exciting users of Reddit.

Reddit user milkcowcafe triggered lots of interest on the site when they revealed a Costco store in Taiwan giving out free samples of 15-year-old Glenfiddich whisky. A photograph shows a small amount of whisky in a tiny shot cup on a table beside one-liter bottles of Glenfiddich. The bottles are shown as costing $1499 which in the U.S. would be close to $50.

Costco's complimentary items are given away during specific times in Taiwan Vice reported in 2017. Patrons patiently queued for items including plum slices and small pieces of kimchi. Despite this apparently mundane process Redditors are very much fixated on the free whisky and have been dreaming about having such adventurous samples in Costco's U.S. stores.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3Mtd29yc3QtY29zdGNvLWZvb2QtY291cnQtbWVudS1pdGVtLXN1bW1lci0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Is the #1 Worst Costco Food Court Menu Item Right Now,"The Costco Food Court is home to the iconic hot dog pizza and chicken bake. It's gone through some changes recently—from the return of some beloved items to some sudden price hikes. But while it's common to flock to the line for some post-shopping fuel the menu contains items that are higher in calories and saturated fats potentially making it harder on your waistline.

As tempting as these may seem many of them haven't quite earned the reputation of being a healthy lunchtime selection when visiting the warehouse. Nutritionist and Eat This Not That! Medical Expert Board member Dr. Lisa Young shared exactly which menu item stood out for all the wrong reasons.

Costco Just Added Another New Summer Bakery Item

Of all the Costco Food Court items Young says that it's the cheeseburger fry and soda combo that should be avoided when scanning the menu. Though largely unavailable in the U.S. the cheeseburger is still served in other areas across the world such as Iceland and there are still a few locations in Southern California that serve them as of 2021. Despite its appeal the combo meal may not be doing your diet any favors. As Young suggests the combo meal ""contains nearly 1800 calories enough for a full day!""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states a daily calorie intake of 2000 calories per day as a general guide for nutrition which varies depending on a person's individual needs. Yet a cheeseburger fry and soda combo stands at 1740 calories or nearly 90% of that daily value with over 40% of those calories coming from fat. According to Young the combo is ""loaded with fat including saturated fat and lots of sodium. Plus the soda contains lots of added sugar.""

Deemed one of the best food court menu items by some others did not embrace the cheeseburger and don't miss its disappearance. But when it comes to deciding whether you should or shouldn't indulge Young's best advice is to simply ""Skip it.""

Johnson received a 25-month prison sentence after admitting assaulting a former partner causing her actual bodily harm and breaching a restraining order forbidding him from contacting or approaching her.

The court heard that having breached a six-year restraining order by staying at the woman’s home address for a fortnight last November at a time he claimed to be suffering with mental health issues he carried out a drink and drug-fuelled attack on her as she drove him home from a friend’s address in the early hours of November 21.

It culminated on her stopping the car in Newton Aycliffe and getting out whereupon Johnston dragged her to the ground by her hair choked her to the point she felt she was becoming unconscious and banged her head off the ground before also biting her ear.

Cory-lee Gibson 21 previously of Stileford Gateshead

Gisbon received a 17-month sentence after admitting dangerous driving driving while disqualified and without insurance plus fraudulent use of a registration plate.

It follows a police pursuit of a Volkswagen Passat bearing a cloned registration plate from Nevilles Cross Durham to Thinford on the A167 in mid-afternoon on September 10 last year.

During the nine-minute chase the defendant who has a previous conviction for dangerous driving on the Tyne Bridge from 2020 travelled at up to 80-miles per hour on 40-limit stretches of road went through red lights took a roundabout in the wrong direction and failed to stop after colliding with another car.

He eventually did stop near the junction at Thinford where he was arrested.

Judge Adkin told him he drove at “grossly excessive speeds” putting other road users and nearby pedestrians at serious risk of injury or even death.

As part of the sentence the judge also made a deprivation order for the VW Passat driven by Gibson.

Watkins was known for being a man of his word who always tried to understand the other side of whatever he was dealing with whether it be a person or an issue and that’s what made the CSX merger work.

In 1978 Watkins chairman of the Chessie System approached Seaboard Coast Line about a union and he and SCL’s new CEO Prime F. Osborn negotiated the deal.

In the ill-fated Penn Central merger 10 years earlier the leaders of the two lines had clashed. “That” Watkins said “is why we had our 50/50 merger Prime and I agreed on everything and if the two of us didn’t agree we didn’t do it.” The two shared the title of CEO and half the company’s top officers were from the Seaboard and half from the Chessie. Even the board was split evenly and the headquarters was set up in a neutral city Richmond.

Two years into the merger Osborn 67 retired and Watkins became CSX’s sole CEO.

Watkins had fallen in love with trains as a boy and after college he went to work in the finance department of the Chesapeake and Ohio which seemed a natural fit since. as a four-year-old. Watkins had been noticed for his prowess with numbers.

By the mid 1960s Watkins was C&O’s vice president-finance and in 1971 following the Penn Central bankruptcy he was chosen the railroad’s president and chief executive. He was selected in part because he had foreseen the pending bankruptcy of Penn Central and had buffered the C&O’s car-hire accounts with PC reducing the Chessie’s loss.

One of Watkins’ greatest achievements was the transformation of the railroads into a multi-modal company. He bought a gas company to hedge against rising fuel costs and with it came a pipeline company and the nation’s largest barge line.

Then he formed a trucking subsidiary and bought Sea-Land Service the world’s largest container line making CSX one of the world’s premier transport companies. Decades later most of Sea-Land and the barge line were sold.

Watkins retired in 1991 after a 40-year career that spanned some of the industry’s most tumultuous years. “It was an interesting time. I can say that” he recalled. “I don’t know whether I’d want to go through it again because there were a lot of sharp turns but it was fascinating.”

Watkins was born in the Louisville suburb of Fern Creek Ky. on Jan. 26 1926. He earned a bachelor’s degree from Bowling Green Business University (now Western Kentucky University) in 1947 and a master’s degree from Northwestern University in 1948 and served in the U.S. Army. He is survived by his wife of 72 years Betty; son H. Thomas Watkins III; three grandchildren and a great grandchild.

Aa memorial service will be held Aug. 5 2022 at the Powell Chapel at the Second Baptist Church 9615 River Road in Richmond Va. In lieu of flowers the family is requesting donations ot the Second Baptist Church.

U.S. Department of Transportation Deputy Secretary Polly Trottenberg will be on hand for a 2 p.m. event that includes a groundbreaking for the construction activity that will take place to get the station prepared for Amtrak’s return.

The only problem: Amtrak’s return remains uncertain.

The nation’s passenger rail operator is currently in mediation with two freight companies – CSX and Norfolk Southern – over the fate of a twice-daily service connecting Mobile to New Orleans. Bay St. Louis is one of four coastal Mississippi stops along the route.

The mediation was ordered in May by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. The board for the first time in its 26-year history is involved in determining the control of a U.S. rail line pitting Amtrak against freight operators.

The battle is high stakes at a time when Amtrak is angling to make substantial investments to its national network after receiving $66 billion from the federal bipartisan infrastructure law last year.

“Amtrak expects to be able to run the train” said Knox Ross a Mississippi-based member on the Southern Rail Commission who will be at the groundbreaking. “That’s the message being sent.”

Ross said Amtrak’s expectations are for a favorable STB ruling to operate the Gulf Coast service despite intense opposition from CSX and NS and a host of Alabama-based officials headed up by the Alabama State Port Authority.

The STB in June ordered mediation in a case that began in March 2021 when Amtrak sought an order from the governmental agency to allow inter-city passenger trains to operate on the freight lines between Mobile and New Orleans.

Marc Magliari spokesman with Amtrak said the event in Bay St. Louis represents the beginning of a multi-phase project to make the stops along the Gulf Coast route handicap accessible or ADA compliant.

“We’ll do this to all of the stations across Bay St. Louis to Mobile” said Magliari. He estimates the projects costing Amtrak around $2 million. The work in Mobile will take place sometime in August.

“We are doing what we need to do and that is taking every reasonable step to prepare for service whether that is hiring crews or making these stations ADA compliant” he said. “In some ways this is the first step toward reactivating these station locations and beginning service.”

Magliari said that Amtrak is receiving cooperation from CSX who will supply a flagger to ensure construction crews are alerted whenever a freight train passes by “to make sure they do so safely.”

NS and CSX both declined comment about the groundbreaking event in Bay St. Louis.

“CSX is focused on the active litigation before the Surface Transportation Board where the impact of our customers of Amtrak’s proposed new passenger service is under evaluation” said Cindy Schild spokeswoman with CSX.

Also declining comment was the Alabama State Port Authority which is the only non-railroad entity involved in the active mediation.

Ross said Amtrak’s belief is that they will “have a good outcome from the STB.”

But he also admitted there was some risk to sinking money into a project before receiving the authority to go ahead with restarting the passenger rail line.

“They are willing to take that risk because they believe in the service and believe they will run it” he said.

Amtrak in recent days submitted to the STB additional analysis showing the Gulf Coast service will cause “no unreasonable impairment” for the freight operators and that no new infrastructure is needed to accommodate the service.

The STB in May requested additional evidence from Amtrak CSX and NS on whether additional passenger trains will disrupt freight service.

Freight operators along the Alabama Port argued in April that introducing a twice-daily Amtrak route between Mobile and New Orleans – without any improvements to the 120-mile rail line – will create “staggering” delays in Alabama.

Amtrak believes the freight operators are making unreasonable capital improvement demands totaling more than $400 million. A CSX attorney in April argued that that infrastructure demands are hefty near the Port of Mobile and that delays would be likely.

The Alabama port along with most Alabama state officials have long been opposed to Amtrak returning to the Gulf Coast if a rail-traffic control analysis – conducted in collaboration with CSX NS and Amtrak – is not completed and its recommendations followed. A prior study completed by CSX and NS but disputed by Amtrak estimated $405 million to $440 million in capital upgrades were needed before the twice-daily service could be restored without major impacts to the freight trains.

Amtrak in early 2021 pulled out of negotiations with CSX and NS for the completion of a rail-traffic control study out of frustration about the study being stalled during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amtrak officials also noted that previous studies into the rail line had been conducted and that enough analysis was prepared to get the service restarted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvY2VuMjE4ODQ00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Donald ""Dean"" Edward Schawe Obituary - The Cincinnati Enquirer","Donald ""Dean"" Edward Schawe 85 of Taylor Mill KY passed away on Thursday July 28th 2022 at his residence.

Yes Amtrak’s Capitol Limited between Pittsburgh and Cumberland Md. offers this and more on its 306-mile round-trip adventure.

The experience begins at Pittsburgh’s historic Union Station at 1100 Liberty Avenue. The city’s Union Station was completed in 1904 for use by the Pennsylvania Railroad to serve several feeder lines.

Union Station would go on to serve as a significant stop for Pennsylvania passenger trains like the Broadway Limited Manhattan Limited Penn Texas and Spirit of St. Louis. Today the station is served by Amtrak’s Capitol Limited and Pennsylvanian trains. When on-time the eastbound Capitol Limited No. 30 departs the steel city at 5:20 a.m. Eastern time traveling briefly on Norfolk Southern’s ex-PRR main before transferring to CSX Transportation’s former Baltimore & Ohio mainline to McKeesport.

The Capitol Limited then follows the Youghiogheny River through West Newton and Connellsville (MP BF 269.7) on the route of the B&O’s flagship passenger train of the same name and the Washingtonian. East of Connellsville you’ll enter Pennsylvania’s 20000-acre Ohiopyle State Park and its Youghiogheny River Gorge of which the train’s route along the CSX mainline parallels to Confluence (MP BF 242.9). From here you’ll follow the Casselman River to Rockwood (MP BF 226.8) before beginning to climb the west slope of Sand Patch grade. While the near 2-percent grade is no challenge for Amtrak’s GE P42DC diesels and lightweight passenger train the grade is a heavy climb for eastbound CSX freight trains.

As you maneuver Sand Patch’s famed S-curves and horseshoe bends keep an eye out for two Western Maryland-built viaducts as part of the WM’s original Connellsville extension west from Cumberland Md. The 1908-foot Salisbury viaduct dating to 1912 is about three minutes east of Garrett (MP BF 219.5) and the 910-foot Keystone Viaduct is about two minutes east of Meyersdale proper. Both viaducts are open to pedestrians and cyclists today as part of the Great Allegheny Passage. Once you pass underneath the Keystone Viaduct the Capitol Limited is within a couple minutes of entering the west portal of the 4475-foot Sand Patch tunnel. Today’s tunnel was built in 1911-1913 to replace the 1850s-era 4777-foot tunnel. Sand Patch Tunnel (MP BF 211.0) is the summit of the grade. After exiting the tunnel’s east portal keep an eye out for the Old Mance post office on the engineer’s (right) side of the train. The structure dates to 1892 and is one of the most well-documented photography landmarks on Sand Patch grade.

From Mance the B&O’s eastern slope of Sand Patch elegantly navigates the Appalachians on its descent toward Cumberland. The engineer’s side of the train offers preferred views for scenery and a number of curves allow you to catch a glimpse of the train’s head-end. Once you pass through Hyndman (MP BF 190.2) the Capitol Limited is within 12 miles of Cumberland where eastbound No. 30 is due to arrive when on-time at 9:20 a.m. ET.

An uninspiring station at Cumberland provides shelter and basic amenities during the lull between Capitol Limited trains. When both trains are on-time you will have almost 10 hours to explore Cumberland’s rail heritage of which is entirely accessible by foot from the Amtrak station at 201 E Harrison Street. Approximately four blocks from the station is the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad at 13 Canal Street. The three-story train station is the main boarding location for the tourist railroad’s Cumberland excursion trains notably its Frostburg Flyer which departs at 11 a.m. ET.

The Frostburg Flyer is a four-and-a-half hour round-trip passenger train featuring coach open air deluxe dome and first class amenities. Fares begin at $35 and range up to $125 depending on class of service. The railroad offers one-way and round-trip cab rides at different prices depending on diesel or steam steam power. An EMD GP30 powers the Flyer on Thursdays in the summer months while the railroad’s flagship restoration project – the return of Chesapeake & Ohio 2-6-6-2 No. 1309 powers the Flyer on Friday-Sunday excursions in the summer and Wednesday through Sunday during October’s fall foliage. No. 1309 is significant for being the last mainline steam locomotive built in the U.S. and delivered by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1949. It was also the centerpiece of TRAINS’ recent preservation initiatives. In its heyday No. 1309 powered heavy coal trains in the Chesapeake & Ohio’s southern West Virginia coalfields until 1957. The Mallet was relocated to the B&O Railroad Museum in Baltimore Md. in 1972. The Western Maryland Scenic began its restoration in 2014 and the locomotive returned to operation in early 2022.

Today’s Frostburg Flyer traces the former Western Maryland climbing a mountainous pass of more than 1200 vertical feet from Cumberland to Frostburg through the Allegheny mountains. The tourist train briefly lays over at Frostburg where passengers can tour the restored depot and visit locally owned shops. A turntable exists at the end of the railroad although the Flyer typically operates with locomotives on each end. You will return to Cumberland at approximately 3:30 p.m. ET three-and-a-half hours before westbound Capitol Limited No. 29 is due to arrive.

Additional free time at Cumberland can be spent appreciating the town’s historical nature including artifacts at Fort Cumberland an 18th century landmark with ties to the French and Indian War. The Allegany Museum at 3 Pershing Street is another attraction capturing the region’s historical elegance. A third historical attraction is the Headquarters of George Washington at 38 Greene Street also in Cumberland’s historic downtown district. It is the site of a log cabin twice occupied by George Washington during his time as a Colonel in the French and Indian War.

In addition to these historical attractions downtown Cumberland offers several local restaurants ideal for dinner prior to boarding westbound No. 29. The author recommends either the Baltimore Street Grill at 82 Baltimore Street or Ristorante Ottaviani at 25 N. Centre Street.

Once you board westbound Capitol Limited No. 29 for the return assault on Sand Patch’s east slope you will return at Pittsburgh’s Union Station when on-time at 11:48 p.m. ET.

On Aug. 1 2018 the K-pop boy band revealed the official name of their fandom — affectionately called Stay — and takes time every year to honor the moment. Stay’s fourth anniversary in 2022 Stray Kids announced ‘STAYweeK’ for daily drops of behind-the-scenes videos unseen photos vlogs live streams and more “special gifts.” Now for the final day SKZ revealed their new song “Mixtape : Time Out” as the last gift for fans.

More from Billboard

Opening with the sound of beach waves “Time Out” quickly jumps into an energetic punk-rock vibe to pair nicely with the fun message of the track: “Let the stress fly away/ Don’t worry ’bout tomorrow” the Kids sing. “We’ll just have some fun right now.” According to a track description the song reflects an actual vacation the band went on together with the beach sounds recorded by the group.

“Time Out” is the latest “mixtape” track from Stray Kids that the group tends to drop as off-cycle typically surprise tracks. Their last tape “Mixtape: Oh” was released in June 2021 at No. 1 on the World Digital Song Sales chart giving the band their first-ever chart-topper on the tally.

It won’t be long before Stray Kids get a chance to see their U.S. Stays as the group will soon be one of the leading performers at KCON 2022 in Los Angeles next month.

A company is expanding a nationwide recall of its flavored laxatives because of microbial contamination which it said could be behind three reported cases of serious adverse reactions.

Consuming the laxatives is unsafe and risks infection that could lead to “serious life-threatening adverse health consequences” according to a news release from the Food and Drug Administration. Anyone who’s immunocompromised and consumes Vi-Jon LLC’s infected laxatives is at increased risk of serious health complications.

The recall includes all three flavors of Vi-Jon’s Magnesium Citrate Saline Laxative Oral Solution available at nationwide wholesalers and retailers including CVS Rite Aid Walmart Walgreens Harris Teeter Kroger Publix and others.

Check to see if your laxatives are affected by looking at the National Drug Code (NDC) and the Universal Product Code (UPC):

The initial recall of the laxative’s lemon flavor came on July 14.

The first recall came after a third party discovered gluconacetobacter liquefaciens had contaminated the laxatives according to the FDA.

The company added its cherry and grape flavors to the recall on Monday. Vi-Jon LLC based in St. Louis is investigating the three reports of “serious adverse reactions” which they say could have come from consuming the laxatives.

Consumers should not use the laxatives and can return them to where they were bought.

Lewis (26-10 MMA 17-8 UFC) a multi-time UFC title challenger and fan-favorite heavyweight had his night halted in just 55 seconds Saturday when Pavlovich (15-1 MMA 4-1 UFC) rocked him with an early flurry in their main card bout at American Airlines Center in Dallas.

Although Lewis unquestionably was staggered and hit the canvas he immediately protested the stoppage when Miragliotta jumped in to wave it off. The crowd showered the octagon with boos fellow fighters complained on social media and only Pavlovich and his team were left happy.

“I think it was too soon but to be fair – I think Miragliotta’s a great ref – the way that he fell probably nine out of the 10 people in this room would’ve jumped on him and stopped the fight including me” White told reporters including MMA Junkie at the UFC 277 post-fight news conference. “I like the ref but I wouldn’t really debate that was an early stoppage. That was definitely an early stoppage.

“When you jump right back up like that and you’re ready to go – listen he was a little rocked but no more rocked than Julianna (Peña) was three four times in the fight and she fought five rounds. Miragliotta made a mistake and it happens. So I don’t think it diminishes Derrick Lewis at all. I would’ve liked to see that fight go on.”

Trong ba tháng kết thúc vào ngày 29/5 doanh số bán hàng của Longhorn Steakhouse tăng 106%. Texas Roadhouse cũng báo cáo doanh số tăng 16% trong quý I. Số liệu được cả hai thống kê tại các chi nhánh đã mở ít nhất một năm.

Robert Byrne Giám đốc phân tích tại công ty tư vấn nhà hàng Technomic cho biết nhu cầu về bít tết đã tăng từ trước đại dịch. Vài năm qua ngày càng nhiều người dành thời gian ở nhà. Họ đặt thức ăn hoặc tự nấu nhiều hơn. Vì thế khi ăn ngoài họ muốn tận hưởng bữa ăn giá trị hơn. Họ chọn những địa điểm như nhà hàng bít tết - vừa có không khí vừa có bữa ăn đủ no.

Một lý do khác là một số chuỗi quyết định ngược dòng bằng cách phóng to miếng bít tết trong thời vật giá leo thang thay vì thu nhỏ chúng. Ricardo Cardenas CEO Darden Restaurants - sở hữu chuỗi Longhorn Steakhouse cho biết những miếng bít tết lớn hơn khiến mọi người cảm thấy họ đang kiếm được một món hời. Điều này đặc biệt quan trọng khi lạm phát tăng cao.

Chuỗi của ông chọn chiến thuật tăng kích thước với hầu hết các miếng bít tết. ""Người tiêu dùng nhìn thấy giá trị của món ăn. Với mỗi USD chi tiêu tại một nhà hàng bít tết họ sẽ nhận được nhiều thức ăn hơn"" Cardenas nói.

Hồi tháng 5 khi một nhà phân tích hỏi lạm phát có thể ảnh hưởng thế nào đến chi tiêu của người tiêu dùng CEO Texas Roadhouses Jerry Morgan cho biết để vượt qua thời kỳ khó khăn ""bạn phải giữ lời hứa"". Với Texas Roadhouse điều đó bao gồm ""giữ kích thước miếng bít tết"". Và điều đó đã mang lại hiệu quả.

Longhorn Steakhouse và Texas Roadhouse dẫn đầu danh sách các nhà hàng đầy đủ dịch vụ trong nghiên cứu về Chỉ số hài lòng của khách hàng Mỹ (ACSI) giai đoạn 2021-2022. ACSI cho biết khách hàng hài lòng hơn với trải nghiệm tại các nhà hàng đầy đủ dịch vụ hơn là các chuỗi thức ăn nhanh.

Thêm vào đó người tiêu dùng có thể đặc biệt hài lòng với quy mô bữa ăn lớn hơn tại những nơi này trong bối cảnh khẩu phần ăn bị thu hẹp ở những nơi khác. Trên thực tế các công ty hàng tiêu dùng đã đối phó với chi phí cao hơn bằng cách giữ nguyên giá nhưng giảm trọng lượng kích thước sản phẩm.

Những miếng bít tết lớn thời lạm phát còn giúp nhà hàng khắc phục những thiếu sót trong dịch vụ Byrne giải thích. Nhiều nhà hàng vẫn còn thiếu nhân sự và nhân viên làm việc quá sức đôi khi sẽ dẫn đến dịch vụ thiếu chỉn chu. Tuy nhiên một miếng bít tết lớn có thể giúp thực khách dễ dàng bỏ qua hơn.

Một lý do khác là trong khi giá thực phẩm tháng 6 tăng 122% so với cùng kỳ năm ngoái giá thực đơn nhà hàng ở Mỹ chỉ tăng 77%. Tại siêu thị giá thịt bò thái miếng sẵn để làm bít tết còn giảm 03% - khiến bít tết trở thành lựa chọn hợp lý khi ăn ngoài lẫn ở nhà.

The episode part of History Channel's ""The Machines That Built America"" series examined the development of the tractor and the people behind it. The works of Benjamin Holt of Caterpillar fame and Henry Ford were also highlighted.

The TV show provided a brief boost to John Froelich's notoriety and museum attendance Schutte says. But she adds all the information in the program wasn't entirely accurate.

""This is the place people will get the real story. We have lots of information from multiple sources"" she continues. ""My desire is to help people learn the true story of John Froelich's invention.""

HISTORY IS MADE

Based on museum documents here is an abbreviated summary of Froelich tractor history:

John Froelich operated a custom-harvesting business in the late 1800s. The 45000-pound steam engine he used to power his thresher was hard to transport often got stuck and was a fire hazard in dry fields in Iowa and South Dakota. Finding enough wood or coal to power the machine was a chore.

The inventive businessman decided a lighter gasoline engine such as the ones that powered his grain elevator mill and well driller could solve the problems associated with steam-powered tractors. And gasoline a byproduct of making kerosene was cheap and plentiful at the time.

In early 1892 Froelich and his assistant and blacksmith William Mann went to work on the new gas tractor. The word ""tractor"" wasn't officially coined until 1903 by the Hart-Parr Co. according to the National Museum of American History.

Froelich bought a new single-cylinder Van Duzen gas engine which reportedly produced 14 hp. Working in the grain elevator's workshop the duo mounted the engine on a wood frame and running gear of a steam engine. Many existing shafts gears and pulleys were used but Froelich designed and built many other parts to make the tractor work. This included a water-cooling system front steering and a reversing clutch.

""It was a tractor before its time"" Schutte says.

Froelich and Mann took the tractor outdoors as a crowd gathered. At first they couldn't get the engine started; but Mann had the idea of wedging a rifle cartridge in the priming cup and hitting it with a hammer. The small explosion ignited the gas and oxygen in the combustion chamber to start the motor. Froelich drove the tractor to the delight of the crowd.

After a local threshing demonstration using the new tractor Froelich shipped the machine that was nearly 17 tons lighter than a large steam engine to South Dakota in September 1892. It provided power to thresh about 72000 bushels of grain.

The early success prompted Froelich and a group of investors to form the Waterloo Gasoline Traction Engine Co. in 1893 for $50000 to make more gas tractors. Froelich was named president. In its first year of production the company only managed to manufacture four tractors far short of the initial goal. Only two were sold and both were returned due to starting and mechanical problems. Initial efforts to build a practical tractor failed.

The company reorganized in 1895 now called the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Co. Froelich left the company because it focused on stationary gas engines not tractors. The company though continued to work on tractors and improve Froelich's design. It created the Waterloo Boy model R in 1914 and then the model N which were both retail successes.

John Deere purchased the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Co. in 1918 for nearly $2.5 million which is about $40 million today. John Froelich who died at age 83 in 1933 didn't see a dime of that or cash in on his invention. Today John Deere is the world's largest tractor manufacturer.

""John Froelich had a creative inventive mind"" Schutte exclaims noting the 14 patents recorded in his name to improve engines farm equipment and everyday life such as a dishwasher. ""He did forever change agricultural history.""

On Saturday night Billy Strings brought his summer tour to TCU Amphitheater at White River State Park in Indianapolis Ind. The musician performed a total of 29 songs spread over three jam-packed sets included was a solo set during the halfway point of the concert. Additionally last night’s show did not have a traditional set break in order to make the most of night two in Indy.

Strings’ started the concert with a tune off his self-titled EP opening the show on “Slow Train” before working into Saturday’s first cover William “Billy” Hayes’ “I’ll Remember You Love in My Prayers.” The band rolled into a handful of originals next including “Watch It Fall” “Turmoil & Tinfoil” and “Nothing’s Working” before covering Bill Emerson’s “Home of the Red Fox” the latter melted into Renewal’s “Secrets.”

The first set continued with a rendition of The Dillards’ “There Is a Time” followed by a cover of The Stanley Brothers’ “Rank Stranger.” For the final tune of the night’s initial set the ensemble landed on fan favorite “Highway Hypnosis.” Then the band – Jarrod Walker (mandolin) Royal Massat (bassist) Billy Failing (banjo) and Alex Hargreaves (fiddle) – exited the stage leaving Strings to take on the next set of songs independently.

The musician preluded what was to come by speaking directly to the audience; he shared “I just wanted to maybe play a little flat-picking for you guys.” He continued “I just decided to opt out of set break tonight myself.” Strings cited strict curfews as the catalyst for the welcomed shift before running through a take on the traditional “Beaumont Rag” which led into a cover of Peter Rowan’s “Black Mountain Rag.”

Strings unaccompanied stage time continued with the traditional “John Henry” which came before Norman Blake’s 1972 track “Randall Collins” a song that was performed for only the second time ever following a 2020 debut in Nashville Tenn. Sam Patterson Trio’s “Haul de Woodpile Down” arrived next before a take on The Delmore Brothers’ “Brown’s Ferry Blues.” For the final song of the solo set Strings landed on the traditional “The Cuckoo” capping the illustrious display on the clawhammer banjo.

The night’s final set opened on Bill Monroe’s “Uncle Pen” followed by a dip into Strings’ personal repertoire on “Know It All” before returning with a cover of Larry Sparks’ “John Deere Tractor” and New Grass Revival’s “Whisper My Name.” “Home” arrived during the sets midway prior to a take on Béla Fleck’s “Tentacle Dragon (Revenge of The).” Then Strings offered up “Red Daisy” and segued in a pairing of “Leaders” and “Wargasam.” For the final songs of the night the musician and his band dug into Jimmy Martin’s “Tennessee” before finishing on The Stanley Brothers’ “Train 45.”

Following last night’s monstrous display Strings and his band will take a well-deserved break from the road returning later this week on Thursday Aug. 4 when they will perform a headlining slot during the first night of the Hinterland Music Festival in Saint Charles Iowa. Single-day and weekend passes are still available for the Midwest music event. For more information visit hinterlandiowa.com.

A Delta Air Lines flight that U-turned over the Atlantic left YouTuber and passenger Arieh Smith ""sobbing"" and ""terrified.""

The flight to Ghana had to return to New York because of a fuel issue.

Smith told Insider he didn't think the crew understood how ""freaked out"" some of the passengers were.

A passenger who was on a Delta Air Lines flight which made a U-turn over the Atlantic Ocean after a fuel issue told Insider he was left ""terrified"" by the incident.

Arieh Smith a YouTuber with more than five million subscribers was on the flight which departed Sunday from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport bound for Kotoka International Airport in Accra Ghana.

Around two hours into the flight when the plane was flying over the Atlantic Ocean the pilots turned the aircraft around and returned to New York Smith said in a YouTube video he uploaded.

""I was honestly terrified"" Smith told Insider. ""I started texting my wife and sobbing in my seat. I thought we were going to die.""

Passengers on the flight began to murmur when the captain walked down the aisle to look out of the side windows at the wings Smith said. Half an hour after that the captain announced there was an issue with the fuel and the plane needed to turn back he added.

""I don't think [the crew] understood how freaked out some of us were"" Smith said.

Delta arranged another flight for the passengers to fly to Ghana the next day but Smith said he was ""too emotionally and physically exhausted"" to travel again so went home.

The airline initially offered Smith meal vouchers and a hotel stay in response to the disruption but the next day he was refunded for the flight he said.

A Delta spokesperson confirmed the incident to Insider saying the plane had to make a U-turn ""out of an abundance of caution due to operational reasons."" Newsweek reported that Delta said the problem was down to a ""fuel imbalance"" — when the amount of fuel between the left and right tanks in the wings is uneven.

In Smith's video he leans into the cockpit as the pilots tell him they can't continue the flight because they are unable to ""automatically or manually balance the fuel.""

The Delta spokesperson told Insider the plane landed safely and passengers got off the flight adding that customers' safety and security is the airline's first priority. Customer support teams helped affected customers when they arrived at JFK airport the spokesperson added.

Asked whether he would try to fly to Ghana again Smith told Insider: ""No. I've tried to go three times now and each time has been unsuccessful so I think the universe is telling me not to go.""

Delta will launch nonstop service in December between Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Tahiti as well as nonstop flights between the carrier's mega-hub in Atlanta and Cape Town. Next May Delta will also start nonstop service between Atlanta and Tel Aviv.

This weekend the carrier made these routes — along with Premium Select seating on certain Hawaii flights — available for purchase. We'll give you the scoop on what it will cost in cash or Delta SkyMiles.

Here's a look at what you can expect if you're looking to book flights. Some of the routes include prices that are quite steep if you want to fly nonstop so it will be worth watching to see what happens to these fares over time. Depending on their popularity they can go up or down of course.

New routes

Los Angeles to Tahiti

Delta's service between Los Angeles and Faa's International Airport (PPT) in Papeete French Polynesia could well be the most in demand since it is a bucket list destination for many travelers.

Launching Dec. 17 we found fares starting at $1941 for a main cabin ticket departing on the first day possible with round trips in Delta One available for $9827. You'd come back on Christmas Eve on this particular round trip.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

For comparison the best nonstop economy fare we found for those same dates on any airline was on French Polynesia's flagship carrier Air Tahiti Nui which is currently priced at $1299. Air France also operates nonstop service between Los Angeles and Papeete with the lowest fares several hundred dollars cheaper than Delta's current fares.

(Screenshot from Google Flights)

It's worth noting that this service launch comes right in the midst of peak holiday travel season. If you can wait until mid-January to fly the starting prices are almost half.

If you're looking to book the trip with SkyMiles economy prices drop from around 128000 miles for holiday travel to 80000 miles round trip in mid-January (plus $55 in taxes and fees). There's Delta One availability for 480000 miles round trip.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

TPG values 80000 SkyMiles at 1.41 cents per mile so the redemption (not including the fees) is worth about $1128 for economy and $6768 in Delta One.

Atlanta to Cape Town

Atlanta travelers will soon have a much simpler path to South Africa with nonstop service to Cape Town also launching on Dec. 17. This will greatly enhance Delta travelers' connectivity to South Africa.

Main cabin tickets for a round trip departing on the inaugural flight start at $5547 in economy. On this itinerary you'd return on Christmas Day.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

If you're looking to travel in a premium cabin I found Comfort+ seating available for $6633 round trip and $10659 in Delta One.

Keep in mind that Delta is launching service to Cape Town just as United Airlines also ramps up nonstop service to the South African city in late 2022 with United's flights originating at Dulles International Airport (IAD) in the Washington D.C. area. For comparison a round trip around the same time on United out of Dulles comes in thousands of dollars cheaper for an economy ticket at $2017.

(Screenshot from Google Flights)

Finding a redemption with nonstop service in both directions was a bit of a challenge though I was successful when I opened up my search dates a bit. For a trip in May for instance the round trip goes for a steep 470000 SkyMiles in the main cabin which TPG values at more than $6000.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

Atlanta to Tel Aviv

Delta's nonstop service from Atlanta to Israel launches next spring with the first flight to Tel Aviv taking off on May 10 2023. Delta last flew this route in 2011.

You can see the fare progression for an itinerary with a departure on the inaugural flight to Tel Aviv with a return just over a week later. Trips start at $8242 in the main cabin though you may want to spend a couple of hundred dollars more for a Comfort+ seat. The fares top out at $13077 in Delta One.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

For now at least it looks like you'll pay a premium to fly nonstop from Atlanta to Tel Aviv right when the service launches in May. Cash fares for itineraries that include a connection in New York at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) are currently going for significantly lower prices. The same is true for mileage redemptions when you connect in New York which comes in at about a third of the cost of the nonstop service from Atlanta for main cabin. Prices on Delta One suites are consistent whether you fly nonstop or not.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

Miami to Los Angeles

In December Delta restarts its service between Miami and Los Angeles for the first time since 2018. You can get a round trip starting at $346 for basic economy departing on the first day of service Dec. 17 and returning to South Florida with a Christmas Eve red-eye flight. That price is among the cheapest fares I found on any airline for this route on those travel dates.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

Round trips for the same itinerary booked with SkyMiles start at 21000 miles for basic economy rising to 100000 miles for a first class ticket.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

New Premium Select options

Delta also started selling tickets this weekend for its first-ever Premium Select seats on domestic flights. The carrier is expanding this cabin to certain longer domestic flights beginning with some Hawaii routes out of its hubs at Atlanta JFK and Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC).

(Photo by Zach Honig/The Points Guy)

Atlanta to Maui

Starting Nov. 19 Premium Select will be an option for travelers to Hawaii as Delta launches nonstop flights from Atlanta to Kahului Airport (OGG) in Hawaii.

I found Premium Select cabin round trips departing on that date and returning a week later for $2854.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

Of course a trip from Nov. 19-26 does fall during the peak travel period of Thanksgiving.

Looking out further into February I found Premium Select available on the nonstop flights for $2169 a little less than double the main cabin price but about a third of a Delta One ticket; a good example of how this change will give travelers that intermediate option between economy and a true first class experience.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

A Premium Select round trip booked on SkyMiles that same week in February goes for 170000 SkyMiles which is just over a quarter of the miles you'd pay for Delta One.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

New York to Honolulu

About a month after the Atlanta to Maui launch Delta will also add nonstop flights from New York-JFK to Honolulu (HNL) with a Premium Select option. A round trip ticket currently goes for $2962 departing on the Dec. 17 launch date.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

Again the price drops significantly if you can wait to fly during a lower-demand period though. I found a $1712 round trip during the first week of February.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

That same itinerary goes for 128000 SkyMiles.

(Screenshot from Delta Air Lines)

Hawaii routes

Delta is also adding Premium Select as an option for its existing nonstop service between its hub in Salt Lake City and Maui. Again we saw pretty significant fluctuations in both cash and award pricing over the course of the weekend so if you don't see a fare you like you might consider waiting a bit and checking later.

Bottom line

Between service launches and new premium cabin availability Delta is definitely adding more prime seats to more prime locations over the coming months. While some of the prices are more affordable than others particularly when looking at peak travel periods when many of these routes are launching you're likely to find a better deal if you can be flexible with your travel dates in the interest of finding the best price.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1haXItbGluZXMtcHJlbWl1bS1zZWxlY3QtaGF3YWlpLWZsaWdodHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines To Introduce Premium Select On Hawaii Flights,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1haXItbGluZXMtcHJlbWl1bS1zZWxlY3QtaGF3YWlpLWZsaWdodHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5vcnRod2VzdGVybi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvMjAyMi8wNy8zMC9kZWx0YS11bml0ZWQtdGFsay1waWxvdC1zaG9ydGFnZXMtZWFhLWFpcnZlbnR1cmUvMTAxMTEzMzEwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta United talk pilot shortages at EAA AirVenture,"OSHKOSH - While an estimated 8000 planes flew in to the Experimental Aircraft Association's annual AirVenture convention this week in Oshkosh across the nation it appears that the only infallible way to fly somewhere is to be your own pilot.

In 2020 20% of U.S. pilots were unemployed due to the crash in air travel during the pandemic according to The 2021 Pilot Survey.

Airlines operated 4.7 million domestic passenger flights in the full year 2020 a 41% drop from flights in 2019 according to the Bureau of Transportation. As a result airlines weren't making enough money to cover their expenses.

Some airlines offered early retirement packages to their employees in efforts to reduce expenses. Other pilots were fired or laid off.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the number of airplane pilots and engineers has decreased by nearly 4% over the past two years.

Wisconsin pilots were on average among the lowest paid in the nation in May 2021 according to the BLS. The state also had the lowest rates of employment for pilots copilots and engineers.

Now that people are becoming more comfortable with flying and traveling the aviation industry is struggling to find enough pilots to fly the flights they need to keep up with the demand.

Commercial pilots say they've been pushed to their limits

The lack of pilots and engineers has been a contributing factor to the issues travelers have faced especially during the busy summer months.

American Airlines has been among those most affected by the shortage. Since the start of June it canceled over 2000 international and domestic flights.

Meanwhile pilots have begun to protest and in some cases strike over work conditions that include disrupted schedules low wages and the inability to get enough rest to safely do their jobs.

Delta pilots have been protesting since May in many major cities; they say they're overworked and exhausted.

""There was already a pilot shortage happening before (the COVID-19 pandemic)"" Kelvin Mason general manager for Pilot Pathways a pilot training program for Delta said during AirVenture. ""What happened with COVID all the airlines went through so much financial turmoil in that 12- to 18-month period that a lot of us went into survival mode. (Delta) offered retirement packages to our employees to try to limit the size of the operation and limit our costs.""

Mason said that at one point during the pandemic Delta was losing over $100000 a day.

As pilots accepted the retirement packages Delta's workforce was significantly reduced leaving it like the other airlines unprepared for the rapid return of leisure travel.

Last month the Delta Master Executive Council released a statement that said by fall Delta pilots will have worked more overtime this year than in 2018 and 2019 combined.

""Travel demand came back faster than anybody anticipated"" Mason said. ""All of the airlines have been scrambling to fill all of our openings. The industry has been struggling to ramp up as quickly as travel demand has come back.""

Here's a snapshot of the turmoil in air travel: According to Flight Aware over 6700 flights within into or leaving out of the county were delayed on Wednesday. Over 2800 flights were canceled across the country.

Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport had 33 delays and five flight cancellations. Appleton International Airport had five delays but no cancellations.

The Air Line Pilots Association which represents Delta pilots posted a letter to Delta customers empathizing with them about their many delayed and canceled flights. The union accused Delta of scheduling more flights than available pilots resulting in pilots working overtime.

""Airline and airport staffing shortages have also led to a slow reintroduction of airline routes to the schedule"" said Madison Blancaflor the content operations editor for The Points Guy. ""Somewhere between 80 to 90% of routes are back from pre-pandemic levels but we’re not fully recovered yet. You’re looking at the same number of passengers from 2019 trying to book a fewer number of available airlines seats.""

Still Blancaflor said airlines aren't seeing much resistance from customers. Travelers are still booking trips even at higher prices so airlines continue to raise them.

More pilots key to better more reliable air service

Some airlines decided to cut back on their operations in an effort to relieve the pressure. Alaska Airlines cut down on capacity and SkyWest announced plans to stop service to at least 29 smaller cities including Eau Claire — though the U.S. Transportation Department barred SkyWest from doing so until replacement carriers can be found under the governments subsidy program according to Reuters.

Delta announced plans in May to cancel around 100 flights a day in July and August to prevent major travel disruptions this summer.

Meanwhile airlines are looking for smarter and more competitive ways to recruit more employees.

One of the ways Delta is doing this is by dropping the requirement for pilots to have a four-year degree. Mason said one of the reasons for the change was an attempt to be competitive with other airlines.

""Most of the other airlines have already removed their requirement or never had one in the first place so we were trying to be competitive with other airlines because we're already in the same boat of trying to hire thousands of pilots"" Mason said.

Another reason was the recognition that not everyone is able to or wants to pursue college degrees.

""We wanted to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to pursue this career"" Mason said. ""It allowed us to expand our candidate pool and we've been happy with the results so far.""

Delta offers a pilot career pathway program called the Propel Program that allows students at Delta's partnered universities as well as the company's internal employees to have the opportunity to become a pilot. Mason said Delta was the first major airline to have a pathway program like Propel.

United has the United Aviate Academy based out of Goodyear Arizona which helps students obtain their private pilot license in as little as two months. Once a student completes the United Aviate Academy they can then transition to the Aviate program which will allow them to gain experience as a certified flight instructor and get the hours needed to be a certified pilot.

Those who continue on past the Aviate program can move toward possibly becoming a pilot for United.

The goal is to train over 5000 pilots within the next decade who will be guaranteed a job at United once they complete the Aviate program as stated by the CEO of United Scott Kirby on the company's website.

United plans for at least half of those 5000 pilots to be women or people of color. For the United Aviate Academy it is important to open up opportunities to for minorities in the aviation field.

""Diversity is important because we need to reflect the people that we serve"" said Daryll Wyrick manager of Academy services who also attended AirVenture. ""It's important for someone to be able to see what's possible and I always say there's power in relatability.""

Having a broader reach on recruitment will bring in more students to the program.

""We're doing everything we can to attract those that have not even thought of it to see the vision and the path"" said Mary Ann Schaffer United's chief pilot after presenting a forum on the academy at AirVenture.

In total United expects to hire more than 10000 pilots over the next decade the website states and the United Aviate Program will aid in reaching that goal.

The program offers free private pilot training which usually costs about $17750. United and Chase partnered to offer $2.4 million in financial aid to those in the program that qualify and some participants can even receive full rides.

""We opened the academy with our first class in December of last year so those pilots are between three to five years from being ready and experienced to the point of coming to United Airlines and the existing pathway"" Schaffer said. ""Mandatory pilot retirement is age 65. Our charts show that we are going to retire over 700 pilots in the year 2028. So we've got the time we can build the pipeline that we need to before we hit our peak retirement.""

Thirteen percent of the nations pilots will reach retirement age within the next five years according to the Regional Airline Association.

U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham is pushing a bill that could help ease the shortage. The Let Experienced Pilots Fly Act would raise the federally mandated retirement age for pilots from 65 to 67 but the long-term solution is to attract younger adults to the aviation industry and train them to fly.

Investing.com -- China's economy slowed again in July suggesting a rocky road to full recovery. PMIs from around the world point to a generalized slowdown except in India. Stocks are pausing for breath after last week's tech-driven rally and grain and oil prices ease on brighter news out of Europe. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday August 1.

1. China slows; Beijing bristles as Pelosi prepares Taipei visit

China’s manufacturing sector slowed in July amid signs of weak demand from core export markets and lingering disruptions from repeated outbreaks of COVID-19.

The Caixin Manufacturing PMI which tracks activity among private-sector companies fell to 50.4 only just above the 50 line that typically separates contraction from expansion with firms reporting falling output and a sixth straight drop in employment.

The numbers suggest that China’s economy still faces huge challenges to meet an official growth target of around 5.5% this year. They were corroborated by HSBC adding another $150 million in credit loss provisions to its offshore Chinese loan book a reflection of the grinding real estate crisis.

In other China-related news U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi begins a tour of Asia today that is scheduled to include a visit to Taiwan despite strongly-worded warnings from Beijing against it.

2. India bucks worldwide PMI decline trend; German retail sales slump

Purchasing managers indices around the world also pointed to a slowdown broadly confirming the preliminary data released a week earlier except in India where activity picked up strongly.

The Institute for Supply Management’s PMI will be released at 10:00 AM ET and is likewise expected to show a modest slowdown from June albeit staying clearly in growth territory.

That contrast with the Eurozone where manufacturing is already in contraction owing to the acute energy crisis and accompanying inflation problem. Those factors also contributed largely to the biggest annual drop in German retail sales since the country started collecting pan-German data in 1994.

3. Stocks set to open mixed; Shale earnings in focus later

U.S. stock markets are set to open the week flat to lower pausing for breath after a vigorous rally last week in response to the quarterly results from Big Tech names.

By 06:30 AM ET (1030 GMT) Dow Jones futures were down 8 points essentially unchanged while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were both down 0.2%.

Most of the day’s earnings action comes after the close with shale oil and gas producers Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) and Diamondback (NASDAQ:FANG) in particularly sharp focus. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) CF Industries (NYSE:CF) Avis (NASDAQ:CAR) and Vornado (NYSE:VNO) also report late while Jacobs Engineering (NYSE:J) and Loews (NYSE:L) head a thinner slate ahead of the opening.

4. Grain prices ease as first ship leaves Ukraine under UN deal

The Sierra Leone-flagged ship Razoni became the first ship to leave a Ukrainian port carrying grain under a landmark UN-backed deal a tentative sign of progress in relieving a growing food crisis in the emerging world. Russia has been blockading Ukrainian ports since its invasion in February

The BBC quoted Turkish and Ukrainian officials as saying the ship left the port of Odesa early on Monday morning local time. It will arrive in Turkish waters for inspection on Tuesday. It is due to take its cargo of 26000 tons of corn to the Lebanese port of Tripoli.

Grain futures eased again on the news with U.S. corn futures falling 1.5% and wheat futures falling 1.4%.

5. Oil falls on report that marine insurance sanctions will not be enforced

Crude oil prices also eased after a report suggested that the U.K. and Europe will not after all try to stop all seaborne Russian oil cargoes from getting insurance. The initiative had formed a major part of the EU’s sixth sanctions package with the capability to disrupt shipments to third-party countries such as China and India.

However the Financial Times reported that the U.K. has not drafted the legislation necessary for that under pressure from the U.S. which wants to bring oil prices down in time for the midterm elections in November.

By 06:30 AM ET U.S. crude futures were down 1.3% at $97.31 a barrel while Brent was down 0.9% at $102.98 a barrel.

AP – To the naked eye the Mako Compressor Station outside the dusty West Texas crossroads of Lenorah appears unremarkable similar to tens of thousands of oil and gas operations scattered throughout the oil-rich Permian Basin.

What’s not visible through the chain-link fence is the plume of invisible gas primarily methane billowing from the gleaming white storage tanks up into the cloudless blue sky.

The Mako station owned by a subsidiary of West Texas Gas Inc was observed releasing an estimated 870 kilogrammes of methane – an extraordinarily potent greenhouse gas – into the atmosphere each hour. That’s the equivalent of burning seven tanker trucks full of gasoline every day.

But Mako’s outsized emissions aren’t illegal or even regulated. And it was only one of 533 methane “super emitters” detected during a 2021 aerial survey of the Permian conducted by Carbon Mapper a partnership of university researchers and NASA.

The group documented massive amounts of methane venting into the atmosphere from oil and gas operations across the Permian a 250-mile-wide bone-dry expanse along the Texas-New Mexico border. Hundreds of those sites were seen spewing the gas over and over again.

Ongoing leaks gushers going unfixed.

“We see the same sites active from year to year. It’s not just month to month or season to season” said a research scientist at the University of Arizona Riley Duren who leads Carbon Mapper.

Methane’s earth-warming power is some 83 times stronger over 20 years than the carbon dioxide that comes from car tailpipes and power plant smokestacks. Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have largely failed to regulate the invisible gas.

That leaves it up to oil and gas producers – in some cases the very companies who have been fighting regulations – to cut methane emissions on their own.

The Associated Press (AP) took the coordinates of the 533 “super-emitting” sites identified by Carbon Mapper and cross-referenced the locations with public records to piece together the corporations most likely responsible.

Just 10 companies owned at least 164 of those sites according to an AP analysis of Carbon Mapper’s data. West Texas Gas (WTG) owned 11.

The methane released by these companies will be disrupting the climate for decades contributing to more heat waves hurricanes wildfires and floods. There’s now nearly three times as much methane in the air than there was before industrial times. The year 2021 saw the worst single increase ever.

Last October AP journalists visited more than two dozen sites flagged as persistent methane super emitters by Carbon Mapper with a FLIR infrared camera and recorded video of large plumes of hydrocarbon gas containing methane escaping from pipeline compressors tank batteries flare stacks and other production infrastructure.

In addition to West Texas Gas’s Mako site AP observed a large plume of gas escaping from tanks at a WTG compressor station about 15 miles away in the Sale Ranch oil field. Carbon Mapper estimated that emissions from that site averaged about 410 kilogrammes of methane an hour.

In a statement Midland-based WTG said it routinely conducts its own overflights with gas detection equipment and within the last six months had either “repaired or upgraded” nine of the super emitting sites that AP asked about including Mako. The company was “actively addressing” another site though it declined to provide specifics. WTG said it inspected the last site and found no leak.

AP found Targa Resources a Houston-based natural gas storage processing and distribution company was the closest operator to 30 sites that were emitting a combined 3000 kilogrammes of methane per hour. Targa did not respond to a detailed list of questions from the AP.

“Reducing air emissions from the oil and natural gas sector is a top priority for the administration and for EPA” said Tomás Carbonell EPA’s deputy assistant administrator for stationary sources. Methane he added is “helping drive impacts that communities across the country are already seeing every day including heat waves and wildfires and sea level rise”.

But proposed rules to address emissions most oil and gas sites are still under review and if implemented will likely face legal challenges.

To track emissions the United States (US) government keeps an inventory of methane released into the atmosphere. Those figures are used by policymakers and scientists to help calculate how much the planet will warm.

AP found the government database often fails to account for the true rate of emissions observed in the Permian.

For example Devon Energy reported releasing methane equivalent to 42000 metric tonnes of CO2 for a year of operations in the Permian Basin. AP’s analysis using the detected emissions shows they would emit that much in just 46 days.

A spokesperson for Devon said the company is committed to reducing its methane emissions and being transparent about its progress.

The EPA could not provide AP with a single example of a polluter being fined or cited for failing to report or underreporting emissions.

At an international climate summit in November the US and more than 100 other countries signed on to a Global Methane Pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.

To meet that deadline the American oil and gas industry would have to reduce emissions at a rate far beyond anything currently seen.

The industry says it is working toward that goal.

“To be able to capture more methane emissions makes sense from a business perspective” said Frank Macchiarola a senior vice president at the American Petroleum Institute an industry trade group. “It’s the product that we ultimately want to bring to market.”

But climate scientists and environmentalists warn the industry’s incremental efforts are nowhere near enough to avoid dire consequences for humanity.

“Methane is responsible for 25 per cent of today’s global warming and we can’t limit future warming to two degrees Celsius if we don’t drastically cut those emissions” said Ilissa Ocko a senior climate scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund a group that campaigns for climate action.

“We have the tools to cut methane in half and the faster we do that the better off our climate and communities will be.”",,,,,,,,,

Are you looking for the best REIT ETFs in 2022? With interest rates rising REITs are certain to face downward pressure due to mortgage costs. Yet REITs that invest in real property may fare better during high inflation. The question is whether the two will cancel each other out.

REIT ETFs often provide a more attractive dividend than bonds. Moreover REIT ETFs offer further diversification by holding a basket of REITs to reduce portfolio risk. Further dividend income is a key for those wanting to learn how to become financially independent.

For this article we sifted through hundreds of real estate ETFs. Then we sorted the ETFs and chose unique REIT ETFs that contain significant assets.

What Is An ETF?

ETFs are funds that hold stocks and perhaps other ETFs. Indeed it’s understandable if investors think a mutual fund does the same. However unlike a mutual fund ETFs are traded on the secondary market (i.e. instantly traded) rather than directly with the mutual fund company. Further investors who buy and sell ETFs get the advantage of having the trade settled when they buy or sell. Summing it up one could say that an ETF is a fund that trades like a stock.

ETFs can hold assets such as stocks other ETFs foreign currencies and even commodities such as gold. While most ETFs attempt to replicate the performance of an index such as the S&P 500 or Nasdaq many others serve other purposes.

Passive Managed ETFs

Passively managed ETFs are the most common type of ETF. The fund manager automatically chooses a basket of assets such as individual REITs and rebalances once or twice a year. These types of ETFs often seek to replicate an Index’s performance like the Dow Jones U.S. REIT Index which tracks the performance of U.S. REITs.

Also due (in part) to its turnover expense ratios are often low.

Active Managed ETFs

Investors choose Actively Managed ETFs because they seek higher than average returns. But it comes at a cost. Indeed actively managed ETFs have higher expense ratios (they cost more) because a manager spends more time managing the portfolio. However the returns have the potential to beat the index. For this article I focus on actively managed REIT ETFs.

What’s A REIT?

A REIT is also known as a Real Estate Investment Trust. You can see Sure Dividend’s full REIT list here.

A REIT is a publicly-traded company that owns operates or finances income-producing assets involving real estate. The most common REITs involve real estate properties that generate revenue from rents such as apartment buildings.

I’d forgive an investor who thinks a REIT is a dividend stock. REITs trade on the secondary market like stocks do and they pay dividends as many stocks do. However unlike typical publicly-traded companies REITs must distribute at least 90% of their income to investors.

Related: Dividend investing versus real estate investing.

And investors must remember the income is net of expenses to operate the business. As a result investors would receive less money than managing the same properties themselves. But that’s a trade-off REIT investors are happy to make.

REIT Risks

REITs often use leverage to grow. In other words like most Americans who buy homes using mortgages so do REITs when they purchase income-producing properties. Of course REITs will borrow significantly more than the average single-family home. Furthermore REITs will often borrow on a variable interest basis. As a result REITs usually pay less interest when mortgage rates drop. And similarly REITs will pay more interest when mortgage rates increase as they are in 2022.

Historically mortgage rates drop when the Federal Reserve needs to stimulate the economy as in March 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis. On the other hand mortgage rates rise when the economy is doing well – primarily to curb inflation.

When it comes to REITs however one of the biggest risks is: “Does the REIT have enough demand?”. In other words is vacancy going to be a risk? When it comes to REIT ETFs however the answer might not be clear as the fund might invest in hundreds of REITs.

Are REITs A Good Investment?

REITs allow investors to participate in a specific real estate market without directly holding and managing the real estate. Let’s say I wanted to own apartment buildings. I could either buy the apartment buildings and manage them on my own. Or I could buy a REIT or REIT ETF that offers exposure to apartment buildings. There are many excellent resources for Real Estate investing.

I probably won’t make as much money with the REIT or the ETF as owning the assets directly. However REITs are more attractive to investors than those wanting to own the underlying real estate. To be sure while the risks are similar it’s much less work owning the REIT or the REIT ETF!

What’s A REIT ETF?

REIT ETFs offer diversification and reduce portfolio risk by investing assets in many different REITs. This way the portfolio should mitigate a single REIT’s disappointing news should it come.

Furthermore REIT ETFs can come in the “leveraged” form. These leveraged REIT ETFs may offer investors a potential 2x or 3x return on an index and may include a “bull” or “bear” in the name. And they profit when REITs in the portfolio go up or down in value. For example a 3x Bear REIT ETF aims to produce the investor 3x the returns in a falling market. However we intentionally left out these types of leveraged ETFs due to their risks.

REIT Taxation

REIT taxation isn’t as straightforward as owning a stock. REITs avoid paying corporate tax by distributing 90%+ of their income to investors. As a result the tax burden passes to the investor.

Investors who receive income from REITs are getting a combination of income short and long-term capital gains (and losses) and non-qualified dividends. As a result it may be better to hold REITs and REIT ETFs in tax-sheltered accounts to ease the burden.

However those who chose to hold REITs and REIT ETFs in taxable accounts can rest assured they will get a 1099-DIV and 8937 forms that account for all the income.

What Are the Best REIT ETFs?

Now that you’ve read through the background on REITs and REIT ETFs I’ll cover the Best REIT ETFs. In this list I’ll evaluate the following:

Is the dividend safe? How likely will they continue to pay?

Does the dividend grow? A stagnant dividend could mean a stagnant business.

How long has the ETF been in business? Longevity is security.

Total assets within the fund. More assets mean additional market participation.

When does the dividend pay? Annually Semi-Annually Or Monthly?

Is it liquid and can you quickly sell the REIT ETF?

Costs: Are the management fees low?

Final Thoughts

Finding the best REIT ETF for your portfolio comes down to what diversification you’re seeking.

That combination offers broad international diversification that would be impractical to reproduce. However those looking to pick a sector to outperform the overall real estate sector need only look at a more specialized REIT ETF.

He was in the sixth grade when his Armenian American family moved from Monterey Park to the new suburb of Hacienda Heights in the early 1960s. Their home on Daytona Street sat on the base of the Turnbull Canyon foothills.

“At the time we were surrounded by avocado groves a joy to get lost in after school for a kid and his dog” Ohanesian said.

He remembers “pre-adolescent family drives over Turnbull Canyon Road to Whittier at night and being spooked over the deep black cavernous ravines and having nightmares of the family car tumbling down the cliffs” he said.

But it wasn’t many years later when he was a professional videographer and film instructor that Ohanesian said Turnbull Canyon Road beckoned again.

Over pizza and beer with some friends he mentioned that he was looking for a project he could really get his teeth into.

“After a years-long absence we’d recently been back up to the hills a few times to hike and I realized how much I’d missed the area how ingrained it had been after all this time” Ohanesian said. “As a video professional I realized that no one had ever done a comprehensive serious treatment of the region that is so rich with history and local lore. I threw out the notion with no idea of where it would lead. With their encouragement I embarked on the ‘long strange trip.’”

Ohanesian’s film “Turnbull Canyon: A Road Unwound” explores the history folklore cultural connections and scenic beauty of the 7-mile road that connects uptown Whittier to Hacienda Heights.

It will be shown at 2 p.m. Aug. 13 at the Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum 15415 Don Julian Road City of Industry. Admission is free but reservations are required. Film run time is about 90-minutes and a question-and-answer session follows the screening. For more information . homesteadmuseum.org

Apart from spending time in the canyons Ohanesian interviewed city police and fire officials longtime residents and hiker Brian Lovell “the conscience of the hills.”

Pastor Stephen Chavez of Pico Rivera appears in the film to talk about the murder of teenager Gloria Gaxiola of Baldwin Park as well as santería practices. The Greenlead Killerz biking club offered insights on the conflict between hikes and bikers on the trails.

“I consciously tried to show a cross-section of hikers bikers public officials residents and even visual artists who share their appreciation of the beauty of the topography” Ohanesian said. “I especially wanted the insights of ‘real people’ who hiked and biked there who lived there who partied there who could provide first-hand hiking-boots-on-the-ground direct insights from their experiences.”

Ohanesian 68 who now lives in South San Gabriel said he feels affection for all the stories about Turnbull Canyon Road both real and speculative: from the couple describing how the 1987 fire devastated their new home to the police deputy talking about the crimes he’s witnessed and stories about the Gates of Hell the old Water Tower and the “Singing Kettle” house at Turnbull and Skyline.

But the most enticing story for Ohanesian is the most mysterious: that of the hill’s namesake Robert Turnbull whom he describes as “an immigrant Scotsman sheep farmer land speculator and local drunk.”

Turnbull was found dead by the Los Angeles River in 1888 soon after scoring a major windfall from his sale of the canyon property to the founders of Whittier Ohanesian said.

“Not only do no photos of him even exist but the only concrete evidence of his existence is featured in the film his gravestone” he said. “It may be fanciful of me but I like to think that the tragic and unknown circumstances of Turnbull’s life and passing inadvertently set the template for far worse human tragedies that have defined the hills’ mythology in the decades to follow” Ohanesian said.

He credits Paul Spitzzeri museum director and Michelle Muro collections coordinator for providing historical insights as did Nick Edmeier director of the Whittier Historical Museum. Ohanesian said he hopes the film will serve as a time capsule of sorts something that will serve as a historical educational and cultural resource as well as provide a counter-narrative to the known and unknown the myths and rumors.

For himself Ohanesian said his time in the canyons has strengthened his belief in some sort of “Spirit of the Hills.”

On every trip up the road Ohanesian said he’s gotten into the habit of gathering trash he sees around.

“My hope being that if I help haul out the garbage the canyon spirits will reward me with some good photographic opportunities” he said. “The result has been that I’ve been fortuitously accorded any number of unexpected discoveries (like snakes deer little-used trails gorgeous scenic views dangerous bikers terrifically cooperative and insightful interviews with hikers).

“I’ve even returned to my car with a bag of plastic bottles to find every vehicle ticketed except mine. That said those damned spirits have also teased me with their mischievous side which I’ve learned to accept.”

Recently Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) and Nykaa announced the launch of Beauty&You India—a programme that is looking to discover the next generation of Indian beauty brands. Created by ELC’s New Incubation Ventures and launched in partnership with Nykaa Beauty & You India aims to help founders and innovators grow their business by identifying brand goals achieving scale and curating product portfolios.

Beauty&You will support India-focused companies and entrepreneurs through a competitive application process—and both pre-launch and in-market beauty concepts will be considered for the awards. The winners will be provided with masterclasses financial support mentorship and distribution support from ELC and Nykaa’s experienced ecosystem.

The jury for the programme includes Katrina Kaif actor and founder of Kay Beauty; Sabyasachi Mukherjee founder & CEO Sabyasachi; Samrath Bedi executive director of Forest Essentials; Nicola Kilner CEO & co-founder DECIEM group among other industry experts. Shana Randhava vice president ELC New Incubation Ventures and Anchit Nayar CEO of beauty for Nykaa e-Commerce who will lead this programme spoke to Forbes India about the vision and objective of the programme. Edited excerpts:

Q. What triggered the decision to launch Beauty&You? What is the main objective of this programme?

Shana Randhava: This programme was inspired by Nykaa and ELC’s deep commitment to building and supporting the startup ecosystem in India. We started talking about this programme about six months back. The idea is to discover and propel the next big beauty entrepreneur in India and allow them to benefit from our joint experience distribution and scale which could help the brand scale up locally and then take it to the global stage.

Anchit Nayar: The idea for this programme comes from our shared history. Estée Lauder did this 76 years ago Nykaa did this just 10 years [ago]—finally both businesses were started by women entrepreneurs and have become successful in their respective domains. We wanted to find a way to give back to the entrepreneurial ecosystem in India. More than the capital we’ll be infusing into these businesses it is about them learning from our shared resources and network.

Young entrepreneurs in the beauty space might have access to plenty of capital from the PE/VC ecosystem. But really understanding what it takes to be a powerhouse and build successful brands—is something we can help them with. Our insights here will be much more meaningful than just giving capital.

Q. From a strategic point of view is this programme a means to look for more acquisitions?

Anchit Nayar: The purpose of Beauty&You is to give back to the ecosystem that has been extremely generous to both Estée Lauder and Nykaa. Our idea is to find the next Estée Lauder the next DECIEM the next Forest Essentials and the next Nykaa.

We are going to be giving the award money without taking any equity in the company. In our minds it is a truly altruistic programme. That being said both companies have a history and track record of making acquisitions. While there is a possibility that we might invest in these brands or look to acquire them at some point that is not the goal of this programme.

Q. How does the programme work and will these companies be a part of ELC and Nykaa’s networks in the long run too?

Shana Randhava: The application portal opens on August 1 2022 and for the next two months we’ll be collecting applications from both—in-market brands as well as companies at the pre-launch stage. There will be a very exhaustive shortlisting process and finally the shortlisted candidates will present at the November event when the final winners will be announced. During the shortlisting process we will spend a lot of time doing masterclasses—educating potential winners about marketing technology and brand building.

Anchit Nayar: I feel the real work begins after the winners have been declared. This is when the stakeholders at ELC and Nykaa will really roll their sleeves up and help these guys on their journey to become meaningful brand(s) in the country. The winners will get access to Nykaa’s distribution network they will be listed on our platform and also possibly get featured in our physical retail stores.

Q. What are some of the criteria you will be looking at when picking the finalists?

Shana Randhava: We will be focussing on brands and entrepreneurs who have some really cutting-edge ideas. These brands or ideas need to have a competitive advantage—new innovative products technology new experiences for consumers and community or even looking at different consumer audiences.

We are focussing on building long-term relationships with these brands which is why we have a very rigorous shortlisting process. To give you an example Estée Lauder looked at over 1200 brands in the past year before deciding which companies to invest in. This means we are very selective and really looking for some unique gems coming out of the Beauty&You programme.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzA4ZGNkYjQzLWVkZDYtNDY2Yi1iNTY4LTdlYzliOWFmMTRkZtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Card lenders show faith in US consumer as they hunt for new borrowers,"Print this page

Roula Khalaf Editor of the FT selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Leading US credit card lenders are signalling their confidence in the American consumer stepping up marketing efforts to attract new borrowers even as the economy slips into a technical recession.

After rising 47 per cent in the first quarter the volume of paper and digital mail solicitations sent by US credit card issuers increased again in the second quarter according to preliminary data from marketing research firm Competiscan putting it on track to reach a record high this year.

The wave of offers follows an 85 per cent surge last year from the depressed levels of 2020 and comes as many big card issuers said during their second-quarter earnings reports this month that they were increasing marketing spending.

JPMorgan Chase the largest US card issuer highlighted the ferocity of the competition for borrowers when it blamed higher customer acquisition costs for a 45 per cent fall in second-quarter card income.* Capital One the second-largest issuer said its quarterly marketing expenses rose 62 per cent from last year’s levels and pledged to remain aggressive.

“We continue to see opportunities to book accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns and we continue to lean into marketing to drive growth” Capital One chief executive Richard Fairbank said calling the competition “more intense than pre-pandemic levels”.

The increase in marketing activity is particularly noteworthy at this stage of the economic cycle. During uncertain times lenders typically send out fewer card offers — targeting potential borrowers with the highest credit scores — and focus on selling premium cards or making other offers to current customers.

However even as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down the highest inflation rate in more than four decades credit card lenders believe they have room to increase the size of their loan books because unemployment is low and consumer balance sheets appear healthy.

Credit card balances held by the seven largest issuers — JPMorgan Capital One Citigroup Bank of America American Express Discover and Synchrony — rose 13 per cent to $739.8bn compared with last year but remain about 9 per cent lower than they were at the end of 2019.

American Express last week raised its already bullish revenue outlook for the year as it reported higher-than-expected earnings and said its annual marketing spending would come in above its prior guidance of $5bn.

“I don’t see [a recession] in my numbers at all” chief executive Stephen Squeri told Yahoo Finance. “It’s really hard for me to get my head around that in quarter three or quarter four we’re going to have a big slowdown.”

To attract new customers issuers are embracing flashy tactics. Last month Amex rolled out a limited-edition card made from the scrap metal of retired planes. Sign-on bonuses tied to travel have become more generous although consumers so far are showing a preference for cashback cards.

Many of the marketing efforts are targeting so-called “revolvers” or borrowers who carry a balance from month to month instead of paying their statements off in full.

During the first quarter there was a 62 per cent increase in the volume of balance transfer offers that would enable consumers to consolidate debt on to a credit card interest-free for a time Competiscan said. The terms are also getting more generous. The interest-free period rose on average to 16 months this year from 14 months in 2021.

Sara Rathner an analyst at NerdWallet a personal finance website said the combination of growing balances and rising interest rates could land consumers in trouble.

“If you have credit card debt currently or you’re taking on debt for a large upcoming purchase interest rates are high they are getting higher” Rathner said. “It can spiral out of control pretty quickly.”

Complicating the task for lenders is the difficulty that they face in gauging the impact of government stimulus and debt forbearance programmes on consumers over the longer term.

“You have seen a dislocation between what had been very correlated metrics” said Brian Doubles chief executive of Synchrony the largest US store credit card issuer which increased its marketing spending by 18 per cent last quarter in line with pre-pandemic levels. “That’s really because of the effects of the stimulus and the forbearance that comes through.”

Lenders argue that new targeting tools and data analytics have made it easier to lend through a downturn without taking outsized losses.

Many lenders now analyse factors such as education employment history and checking account balances in addition to the traditional credit score to determine creditworthiness which increases the pool of potential borrowers said Megan Cipperly senior director of client services at Competiscan.

Incentives such as rate discounts for setting up automatic payments or making several consecutive on-time payments are also becoming more popular for unsecured loans.

“It reduces their chance of having delinquencies and then it creates a positive customer-lender relationship” Cipperly said. “That’s a great strategy if we’re heading into a recession.”

Your little goblin may be getting bags of pennies from your neighbors when they trick or treat this Oct. 31.

Hershey the big candy maker issued a warning this week that said a possible candy shortage may affect your Halloween pickings. The big concern is the shortage of raw ingredients which will cause a major candy capacity problem.

The shortage is a result of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine where restrictions have been made on Russian gas and oil imports which are specifically hurting the German import of supplies that aren’t going to make it to Pennsylvania and the world’s fifth largest candy maker.

According to an article in the Washington Post candy has seen an 11% gain in share in 2021 with an amazing $37 billion dollars in confectionary sales revenue.

The increase in candy sales across the board coupled with the lack of supplies coming from Europe have put a big stress on shelves now selling candy. Candy makers are at “all hands on deck” mode to keep the shelves stocked three full months before Halloween.

The Halloween scare at Hersey’s and Mars is very real. Not only is there a problem in Europe but here in the states there is a milk shortage that will add to the problems that candy makers are trying to ward off. The milk shortage is a result of one of the Borden Dairies' production facilities permanently closing its doors in Chicago. Borden Dairies has one of the country’s largest milk production plants. This closing in Chicago will affect mostly Illinois and Wisconsin retailers but those retailers are spreading out to get dairy deliveries outside their states to keep up the demand which will put more of a strain on the national market.

All in all we have three months to see how this shakes out. Hopefully it will be a Happy Halloween with lots of candy for your little trick-or-treaters and you too!

Garrett Hardin after a foot chase.

Brooks family attorney Sadiyah Evangelista Karriem said the 47-year-old was shot near where his head and neck met per the HuffPost.

The family is seeking an investigation by the Department of Justice for Brooks’ death on allegations of police brutality and misuse of force.

The footage released by the Harris County Sheriff’s Office only tells part of the story according to the Brooks family.

Demetria Brooks the victim’s sister said that the deputy hit Brooks several times which is not in the department’s footage.

“The world needs to see what they are doing. In this case they are not showing everything” she said. “What gives you the right to take someone’s life by shooting them in the back of the head and neck?”

A Dollar General employee initially called 911 after Brooks allegedly pushed her arm as he stole from the store.

Per audio from the call the clerk told dispatchers that she didn’t believe the 47-year-old posed an immediate threat to officers.

“I just want him to get arrested because he is literally running to the back of the building right now” she said.

Another alleged witness called 911 twice claiming that a man had “pushed a lady down” as he left the store with laundry detergent.

Footage released by the sheriff’s office shows Hardin hitting Brooks with his stun gun and pinning him to the ground. Brooks then grabs the officer’s Taser.

After shouting “I am going to shoot you. Put that down! I will f***ing shoot you!” Hardin opened fire against Brooks.

“The Taser issue is a red herring and if you see the video he grabs the Taser but he releases it multiple times” Justin Moore another Brooks family attorney told HuffPost. “He never grabs it and points it at the officer. He tried to get it to stop electrocuting him.”

The family’s legal team is looking to file a lawsuit against the Harris County Sheriff’s Office and the deputy.

Hardin is currently on paid administrative leave as the department investigates the fatal shooting.

""We're seeing in the [Sam’s] Club channel that the traffic has been remarkably resilient"" Jefferies Analyst Stephanie Wissink told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""One of the strongest customer acquisition tools for them is gasoline. And when gas prices spike that tends to be a net beneficiary to traffic to their pumps.""

Those gas deals paid off in the first quarter: Sam's Club proved to be a bright spot in Walmart's earnings touting 10.2% sales growth from the previous year. Over that time period the price of gas increased from $3.41 per gallon at the beginning of the quarter to $4.14 per gallon according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

""Regardless of what your consumer income profile looks like we know that even the high-income [consumer] loves to find a way to value-hack the system"" Wissink said ""and gas tends to be the way that the Club channel does that.""

Consumers have been pinched by higher costs for necessities as elevated oil prices disrupted supply chains and greater operational expenses for businesses exacerbate inflation. All of the Consumer Price Index spending categories outpaced nominal wages according to the Atlanta Fed's wage growth tracker.

Against this backdrop wholesale retailers have been vying for new members by catering to consumers through cash-back on gas purchases inflation-bucking hot dogs rewards curbside pick-up and free shipping.

The dash for deals during economic uncertainty isn't atypical when compared to past cycles. Historical data from e-commerce platform Boxed found that during previous economic contractions customers actively sought out more value for their money.

""What a consumer did in prior downturns they really kind of traded down or up"" Chieh Huang co-founder and CEO of Boxed told Yahoo Finance in May. ""They'll trade down to a dollar store. They'll trade down to a hard discounter. The folks who can afford it will actually trade up in quantity because if you're buying more if you're buying in bulk you're going to save a little bit of money.""

Target CEO Brian Cornell was one of the first retail industry executives to publicly acknowledge that he was beginning to see customers trade down to private label products.

While consumers trading down in discretionary spending can signal a profit squeeze for big-box retailers dollar store chains like Dollar Tree and Dollar General may experience increased volume. And as Huang mentioned bulk buying poses a prospective boon to membership clubs such as Sam's Club Costco and BJ's Wholesale.

Story continues

""Broadly we would say [Sam's] Club is still an outlier to the positive"" Wissink said. ""Bulk-buying can actually be a way to save.""

The video starts off with the user Autumn (@slug_whisperer) saying “shoutout to Winners for sticking a Kate Spade sticker on these plates and bowls” as she shows blue and black plates and bowls. On them a Kate Spade sticker is plastered on them with the price on the back reading “$9.99” and “$19.99.” According to Autumn those were the same plates and bowls she purchased three years ago from Dollar Tree for $1.25 and she revealed the same ones in her cabinets.

The video was viewed over 460000 times since it was posted on July 25. There were alleged former and current employees of Winners who confirmed in the comments section that the Kate Spade stickers were fake. Several speculated the creator had probably uncovered a fraudulent return.

“I work at winners it was just a fraud return and no one caught it it happens a lot but the frontline ppl and floor workers should pay closer attention” one person commented.

“I used to work there they were definitely fraudulent returns and the cashier didn’t pay attention before printing a new tag for them” a second agreed.

“[Where] I worked the manager said that no return should ever be turned away. Every person must leave the store happy. Those are even reprint stickers” a third said.

“You likely uncovered return fraud. I used to work at TJX and this happened all the time because they don’t actually have an inventory” another viewer explained. “They accept returns without a receipt. I had to accept returns of chairs from over a year with bugs in it once!”

There were others who claimed they bought those same bowls and plates from Dollar Tree.

“Oh my God I was just going to say I got those bowls at dollar tree” one user shared.

“Those are legit from the dollar tree in America. I have those dishes” another said.

The Daily Dot reached out to Autumn for comment via TikTok comment and Winners via website contact form.

One frugal mom shared a budget-friendly recipe she said can feed up to eight people for less than $10.

1 TikTok user Rebecca Chabot made a meal for $10 after a trip to Dollar Tree

Rebecca Chabot who goes by dollartreedinners on TikTok posts grocery hauls and affordable dinner ideas to an audience of 220000 followers.

She shared a chicken parmesan pasta recipe that she made using ingredients from Dollar Tree in a recent video.

Everything Rebecca purchased was just $1.25 and she picked up the following items:

One box of pasta

One jar of pasta sauce

One jar of parmesan

Two blocks of mozzarella

Three bags of chicken nuggets

She made the meal by boiling the pasta and adding the tomato sauce once it was ready.

Next Rebecca cooked the chicken nuggets in an air fryer until they were golden brown and sliced the cooked chicken into quarters.

She then shredded the mozzarella cheese before layering the pasta chicken and cheese together in a glass baking dish.

To finish the dinner Rebecca covered the dish in tin foil and popped it in her oven for 20 minutes at 420 degrees then removed the foil and baked it for another 10 minutes.

""I don't even like chicken parmesan but I thought this pasta was really good"" Rebecca said after trying the meal.

Rebecca also added that families could swap one bag of chicken for a serving of Dollar Tree garlic bread which also costs $1.25.

With enough food to serve six to eight people she estimated the meal cost between $1.25 and $1.67 per serving.

Your little goblin may be getting bags of pennies from your neighbors when they trick or treat this Oct. 31.

Hershey the big candy maker issued a warning this week that said a possible candy shortage may affect your Halloween pickings. The big concern is the shortage of raw ingredients which will cause a major candy capacity problem.

The shortage is a result of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine where restrictions have been made on Russian gas and oil imports which are specifically hurting the German import of supplies that aren’t going to make it to Pennsylvania and the world’s fifth largest candy maker.

According to an article in the Washington Post candy has seen an 11% gain in share in 2021 with an amazing $37 billion dollars in confectionary sales revenue.

The increase in candy sales across the board coupled with the lack of supplies coming from Europe have put a big stress on shelves now selling candy. Candy makers are at “all hands on deck” mode to keep the shelves stocked three full months before Halloween.

The Halloween scare at Hersey’s and Mars is very real. Not only is there a problem in Europe but here in the states there is a milk shortage that will add to the problems that candy makers are trying to ward off. The milk shortage is a result of one of the Borden Dairies' production facilities permanently closing its doors in Chicago. Borden Dairies has one of the country’s largest milk production plants. This closing in Chicago will affect mostly Illinois and Wisconsin retailers but those retailers are spreading out to get dairy deliveries outside their states to keep up the demand which will put more of a strain on the national market.

All in all we have three months to see how this shakes out. Hopefully it will be a Happy Halloween with lots of candy for your little trick-or-treaters and you too!

""We're seeing in the [Sam’s] Club channel that the traffic has been remarkably resilient"" Jefferies Analyst Stephanie Wissink told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""One of the strongest customer acquisition tools for them is gasoline. And when gas prices spike that tends to be a net beneficiary to traffic to their pumps.""

Those gas deals paid off in the first quarter: Sam's Club proved to be a bright spot in Walmart's earnings touting 10.2% sales growth from the previous year. Over that time period the price of gas increased from $3.41 per gallon at the beginning of the quarter to $4.14 per gallon according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

""Regardless of what your consumer income profile looks like we know that even the high-income [consumer] loves to find a way to value-hack the system"" Wissink said ""and gas tends to be the way that the Club channel does that.""

Consumers have been pinched by higher costs for necessities as elevated oil prices disrupted supply chains and greater operational expenses for businesses exacerbate inflation. All of the Consumer Price Index spending categories outpaced nominal wages according to the Atlanta Fed's wage growth tracker.

Against this backdrop wholesale retailers have been vying for new members by catering to consumers through cash-back on gas purchases inflation-bucking hot dogs rewards curbside pick-up and free shipping.

The dash for deals during economic uncertainty isn't atypical when compared to past cycles. Historical data from e-commerce platform Boxed found that during previous economic contractions customers actively sought out more value for their money.

""What a consumer did in prior downturns they really kind of traded down or up"" Chieh Huang co-founder and CEO of Boxed told Yahoo Finance in May. ""They'll trade down to a dollar store. They'll trade down to a hard discounter. The folks who can afford it will actually trade up in quantity because if you're buying more if you're buying in bulk you're going to save a little bit of money.""

Target CEO Brian Cornell was one of the first retail industry executives to publicly acknowledge that he was beginning to see customers trade down to private label products.

While consumers trading down in discretionary spending can signal a profit squeeze for big-box retailers dollar store chains like Dollar Tree and Dollar General may experience increased volume. And as Huang mentioned bulk buying poses a prospective boon to membership clubs such as Sam's Club Costco and BJ's Wholesale.

Story continues

""Broadly we would say [Sam's] Club is still an outlier to the positive"" Wissink said. ""Bulk-buying can actually be a way to save.""

The name they gave themselves seemed fitting as they cheered one another on through a reception held in their honor at the center Friday evening where they discussed the program and gave the audience an overview of their accomplishments.

The internships are the first of their kind in the country said the center’s executive director Mozine Lowe.

(The interns are: Ma’Chiya Arrington a rising senior at Halifax County Early College; Rakeya Brinkley a rising senior at Halifax County Early College; Anyah Brown a graduate of Northwest who will be attending St. Augustine’s University; Jamiya Cabiness a Warren County High School graduate who will be attending UNC-Greensboro; Mihkayla Hammie a rising senior at Weldon High School; Jaslyn McKinney a rising senior at Halifax County Early College; Zakeiryh Perry a Northwest graduate who will be attending UNC-G; Mikayla Watson a rising senior at Roanoke Rapids Early College; Janine Williams a rising senior at Halifax County Early College; and Shamyra Wright a rising senior at KIPP Pride High)

“These 10 girls they have made history” Lowe said. “This is the very first program for women in solar young girls of color. The industry is growing at a tremendous rate. It is coming to Halifax County. There are so many jobs that are available to any and everyone. You have to know that the jobs are out there and you have to know the people that have the jobs that are out there.”

Lowe said the 10 girls have had a tremendous experience. “They were first of all identified by their academic leaders in the community. They were deliberately selected to be part of the Young Women in Solar at the Center for Energy Education.”

Lowe said the program received strong funding from well-established solar companies — Duke Energy Geenex Solar Engie EDF Renewables Roanoke Electric and many other associations.

The goal of the program Lowe said was for the girls to meet high-level leaders in companies. “We wanted them to sit in their board rooms. We wanted them to talk to them about their jobs their careers how they managed to be at the top of their jobs.”

She said the organizers wanted the girls to ask these leaders what they were doing to make it possible for girls of color to have jobs in these companies.

The internship took the girls to Geenex in Charlotte North Carolina A&T State University North Carolina Central University and the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington. “We wanted the company leaders to meet them to get to know them to consider being their mentors next summer.”

Lowe said this will not be the last opportunity. “With the partnerships with the local schools we hope to continue this program throughout the school year.”

And the journey for the Radiant Rays doesn’t end with the internship. They have been talking with a videographer in London who is creating a film about the girls. “He is telling their story to the world because they’re very unique. It’s just amazing how these 10 young women have embraced all of this newness — coming to the center learning about clean energy meeting company leaders going to Dominion Energy into the dam. It’s just amazing. They went to Howard University. We tried to give them the opportunity to see as many universities to meet company leaders and just to know what the world is like.”

The plan going forward Lowe said is for the 10 girls to become Center for Energy Education ambassadors and to meet once a month. “We have big plans.”

There is a Solar Fest event coming up on October 6 where the girls will be featured as presenters.

The North Carolina State University Clean Energy Technology Center has plans for the girls to present at the 2023 Energy Conference. “I want you to know that they have done some tremendous things and I realize that it was through your support and the support of the schools that this was possible” Lowe said. “Companies are really interested in them and following their career path and there’s just so much more to come.”

In her welcoming remarks Brown said “For the last five weeks me and my sisters have been networking and meeting new people in renewable energy careers and traveling to different colleges.”

In her remote message to the students and the audience Rita L. Joyner a senior advisor for the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association said “I’m so proud of the young ladies and their achievements.”

Joyner’s message focused on a three-point plan for success. “You must dream with your eyes open” she said. “I want you to spend time with yourself and explore your possibilities.”

She advised the students to write out their goals. “Write with detail. What will it look like? What will it feel like … and use all of your senses as you’re writing down your plan.”

The third point Joyner said is to achieve those dreams. “Work at it until your definition of success is accomplished.”

Jim Harris director of land development for Geenex said “This is Geenex’s dream. This was George Veit’s and Mozine Lowe’s dream to bring a center for energy education to the area to help the communities that we work in.”

Harris said “What’s impressive about these young ladies here is their taking advantage of that vision. It is so wonderful to see a community come together and support these young women. It is so wonderful that I get to work with a company that sees that vision.”

Afterward Wright said “One thing I learned is that networking is very important because sometimes it’s not about what you know but who you know.”

Said Cabiness: “The takeaway I got from this is it’s a great opportunity and my generation will be the generation to right the wrongs.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpbG90b25saW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzMwL3NvbGFyLWZhcm0td2l0aC1lbm91Z2gtcG93ZXItZm9yLTIwMDAtaG9tZXMtcHJvcG9zZWQtZm9yLWNhbXBvc3RlbGxhLWxhbmRmaWxsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar farm with enough power for 2000 homes proposed for Campostella Landfill,"An old landfill in the Berkley-Campostella neighborhood could become a solar farm with enough energy to power more than 2000 homes.

The city is in discussions with Community Power Group a Washington solar company to redevelop the 59-acre site after a months-long bidding process according to company officials.

“We’re super excited about the prospect of this” Community Power president Mike Borkowski said. “We’re trying to use every inch of that land which can’t be used for anything else.”

The city of Norfolk is proposing to build a solar farm on the long-defunct Campostella landfill in Norfolk’s southside. The solar farm would be 8 megawatts enough to power 2000 homes. As seen Friday July 29 2022.

The Campostella Landfill on Norfolk’s southside is behind the Diggs Town public housing development. The city started dumping construction and demolition debris there in 1944 according to previous Pilot reporting. It was closed in the 1990s.

Borkowski said the company plans to build an 8-megawatt solar farm on the site.

More than half of the project will become a “community solar garden” a facility that sells its power to local residential and commercial customers at a discount Borkowski said. The rest of the energy would go to Dominion Energy to distribute to its customers at large he said.

“The city of Norfolk really couldn’t have picked a better spot to do this to help out the members of their community” Borkowski said.

NEWBERRY S.C. — Newberry County Memorial Hospital has partnered with Newberry College to bring a new health clinic to the area. The site which will be located at the corner of Evans and College streets will provide medical attention to students at the college and those in the community.

""It's just going to be great for our community as the community continues to grow as the college continues to grow"" said Chief Nursing Officer Meg Davis. ""It's a win-win situation for employees staffing for the students and for the community as we know sometimes it's a struggle getting into a doctor's office quickly when you're sick.""

David added that having students working with patients at this clinic can also help them in the hospital.

""The last two years have been horrific with staffing with nursing so we're looking to expand nursing opportunities but expand beyond that there are many non-clinical areas and needs that we have staffing need as well so working with Newberry College to expand"" she said.

Newberry College Dean of Nursing Jerry Alewine said this will provide real-time experience.

""It's also going to provide the nursing students at Newberry College to have an additional experiential site where they can treat patients directly"" Alewine said.

This cofferdam is part of work Dominion Energy is doing to remove 100-year-old toxic tar from the river bottom. This month Dominion completed the first stage — getting the dam set up. Crews are continuing to reinforce the dam with tarps and concrete mats.

Congaree Riverkeeper Bill Stangler said he expects reinforcements to take five to six weeks with closer to three years for the entire cleanup. Eventually they will drain the area enclosed by the dam and then clean tar from the exposed river bottom.

""There's a lot more that needs to happen"" Stangler said. ""This is just the very beginning of what's going to be a long process. But it is great to see it coming together.""

In the meantime the Senate Street river landing will remain closed but the surrounding river will not be affected.

Crews will have to drain the area within the dam — about 2.5 acres of the river — and another smaller area downstream. A second dam which will enclose about half an acre will begin construction after the first is complete Dominion spokesperson Matt Long said in an email.

The cleanup has been a decade in the making. In 2010 a kayaker discovered the tar which can contain cancer-causing chemicals and skin irritants. Since then Stangler and other environmentalists have been trying to get the tar out of the water.

Stangler said he often watches the work from the Gervais Street Bridge and has taken his canoe out to get a closer look at the cofferdam.

""It's impressive work and it's going to get more interesting as they start digging and hauling stuff out of there"" he said.

Plans to transform a former high street bank into a Domino’s pizza have been given the green light despite concerns there’d be too many takeaways in town.

The proposals put forward by the Pegasus group will see the former Santander Bank in Market Street Ashby turned into a Domino’s in the coming months. The plans received a less than enthusiastic response from the public when they were first touted with some believing a charity shop would be a better option for the town. Others feared that Ashby was being overwhelmed with fast food outlets.

Concerns that Domino’s wasn’t in keeping with Ashby’s image were also raised but planners at North West Leicestershire District Council (NWLDC) believed the project would benefit the town’s economy.

The Grade II listed building has been empty since Santander departed Ashby last summer. The empty site sits just metres away from Italian restaurant Zamani’s too - something residents feared would affect its trade. However the Pegasus Group believed their plans would “enhance” Ashby and end the sight of “dead frontage” in the town.

“The site is a long term vacant unit and is therefore creating a dead frontage and does not generate any activity or footfall at the site. The proposal would result in the reoccupation of the unit [...] improving the footfall and providing new job opportunities. As such it would enhance the vitality and viability of the area” they said.

The closeness to Zamani’s and other Italian restaurants in town was also raised in planning documents but the Pegasus Group said Domino’s was a takeaway and would not affect others’ trade.

“The closest hot food takeaway to this site is The Fish Inn located at 85A Market Street. The takeaway is located approximately 240m to the north east of the site and therefore the proposals will not result in an intensification of hot food takeaways in this location” they said.

Planners at NWLDC agreed saying that the proposal would not create “a cluster of takeaways” in Ashby.

“Although there are restaurants offering takeaway services in the immediate vicinity of the site along Market Street these establishments would be considered a restaurant therefore not contributing to the number of hot food takeaways” they said in their report.

Concerns had also been raised initially by NWLDC’s Conservation Officer about Pegasus’ plans to remove partition walls inside the former bank and add grey vinyl to the exterior of the listed building but resubmitted proposals removed these ideas with officers approving the idea.

Planning officers said Domino's would make a “positive contribution” to the variety of shops on Market Street and be of benefit to the local economy.

Officials also noted the boost to the town’s economy Domino’s would bring. They said: “The proposal would result in economic benefits by contributing to the local economy particularly in the evenings when nearby shops and cafes are closed.”

DOW,Dow,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzdHJhdmVsLm9yZy9uZXdzL2hlYXJ0ZmVsdC1nb29kYnllLXJvZ2VyLWRvd9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Heartfelt Goodbye to Roger Dow,"Today the U.S. Travel Association says a heartfelt goodbye to Roger Dow who is stepping down from his role as president and CEO after 17 incredible years.

Roger joined U.S. Travel in 2005 following a successful 34-year career at Marriott International. Though Roger often joked that he had no experience in lobbying prior to taking on the job as travel’s top advocate his sharp business acumen vast network of contacts and decades of experience created a lasting impact on the U.S. travel industry.

His leadership complemented by an abiding sense of optimism was essential in guiding the industry through numerous challenges over the years from the post-9/11 travel slump to the COVID-19 pandemic. Roger was a steady voice of resilience in each of these moments none more so than by rallying the industry to ensure all sectors of travel received the necessary relief to survive the pandemic and keep workers on payrolls. His role in reopening international inbound air travel and repealing the pre-departure COVID testing requirement was a turning point in the industry’s recovery.

Roger’s ability to unite the industry at such a critical time was a direct result of the decades of trust built with our members. His unique capacity to connect with others forge relationships and mentor the next generation of leaders proved invaluable. It was thanks to Roger’s vision and strong relationships that so many new and diverse organizations teamed up with our industry under the Let’s Go There campaign strengthening travel’s voice in its most urgent moment of need.

Throughout his time at U.S. Travel Roger’s forward-thinking approach resulted in significant legislative victories including the establishment and renewal of Brand USA. Due to these efforts—as well as his oversight of U.S. Travel’s IPW trade show and the addition of more than a dozen nations to the Visa Waiver Program—inbound travel to the U.S. has increased 61% during Roger’s tenure.

And speaking of IPW…Roger is not just a staple of the U.S. travel industry but an icon of the global travel community. Anyone who has ever walked a trade show floor with him knows the respect and admiration that our international delegates have for Roger. The energy and productivity of IPW is a testament to his longstanding efforts to elevate the importance of professional meetings and events and the value of conducting business face to face. For his final IPW as head of the association this year delegates from around the world came together to show their appreciation for Roger and his countless contributions to our industry.

But perhaps most importantly Roger has been a tireless advocate of the power of travel and its capacity to bring people together. Roger’s belief that travel can break down barriers connect those of different backgrounds and open our eyes to new and treasured experiences is the ethos of our industry; that the true value of travel is not calculated in dollars but in the cherished memories that are made when we explore this great country and all that it has to offer.

As we say goodbye to Roger we’d like to end on one of his favorite quotes from Mark Twain the essence of which is at the very heart of the industry he has led for 17 years:

“Travel is fatal to prejudice bigotry and narrow-mindedness.”

Thank you Roger for everything.

-U.S. Travel Association Staff",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA3LzMwL2hvdy1kb2VzLXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1wZXJmb3JtLWR1cmluZy1yZWNlc3Npb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Does the Stock Market Perform During a Recession? Here's What History Shows,"There's bad news -- but some good news too.

We're probably already in a recession. The U.S. economy contracted for the second consecutive quarter with the gross domestic product (GDP) falling 0.9% in Q2 after a 1.6% decline in Q1. Having two quarters in a row of GDP declines is widely viewed as the beginning of a recession.

Officially though the U.S. won't be in a recession until eight economists say so. These economists serve on the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee.

Investors won't wait until the official declaration of a recession to worry about the stock market. But how does the market perform during a recession? Here's what history shows.

An ugly chart

The S&P 500 doesn't fully represent the entire stock market. It only includes 500 of the biggest publicly traded companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. However the S&P 500 has long been viewed as a good proxy for the overall market. And since the index has been around for 65 years it gives us a way to look at how the stock market has performed in most post-World War II recessions.

There have been 10 official U.S. recessions since the S&P 500 was established in 1957. The following chart shows how the index fared during those periods.

The worst S&P 500 decline occurred during the Great Recession which began in December 2007 and went through June 2009. The index plunged as much as 55% below its previous peak in March 2009.

However that was a much more severe recession than normal. The average S&P 500 decline during post-World War II recessions is around 29%. This average is skewed though in part due to the especially steep sell-off during the Great Recession. The median decline is around 24%.

Unsurprisingly the S&P 500 has always dropped during a recession. Many companies report lower earnings as consumers tighten their purse strings. Investors often react negatively to any bad news.

The best performance for the S&P 500 during a recession was a 20% decline in 1990. That recession was a short one lasting only eight months.

Two important details

There are two important details related to how the S&P 500 has performed during recessions. First in many cases the index declined significantly well before the official start of the recession. Second the S&P 500 frequently began to rebound well before the end of the recession.

The S&P 500's decline before the start of a recession makes sense. Investors tend to be forward-looking. Most recessions don't come out of the blue although the COVID-19 recession of 2020 was an outlier.

Investors usually see the signs of a potential recession well before one is officially declared and often become more cautious in advance. This risk-averse psychology can impact stocks before a recession hits.

But this same forward-looking mentality also helps stocks to begin recovering before recessions officially end. Again the economic improvement that leads to the ending of a recession doesn't usually happen overnight.

Investors watch for hints that a turnaround could be on the way. When they see positive indicators they begin buying stocks more aggressively. This often causes a bandwagon effect with even more investors jumping into the stock market.

Reasons for optimism

Looking at the past performance of the S&P 500 should give investors reasons to be cautiously optimistic right now. The index is currently down around 18% and was more than 20% below its previous peak just a few weeks ago. There's not much more room to fall for the S&P 500 to reach the median level of decline during a recession.

More importantly the S&P 500 has bounced back sharply after every recession we've had. And it often began a major rebound well before the end of the recession.

This bodes well for long-term investors. The current market downturn should provide an excellent buying opportunity for anyone with the patience to hold on for a few years. That's true whether a recession is really on the way or not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbWlkamlwaW9uZWVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZ2VuZXJhdGlvbnMtMTk2MHMtYmhzLWF0aGxldGVzLXJlbWluaXNjZS1hYm91dC10aGUtZ2xvcnktZGF5cy1vZi1iYXNrZXRiYWxs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GENERATIONS: 1960s BHS athletes reminisce about the glory days of basketball,"On a perfect summer’s day 16 former Bemidji High School athletes gather on the patio outside Ruttger’s to remember share thoughts and spend time with old friends. There are hearty handshakes happy greetings and even a few manly embraces.

For the past four years Jerry Phillips (BHS class of 1964) and Larry Higgins (1961) have invited interested BHS athletes from the 1960s to get together and reminisce about the heydays of BHS basketball and other highlights of their high school careers.

This year the group met during the All School Reunion with guests from as far away as Kansas and Florida.

I am a “fly on the wall” here to observe listen in and record what I can of the conversations. There is preliminary chatter about upcoming events for the reunion and a lot of recounting of basketball memories from the 1960s.

After handshakes and greetings have been exchanged and everyone has found a place to sit Higgins hands out three-ring binders of the history of 100 years of BHS basketball from 1896-1996.

Inside are short pieces from guest writers Bun Fortier (coach) Jim Carrington (Pioneer sports writer) Higgins (athlete) and his mother Barbara (fan). Higgins has spent a lot of time searching through old microfilm collecting organizing and printing newspaper articles and yearbook pages about a century of BHS basketball.

He hands me a copy too which is now on display at the Beltrami County Historical Center. One highlight is the 1936 state championship story and photo of the BHS champs their first-ever state title — first not only in basketball but in any sport.

Flipping through the binder inspires discussions with play-by-play details from crucial games — the memories of which are as clear as if they happened yesterday instead of 60-some years ago.

There are stories about buzzer-beating game-winning shots and shots that could have won games but didn’t; changes over the years in rules style strategies and coaching; stories about speeches given one-point losses fouls not called incredible shots made free throws missed and bad ref calls that still sting.

An 8-by-10-inch photo is passed around and picks the scab off an old wound from the 1961 state championship game between Bemidji and Duluth Central when Bemidji’s Lee Fawbush launched a shot that could’ve won the game and was hit by a Duluth player as the shot was released but no foul was called. Duluth won 51-50.

That sports moment was notorious enough to be recounted in a March 27 2022 Minneapolis Star Tribune story about a reunion of players from Minnesota’s one-class high school basketball teams from 1960-1970. Higgins was at that event and shared copies of the story with his old teammates at the Bemidji gathering.

Bits of conversations fly around the table — enough for these guys to spur sports memories but not enough for me the fly to grasp: “That Richfield game …” “… only two seniors on the team that year…” “… concession stand…” “Last shot … ball in the air … would win if it went in…” “North vs. South …” “…dribbling right-handed switched to left.

Bun told him not to…” “Ranked #1 in state …” “… played six years on that team …” “… sudden death overtime” “… Ada … 35-point win during the year … got beat at regions by 1 point 51-50!” “… game against Crookston five seconds to go … at the line for free throws … Bemidji wins!!” “Bob Glas got the ball put it up won the game …”

Later I flip through the pages of a scrapbook lent to me by Jim Neuenfeldt (class of 1962). Articles clipped and saved inside fill in a few blanks for me. There’s an undated story about Bemidji beating Crookston 47-46 after what coach Bun Fortier called a “dandy” play by Bob Glas.

A clipped story in the scrapbook “Bemidji Wins in Thriller” describes the tense final minutes of that game in which “the Lumberjacks (fought) an uphill contest most of the way (including) the last 40 seconds when Bemidji tied the score on two rim-hanging free throws by Jerry Strowbridge for a 44-44 tie.”

Crookston got lucky nine seconds later to put them up by two. “Then” the story continues “it was Glas’ turn. He took the ball on a pass near center court with time running out and on a hanging layup which he sailed several feet through the air just barely curled the ball through the nets” and was fouled on the play. After a time-out Glas “calmly sank the free throw for the game-winning point.”

The colorful description by an unnamed “special correspondent” fleshes out the story for me. I can see why this one has been locked in their memories for 60-odd years. Higgins awards a 1960 Region 8 runners-up trophy to Bobby Glas who is not at the gathering but whose brother Rich (class of 1966) is and is entrusted with delivering the award.

The server stops by to take lunch orders. I’ve been the fly on the wall long enough. These guys are re-living the glory days of basketball and why not?

Jerry Phillips sums it up well: “You spend a lot of time with your teammates —- school lockerroom games bus rides. Ray Kavanagh (former history teacher and football coach at BHS) once told me nobody ever came back to him asking to see the 2nd quarter history test but they want to see an old game film.”

Jim Neuenfeldt laughingly refers to himself and the others as “has-beens” but what good are games and friends and teammates if you can’t share memories together six decades later? The camaraderie celebrated here is as priceless as the times that built those memories.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHA6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kY2hpY2Fnby5jb20vbmV3cy8zNjc0NS9pbi1tZW1vcmlhbS11bnB1Ymxpc2hlZC1leGNsdXNpdmUtcGhvdG8tb2YtY2hpbGQtc3Rhci10b255LWRvd9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In Memoriam: Unpublished Exclusive Photo of Child Star Tony Dow,"Average: Select rating Cancel rating Poor Okay Good Great Awesome Average: 5 ( 1 vote)

The television show left the airwaves in 1963.

Fox News Digital confirmed Tony Dow one of the show’s main stars died Wednesday at age 77.

""Although this is a very sad day I have comfort and peace that he is in a better place"" his son Christopher shared in a Facebook statement announcing his father's death.

Here's a look back at the show's beloved cast:

‘LEAVE IT TO BEAVER’ STAR JERRY MATHERS REACTS TO CO-STAR KEN OSMOND’S DEATH: ‘I WILL GREATLY MISS HIM’

Jerry Mathers – Theodore ‘Beaver’ Cleaver

Jerry Mathers took on the title role of Theodore ""Beaver"" Cleaver during the entirety of the show. He also appeared in ""The New Leave It to Beaver"" from 1983 until 1989.

Since the show ended Mathers’ life has been normal by Hollywood standards. He attended school played football and joined the track team. He then enlisted in the Air Force followed by the National Guard.

Mathers has previously said he remained in touch with his TV family.

""We’ve had reunions"" he said. ""It’s probably more like how you are with people you went to school with. If anything important happens in their lives or with their grandchildren — because we all have grandchildren now — we reach out. And when someone marries. And sadly when someone passes. Whoever finds out first calls the rest of us.""

Mathers 74 was diagnosed In 1997 with diabetes which completely altered his life. He was told he would only have 3-5 years to live.

""I was living the good life"" Mathers told Fox News Digital in 2017. ""I had side businesses and one of them was a catering business. And I was doing a lot of motion picture and television catering for crews which is for about 100-200 people. It’s like setting up a whole restaurant.

""I was around food all the time and I was a very good cook. Of course that entailed sitting down with people. So I was sometimes eating 5-6 full meals a day… I was making a lot of money everything was going great and everyone around me was at least as fat as I was.""

Mathers was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes high blood pressure and bad cholesterol. He didn’t need much convincing to turn his life around and shed 55 pounds.

After his diagnoses he led lectures across the country to warn listeners about the disease and how it can be prevented.

Following Dow's death Wednesday Mathers told Fox News Digital in part ""He was always the kindest most generous gentle loving sincere and humble man that it was my honor and privilege to be able to share memories together with for 65 years.""

Tony Dow – Wally Cleaver

Tony Dow who portrayed Wally Cleaver on the sitcom died Wednesday at 77. His son Christopher confirmed his passing to Fox News Digital.

TONY DOW 'LEAVE IT TO BEAVER' STAR DEAD AT 77 SON CONFIRMS: 'HE IS IN A BETTER PLACE'

""He was the best Dad anyone could ask for"" Christopher said in a Facebook statement. ""He was my coach my mentor my voice of reason my best friend my best man in my wedding and my hero. My wife said something powerful and shows the kind of man he was. She said: ‘Tony was such a kind man. He had such a huge heart and I’ve never heard Tony say a bad or negative thing about anyone.'""

In May Dow's wife Lauren Shulkind announced Dow's cancer had returned just a month after he celebrated his 77th birthday.

Dow starred in ""Leave It to Beaver"" for six seasons on CBS before it switched to ABC. The actor participated in the reunion show ""Still the Beaver"" and the show’s sequel series ""The New Leave It to Beaver.""

Dow was also known for his roles on ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" and ""Babylon 5.""

Barbara Billingsley – June Cleaver

Barbara Billingsley played June Cleaver ""Beaver"" Cleaver’s on-screen mom. Billingsley died in 2010 after suffering from a rheumatoid disease. She was 94.

""We knew we were making a good show because it was so well written"" Billingsley said in 1994. ""But we had no idea what was ahead. People still talk about it and write letters telling how much they watch it today with their children and grandchildren.""

After ""Leave it to Beaver"" left the air in 1963 Billingsley largely disappeared from public view for several years. She resurfaced in 1980 in a hilarious cameo in ""Airplane!""

She returned as June Cleaver in a 1983 TV movie ""Still the Beaver"" that co-starred Mathers and Dow and portrayed a much darker side of Beaver's life. In 1997 Universal made a ""Leave it to Beaver"" theatrical film with a new generation of actors. Billingsley returned for a cameo however as Aunt Martha.

In later years she appeared from time to time in such TV series as ""Murphy Brown"" ""Empty Nest"" and ""Baby Boom"" and had a memorable comic turn opposite fellow TV moms June Lockhart of ""Lassie"" and Isabel Sanford of ""The Jeffersons"" on the ""Roseanne"" show.

Hugh Beaumont – Ward Cleaver

Hugh Beaumont took on the role as Ward Cleaver ""Beaver’s"" father in the hit series. In 1982 Beaumont died at age 73. At the time of his death The New York Times reported he suffered a heart attack while in Germany where he was visiting his eldest son who was teaching psychology.

After ""Leave It to Beaver"" came to an end Beaumont kept busy acting. He took on roles in ""Studio 57"" and he also wrote screenplays and short stories and even operated a Christmas tree farm.

Despite the show’s success Beaumont wasn’t fazed by fame. In fact when cameras stopped rolling he found comfort in his family and the great outdoors.

His daughter Kristen Beaumont spoke to Closer Weekly in 2020 and described the beloved patriarch as a man who ""loved poetry"" possessed ""an infectious laugh"" and considered the family’s annual trip to Minnesota the high point of the year.

During his later years Beaumont lived in Minnesota. He suffered a stroke in 1970 and did little acting after that.

Ken Osmond – Eddie Haskell

As a child Ken Osmond took on the role of Eddie Haskell in ""Leave It to Beaver.""

In 2020 Osmond died of cardiopulmonary arrest. He also had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which obstructs airflow from the lungs. He died at 76 in his Los Angeles home surrounded by family.

‘LEAVE IT TO BEAVER’ STAR JERRY MATHERS REACTS TO CO-STAR KEN OSMOND’S DEATH: ‘I WILL GREATLY MISS HIM’

The Glendale California native started his career at age 4 working in commercials and as a film extra. At age 9 he got his first speaking role in the movie ""So Big"" Variety reported. He went on to appear in ""Good Morning Miss Dove"" ""Everything But the Truth"" ""The Loretta Young Show"" ""The Walter Winchell File"" ""Fury"" ""Lassie"" and ""Wagon Train"" among others.

The actor starred in ""Leave It to Beaver"" from 1957 to 1963. Osmond's part as the two-faced teenage scoundrel Haskell was only supposed to be a one-off guest appearance. However he did so well in his portrayal — and the show's producers and its audience found him so memorable — that he became a regular appearing in nearly 100 of the show's 234 episodes.

Eddie was the best friend of Tony Dow's Wally. He constantly kissed up to adults and kicked down at his peers usually in the same scene and was the closest thing the wholesome show had to a villain. Viewers of all ages loved to hate him.

Babcock Ranch jumped 4 spots since the end of 2021 when it claimed No. 14 on RCLCO’s annual list of the 50 fastest-selling master-planned communities in the country.

The July 18 announcement follows several milestones at Babcock Ranch with total home sales now exceeding 2220 and over 1700 homes closed. The town will soon introduce new neighborhoods builders amenities and facilities including the opening of Babcock High School and the Field House in August.

“We are thrilled that our vision and this special place have resonated with so many families who have chosen a better way to live” said Syd Kitson chairman and CEO of town developer Kitson & Partners. “This is an exciting time at Babcock Ranch for residents homebuyers and the community as we create an innovative sustainable hometown with a true sense of community and a unique lifestyle in harmony with nature.”

Babcock Ranch America’s first solar-powered town debuted on the RCLCO list in July 2020 and has risen steadily in the rankings which are based on total new home sales in master-planned communities across the country. Babcock Ranch began marketing new homes in 2017 and welcomed its first residents in January 2018.

Babcock Ranch was created by Kitson & Partners with the philosophy that smart growth and sustainability work hand in hand. Half of the town’s footprint is set aside as greenways parks and expansive lakes providing recreation and scenic backdrops for Babcock Ranch’s homes and the Founder’s Square downtown district. Built to Florida Green Building Coalition standards homes emphasize energy and water conservation innovation and have a full gig of fiber-optic connectivity.

Babcock Ranch continues to explore higher environmental standards in homebuilding with the recent introduction of its newest neighborhood – Innovation Way – with seven showcase homes serving as a testing ground and living laboratory. National homebuilders Lennar Pulte Homes and D.R. Horton are evaluating the possibilities for a new wave of homebuilding solutions implementing cutting-edge technology new materials and construction practices to create the most energy-efficient water-preserving and health-forward homes on the market. Florida Power & Light Company will analyze energy efficiency throughout the testing period.

Babcock Ranch was named Master Planned Community of the Year by the Lee Building Industry Association for a second consecutive year in 2021.

Babcock Ranch offers homes from national homebuilders including D.R. Horton Lennar Meritage Homes Pulte Homes and WCI and custom homes by AR Homes by Arthur Rutenberg Divco Custom Homes and Florida Lifestyle Homes. Additional neighborhoods by Christopher Alan Homes Toll Brothers and William Ryan Homes are coming soon.

Babcock Ranch homebuilders offer more than 50 home designs ranging from 1120 to more than 4000 square feet. Homes appeal to young millennials families empty nesters and retirees with base prices ranging from the upper-$200000s to over $1.5 million.

Babcock Ranch recently unveiled plans for Midtown the newest chapter in the town’s development celebrating outdoor recreation and the natural landscape with more places to live work play and connect with nature and each other. Midtown’s first phase will introduce eight new neighborhoods new builders and a thoughtfully designed next-generation town center for waterfront dining offices shops and apartments within seven scenic acres of green space. The new Curry Creek Park a 3.5-mile linear park leads to Midtown offering 50 acres of unique pocket parks pavilions and event lawns for picnics and community events gardens play areas for adults children and dogs and untouched preserves and wetlands.

We’re looking at a lot of things.""

The transition included the commissioners approving two annexations — a 509-acre annexation from Jersey Township to New Albany and a 94-acre annexation from Licking Township to Heath.

Bubb was speaking to Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission officials about planning efforts that include a land use and housing study and a water and sewer study. Licking County officially joined MORPC earlier this year.

“We’ve gone through sort of a period of what I call the Intel panic” Bubb said. “You know it sort of took your breath away.”

Intel Corporation plans to build two computer chip manufacturing facilities called fabs on Jersey Township land annexed into New Albany. The company expects production to start in 2025 and employment to reach 3000 with an average wage of $135000. The project is also expected to create 7000 construction jobs and 10000 indirect jobs.

More:Intel spends $111 million on 750 acres of land for its New Albany factories

Intel said the development could expand to a $100 billion investment if the Chips Act becomes law. The U.S. House approved the legislation on Thursday following the Senate's approval. The president is expected to sign it providing subsidies for companies to research design and manufacture semiconductors and provide a 25% tax credit for companies that build facilities in the U.S.

New Albany seeks commercial use

The 509-acre annexation of Beech Road properties is part of the 3190-acre New Albany-Jersey Township annexation agreement approved in January but not part of the 1689-acre Intel development area previously annexed.

The 509 acres is bordered by the Franklin County line to the west and just short of Green Chapel Road to the north. To the east it reaches about halfway between the county line and Clover Valley Road. To the south it stops about halfway between Green Chapel and Jug Street.

More than half of the Beech Road parcels to be annexed are owned by the Hendren family.

Dustin Hendren one of the property owners said only that the family continues farming and can’t say what the future holds for the property.

“Time will tell” Hendren said. “Things are changing it seems like every day.”

Scott McAfee chief communications and marketing officer for the city of New Albany said the New Albany City Council can’t vote on the annexation for 60 days.

“Assuming it is annexed it would be land developed commercially within the New Albany International Business Park” McAfee said. “To my knowledge Intel purchased the amount of land that they need for their project. It is very likely that this would be something other than Intel.”

McAfee said the city’s land use and strategic plans show the area being zoned commercial. So it would be annexed in as agricultural then changed to commercial he said.

“If the owner wants it to stay (agricultural or residential) it probably would not be annexed in” McAfee said. “The property owner requests to be annexed. If they want it to remain residential we don’t want it to be annexed.”

Jersey Township Trustee Dan Wetzel said he does not expect annexations to go east of Mink Street and believes passage of the Chips Act will not necessarily force more annexations even if the company builds 10 fabs instead of two.

“They might need more land but the land they already annexed might be sufficient” Wetzel said. “I don’t think they would have to annex more land.”

The annexed land remains part of the township unless the city and township agree to conform boundaries. The township would lose revenue if the boundaries are conformed Wetzel said. When abatements expire the township is compensated he said.

“That’s what we don’t want” Wetzel said. “The township still lays there. Neither one is interested in conforming boundaries.”

McAfee and Wetzel both said they do not know the plans for 1245 Beech Road SW the location of a 98-acre tract of land purchased Tuesday by Preylock a real estate acquisition and management company for $156.5 million.

The site is west of Beech Road south of Ohio 161 across Beech Road from the Facebook development.

Heath eyes residential manufacturing

The city of Heath has three potential annexations in various stages of the approval process. Two are likely for residential and one for manufacturing. All three are in the Lakewood School District.

The county commissioners approved on Thursday a 94-acre annexation on Irving Wick Drive East just outside the Heath city limits.

Homebuilder D.R. Horton has proposed a 302-home subdivision named South Fork Ridge south of Irving Wick Drive adjacent to The Villages at River Oaks and across from the River Oaks housing subdivision.

More:Homebuilder D.R. Horton targets Intel with proposed 302-home subdivision in Heath

The developer first proposed a 325-home plan then revised it to 302 homes but further adjustments are expected.

“I suspect that number (of homes) will go down” Heath Mayor Mark Johns said.

Rob Little the D.R. Horton division vice president of land acquisition told Heath council’s Community Development Committee in June the homes will be priced well above what the average Heath resident can afford possibly approaching $400000.

He said the average home sale price in Heath last year was $223672 and the city’s median household income is $51524.

Another possible Heath annexation for a residential development is on 144 acres at the south end of Franklin Avenue at Dorsey Mill and Irving Wick Drive in Licking Township.

Heath City Council will consider pre-annexation agreements with Licking Township and property owner Test Track Partners on Monday night. A final vote is expected Aug. 15.

Test Track Partners plans various residential uses including single-family multi-family assisted living and senior housing according to the proposed agreement. The city plans to build a water tower on the site.

Johns said the city had started working on the project long before Intel caused even more housing demand in the county.

“The housing market in Heath has been extremely tight” Johns said. “The need for additional rooftops has existed in the central Licking County market for some time. My understanding is Lakewood Schools is welcoming of students.”

The mayor said he plans to meet with the Lakewood superintendent next week.

A third possible annexation into Heath will be considered for 230 acres west of Thornwood Drive and north of Lees Road next to the Lees Meadows subdivision in Union Township.

Heath City Council will have a public hearing Monday night for zoning of four parcels three for manufacturing and one agriculture.

An 8-acre agriculture zone along with the existing flood plain will provide a buffer between the housing subdivision and future manufacturing. There is an adjacent rail line.

Roller skating has been an off and on again trend for decades. In Milton the scene is as hot as ever. We write about David Weber the current owner of Weber’s Skate World and his plans to expand the operation to include an outdoor track.

Homelessness is one of Pensacola’s most-talked-about issues — and one where the answer is complex. Not everyone is sitting on their hands waiting for the issue to resolve itself. Two Pensacola police officers have decided to step up and help get the homeless off the streets by working in conjunction with advocate Melissa Johnson to connect the homeless to long-lasting and sustainable services.

No data backs up mayor's claim of increase in complaints about homeless

Mayor Grover Robinson kicked off a mini-firestorm over the weekend in an email chain doubling down at his Monday press conference in which he openly speculated that the arrest of homeless advocate Michael Kimberl lines up with a ""spike"" in complaints about the behavior of homeless people in the city.

However no data exists at City Hall backing up the mayor's claim.

Kimberl was arrested July 13 and charged with misdemeanor criminal mischief with damage under $200 for cutting the lock on a portable toilet rented by the Downtown Improvement Board.

Okta is a leader in the cybersecurity industry specializing in identity and access management. Its platform ensures that only authorized people can access specific applications and infrastructure.

Unlike Microsoft Okta is technology neutral. It doesn’t own any cloud infrastructure and it has no reason to show bias toward any particular vendor. In fact Okta offers more than 7000 prebuilt integrations making deployment quick and easy for clients. Research company Gartner has recognized Okta as an industry leader in access management for five consecutive years.

Not surprisingly it’s growing quickly. In its last quarter Okta’s revenue grew by 65% over the past year with established customers spending 23% more on average with the company than they were a year prior. Okta recently had $2.3 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet meaning that the company can afford to invest aggressively in growth.

Shareholders have good reason to be bullish. Management estimates its market opportunity to be $80 billion and Okta has established itself as an industry leader. The company should benefit as more enterprises shift more of their digital operations to the cloud adopt remote work models and prioritize zero-trust security.

With Okta shares recently down more than 65% from their 52-week high long-term investors might want to take a closer look. (The Motley Fool owns shares of and has recommended Okta.)

Ask the Fool

From P.L. in Las Cruces N.M.: How should I learn about an industry to invest in it?

Advertisement

The Fool responds: The best way to learn about any industry is to read a lot about it — though don’t expect to understand all of what you’re reading at first. Just stick with it. Note that some industries (such as consumer products and retail) can be fairly easy to understand but others (such as biotechnology semiconductors and financial services) can be quite complex.

Advertisement

Start with websites of companies in the industry and trade associations. Read books on the industry or companies in it. There are gobs of online articles to digest too. You can get research reports from many brokerages on lots of companies prepared by Wall Street professionals. Read annual reports of companies in the industry which include comprehensive 10-K reports.

Ideally learn some accounting basics too so that you can make sense of companies’ financial statements.

From D.R. in Kenosha Wis.: I’m invested in a mutual fund with a 4.75% front-end load. Should I sell out of it and move that money to a no-load fund?

Advertisement

The Fool responds: No-load funds —of which there are thousands — are generally preferable to funds with loads (sales charges). In this case though you already paid that fee up front when you bought your shares. So at this point forget the load and simply decide whether you want to keep the fund based on your performance expectations for it. But do check out its expense ratio (annual fee). Many good funds charge less than 1% and some index funds are charging less than 0.10%. There are plenty of outstanding no-load funds.

The Fool’s School

Whether you’re approaching retirement or are just thinking about and planning for it here are some things you should know:

Advertisement

Withdrawal strategies: You’ll need a plan for how much you’ll withdraw from your nest egg each year in order to make it last. If the market and your portfolio’s value sink just before you retire consider delaying retirement or withdraw a smaller amount. Try to keep several years’ worth of living expenses in cash or low-volatility accessible accounts to tap during bear markets or recessions.

RMDs: Once you turn 72 you’ll need to start taking required minimum distributions from certain retirement accounts such as traditional (non-Roth) IRAs. Fail to do so and the penalty is huge — 50% of the sum you failed to withdraw on time. (These withdrawals will generally count as taxable income.)

Health care: Prepare to pay a lot to health care providers. Fidelity Investments has estimated that the average 65-year-old opposite-gender couple retiring in 2022 will spend $315000 on medical expenses throughout their retirements (excluding long-term care most dental care and over-the-counter drugs). Getting and staying as healthy as possible might keep those expenses down for you.

Other expenses: While you might spend a lot on health care you’ll likely spend less on many other items as you slow down such as commuting clothing and even travel. Your housing costs may drop too if your mortgage is paid off or if you move to a smaller home or lower-cost location.

Advertisement

Daily life: Having big swaths of free time may sound enticing but many find themselves restless or even depressed in retirement. Prepare to combat that by staying active learning new things engaging in activities you enjoy and socializing. Exercising regularly volunteering or working a low-stress job can also help.

A bigger standard deduction: One nice thing about getting older is that those 65 or older get a bigger standard deduction come tax time.

My Dumbest Investment

From B.C. online: My dumbest investment? I lost money on Tesla a stock that has gone from a split-adjusted $3 per share in 2010 to more than $700 recently.

Advertisement

When I opened an account so I could invest in stocks I bought three shares of Tesla and two shares of Amazon.com. I sold Tesla in 2018 when the company was burning through cash quickly and its CEO Elon Musk suggested on Twitter that he could take the company private. The stock dropped after that and the Securities and Exchange Commission charged him with securities fraud. He and Tesla each ended up paying a $20 million penalty for his actions. Emotionally speaking I couldn’t take his reckless comments anymore.

The Fool responds: You might think of this as your dumbest investment but it could also be considered one of your smartest.

Yes Tesla’s stock is up roughly tenfold since you sold but you sold because you didn’t have faith in the company’s management — and that’s an excellent reason to sell.

Musk is still heading the company and he has a reputation for rather unpredictable behavior. Some reasonably question whether he’s able to spend sufficient time leading Tesla when he’s also involved in many other ventures such as pursuing (and then rejecting and then being sued about rejecting) Twitter. Others of course do believe in his leadership and expect more growth from Tesla.

Quartey

What do all the largest companies in the world have in common? Can you name one business that was not started by an entrepreneur? Personally aside from a few started by the government such as the post office I cannot think of any.

Even mail delivery has its fair share of entrepreneurial companies now competing with our government service – FedEx UPS etc. When you think of the world’s largest companies such as Walmart Ford Apple they all started as an idea in someone’s mind.

The word entrepreneur is defined by Meriam-Webster as “one who organizes manages and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise.” It has also been said to be the “creation or extraction of economic value”. Note that it is about change and is broader than it was when the word was first developed.

The classical economists were the first to come up with the term. In basic economics the four factors of production are land labor capital and entrepreneurship. The entrepreneur was the one who pulled those other three resources together for one purpose only to make a profit. As we can see from the more modern definitions above the concept of “profit” is missing as entrepreneurship may include values beyond economic ones. This essentially means that an entrepreneur can take risks for purposes other than profit. It could simply be to provide goods or services for the needy. This is the concept of “social entrepreneurship”.

Some years ago I railed against the concept of “social entrepreneurship.” Why? Because in all of my studies in economics and from all that I had been teaching my students the entrepreneur in the strictest sense is the individual who takes a risk to make a profit. So if there was no profit motive then I felt that the individual needed to be called something else.

I felt that the terms social and entrepreneur were contradictory or oxymoronic. How could one seek a social objective while also seeking a profit? I now know better. One can seek a number of objectives beyond the profit motive while engaging in entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship does not always have to be about making money or profit. Or to put it another way the profit does not have to be in terms of money or materiality; it can be in terms of what sociologists and some economists call psychic income – the satisfaction or nonmonetary gain from doing good; it is making a difference in the lives of others.

I am by no means suggesting that we should pursue entrepreneurship only socially. The profit motive while it benefits the individual entrepreneur may benefit others also while benefiting society in general. Society is replete with such examples.

The largest Michigan company in terms of number of employees is Ford Motor Company with almost 200000 employees. Here in Monroe it is La-Z-Boy Inc. with almost 10000 employees. We all know the impact these companies with a profit motive have on our economies and communities. Aside from jobs provided and their multiplier effect we see the numerous examples of La-Z-Boy’s largesse through its corporate responsibility acts in our Monroe community.

Other Michigan-based companies in the top 100 list that directly impact Monroe are DTE Energy Meijer General Motors Guardian Industries and Consumers Energy (zippia.com/advice/largest-companies-in-michigan/). Their impact is enormous and our community would not be what it is without them.

These companies started as an idea in someone’s mind with a profit motive and now the entire society is the better for it. So let’s keep those ideas coming whether it is for one’s own benefit or for the larger social benefit.

Monroe County Community College’s Maker Space/Entrepreneurship Center encourages your innovation and ideas be they for social or profit purposes and we are here to help you succeed. In the long run if your idea takes off not only will you benefit but the entire society benefits as we make the world a better place for all of us.

Workers last week paved the 1.5-mile walking path around the perimeter of the park while a new playscape structure was installed as well. Additional work at the park will include a five-unit outdoors fitness area that will offer wheelchair-accessible stationary equipment that works the arms shoulders chest back and core.

will be expanded with construction of a new28-vehicle parking lot south of the township hall. The park currently includes a children’s playscape and picnic pavilion.

Township supervisor Mike Boskee said the $200000 investment at the park and township hall grounds fulfills a commitment to the community to provide recreational opportunities for area residents in Elba Township.

The name they gave themselves seemed fitting as they cheered one another on through a reception held in their honor at the center Friday evening where they discussed the program and gave the audience an overview of their accomplishments.

The internships are the first of their kind in the country said the center’s executive director Mozine Lowe.

(The interns are: Ma’Chiya Arrington a rising senior at Halifax County Early College; Rakeya Brinkley a rising senior at Halifax County Early College; Anyah Brown a graduate of Northwest who will be attending St. Augustine’s University; Jamiya Cabiness a Warren County High School graduate who will be attending UNC-Greensboro; Mihkayla Hammie a rising senior at Weldon High School; Jaslyn McKinney a rising senior at Halifax County Early College; Zakeiryh Perry a Northwest graduate who will be attending UNC-G; Mikayla Watson a rising senior at Roanoke Rapids Early College; Janine Williams a rising senior at Halifax County Early College; and Shamyra Wright a rising senior at KIPP Pride High)

“These 10 girls they have made history” Lowe said. “This is the very first program for women in solar young girls of color. The industry is growing at a tremendous rate. It is coming to Halifax County. There are so many jobs that are available to any and everyone. You have to know that the jobs are out there and you have to know the people that have the jobs that are out there.”

Lowe said the 10 girls have had a tremendous experience. “They were first of all identified by their academic leaders in the community. They were deliberately selected to be part of the Young Women in Solar at the Center for Energy Education.”

Lowe said the program received strong funding from well-established solar companies — Duke Energy Geenex Solar Engie EDF Renewables Roanoke Electric and many other associations.

The goal of the program Lowe said was for the girls to meet high-level leaders in companies. “We wanted them to sit in their board rooms. We wanted them to talk to them about their jobs their careers how they managed to be at the top of their jobs.”

She said the organizers wanted the girls to ask these leaders what they were doing to make it possible for girls of color to have jobs in these companies.

The internship took the girls to Geenex in Charlotte North Carolina A&T State University North Carolina Central University and the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington. “We wanted the company leaders to meet them to get to know them to consider being their mentors next summer.”

Lowe said this will not be the last opportunity. “With the partnerships with the local schools we hope to continue this program throughout the school year.”

And the journey for the Radiant Rays doesn’t end with the internship. They have been talking with a videographer in London who is creating a film about the girls. “He is telling their story to the world because they’re very unique. It’s just amazing how these 10 young women have embraced all of this newness — coming to the center learning about clean energy meeting company leaders going to Dominion Energy into the dam. It’s just amazing. They went to Howard University. We tried to give them the opportunity to see as many universities to meet company leaders and just to know what the world is like.”

The plan going forward Lowe said is for the 10 girls to become Center for Energy Education ambassadors and to meet once a month. “We have big plans.”

There is a Solar Fest event coming up on October 6 where the girls will be featured as presenters.

The North Carolina State University Clean Energy Technology Center has plans for the girls to present at the 2023 Energy Conference. “I want you to know that they have done some tremendous things and I realize that it was through your support and the support of the schools that this was possible” Lowe said. “Companies are really interested in them and following their career path and there’s just so much more to come.”

In her welcoming remarks Brown said “For the last five weeks me and my sisters have been networking and meeting new people in renewable energy careers and traveling to different colleges.”

In her remote message to the students and the audience Rita L. Joyner a senior advisor for the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association said “I’m so proud of the young ladies and their achievements.”

Joyner’s message focused on a three-point plan for success. “You must dream with your eyes open” she said. “I want you to spend time with yourself and explore your possibilities.”

She advised the students to write out their goals. “Write with detail. What will it look like? What will it feel like … and use all of your senses as you’re writing down your plan.”

The third point Joyner said is to achieve those dreams. “Work at it until your definition of success is accomplished.”

Jim Harris director of land development for Geenex said “This is Geenex’s dream. This was George Veit’s and Mozine Lowe’s dream to bring a center for energy education to the area to help the communities that we work in.”

Harris said “What’s impressive about these young ladies here is their taking advantage of that vision. It is so wonderful to see a community come together and support these young women. It is so wonderful that I get to work with a company that sees that vision.”

Afterward Wright said “One thing I learned is that networking is very important because sometimes it’s not about what you know but who you know.”

Said Cabiness: “The takeaway I got from this is it’s a great opportunity and my generation will be the generation to right the wrongs.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbGlzYnVyeXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMzAvbGF1cmEtYWxsZW4tNC1oLXN1bW1lci1pbi1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Laura Allen: 4-H summer in review - Salisbury Post,"Laura Allen: 4-H summer in review Published 12:00 am Saturday July 30 2022

Summer has been a busy time for Rowan County 4-H. In earlier articles 4-H’ers have been recognized for their achievements and participation in district level presentations and talent and the state 4-H poultry judging contest. Now it’s time to recognize 4-H youths for additional achievements during the summer months.

On June 14-16 four Rowan County 4-H’ers attended NC 4-H Citizenship Focus held in Cary. During this conference 4-H’ers learned about government how a bill is made and how to be a good citizen. 4-H’ers also visited the General Assembly. Rowan County 4-H’ers were able to meet with Rep. Harry Warren Rep. Julia Howard and Senator Carl Ford to discuss 4-H government and our community. Rowan County 4-H’ers attending this event included Emily Barlow Nathan Croyle German Jaramillo and Samantha Simon.

On June 26-July 1 17 youths ages 8-14 attended 4-H Camp at Betsy-Jeff Penn 4-H Educational Center.

A new analysis of the August 2020 Colonial Pipeline gas spill estimates that the volume of gasoline leaked was far greater than original estimates making it the largest onshore spill in U.S. history. New data released last week by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) suggests that the spill started 18 days earlier than it was discovered and released more than 2 million gallons of gasoline a large increase from the 1.2 million gallons reported by Colonial in January 2021.

The Colonial Pipeline spill was first discovered by two teenagers riding four-wheelers through the Oehler Nature Preserve on Aug. 14 2020. Shortly after the spill was discovered a Colonial Pipeline spokesperson reported that 63000 gallons of gas had spilled but that most of it had been recovered. Five months later in January 2021 the company acknowledged that 1.2 million gallons had actually leaked from a five-foot pipe that had ruptured.

The most recent info came as the result of a consent order approved by a Mecklenburg County Superior Court on July 7 which ordered Colonial to provide an updated estimate of the volume of the spill within 30 days. The order also requires the company to take specific remedial actions and pay nearly $5 million in penalties and investigative costs.

As of July 13 Colonial reported that they have recovered nearly 1.4 million gallons of gas from the spill site — leaving 600000 gallons unaccounted for — as well as about 9.9 million gallons of petroleum-contact water.

“When it comes to using fossil fuels we know by now that when we extract and transport oil and gas we spill oil and gas” said Katie Craig state director at North Carolina Public Interest Research Group in a release on Monday. “Gas infrastructure creates accidents waiting to happen that pollute our water harm our environment cost consumers and taxpayers money to clean up and threaten public health. But these spills are preventable. We need to move away from our reliance on dirty fossil fuels and move toward a cleaner healthier future powered by green renewable energy.”

Body-Cam Footage of Veteran’s Gastonia Arrest Released

A judge ordered the city of Gastonia to release full body-cam footage related to the arrest of a disabled veteran for panhandling at a main intersection in the Gaston County city in October 2021 during which an officer deployed a taser on the man’s service dog Sunshine. The dog ran off and would be struck and killed by a car three days later.

City officials released two videos on Thursday the first one shows interactions that Joshua Rohrer had with police on Oct. 9 and then on Oct. 13 the day he was arrested. In the Oct. 9 video an officer discusses Gastonia’s panhandling laws with Rohrer and the interaction has a peaceful conclusion.

The Oct. 13 footage which begins at the 8:30 mark in the first video shows Rohrer’s arrest at the hands of multiple officers. A woman officer can be heard telling her colleague “I don’t think he’s going to bite” in reference to the dog shortly before that colleague deploys his taser on the animal.

Rohrer has called for charges against the officers who arrested him and has continued to do so after the footage was released on Thursday.

County Announces Move to High Community Spread

Mecklenburg County Public Health on Friday announced that the county has moved to the highest level of CDC COVID-19 community spread possible. The change from medium to high reflects a continued increase in positive cases which has resulted in an increased burden on county resources according to a release from MCPH on Friday.

The Omicron BA.5 variant which appears to be more contagious and more resistant to immunity from vaccines or previous COVID-19 illness currently represents the majority of new cases in the United States and in Mecklenburg County.

“At this highest community Level we all must take steps to slow the spread and use the effective tools we have available: Get up to date with your vaccines stay home if you’re not feeling well and test and meet outdoors when possible” stated Dr. Raynard Washington Mecklenburg County Public Health director in the release. “We all need to do our part.”

Department officials also recommended that residents mask up indoors and for immunocompromised or high-risk people to talk to their health-care provider about whether they are a candidate for treatments like oral antivirals and monoclonal antibodies.

Activists Speak Out Before Duke Energy Hearing

Around 75 people representing organizations from around North Carolina gathered at Marshall Park Thursday to speak out against Duke Energy’s proposed Carolinas Carbon Plan in the lead up to that day’s NC Utilities Commission’s hearing of public testimony about the plan.

According to the folks who organized the event which included organizers with Sunrise Movement Charlotte Charlotte Mecklenburg NAACP and others Duke’s proposed plan to reduce carbon emissions by 70% by 2030 vs. 2005 levels relies too heavily on coal gas and unsustainable energy sources; slow-walks the deployment of renewable energy resources; and is inadequate in terms of equity.

“Duke Energy’s draft carbon plan is a scam designed to keep expanding the use of the very methane gas that is devastating communities and driving the climate crisis” said Jim Warren executive director of the climate justice nonprofit NC WARN. “Scientists say reducing the expansion of gas infrastructure is crucial to humanity’s efforts to avert climate and social catastrophe yet Duke execs’ plan could result in dozens of new natural gas-fired power plants.”

“Duke Energy’s carbon plan ignores the experiences and realities of BIPOC communities and demonstrates a disregard for a ‘just and equitable’ energy transition” added Rev. Corine Mack president of the Charlotte Mecklenburg NAACP. “As we approach one of the greatest turning points in human history due to climate change the Charlotte Mecklenburg NAACP is urging the Utilities Commissioners to ‘see us’ and meaningfully address and mitigate these impacts.”

Former Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts said “Today I asked the Utilities Commission to think of what climate change means to real people to their own families and neighbors here and now. I hope they will recognize that they have the power to reject this Carbon Plan and build a more ambitious one that brings hope — something that our young people are in great need of in these challenging times.”

Five Murders in Charlotte This Week

Five people were murdered in Charlotte this week making 70 homicides in Charlotte thus far this year. Just after 7 p.m. on Sunday police responded to Thomasboro Drive in the Thomasboro-Hoskins area of northwest Charlotte and found 19-year-old Jesse Mobley Jr. suffering from a gunshot wound. Medic pronounced him dead on the scene.

Just before 1:30 a.m. on Sunday police responded to a shooting call on Queen City Drive near Sloan Drive in west Charlotte and found 35-year-old Christopher McGill suffering from a gunshot wound. Medic transported McGill to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. Shortly after McGill’s death police arrested and charged a 27-year-old man with murder.

Shortly after 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday police responded to Pennsylvania Avenue in the Oakview Terrace neighborhood of northwest Charlotte where they found a person suffering from a gunshot wound. Medic transported the victim to the hospital where they were pronounced dead. The victim had not yet been identified at the time of this writing.

Shortly after 9 p.m. on Wednesday police responded to Atrium – University in response to a call about a subject who had arrived with a gunshot wound and was pronounced dead at the entrance of the emergency room. He was later identified as 24-year-old Dymonte Hall. Further investigation found that the shooting occurred on John Adams Road in University City.

PETERSBURG — It’s a two-story frame home built in 1912 aqua-colored with a metal roof and a handsome wrap-around porch. For more than a century it graced the 100 block of Fourth Avenue NE near the downtown waterfront later becoming a local historic landmark.

On Sunday morning it was headed north on Fourth Street N making for an odd sight as dozens of onlookers gathered along the sidewalks. Crews cut tree limbs and lifted power lines to make way and police directed motorists to take detours for the move which began Saturday night and continued past noon on Sunday.

The relocation was part of a larger story — Old St. Pete making way for a newer version of the city that features gleaming residential towers new restaurants and a booming night life. The operation clears a path for The Nolen an upscale 23-story residential tower that is 65% sold. Construction will begin immediately and take about 20 months to complete. The project is led by DDA Development of Tampa.

The house meanwhile has a new location in the historic Round Lake neighborhood on a shady lot at the corner of 8th Avenue N and Dartmoor Street. The developers estimate the move — part of the purchase agreement and a condition of city approval for The Nolen — will cost about $500000.

During the move the home was accompanied by a convoy representing at least a half-dozen public agencies and companies including St. Petersburg police crews from the cable company the Department of Transportation Duke Energy and AJS Building Moving & Leveling based in Florida. It traveled west on Fourth Avenue N then north on four-lane Fourth Street one of the city’s busiest arteries before taking a tight left turn at Eighth Avenue N.

“We’re tremendously impressed with the professionalism of everyone involved in this project” DDA Development principal Bowen Arnold said in a news release. “There was exceptional care put into preservation of the house as well as avoiding disruption to the neighborhood. It was an impressive effort.”

Amber Brinkley a spokesperson for the project provided a passage from the city’s historic preservation department that described the home’s history. It said the house originally was part of a cluster of homes and apartment buildings that largely catered to winter residents. Its first known occupant was a renter from Davenport Iowa.

It was also used as a hotel for a time and most recently operated as the Watergarden Inn at the Bay from 2012 to last year.

According to Pinellas County property records the house and property under it at 136 Fourth Ave. NE sold to DDA Development in December for $7 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpbGxhZ2VzLW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMzEvYmFkLXBhcmtpbmctcGhvdG9zLXNob3ctcGxlbnR5LW9mLXZlaGljbGVzLWJlbmRpbmctdGhlLXJ1bGVzLWluLXRoZS12aWxsYWdlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bad Parking photos show plenty of vehicles bending the rules in The Villages,A Village of Osceola Hills reader was impressed with the conditions at Hacienda Hills Championship Golf Course.

Mike Grier’s wicked cool July in the Bay Area — a warp-speed course in NHL front officeology — continued with his hiring Tuesday of fellow ex-BU Terrier David Quinn as the 10th head coach in the Sharks’ 30-year history.

Sandwiched in too was the July 7 amateur draft in which Grier in Belichickian more-is-better style traded out of the No. 11 spot for a pair of second-round choices (Nos. 34 45) and also acquired Filip Bystedt at No. 27.

The 6-foot-3-inch Bystedt a left shot pivot has the hands and passing skills to make it as an NHL center but will have to improve his stride and speed — not uncommon for supersized 18-year-olds yet to grow into their frame. Even at No. 27 they are usually projects.

Quinn who made it to the short list of finalists to succeed Bruce Cassidy behind the Bruins bench prior to Don Sweeney opting for Jim Montgomery is back as a bench boss after a one-year layoff. He was dismissed by the Rangers after his three seasons overseeing the aggressive Blueshirt roster rebuild masterminded by then-GM Jeff Gorton after shaping the likes of Chris Kreider Artemi Panarin Mika Zibanejad and Adam Fox (Norris winner ‘21) into legit contenders.

Grier and Quinn who turned 56 Saturday now are co-shareholders trying to shake the Sharks from a lethargy that has led to a franchise-worst three straight seasons without a playoff berth.

A tall order possibly all the harder without the dynamic Burns who ranks No. 1 in points (594) among all NHL back liners since joining the Sharks for the start of the 2011-12 season. Over that same stretch he also landed more shots on net (2643) than any other defenseman nearly 500 more than Nashville’s Roman Josi (2153).

Burns is 37 and the contract ($8 million cap hit) was heavy but his firepower unparalleled in a sport that makes it increasingly difficult for defensemen to put shots on net. It was not good news for the Bruins to see him land with the Tropical Depressions.

“I know the last three years have been tough” Quinn said during his introductory news conference noting that dips can be typical for franchises such as the Sharks “that have been successful for a long time.”

Quinn added that he intends to coach up a roster to play with both structure and freedom which is very similar to the approach/ethos that Martin St. Louis implemented in Montreal when taking over the hapless Habs bench last season. St. Louis saw encouraging results arguably with a roster with less talent than Quinn has inherited from outgoing coach Bob Boughner.

“I never heard a coach say ‘We want to play slow’ ” added Quinn emphasizing his desire for speed. “We want to be an up-tempo tenacious aggressive ultra-competitive team.”

By Quinn’s math if his 23 players can produce 5 percent better results than last year “that can be the difference between making the playoffs or not.”

Maybe. The NHL can be the land of funny math especially so when factoring in those loser points for overtime defeats.

Another challenge for Quinn will be in net where today (subject to change) Quinn will have to cull a No. 1 from among a lackluster lot of James Reimer Kaapo Kahkonen and Adin Hill. None of them is capable of carrying the franchise which was why Grier insisted on Finnish prospect Eetu Makiniemi when flipping Burns to the Hurricanes. Makiniemi has only one year of North American pro experience (AHL Chicago) but at the moment he has a shot at being the franchise’s goalie of the future.

It’s likely Quinn more than once this season will recall the words of his pal Jack Parker the legendary BU coach who often said hockey should be renamed “goalie.”

“That” said Parker “is how important the position is.”

Despite their Comm. Ave. bond Grier and Quinn never were together at BU though both played for Parker.

“It all starts with Coach Parker” Grier said after he became the first Black man to direct an NHL team. “He was the leader. He believed in a team-first unselfish approach.”

Grier helped BU win an NCAA title in 1995 then wrapped up his three years under Parker in ‘96 and turned pro with the Oilers. That same spring Quinn left Northeastern his first coaching gig to spend six years at the University of Nebraska-Omaha.

Years later noted Grier he sometimes would venture over to BU for workouts during Quinn’s tour as the Terriers head coach (2013-18) — well after Grier wrapped up a 1000-plus game playing career. Now the guy who OK’d Grier’s post-career tuneups in the Comm. Ave. gym is the guy charged with making Grier’s team an on-ice success.

Quinn decked out in a tailored suit sounded eager and confident during his intro presser. As important as X’s and O’s are he noted his philosophy and approach to coaching are personality-and relationship-driven.

“When the people you are leading know you want the best for ‘em” he mused “you have a much better chance to get the most of ‘em.”

THE TIME IS NOW

Tkachuk move reminiscent of Neely Espo deals

Matthew Tkachuk's trade from Calgary to Florida rocked the NHL. Sydney Walsh/Associated Press

When the call came with word that Matthew Tkachuk indeed wanted out of Calgary and had Florida at the top of his list Panthers GM Bill Zito initially wasn’t sure whether to believe it.

“I couldn’t even fathom it was possible” said Zito. “He’s 24 years old . . . tough . . . mean . . . ”

At that point during the Sunrise news conference a giddy Zito with Tkachuck sitting at his right elbow kiddingly checked himself and said “I might have to stop.”

Earlier in the press conference Zito also described Tkachuk as “a unicorn.” He indeed landed the best player in the deal though at a high price that included Jonathan Huberdeau the classy productive winger who posted a career-high 115 points this past season.

Clearly the Panthers believe this is their Cam Neely moment reminiscent of the summer of ‘86 when Bruins GM Harry Sinden landed the strapping 21-year-old winger in trade with the Canucks. Neely soon was tabbed the game’s first power forward (Sinden’s term) his combination of strength and prolific goal scoring parlayed into his ticket to the Hall of Fame.

Some 20 years earlier in May 1967 Bruins GM Milt Schmidt made the whopping deal with the Blackhawks acquiring Phil Esposito Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield for Gilles Marotte Pit Martin and Jack Norris. Espo came aboard one year after Bobby Orr’s arrival and two Cups (’70 ‘72) soon followed.

Tkachuk is not Neely or Esposito though the swagger he often displays on the ice might make some believe he is better than both combined.

It’s precisely that swagger bordering on an irritating smack that Zito felt his skilled Panthers desperately needed and convinced him to part with the bountiful package that included Huberdeau defenseman MacKenzie Weegar center prospect Cole Schwindt and a first-round pick (2025).

“Steep price but didn’t want to lose the asset” Zito said. “Cannot find guys like this.”

Zito promptly signed Tkachuk to an eight-year deal with a $9.5 million cap hit identical to the pact Charlie McAvoy starts this season with the Bruins. All but $8 million of that $76 million total will be paid in signing bonuses including $38.75 million over the first four seasons.

“On ice I have a different personality” said a smiling Tkachuk. “The way I play I bring a certain swagger that I really think will help this team . . . I’m excited to get the chance to grow the game down here.”

A 6-foot-2-inch 200-pound left winger with the same swaggering DNA his dad Keith Tkachuk turned into a 538-goal fortune Matthew last season posted a career-high 42 goals and 104 points. He’s a younger brasher version of Huberdeau and now he gets to help anchor a lineup dotted with young high-end talent that last season pinned up the league’s best overall record (58-18-6) in the regular season.

It’s all right there for it to happen — just as it was for Neely and Esposito upon their arrivals here.

Faced with the Bolts in Round 2 though the Panthers couldn’t blend in the requisite moxie and jam it takes to get to a Cup Final. Enter Tkachuk whose play should embolden performances throughout the lineup particularly those such as Aleksander Barkov Sam Reinhart and Aaron Ekblad.

“First and foremost it was winning ― not just winning now but in the future” said Tkachuk asked why he prioritized joining the Panthers. “If I keep hearing about the past [Panthers failures] I think I’m going to lose my mind . . . because I think this team I know some of the players are unhappy with the way things have gone the last few years but I don’t want to keep hearing it. I want to worry about the future here. All the guys are from my age up to 28 or 29. That was attractive to me ― win now and win in the future.”

Tkachuk already with six seasons in the NHL is 24½ years old. Neely turned 21 the day he was dealt here and had logged three seasons with the Canucks. Esposito who had posted 174 points in his 235 games with the ‘Hawks was 25.

“I’m here to win” said Tkachuk. “Personal stuff . . . throw that out door . . . I’m here to be the last team standing. That’s it. If we are I’m happy.”

“Mean big . . . 24 years old” Zito noted when contacted by the Globe. “I’ll take two please.”

Some moves bring relief but cause pain

Oliver Bjorkstrand was an unfortunate cap casualty for Columbus. Mike Ehrmann/Getty

Ex-Bruin forward Jarmo Kekalainen his Blue Jackets payroll squeezed by the UFA signing of Johnny Gaudreau and a pricy extension for Patrik Laine scurried for cap relief in dishing productive right winger Oliver Bjorkstrand to Seattle.

It was essentially a gift in the top six for the Kraken who yielded only two picks (R3 R4) in next year’s entry draft to acquire a reliable forward who posted 101 points over the last 136 games.

The return normally would he higher for that kind of production but these are not normal times with Kekalainen underscoring to The Athletic’s Aaron Portzline that he feared fewer and fewer teams around the league as the summer progressed would have the cap space to accommodate Bjorkstrand’s $5.4 million cap hit (for three more seasons).

“The hardest decision I ever had to make as GM of the Blue Jackets” said Kekalainen whose brief NHL playing career included 27 games with the Bruins at the start of the ‘90s. Making it all the harder: The amiable Bjorkstrand was on his honeymoon when he received Kekalainen’s farewell call.

Headed into the weekend based on puckpedia.com figures the Blue Jackets still have to shed approximately $1 million to be compliant with the max $82.5 million cap figure for the coming season. Like all clubs they have until the season opener to shimmy under the line. Until then clubs are allowed to run 10 percent over the cap.

Ideally perhaps Kekalainen would have found takers for Gus Nyquist ($5.5M/one year) or ex-Flyer Jakub Voracek ($8.25M/2 years) but again there are so few potential takers. Upon Bjorkstrand landing in Seattle only 11 of the Original 32 held more than $5 million in cap space.

The Bruins with Don Sweeney still trying to budget the return of elite pivots Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci entered the weekend with approximately $4.8 million in spending money — and an upcoming arbitration hearing with Pavel Zacha acquired from the Devils in the Erik Haula swap.

Zacha made $3 million last season. A modest bump to say $3.5M would eat up most of what is left in the Jacobs’s purse seemingly necessitating more moves to accommodate Bergeron and Krjeci. Sweeney has some breathing room there though because hefty salaries for Brad Marchand and Charlie McAvoy won’t be on the books until they return on or about Dec. 1.

If Sweeney is forced into a Bjorkstrand-like gift situation the likeliest to go could be winger Craig Smith ($3.1M/one year) whose production was spotty and frustrating last season. Perhaps a new coach will wring more out of him if he doesn’t end up the collateral damage for the younger bigger and perhaps more versatile Zacha.

Loose pucks

It increasingly looks and sounds as if the Blackhawks will move longtime franchise pieces Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane each about to enter the final year of their megadeals that carry $10.5M cap hits. Of the two the 33-year-old Kane remains the most vital and productive (92 points last season) and maybe a team like Detroit (young stars evolving) or Anaheim (winters a touch warmer than both Detroit and Chicago) would entertain the idea of offering a two- or three-year extension at a decent dollar. The road back to respectability just looks too long for the ‘Hawks. “Not appealing” Toews told The Athletic noting the departures of Alex DeBrincat (flipped to Ottawa) Kirby Dach (to Montreal) and Brandon Hagel (Tampa Bay). All that turnover said Toews is “really draining and exhausting.” . . . .A bunch of Tuukka Rask’s former teammates including Bergeron Krejci Torey Krug and others recently ventured to Northern Italy to attend his wedding to longtime partner Jasmiina . . . There has been a growing narrative around the club this offseason that Krejci intends to settle his family in South Carolina originally his wife’s home and he would like some flexibility to zip down there during the 82-game season if he opts to return to the Bruins . . . The Kings will send Dustin Brown’s No. 23 to the rafters Feb. 11 and unveil his statue outside their Crypto.com arena. A solid Kings performer and a former captain (before surrendering the C to Anze Kopitar) but a statue really? Wayne Gretzky and Luc Robitaille are the only other individual bronzed Kings. When does Marcel Dionne get his moment in the sun. Meanwhile Bobby Orr’s statue is the lone Bruins monument on Causeway Street. Just seems wrong not to be surrounded by the likes of Phil Esposito Gerry Cheevers and Ray Bourque . . . Prior to the Mike Grier-David Quinn takeover in San Jose the Sharks in June hired another ex-Terrier John McCarthy (BU ‘09) to be the head coach of their local AHL Barracuda franchise. McCarthy 35 played all his 88 NHL games with the Sharks and retired due to a stroke during his final pro season (2019-20) with the Barracuda . . . Grier played his prep hockey at St. Sebastian’s and was drafted by St. Louis (No. 219 in ‘93) at the urging of Matt Keator then a scout for the Blues. Now a successful agent best known here for his work with Zdeno Chara Keator this past week finalized a one-year deal for ex-Bruin Ryan Donato’s return to Seattle. Meanwhile Ryan’s brother Nolan recently graduated from Providence College hits the stage this weekend in “Hair: The Musical!” at the Company Theater in Norwell. A forward Donato played his prep hockey at Dexter Southfield and suited up briefly his freshman year for the Friars but ultimately swapped ice for the footlights. The show runs through Aug. 21.

Service between the Farragut North and Van Ness stations was back as of about 9:50 a.m. Metro officials said. Trains will run every 10 minutes the agency said.

BREAKING -- Metro says it has restored train service on the Red Line once again. Shuttle buses still available for an hour or so #wmata @nbcwashington https://t.co/KRZG26FRQk — Adam Tuss (@AdamTuss) August 1 2022

The closure began Saturday night after sparks and fire were spotted near the Dupont Circle station. Officials found burned-up electrical cables. It still wasn’t clear as of Monday afternoon why the cables sparked up but we now know a train with passengers was close to the sparking and potential smoke.

“It’s probably 100 feet away from me in total” a train operator in the tunnel could be heard telling central control.

Metro has a troubled history with smoke and trains in tunnels. Smoke filled a train at L’Enfant Plaza in 2015 killing a woman.

Red Line riders coped with shuttle buses during Monday morning's commute after a fire Saturday disrupted service. Service was back as of about mid-morning. News4's Juliana Valencia reports.

An electrical fire and ""low-voltage cable arcing"" broke out Saturday at the Dupont Circle station. No injures were reported. Riders boarded shuttle buses including for the busy Monday morning commute.

“I was on track to get to work early today. Now I’m gonna be late"" one woman said as she dealt with the shuttle bus system.

Red Line trains were first delayed Saturday at 9:30 p.m. between the Van Ness and Farragut North stations after a fire broke out at the Dupont Circle station and for what WMATA initially said was a “track problem.""

DC Fire and Emergency Services were at the scene at 12 a.m. working on an “electrical issue” according to a tweet. By 3:30 a.m. DC Fire tweeted they had isolated the station's power and the burning had ended.

Metro said crews were ""working continuously to make repairs so service is restored... in time for your morning commute."" Early Monday though Metro said that repairs on the ""complicated work"" continued.

Rail Transit OPS an independent monitor of WMATA said Red Line delays were due to low-voltage cable fires and an “explosion” near Dupont Circle on Saturday between 9 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.

""At this point in the investigation evidence suggests that there was a failure of a low-voltage electrical cable that led to an electrical fire which damaged adjacent cables"" WMATA said in a statement. ""The GM has directed rail management to undertake a systemwide inspection of low-voltage power cables starting with the underground portion of the system.""

Great stuff here as well. Turns out this was a cable fire and explosion. Much more than just a “track problem.” Wow. #wmata @nbcwashington https://t.co/Xu1WZX9sGs — Adam Tuss (@AdamTuss) July 31 2022

Many passengers said they were caught off guard.

""I'm fine with delays. I can't stand the shuttle. That shuttle just now was packed"" rider Jonathan Smith said. ""And it took like a half-hour to go I don't know two miles.""

""This is the route that I take to work and it is quite time-consuming"" passenger Selwin Dsilva said. ""The Uber costs about $25 so I have to take the bus.”

Metro’s new general manager Randy Clarke — who’s been on the job for just over a week — pledged to get to the bottom of what happened. He apologized in a tweet for the impact on customers and said Metro will conduct an ""after action review"" of the agency's response.

""It is clear this incident could have been handled better especially in relation to communications on trains and bus shuttles"" Clarke wrote.",,,

He’s one of England football’s most famous faces who has swapped Manchester for South West London but where might Raheem Sterling decide to live. This month it was announced the winger who has 19 goals and 77 appearances for his country was signing for Chelsea meeting up with Thomas Tuchels’ men and reportedly joins as the highest earner at the club.

While Sterling will be playing his home games at the famous Stamford Bridge any knowledgeable Blues fan knows Chelsea players train just south of the Surrey town of Cobham which has become a hotbed for celebrities and footballers alike. It begs the question whether the four-time Premier League could be another to settle in leafy Surrey.

It may be he decides to stick closer to his roots in London having emigrated to Neasdon in North West London from Jamaica when he was five and where he played football in the shadow of Wembley Stadium. Getting across London isn’t easy however so we’ve decided to help him find his new Surrey home.

Will Sterling have hired someone to do this already? Probably. Will he take the advice of his local news website? Who knows. However these stunning houses will certainly peak his interest if he does decide to take our advice.

Eaton Park

First up for Raheem is the most expensive property currently listed in Cobham a £6995000 six bedroom house located on Eaton Park. Situated over three floors and in one of Surrey’s most desirable locations this is a house worthy of Sterling’s considerable talent.

With a staggering nine bathrooms and 8504 sq ft of stylish interiors there’s plenty of space to entertain people with a spacious open plan kitchen and dining room area. This space leads onto a garden room where you can look out onto a 0.49 acre plot with a south west facing garden.

There’s room for work as well as play too once you move onto the second floor with a gym and a cinema room located on this level perfect for relaxing and preparing during the summer break. Set behind secure electric gates it's a perfect spot for any footballer.

It is located in an ideal spot too with Cobham High Street just a short walk away with its wide-range of boutiques and restaurants. There's also a wide array of good schools in the surrounding area while the golf courses of Queenwood St George’s Hill and The Wisley aren’t far away either.

While we wouldn’t call this a budget option this next property is a bit less expensive than the one on Eaton Park with it currently being listed at £5.5 million. However it doesn't mean its short in luxury in any way as its nestles perfectly in the Surrey countryside has a few advantages.

Despite having fewer bedrooms (five) and bathrooms (five) this property crucially has an outdoor swimming pool in a plot of land spanning an enormous five acres. It doesn't stop there either with a tennis court also built onto the premises for the lucky buyer.

Inside there's plenty to enjoy as well with a grand reception hall grand bedrooms and large living and kitchen areas which are perfect for hosting people. There’s also an air conditioned summer house which can double up as a gym amongst other things which is perfect for someone with an active job.

While the house is further away from Cobham than the one in Eaton Park it more than makes up for it by being in a stunning location. If Sterling does narrow his choice to these two homes he’ll definitely have a tricky decision on which one to choose.

However our opinions are our own. See how we rate products and services to help you make smart decisions with your money.

When my son and I moved last year I asked him to choose some old Legos to sell to make space.

I learned that eBay buyers will pay top dollar for certain sets and minifigures so I started flipping them.

I buy them cheap and sell them at a markup. Since February I've earned $2400.

At the end of 2021 my son and I had to move. My son is 13 and he's been a Lego fanatic for years and it's a pain to transport completed sets and find a place for them. When we moved to our new place I told him to start going through the boxes and find ones that he didn't mind getting rid of.

I quickly learned we were sitting on a gold mine.

People will pay a fortune for old Legos

I've been an entrepreneur my whole life and it's the main reason I'm able to survive whenever I'm between jobs or just need to make extra money. Since financial independence has been so valuable in my life I wanted to teach it to my son. While we gave some Legos to charity I thought selling them would also be a great opportunity to show my son a simple way to make money.

I've never sold anything on eBay but I know people value random things. I figured if we could at least get some of the money back that we'd spent on these old sets it'd be a good deal. First I had him sort the sets and separate the minifigures. Next we needed to see how much they were worth so we worked together to do research and see if there were any websites that gave estimates.

One of the first minifigures we looked up was for the character Ahsoka Tano from Star Wars. We pulled it up and saw that it was worth almost $200 and I almost fell out of my chair.

My son was shocked as well and we spent the next few hours looking up all the minifigures and sets we could. We also started watching a bunch of YouTube videos to find the best ways to properly appraise minifigures and sets.

We used a few different methods. One way is to look on eBay and check how much the item has recently sold for. Using eBay is only semi-reliable though; a much better website we found was Brickeconomy.com.

I saw an opportunity to earn more

We managed to sell that Ahsoka figure within a day or two for $199. Of course I'm not going to take my son's profits but I saw how I could make some easy money. The set that minifigure came in was $109.99 when it came out in 2016 so I was willing to bet that there were people selling old sets who didn't know how much they were worth.

I started spending countless hours researching the most valuable minifigures and Lego sets. Lego has been around for 90 years so you can get bogged down with too much research. I decided to hyper-focus on Star Wars and Marvel sets since they're what I know.

My son and I started going out on weekends to used toy stores here in Las Vegas to see if we could find any hidden gems. One local used toy chain hosts events for people to sell so we started checking those out too. What I quickly noticed is these people aren't dumb. They often sell minifigures and sets at or above their value. But I did find a deal or two.

Unopened sets are worth significantly more and I ended up meeting a woman who had a lot of unopened sets she bought for her sons who are now adults. She was doing her research as well but she was cool and started making deals with me if I'd buy multiple sets.

I have had the best luck on eBay with finding undervalued sets and minifigures. On eBay you can create saved searches. I found about 20 to 30 items and created saved searches so I'd get an email if anyone was selling them below a certain price. I set a goal to make at least 50% profit which is how I decided what to set the price at.

Now and then I'd find minifigures or sets that were missing a piece so I'd go to Bricklink.com and see how much that part was. Bricklink is a marketplace where people sell individual Lego parts and sets. It also gives value estimates but it's not as reliable as Brickeconomy. If I could buy the missing part and still make a significant profit I'd do it.

I've made over $2000 in 6 months

Since starting this project in February I've made about $2400 flipping Legos. I made some big mistakes early on that cost me money but I've made all of that back and more. I also still have some sets that haven't sold but I learned that people make a lot of money around Christmastime.

Making this discovery has been a financial boon. I was unexpectedly laid off in September 2021 and without an income I had to start using credit cards. I was terrified of ruining my credit score after I worked so hard to repair it.

But thanks to my Lego-flipping side hustle I was able to pay off all the debt I racked up between jobs. Plus this was a great experience with my son. With the pandemic the current issues with inflation and the uncertainty of the future I'm glad I'm able to teach my son that there's always a way to increase your income and be self-sufficient.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Amitkumar Kanubhai Patel 38 of Vadodara India formerly of Edison was convicted on one count of international parental kidnapping following a five-day trial before U.S. District Judge Renée Marie Bumb in Camden federal court.

Court papers say the child’s mother and Patel were in a relationship and lived together in New Jersey from August 2015 through July 2017 but never married.

In November 2016 Patel and the child’s mother had a child who was born at JFK Medical Center in Edison.

According to the child’s mother Patel wanted to take the child to India to introduce him to his parents and obtain DNA testing which Patel claimed was necessary for the child to claim property that Patel’s family owned in India court papers say.

Megan's Law:A look back at how NJ became a model for federal legislation

Patel also told the child’s mother that in order to obtain an Indian visa for the child he would need to secure sole custody which required them to go to the Family Division of Superior Court.

Patel instructed the mother to tell the court that they had a mutual understanding about the custody of their child. He also told her to say that she did not have a work permit and since she was unemployed she could not care for her child.

On May 1 2017 Patel took the child’s mother to New Jersey Superior Court Chancery Division Family Court to obtain sole custody of the child.

According to the mother the majority of the hearing was conducted in English with no translator. At the time of the hearing the mother spoke limited English court papers say.

The mother answered the court’s questions as she had been instructed by Patel. The mother was not represented by an attorney during the hearing.

On May 2 2017 the court granted Patel sole legal custody of the child on the condition of the child’s mother's consent to the arrangement. The ruling also allowed the mother to file for joint legal custody if she wanted to in future.

Patel then obtained visas to India for himself and the child and booked air travel telling the child’s mother that they would only be gone for two weeks to a month.

Patel then took the child to India and after several days in India called the mother and said that he was never bringing the child back to the United States.

At that point court papers say the child’s mother obtained legal counsel and returned to the New Jersey Superior Court. On Oct. 16 2018 the court ordered Patel to return the child to the United States immediately.

Three days later the mother’s lawyer emailed the court order to Patel who did not return the child to the United States.

Two years later on Oct. 2 2020 Patel and the child flew from India to the United Kingdom. Upon arrival Patel was arrested based on a provisional arrest request submitted by the United States.

By Jason Collins |

Following a security data breach a ruined Battlefield 2042 game the company’s loss of Star Wars exclusive rights and its split with the International Federation of Association Football also known as FIFA one would think that things aren’t really playing in EA’s favor. However that is not entirely the case. Following the announcement of its “uncontested divorce” with FIFA Electronic Arts has announced the rebranding of its soccer video game genre and has secured a multi-year partnership with one of the biggest soccer clubs in the world.

According to IGN Juventus one of the world’s biggest soccer (referred to as football in the rest of the world) clubs is coming back to EA Sports starting with the upcoming FIFA game FIFA 23. This means that we’ll see the Italian side featured in the developer’s final soccer title under the FIFA banner before its partnership with the FIFA organization officially expires at the beginning of 2023. Considering that EA practically owns the game engine the company announced its plans to rebrand the gaming series as EA Sports FC.

Juventus previously had an exclusive relationship with Konami and the publisher’s Pro Evolution Soccer series for the past three years. Pro Evolution Soccer never matched FIFA in terms of sales whose licensed teams and player names made the series more realistic and thus more appealing to the gamers. But PES occasionally gave a FIFA series a run for its money considering how several iterations were regarded as better games than their FIFA contemporaries.

The new deal between EA and Juventus means that the club’s players stadium and jerseys will appear in the next EA soccer game. In addition EA stated that the two sides would work across several lifestyle and cultural initiatives that will bring new opportunities outside the world of football alone while Juventus praises EA as its next official urban culture partner. This is a piece of very notable news for the future.

As stated above EA and FIFA have split paths but neither company is dropping their soccer gaming titles. FIFA already announced that it’s ready to work with third-party developers to launch new non-sim soccer games some of which are already in development with a planned release in Q3 2022. EA stated high price tags and creative limitations imposed by FIFA as reasons for the split. FIFA on the other hand only stated that it wants its wide range of future products to reach all gamers members and fans which could indicate the development of a new metaverse.

And no we’re not kidding either; the company has applied for World Cup Metaverse Trademarks which indicates the creation and implementation of digital content. EA on the other hand has revealed that a massive number of the world’s top clubs and leagues choose to remain with the company and its future series including Premier League Bundesliga La Liga and UEFA team licenses. EA showed off FIFA 23 recently and for the first time while also revealing a renewed focus on women’s soccer — a continuous effort to include more women in gaming. Apparently Rockstar Games isn’t alone on this front.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9hcGV4LWxlZ2VuZHMtYmVzdC1lbW90ZXMtZm9yLWRvZGdpbmctYnVsbGV0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apex Legends Players Share The Best Emotes For Dodging Bullets,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9hcGV4LWxlZ2VuZHMtYmVzdC1lbW90ZXMtZm9yLWRvZGdpbmctYnVsbGV0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcmN1cnluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzMxL2JpbGwtcnVzc2VsbC1uYmEtbGVnZW5kLWNlbHRyaWNzLXN0YXItdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1zYW4tZnJhbmNpc2NvLWRvbnMv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVyY3VyeW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMzEvYmlsbC1ydXNzZWxsLW5iYS1sZWdlbmQtY2VsdHJpY3Mtc3Rhci11bml2ZXJzaXR5LXNhbi1mcmFuY2lzY28tZG9ucy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bill Russell: What you need to know about the NBA Celtics and USF Dons legend,"Here’s a look at the life of Bill Russell Hall of Fame center who played with the Boston Celtics.

The company re-fitted the former 277000 square foot Cherokee Frame manufacturing plant for its professional tools business with a primary focus on producing Greenlee specialty tools and related products for electrical tradespeople across North America.

Emerson has more than 150 employees working at the facility and plans to grow the operations with a goal of creating up to 285 total jobs at the site over the next four years.

“Today is the culmination of the strong partnerships we have forged over the past two years with local state and federal organizations and we deeply appreciate their support” Craig Sumner president of Emerson’s professional tools business said. “We are looking forward to establishing strong ties here in the Ash Flat community and taking a leadership role in developing the next generation of skilled manufacturing workers in Arkansas.”

Workforce available in the area and its close proximity to the company’s Memphis distribution center were the two primary reasons the company chose to locate at the Ash Flat site in 2020.

“Emerson has honored Arkansas by returning to the state and selecting Ash Flat for its expansion and new facility” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. “With our state’s dedicated workforce and low costs of doing business Emerson is proof that Arkansas has the tools in place to take new and expanding companies into their next phases of growth.”

Emerson was founded in St. Louis in 1890 as a manufacturer of electric motors and fans. Over the past century the company has grown from a regional manufacturer into a global technology and software solutions powerhouse.

“Arkansas continues to be one of the most financially sound states in the country” said Arkansas Secretary of Commerce Mike Preston. “Our diversified economy and business-friendly policies kept our state open for business and we continue to see the results of those decisions as Emerson and similar companies have been able to invest in our state and create more jobs for hardworking Arkansans.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld3MtbWVzc2VuZ2VyLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL21uajI0MjY4NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Craig William Raney Obituary,"Craig William Raney 52 of Wapakoneta died 8:15 a.m. Fri.

The MHS uses existing legal and economic instruments—but once a building comes under its umbrella there’s no chance of it returning to the commercial real estate market. In recent years this concept has become increasingly popular in Germany and it’s currently expanding into new areas including the construction of new houses and collective ownership of agricultural land. In the Southwestern German town of Tübingen I met Marc a member of the MHS at a Housing Action Day demonstration—a civil action demanding the expropriation and socialisation of housing corporations in Berlin. Even with strict Covid restrictions the demonstration filled Tübingen’s square. Housing costs aren’t only rising in large urban centres like Hamburg and Berlin: Tübingen is among the most expensive residential areas in the Federal Republic. Located in the Neckar valley the university town has become a base for medical clinics research centres like the Max Planck Institute and companies like CureVac which is developing a vaccine against Covid-19. The specialised workers coming here are creating price pressure and increasing housing demand and the development of a Cyber Valley in the Neckar—an investment in artificial intelligence research facilities that it’s hoped will attract giants like Amazon and the German auto industry—is yet another reason for lower-income residents to fear being pushed out by techies flocking in. Due to the lack of cheaper flats for rent students often are forced to occupy basements and attics. A psychologist by profession Marc however is not afraid of losing his apartment or having his rent raised. He’s a tenant in one of the so-called housing projects (or Wohnprojekt) developing under the umbrella of the MHS. He invites me to see the 4-Häuser Projekt one of eight MHS-affiliated projects in Tübingen. As the name suggests this one consists of four buildings which served as homes for French garrison military personnel stationed in the city until 1991 and then as housing for medical staff at the university clinic. Renovated and tidy the two-storey multi-family house with a red-tiled roof and centrally located staircase looks friendly. It’s distinguishable from other houses by the multi-colored window trim the organic ‘let it be’ maintenance of gardens and a smattering of banners hung on the fence and patio bannisters. The banners call for the fight against climate change and express opposition to the forced return of refugees to Afghanistan.

What’s a Housing Project? These housing projects stem from the 1970s and ’80s. Under one roof are individual apartments occupied by families singles or pensioners as well as so-called Wohngemeinschaften or WG which are apartments cohabited by flatmates of various ages and professions. The 4-Häuser Projekt houses are not a concentrated housing complex. They’re scattered at different lots along the street. Marc draws my attention to the ground floors rebuilt by the residents themselves allowing families living on the same floor to have independent access from the yard. Altogether the four buildings are inhabited by one hundred people including forty children. New roof tiles added a year earlier are covered by photovoltaic panels. Bicycles are parked in front of the entrance. We enter one of the units. The presence of children is noticeable; there are toys everywhere. On the mezzanine there’s a large bookcase filled with dozens of shoes. We go to sit in the meeting room and the sound of a hammer drill can be heard. Marc explains that they’re currently working on an extra room for guests. ‘This continuous development and change is underlined by the collective name of what we do’ says Marc. ‘It’s always a ‘housing project’—never something completely finished; rather a structure that we transform as collective needs change.’ I ask if it’s related to the history of the squatters’ movement. ‘Yes and not at all’ Marc replies—‘though there would be no MHS without the squatting movement.’ The idea of the syndicate was born among those who occupied an abandoned machine production factory in Freiburg im Breisgau another university town near the French border in the 1980s. These were the heydays of the squatting movement and young people in light of accelerating deindustrialisation and the flight of the middle class to the suburbs occupied abandoned buildings in the large cities. They established centres of extra-parliamentary political activity social initiatives and independent cultural projects within their walls with the intention of building an ‘alternative society’. Squats served also as dwelling-places. But big capital returned to the centres of the big cities in a new form and the era of gentrification began. Protracted conflicts over property rights and outbreaks of police violence pushed older squatters to seek a new framework for their activities. Most squats have now disappeared from city maps; a few turned into legal—or at least tolerated—youth and cultural centres. Some started to think of buying the property out but bought-out property could again be an object of commodity trading. In Germany people looked for legal means to avoid that outcome.

Escape the Spectre of Re-Privatisation Founding a housing cooperative was the first idea of the future syndicalists in Freiburg. Democratic control autonomy and independence cooperation and care for the local community—the principles of the cooperative movement seemed to fit perfectly with the planned enterprise. However this form of shared ownership did not guarantee that it would be sustained as such in the future. Through a qualified majority the general meeting of cooperatives could lead to the re-privatisation of cooperative property. The goal instead was to remove the property permanently from the market circulation—described as the ‘neutralisation of capital’. The Freiburg project decided to use an organisational form derived from the very core of the capitalist system: a limited liability company (in German Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung or GmbH) which offered a vital feature—the possibility of establishing the asymmetry of its constituent entities. This meant every housing project would be given full autonomy of self-determination with one exception: the ability to re-privatise. In this case the right of veto belongs with the partners of the company—the entity representing the entire syndicate meaning all housing projects associated with MHS. If one group wanted to take ownership of the building or sell it all others in the syndicate have a tool to stop it. The road to re-privatisation was closed. At first glance this might seem complicated; in practice it’s not. New groups that want to jointly acquire or build a house form an association (Verein). The size of the group varies from a few people to dozens. The key part of the process is developing a financial plan upon which the future rent level depends alongside its acceptance as a part of the syndicate. Newcomers however don’t have to organise everything by themselves. MHS offers free volunteer assistance to ensure that the new groups are aware of all the necessary steps. When their plan is cohesive a new project group will present the concept at the general meeting of the syndicate held three or four times a year. If approved by the general assembly another phase begins: the formation of a company (GmbH) between the housing project association and the syndicate. It’s this company that will be the entity purchasing and managing the property. The Tenement Housing Syndicate itself is also a limited liability company but its sole shareholder (Gesellschafter) is the association of the same name Mietshäuser Syndikat. The association is made up of all previously attached syndicate groups house associations and private individuals. I query this inclusion of private individuals asking Marc if it’s possible to create home projects individually. He says no. ‘These individuals are people who don’t live in any of the syndicate houses but their presence is crucial to the entire structure’ he explains. ‘These are people who joined the MHS association for ideological reasons or those who used to live in housing projects and although they moved out due to changing life circumstances still feel attached to the syndicate. Importantly they have no material interest in supporting a possible re-privatisation. They are a safety brake in case all other associations suddenly want to privatise the Syndicate—which nonetheless seems unlikely.‘

Scalability One of the reasons this is unlikely is the sheer scale of the project. The growth of the Syndicate and therefore the amount of wealth permanently withdrawn from capitalist circulation is accelerating. In 2015 MHS had about 100 housing projects. Currently there are 174 and an additional sixteen candidate initiatives. In its thirty years of operation the Syndicate has suffered only one failure: a large project based in a historic country house a decade ago which in the face of increasing costs for a lengthy renovation was forced to file for bankruptcy. There is a full stylistic and functional diversity among the buildings taken over by the Syndicate. Among them are villas from old suburbs former military barracks old tenement houses more contemporary residential buildings a former office building and even a train station. Building completely new structures is not outside its scope either. A modern building in an attractive district of Hamburg has recently been completed. The space offers 1400 square metres of workshop space for craftsmen renovation companies and freelancers associated with the project. The total residential area of all the Syndicate buildings accounts for approximately 150000 square metres with an additional 25000 in usable space for business activities. MHS’s buildings are inhabited by around 4.5 thousand residents. The value of all properties was estimated in 2021 at around 280 million euros which equates to the amount of ‘neutralised capital’. As one person in a documentary made about the Syndicate put it: ‘The whole trick is that this value will never be realised on the market again.’

The Functional Questions But just saying ‘buy the building’ is easy. Where does the money come from? For most people living in Syndicate homes investing individually in any real estate would probably be inconceivable—but I’ve seen a financial plan of over one million euros managed by ex-squatters. How do they get those sums? As of 2020 the inhabitants’ own contribution to the purchase of real estate was only seven percent of the required funds. Thirty-nine percent is direct loans borrowed by private individuals—often family members friends or people who identify with the idea of the Syndicate. In the case of the 4-Häuser Project in Tübingen the lender was the city council. For lenders the syndicate offers the possibility of a transparent social and sustainable investment without passing money through a bank. It’s often unclear what happens with the money in savings accounts or equity funds or what’s financed with them; crediting MHS projects on the other hand means individuals know they’re funding something valuable for the community. They are also paid back with three percent interest—far more than the banks offer for keeping money in an account nowadays. In turn the sums collected by MHS through direct loans are treated by banks as the Syndicate’s own contribution. The remaining fifty-four percent of funding has been covered by bank loans which in the beginning was not an easy process. Cooperative bank GSL an institution specific to German culture stemming from the anthroposophical movement of Rudolf Steiner led the way. ‘We no longer have this problem’ Marc explains. ‘Now it’s us who choose the institutions which are from our point of view the least ethically suspicious.’

Finance and the Method of Replication Obtaining creditworthiness is one thing. Paying off the loans is another. The Mietshäuser Syndikat is based on three principles: shared ownership self-organisation and solidarity. These are nice slogans to hang as a banner but they also have specific financial dimensions. The financial plan for each new housing project includes start-up basics like the cost of acquiring the property and renovating it which is obligatory under German law. It includes a repayment scheme a forecast of future monthly spending shares transferred to the Syndicate solidarity fund and more. Future residents can knock down the rent level by for example carrying out renovations personally. Dividing the final costs by number of square metres gives the rent rate which will be paid by inhabitants. Such a rate level stays forever. Nobody will ever raise it. That’s the sole decision of the Wohnprojekt itself. But also after paying off the loans it won’t be reduced. The difference goes to the funds of the Syndicate and is used to support new projects now also given in the form of direct loans. Public relations activities legal support and the aforementioned consulting for newcomers are also funded out of this pile. A Syndicate with a solid pool of financial resources is also a safe loan warrantor for emerging projects one of the most important parts of the organisation. The sum of solidarity contributions paid in year 2020 reached €350000—seven times more than the amount collected a decade earlier. The most important feature of this system is that rents calculated this way come out much lower than those of the commercial market. Practice shows that this difference grows in favour of the Syndicate over time. On the other hand if the rent of a given project would exceed eighty percent of average local rates residents may apply for a partial remission of the contribution paid to the Syndicate. That means apartments under the MHS umbrella always offer more favorable rates than those on the commercial market. In Grether—Freiburg’s first building complex converted in this model—rents are now two to three times lower than in neighboring locations. The ‘syndicalists’ pay €5.70 per square metre while the average prices in the city in 2021 ranged from €13.5 to over €17 per square metre—and don’t forget that part of the rent paid in Grether goes to the joint fund of the Syndicate for the development purposes of the entire group. In its publications MHS provides descriptions of all projects along with the parameters including year of purchase size of land and living space number of inhabitants purchase costs rent per square metre and the amount of the contribution to the Syndicate. Full transparency is key. The houses meanwhile are self-governing. Every project keeps its own full accounting administers the building and carries out repairs. In addition MHS has its own publications and organises general meetings and activities for the benefit of the local community. MHS does not support any political party but it goes without saying that it’s a left-wing institution. One of the tools used to counteract the atomisation of housing projects is the rule that every tenant should be involved in at least one working group. There are no passive observers.",,,,,,,,,

Recently Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) and Nykaa announced the launch of Beauty&You India—a programme that is looking to discover the next generation of Indian beauty brands. Created by ELC’s New Incubation Ventures and launched in partnership with Nykaa Beauty & You India aims to help founders and innovators grow their business by identifying brand goals achieving scale and curating product portfolios.

Beauty&You will support India-focused companies and entrepreneurs through a competitive application process—and both pre-launch and in-market beauty concepts will be considered for the awards. The winners will be provided with masterclasses financial support mentorship and distribution support from ELC and Nykaa’s experienced ecosystem.

The jury for the programme includes Katrina Kaif actor and founder of Kay Beauty; Sabyasachi Mukherjee founder & CEO Sabyasachi; Samrath Bedi executive director of Forest Essentials; Nicola Kilner CEO & co-founder DECIEM group among other industry experts. Shana Randhava vice president ELC New Incubation Ventures and Anchit Nayar CEO of beauty for Nykaa e-Commerce who will lead this programme spoke to Forbes India about the vision and objective of the programme. Edited excerpts:

Q. What triggered the decision to launch Beauty&You? What is the main objective of this programme?

Shana Randhava: This programme was inspired by Nykaa and ELC’s deep commitment to building and supporting the startup ecosystem in India. We started talking about this programme about six months back. The idea is to discover and propel the next big beauty entrepreneur in India and allow them to benefit from our joint experience distribution and scale which could help the brand scale up locally and then take it to the global stage.

Anchit Nayar: The idea for this programme comes from our shared history. Estée Lauder did this 76 years ago Nykaa did this just 10 years [ago]—finally both businesses were started by women entrepreneurs and have become successful in their respective domains. We wanted to find a way to give back to the entrepreneurial ecosystem in India. More than the capital we’ll be infusing into these businesses it is about them learning from our shared resources and network.

Young entrepreneurs in the beauty space might have access to plenty of capital from the PE/VC ecosystem. But really understanding what it takes to be a powerhouse and build successful brands—is something we can help them with. Our insights here will be much more meaningful than just giving capital.

Q. From a strategic point of view is this programme a means to look for more acquisitions?

Anchit Nayar: The purpose of Beauty&You is to give back to the ecosystem that has been extremely generous to both Estée Lauder and Nykaa. Our idea is to find the next Estée Lauder the next DECIEM the next Forest Essentials and the next Nykaa.

We are going to be giving the award money without taking any equity in the company. In our minds it is a truly altruistic programme. That being said both companies have a history and track record of making acquisitions. While there is a possibility that we might invest in these brands or look to acquire them at some point that is not the goal of this programme.

Q. How does the programme work and will these companies be a part of ELC and Nykaa’s networks in the long run too?

Shana Randhava: The application portal opens on August 1 2022 and for the next two months we’ll be collecting applications from both—in-market brands as well as companies at the pre-launch stage. There will be a very exhaustive shortlisting process and finally the shortlisted candidates will present at the November event when the final winners will be announced. During the shortlisting process we will spend a lot of time doing masterclasses—educating potential winners about marketing technology and brand building.

Anchit Nayar: I feel the real work begins after the winners have been declared. This is when the stakeholders at ELC and Nykaa will really roll their sleeves up and help these guys on their journey to become meaningful brand(s) in the country. The winners will get access to Nykaa’s distribution network they will be listed on our platform and also possibly get featured in our physical retail stores.

Q. What are some of the criteria you will be looking at when picking the finalists?

Shana Randhava: We will be focussing on brands and entrepreneurs who have some really cutting-edge ideas. These brands or ideas need to have a competitive advantage—new innovative products technology new experiences for consumers and community or even looking at different consumer audiences.

We are focussing on building long-term relationships with these brands which is why we have a very rigorous shortlisting process. To give you an example Estée Lauder looked at over 1200 brands in the past year before deciding which companies to invest in. This means we are very selective and really looking for some unique gems coming out of the Beauty&You programme.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGhlYmVhdXR5aW5mbHVlbmNlcnMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMzAvcGVyZnVtZXItbWFyaXNzYS16YXBwYXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtcmVkYW1hbmNlLWF0LXRoZS1zY2VudC1iYXItaW4tbnljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Perfumer Marissa Zappas Launches Redamance at The Scent Bar in NYC,"Perfumer Marissa Zappas launched a collection of three perfumes called Redamance at an event at The Scent Bar in July 22nd. A cocktail reception followed at The Crosby Hotel in NYC.

Marissa is an anthropologist turned perfumer who trained for years in the esoteric world of perfumery but has recently stepped out and started her own brand. She often takes collaborative approaches to her work crafting dreamy scentscapes of historical women New York City artists tarot cards and even aquatic fantasties.

Redamance is derived from the word “redamancy” which means “the act of loving in return.” Each perfume is an homage and olfactive portrait of an overlooked woman from history and the notes reflect her time period personality and environment. The fragrances Imperia La Divina Ching Shih and Queen Nzinga aim to connect women of the past to women today through the transportive art of perfumery.

Applying perfume is a way of invoking a future self connecting to our bodies and desires. Redamance perfumes are meant to be worn by anyone inspired by the feminine in its endless forms. Our fragrances explore what it means to take up space while recalling past women who had the courage to do the same. We believe perfume is an exercise in memory and an art form that deserves more recognition.

Redamance perfumes are available in 50ml and 100ml sizes for $175 and $325 respectively.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFvbmUuY29tL2RpZ2l0YWwvc25hcC1ob3N0cy1hci1zaG9wcGluZy1sdW5jaC1mZWF0dXJpbmctbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLXNwZWN0YWNsZXMtYW5kLXBpeHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snap hosts 'AR Shopping Lunch' featuring next-generation Spectacles and Pixy,"Snap the company behind Snapchat hosted its first 'AR Shopping Lunch' event in Singapore a couple of days back where it showcased a few of its shopping and fashion-oriented AR Lenses through a physical display along with new products that the company has been working on that affirms its focus on wearable and camera technology.

One notable display was an AR try-on mirror which allows guests to try on clothes without having to change them. Using computer vision to apply the outfit the only requirement was having to take a few full-body pictures beforehand.

The display ties in with Snap's efforts to widen usage of AR shopping having conducted a study that said 1 in 4 shoppers would prefer to trial products with AR rather than actually being in the store.

Lenses featured in the event through the try-on mirror included products by Prada and PUMA and notably cosmetic companies like Estée Lauder and L'Oreal.

Apart from that Snap also showcased two new products one of which is its next generation of AR Spectacles. Snap's Spectacles of which three generations have already been on sale were originally released in 2016.

This generation however isn't on sale to the general public instead being oriented towards creators and AR developers (who can apply for access to the Spectacles here). Guests were given the chance to demo the Spectacles and try out some of the features including dual 3D waveguide displays (which form the lenses) to overlay AR.

Another new product shown was Pixy. Unveiled a few months ago Pixy is a small flying camera drone developed by Snap with the purpose of being a companion to Snapchat with the ability to capture video.

Pixy features four preset flight paths which means it can be used without a controller and can transfer taken videos to Snapchat Memories.

All in all the event served to re-enforce Snap's focus on AR commerce and making shopping more accessible to users. Snap says that AR-guided purchases lead to a 25 per cent decrease in returns and for brands a 94 per cent higher conversion rate which it lists as some results that its focus on AR commerce has given.

The descent of San Francisco's downtown moniker as a prominent place for tech companies to set up massive headquarters continues in unobstructed free fall. Earlier this week Twitter announced its plans to ditch its Oakland expansion... all while committing to a sizable decrease to its San Francisco headquarters. (Though these actions do make sense given how the social media company's CEO Parag Agrawal announced that he'd continue supporting the option of working remotely “forever"" in March.) Etsy the American e-commerce company that's become a go-source for one-of-a-king goods is expected to shutter its San Francisco offices for good come September.

Completing tasks is so much more fun when #RENAISSANCE is playing in the background 🐝 — Asana (@asana) July 29 2022

Why? Employees aren't going into them. It's why LinkedIn has completely redesigned its Silicon Valley campus — to include over 75 types of seating and make it feel more like a large community center than a sprawling office space.

Asana is among the companies interested in creating and expanding physical spaces that explore the next generation of (likely hybrid) office work which is why its corporate footprint in San Francisco is set to grow by 71000 square feet.

First reported by the San Francisco Business Times Asana is expected to begin subleasing more office space at 633 Folsom Street this year; the company which was co-founded by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz is headquartered in South of Market. According to the publication Asana will be taking over space that was previously home to Macy’s San Francisco offices.

It's unclear how the newly leased office space will be laid out but it's a bit of bright light for a particularly dark time in corporate San Francisco real estate.

According to its prohibited business policies seed companies are categorized as drug paraphernalia which is defined as “any business whose products are primarily intended for aiding the consumption of illegal drugs.”While we knew these waters would be murky as we set out on this journey we believed that by doing absolutely everything in our power to demonstrate our desire to be compliant with local state and federal laws while being mindful of public health and safety concerns we would be able to operate in this space without being arbitrarily discriminated against. Not only is the decision to restrict the online sale of our products un-American it is rooted in misinformation about the legal status of cannabis seeds in our country.Earlier this year the Drug Enforcement Administration responded to an inquiry concerning the control status of “Cannabis Sativa L. seeds tissue culture and any other genetic material of Cannabis Sativa L. under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).” In the DEA's response  Dr. Terrence L. Boos of the agency’s Drug & Chemical Evaluation Section opined that any and all parts of the cannabis plant including stems and seeds with a THC content below 0.3 percent are now considered hemp products — which were legalized as a result of the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill that ended federal hemp prohibition.In addition to losing our ability to process online payments we were notified by Etsy that our products violated its policies  which broadly define seeds as “controlled substances and medical drugs” regardless of the DEA’s memo that clearly states otherwise. Here is what we were told:“Etsy prohibits the sale of controlled substances and medical drugs including (but not limited to):• Marijuana and any products containing THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD)• Medical cannabis/hemp items and any items presented as such• Hemp buds leaves resin or unsterilized seedsBut the fight to liberate cannabis seeds in America is not new. In the spring of 2012 just seven months prior to the legalization of adult-use marijuana in Colorado Robert Hoban of Hoban and Fiola L.L.C. submitted a Request for Position Statement to the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division concerning the sale of seeds from licensed medical marijuana centers. In response Laura K. Harris the agency’s director at the time explained that the MED had no statutory or regulatory authority to prohibit a medical marijuana center (MMC) licensee or medical marijuana center applicant who was authorized to sell medical marijuana and that they could in fact sell medical marijuana seeds.Most recently the MED sent out an industry-wide memo urging licensed marijuana businesses to comply with the state’s existing framework which limits the transfer of seeds clones and other marijuana products exclusively between regulated marijuana businesses — a disappointing blow for seed enthusiasts.While the future of seed companies remains hazy it’s obvious that licensed cannabis companies have found a loophole and they’re more than willing to exploit it. With nineteen states legalizing the sale and use of recreational marijuana there’s no shortage of massive cultivation facilities popping up in industrial areas in places like Denver Las Vegas and Oakland. But how?Considering the varying restrictions on the importation and transport of cannabis seeds how do all these plants get started? The explanation is steeped in the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church or immaculate conception. I’m not kidding. Lawmakers regulators and law enforcement essentially look the other way as licensed cannabis businesses source thousands of seeds from around the globe to establish a newly regulated market.Westword.com

Electric utilities in the region are permitted by regulatory authorities to use the Retail Energy Cost Adjustment or RECA to recover the cost of power generation fuel and the costs of purchasing power.

On July 1 2022 Evergy Kansas Central increased its fuel and purchased power costs by 52% from $0.028918 to $0.043956 per kilowatt hour and neither the Kansas Corporation Commission — the entity tasked with regulating energy companies in the state — nor Evergy advised Kansas retail ratepayers of the change.

An expert analysis conducted by Brubaker and Associates — an expert energy consulting company in St. Louis Missouri — and commissioned by the Kansas Industrial Consumers Group found that the increase in fuel cost without factoring in the recent heatwave would cause the average monthly electric bill for July August and September 2022 to increase on average for residential customers by 22.69%; from 12.44 cents per kWh to 15.263 cents per kWh and for commercial customers by 28.25%. That will affect about 95% of Evergy’s 716000 customers who have a fuel adjustment clause.

Worse according to Jim Zakoura of Kansas Industrial Consumers Group the increase in fuel costs is not what Evergy actually spent but rather an estimate of what they think they might spend.

“When Evergy increased its fuel adjustment clause on July 1 2022 — to reflect what Evergy estimated would be increased costs — the per unit cost for electric energy in Kansas increased materially” Zakoura said. “Very predictably the combination of the increased per-unit cost and extended high temperatures and additional electric use will lead to very high residential and commercial electric bills.”

Moreover the most recent billing period for which customers will have bills ran from mid-June to mid-July so August and September bills are likely to be higher yet.

Zakura also noted: “These increases will be greatly exacerbated by the weeks of very high temperatures. It would be expected that electric bills in July 2022 would increase more than 50% compared to a year ago.”

The chart below from a 2020 study shows Kansans paid the highest electric rates in the region by far and that has since gotten worse.

Transmission projects capital spending also push rates higher

The KCC is expected next month to make a decision on a transmission project which would cut a swath half a football field wide through five counties and 89 miles of Kansas countryside taken from landowners by eminent domain for a massive high voltage power line. Adding insult to injury Kansas ratepayers will foot the bill for the transmission line that will send electricity to other states.

If approved the line would send electricity that was originally intended to serve the Wichita and Kansas City metro areas to customers in Missouri but Kansas customers will have to pay for the transmission line via higher electricity rates.

All while already paying some of the highest electric rates in the country.

Additionally KCC staff recently raised concerns about Evergy’s propensity to exceed its allowed capital expenditure budget — with the costs passed on to consumers in the form of higher electric rates.

“Evergy’s ratio of capital expenditures to depreciation and amortization has grown to a level that is 7% above its regional peers” the report reads. “Additionally Evergy’s 2022-2024 capital expenditure projections grew 8.70% over its 2021-2023 projections whereas the capital expenditure projections of Evergy’s regional peers grew by an average of 3.38%.

“These trends are highly concerning to Staff. Evergy’s propensity over the last three years has been to increase its capital expenditure budgets higher and higher with every iteration. If this continues we believe it will undermine the goal of achieving regionally competitive rates and reliable electric service especially against the backdrop of general inflationary pressures being experienced throughout our economy.”

The Sentinel reached out to Evergy in an attempt to ask about the KCC staff concerns but received no response.",,,,,,,,,,,,

JPMorgan has been bought a booking system a restaurant review company and a luxury travel agent. The bank one of the flagship U.S. financial institutions has also built its own airport lounges and hired thousands of travel agents. And there will be a new website launched as well.

It’s all happening as the travel industry becomes ever more important for banks and credit card issuers.

The WSJ report said JPMorgan executives think the bank might be able to capture $15 billion in bookings in 2025 which would be five times what it handled before the recent purchases. That would make it the third-biggest travel agent in the country based on 2021 volumes per stats from Travel Weekly.

The report noted that this is still far smaller than the parent companies of the top two travel agents Booking.com and Expedia — both of which manage more than $70 billion.

JPMorgan’s goal is to turn the travel customers into “lifelong Chase fans” who will spend more with the bank.

JPMorgan also already has a stake in travel with its credit cards letting customers build up travel rewards and cashing them through the bank’s Ultimate Rewards booking site.

A handful of changes are coming to Delaware Christian School this year as the school tries to accommodate the continued growth in the building.

Perhaps most notable among those changes is the work associated with preparations for 13 new classrooms that are planned to be built next year. Delaware Christian is currently progressing through a $4 million fundraising campaign to finance the project. Jane Miner head of school at Delaware Christian said the school is more than two-thirds of the way through its capital campaign which began last summer.

Miner told The Gazette the hope is to finish the campaign by the end of the upcoming school year and should the financing be secured ground would be broken on the new building in the spring. When finished the additional classroom space will provide much-needed relief to the overcrowded elementary classes.

“At this present time we only have one elementary classroom per grade” Miner said. “So we’re hoping to double our elementary classrooms kindergarten through fifth grade and then have an extra room for intervention.”

Delaware Christian’s enrollment has increased by “quite a large amount” according to Miner which has hastened the need for more classrooms. Enrollment for the 2022-23 school year is projected to be around 380-4oo students. Miner said the school would like to have classroom sizes of 20 students per room but all current elementary classes are at 30 students per room at the moment.

Before the addition can be built Miner said Delaware Christian must first reconfigure its current space which includes constructing a new storage building to relocate the current storage space.

“Right now presently going on in order to put that building up on our west end we need to move some storage buildings” Miner said. “So right now the new storage building is going up. The foundation was just dug last week so we’re kind of moving some buildings around so that we can put that new building up.”

To remedy the packed classrooms in the interim the school has hired full-time aides for each of the elementary classrooms to assist teachers. Because the kindergarten class at Delaware Christian has experienced such considerable growth Miner said the school has added a second full-time teacher to essentially split the kindergarten class although they will still share the same classroom.

With the second kindergarten teacher position being filled by a current first grade teacher at the school Delaware Christian has hired a new first grade teacher. A new sixth grade teacher was also hired to account for the growth being experienced at the middle school level.

“That is kind of enhancing our middle school” Miner said of the personnel move. “We’re able to split our sixth grade into two divisions now because they are so large … That fifth and sixth grade age is where we’ve seen the most amount of growth mostly because the other classes we’re stopping them because we don’t have any place to go with them.

“Last school year we doubled the fifth grade and that was a first for us then. We hired a new teacher for that and as that whole group of kids is moving into sixth grade and even growing larger that’s why we hired another sixth grade teacher.”

Asked about the level of growth Delaware Christian is experiencing this year compared to years past Miner said that while there’s been consistent growth in recent years it’s been greater this year. Miner anticipates welcoming close to 40 new families to Delaware Christian this school year.

Although growth is sure to bring new challenges to Delaware Christian which Miner acknowledged she added that with growth also comes new opportunity.

“It’s kind of two-fold” Miner said. “I would say the challenge is to keep our academics excellent which is why we’ve hired additional staff to make sure that there is plenty of staff per student ratio.”

On the other hand she said “It’s growing our sports programs. Last year we went back to high school soccer teams which we’ve not had for a couple of years. We were able to open up some middle school and upper-elementary sports things because of that area growing. So it’s just opening so many more opportunities for our families.”

With growth unlikely to slow down anytime soon Miner anticipates starting up another building program shortly after the current campaign is finished. Among the projects she would like to see in the near future are an additional gymnasium and more high school classrooms. “That’s all in the future all in the Lord’s will” she said.

The high school administrative team will also look different this coming year following the retirement of Principal Tom Carroll who had been at Delaware Christian since 2015. A new position dean of students has been created and will be filled by David Mulligan. Miner said she will take on some of the academic responsibilities typically associated with the principal effectively splitting the traditional position into two roles.

“We’re just trying to transition into our growth and give us a little time to hire someone completely” Miner said of the new position adding that Mulligan’s role will be focused primarily on the culture within the building and creating a student-centric environment in the high school.

Miner went on to say of the culture she wants to see throughout the school “I want it to represent what we call the DCS way. D stands for demonstrating your faith — we want our students to be strong and confident in their faith. C stands for caring for others more than themselves — I want the school to be representative of a real service heart to be service-oriented to influence the community with that service. S stands for studying to the best of your ability — we definitely want to be an academically excellent school. And all of those things sort of roll in together as the students are in the hallways.”

The property a Victorian terrace ground-floor flat in Kilburn Northwest London which she shares with husband Marc and one-year-old daughter Poppy originally had just one bedroom.

But the couple reconfigured it to create another bedroom and improve its layout for family life. ‘The kitchen area was originally dark and poky with a wall separating it from a run-down utility room’ says Jess who’s co-founder of retro-style locker brand Mustard Made. ‘

The whole space felt completely disjointed.’ Their new open-plan kitchen-living area was the first step in their renovation project. ‘To conjure the feeling of space we knocked down the wall between the kitchen and utility area.’

They also dug down ensuring the floor was the same level as the garden to allow the new space to extend seamlessly outdoors. Double french doors were added to allow light to fill the room throughout the day.

The open-plan living area needed a fabulous sofa and this one by boconcept.co.uk is Jess’s pride and joy. ‘It was a splurge but it’s a sofa for life.’ The artwork is by emmielouart.com. For a similar fern cushion try oka.com

Poppy’s room used to be Jess and Marc’s bedroom. The main bedroom is now where the living room used to be. Jess’s home fuses style with practicality. The walls were painted predominantly white ‘which gave us more flexibility to add brighter shades through accessories’ explains Jess.

Savvy style solutions feature throughout. ‘I am always on the hunt for easy updates that can quickly refresh a space such as mirrors throws and rugs.’ Seamless storage is of course a must too for locker queen Jess.

Everything from toys clothes and medical supplies are cleverly tucked away within easy reach using clever storage and in the kitchen her pièce de résistance a hidden pantry. Check out the new limited edition Poppy lockers at uk.mustardmade.com.

ExxonMobil and Chevron have reported a massive leap in profits as Americans struggle with record high gas prices at the pump.

Exxon reported second-quarter profits of $17.6 billion - close to double its first quarter. Profits were up 273 per cent on the same period of 2021.

Chevron made $11.4bn - up 74 per cent from the first quarter of 2022 and 247 per cent on the same quarter last year.

Shell also reported record profits of $11.5bn more than doubling earnings from $5.5bn in April-June 2021. Profits were up from $9.1bn in the first quarter of 2022.

“Earnings and cash flow benefited from increased production higher realizations and tight cost control” said Darren Woods Exxon’s chairman and chief executive officer in a statement.

“Strong second-quarter results reflect our focus on the fundamentals and the investments we put in motion several years ago and sustained through the depths of the pandemic.”

Exxon based in Irving Texas increased its oil and gas production as crude prices hovered above $100 a barrel. Revenue at Exxon skyrocketed to $115.68bn up from $67.74 billion during the same quarter last year.

“Exxon made more money than God this year” President Joe Biden noted at the White House last month.

Meanwhile families are facing a cost of living crisis over basic necessities. Gas prices have soared in the US this year with the average now at $4.26 a gallon. The high energy prices are spilling out across the economy driving up prices across the board.

Part of the reason why US gas prices are so high is that fewer refineries are operating in the US than before the pandemic so production has been cut.

The war in Ukraine and subsequent sanctions against Russia a major gas supplier has also seen prices jump in the fossil (natural) gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector.

Competition over a reduced LNG supply particularly in Europe which relies heavily on Russian gas has also driven up the price.

In addition to oil company executives shareholders reaped benefits of high energy prices during the quarter too. Exxon earned $4.21 per share exceeding analyst expectations of $4.02 per share according to analysts polled by Factset. Chevron earned $5.95 per share exceeding analyst expectations of $5.16 per share.

Shares of both companies jumped another 3 per cent before Wall Street opened on Friday.

Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report





Algeria Nigeria and Niger have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to build a natural gas pipeline across the Sahara Desert Algeria’s Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab announced yesterday.

In a related development ExxonMobil and Chevron yesterday smashed profit records in Q2 as the surging energy prices that followed the war delivered a windfall for the oil supermajors.

The three countries had agreed in June to revive decades-old talks over the project a potential opportunity for Europe to diversify its gas sources.

Arkab told reporters after the signing ceremony that the three countries would continue talks to achieve the project as quickly as possible.

The Trans-Saharan gas pipeline is an estimated $13 billion project that could send up to 30 billion cubic metres a year of supplies to Europe.

The pipeline is expected to span around 4000 kilometres and has been slated to start in Warri Nigeria and to end in Hassi R’Mel Algeria where it would connect to existing pipelines that run to Europe.

The idea was first proposed more than 40 years ago and an agreement signed between the countries in 2009 but progress had stalled a Reuters report stated.

Algeria exported 54 billion cubic meters of gas in 2021 mainly to Italy and Spain.

The MoU was signed in Algiers by the Algerian Minister of Energy and Mines Arkab; Nigerian Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Timipre Sylva and Niger Minister of Energy and Renewables Mahamane Mahamadou.

In 2009 an accord was signed by Nigeria Niger and Algeria to build the Trans Saharan gas pipeline project which was to be completed in 2015. But for various reasons including growing security concerns the project was stopped temporarily.

The proposed pipeline will source natural gas from Nigeria and traverse north through Niger and further to Algeria.

The revival of the project is coming against the backdrop of pressure from the European Union (EU) on African countries to ramp up production following the supply distortions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.

Meanwhile as Nigeria continues to grapple with crude oil production and petrol subsidy challenges ExxonMobil and Chevron yesterday smashed profit records in Q2 as the surging energy prices that followed the war delivered a windfall for the oil supermajors.

The huge earnings came as consumers reel from sky-high fuel costs that have helped drive inflation to levels not seen in decades across the US and Europe Africa and other parts of the world threatening a political backlash against energy companies.

Exxon’s second-quarter net profit was $17.8 billion beating analysts’ estimates of $16.9 billion according to data compiled by S&P Capital IQ. The previous record quarterly profit for the company was $15.9 billion in 2012 another year of elevated oil prices.

Chevron’s Q2 profit was $11.6 billion also its highest quarterly profit and easily surpassing consensus estimates of $9.9 billion.

“Earnings and cash flow benefited from increased production higher realisations and tight cost control” said Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods.

The blockbuster profits came after UK-based Shell on Thursday reported its second consecutive record-breaking quarter with adjusted earnings of $11.5 billion. France’s TotalEnergies on the same day said profits in the quarter surged to $9.8 billion almost triple the same time a year ago.

The five western oil supermajors — Exxon Chevron Shell BP and TotalEnergies — are together on track to generate well over $50 billion in profits in the three months to the end of June.

Italian rival Eni yesterday also announced bumper quarterly results boosting returns to investors after a fourfold year-on-year rise in adjusted net profit to €3.81 billion the Financial Times reported.

Exxon and Chevron’s “downstream” oil refining businesses drove their soaring results after profit margins from selling refined fuels above the cost of buying crude oil exploded to record highs.",,,

The Seattle-based e-commerce giant also said it is making progress in controlling some of the excess costs from its massive expansion during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Amazon lost USD2.03 billion or 20 cents per share in the three-month period ended on June 30 driven by a USD3.9 billion write-down of the value of its stock investment in electric vehicle start-up Rivian Automotive.

That compared to a profit of USD7.78 billion a year ago. It posted a loss of USD3.84 billion in this year’s first quarter its first quarterly loss since 2015 which was also marked by a large Rivian write-down. Analysts had been expecting a 12-cent profit in the latest quarter according to FactSet.

But Wall Street was cheered by Amazon’s USD121.2 billion in revenue topping expectations of USD119 billion. The results came as the company attempts to navigate shifting consumer demand and higher costs while curtailing the glut of warehouses it acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Shares in Amazon.com Inc. rose almost 14 per cent in after-hours trading.

CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement Amazon is seeing its revenue accelerate as it invests in its Prime membership and offers more benefits to members such as its recent deal to give free access to meal delivery service Grubhub for a year.

Subscription services have grown 10 per cent compared to the prior year. Some analysts estimate the company generated roughly USD4.6 billion in revenue during its Prime Day shopping event which it held during the second quarter last year but moved to the third in 2022. Amazon noted sales have also been dampened by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

“Against this context Amazon’s performance is reasonable enough – but it is still a very long way from the stellar numbers Amazon usually produces” said managing director of GlobalData Neil Saunders.

Jassy noted the company continues to feel inflationary pressure from higher energy and transportation costs but it’s been making progress controlling expenses related to its fulfillment network.

Between 2019 and 2021 Amazon nearly doubled the number of warehouses and data centres it leased and owned to keep up with rising consumer demand. But as consumers shifted their habits Amazon found itself with too many workers and too much space which added billions in extra costs.

The company has been subleasing some of its warehouses ending some of its leases and deferring construction on others to deal with the problem.

Amazon’s Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said during a media call on Thursday the company is slowing down its expansion plans for this year and the next to better align with customer demand. He said the company is also planning to shift capital investments towards its cloud-computing unit AWS.

Amazon’s retail operations both internationally and in North America reported operating losses showing the company is suffering the same fate as Walmart and Target Saunders said. Costs are outpacing sales and growth though Amazon can dip into other profit pools – like AWS – to protect its overall performance he said.

AWS which is facing increasing competition from Microsoft Azure earned USD19.74 billion in revenue a 33-per-cent jump from last year. While Amazon’s advertising unit another burgeoning moneymaker pulled in USD8.76 billion an 18 per cent increase from last year.

On the labour side Amazon has been able to reduced its headcount through attrition and staffing levels were more in-line with demand Olsavsky said. The company had 1.52 million employees by the end of June down 6.1 per cent from the first quarter. The performance of the broader economy is expected to shape its hiring plans moving forward.

“I don’t think you’ll see us hiring at the same pace we did over the last year or in last few years” Olsavsky said adding the company will continue to hire targetted positions for profitable units like its advertising business and AWS.

Despite Wall Street’s celebration the e-commerce and tech giant’s revenue growth still landed at a relatively sluggish seven per cent about the same as the first quarter of this year and its slowest in about two decades.

It comes as the pandemic-induced consumer reliance on online shopping dies down and Americans are shifting their spending habits away from things like home improvements towards travelling and eating out.",,,,,,,,,

No driver has a clear advantage yet. Every car has its full torque steering control and the bodies aren’t yet softened by impacts.

“It’s like a fight to the death” said McCarrick of Simpson Minn. “A legal fight to the death.”

McCarrick is a third-generation demolition driver. Growing up he knew it was something he would do someday. At age 19 McCarrick has lost count of how many derbies he has competed in.

For Brady Keefer of Stewartville the Sunday heat at the Olmsted County fairgrounds for drivers under 21 years of age was his second derby.

The event was one of the Impact Motorsports Promotions’ demolition derby heats at the Olmsted County Fairgrounds Sunday.

“It seemed fun and I would have been here anyway” Keefer said adding he would be at the fairgrounds watching the derby anyway.

“I definitely didn’t talk you into it” McCarrick said.

“Well you did” Keefer responded.

McCarrick has been competing in demolition derbies since he was 13.

“It’s a feeling you can’t explain” he said about competing.

The key to a successful heat?

“Always keep moving and keep your head on a swivel” he said. “I always just try to survive the first five minutes.”

After that it’s a grind dealing with diminishing control and torque and scoring critical hits on the surviving opponents.

McCarrick and Keefer competed in the same heat. That didn’t mean they were off limits on the track.

“If it came down to it” McCarrick said.

The two lasted well into the heat but were both out of the competition by the time it was narrowed to two drivers.

“We didn’t quite make it but we gave her hell” McCarrick said.

Isaac Holland and Cassandra Hall were the last two with Holland finally incapacitating Hall’s car on the west side of the track.

However the 2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic will run from June 26-July 2 according to the PGA Tour schedule for next season released Monday placing it right back on the early July schedule. Action takes place two weeks after the U.S. Open and three weeks before the British Open.

THE GRAND PRIZE:How should Tony Finau spend $1.5 million Rocket Mortgage Classic prize? Golf fans have ideas

SCENES FROM WEEKEND:I went looking for LIV Golf fans at 2022 Rocket Mortgage Classic. Here's what I found.

This year's Rocket Mortgage Classic featured a quality field as world No. 13 Tony Finau set the tournament record (26-under 262) and won his second straight PGA Tour event. World No. 4 golfer Patrick Cantlay finished tied for second in his first trip to Detroit. World No. 17 golfer Cameron Young a standout rookie and Open Championship runner up finished tied for second with Cantlay.

“By all measures the 2022 Rocket Mortgage Classic was a smashing success"" said Jason Langwell executive director of the tournament. ""...To crown a champion such as Tony Finau on Sunday afternoon after watching his magnificent performance over the course of four days at Detroit Golf Club was truly special.""

This year players were lured by the late-season opportunity to gain leverage in the FedEx Cup Standings. Detroit held the next to last regular season event; the Wyndham Championship in Greensboro North Carolina is this weekend followed by the FedEx Cup Playoff in Memphis.

No. 14 Will Zalatoris and No. 20 Max Homa were notables in the postseason race who came to the Rocket Mortgage Classic. Former Masters winner Adam Scott and fan favorite Rickie Fowler also made appearances. But no one in the field matched the star power of past competitors Dustin Johnson Phil Mickelson and Bryson DeChambeau now of LIV Golf.

Attracting another top star might be easier now that that the tournament is back to its early July date. World No. 7 Justin Thomas had spoken with Rocket officials about playing this year but could be interested earlier in next season when not picking his spots ahead of the postseason.

“We are already looking forward to next year’s Rocket Mortgage Classic and are excited about our dates which fall during the same week as our inaugural event in 2019 and last year’s tournament both of which produced tremendous crowds"" Langwell said.

The United States Postal Service has served the American people for almost 250 years as one of the oldest and most venerable US institutions. You’ll recognize agency members by those timeless navy blue shorts and the eagle logo on the side of their trucks. The USPS has been making deliveries for centuries yet many Americans still don’t fully grasp the organization’s mailing laws. Namely what is the risk of mailing or shipping weed or edibles through the mail?

The short answer: mailing flower edibles vapes or any other cannabis product is federally illegal. Postal inspectors play a key role in helping wage the nation’s War on Drugs including cannabis. As one of the country’s oldest law enforcement agencies they work to identify and prosecute major drug mailers and intercept illegal drug proceeds that traffickers attempt to send through the mail.

But we know what you’re thinking: How many of those billions of packages being mailed each year contain cannabis? Are people getting away with mailing cannabis? Can I mail weed and not get caught? Is it worth risking the consequences? The long answer is a little more complicated and we’re here to break it down.

Potential penalties for mailing weed

Though states can legalize marijuana possession under local law possession for any reason outside limited research technically remains a federal crime as does shipping cannabis through the mail. Additionally as a government agency the United States Postal Service is subject to federal law; any illegal use of their services is a felony. Plus marijuana is still a Schedule I drug.

That means anything under 50 grams can potentially get you up to five years in a federal penitentiary and the penalties only increase as the amount grows. More than 200 federal laws protect the sanctity of the US mail enforced by the US Postal Inspection Service.

We should also note that even if you did not mail the package and are only the recipient your knowledge and participation in the planning of the shipping makes you just as guilty as the person who mailed the package. Once a package is seized a person is liable to face prosecution in both the state in which it was mailed as well as the state in which it was delivered. It’s totally at the discretion of the prosecutor.

Mailing hemp and delta-8 products

With the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill came the federal legalization of hemp and hemp-derived products which are defined as having less than 0.3% THC. Hemp products can be mailed legally within the United States by the USPS as well as private mailers like FedEx and UPS though there are some exceptions such as vaporizers and legality depends on if the sender or delivery state has laws in place that prohibit it.

Now you might be thinking that the rise of delta-8 THC a hemp-derived cannabinoid with intoxicating effects that differs from delta-9 offers a loophole. You can extract it from federally-legal hemp plants so you should be able to ship it anywhere in the country right? Well no. Delta-8’s legal status currently exists in a gray area; while the DEA has listed it alongside delta-9 THC on its scheduled substances list it hasn’t been officially scheduled as such yet.

But some states have passed their own laws against shipping and selling it likely because its products do not have to be tested and regulated like delta-9 THC. So if you live in a state that allows it yes you can ship delta-8 products (minus vapes) through the USPS.

What about mailing weed through private couriers like UPS or FedEx?

In terms of alternative carriers within the US there are a number of private couriers. The big three outside of USPS are FedEx UPS and DHL. A discerning cannabis shipper might ask “Which service should I choose and are any of these a better safer option than USPS?” Surely these private companies offer the paying customers greater protection against government interference and warrantless searches?

The answer is a resounding no. FedEx UPS and DHL all specify in their terms of service that they reserve the right to open and inspect any package at their own discretion. They all also specify that shipping any form of marijuana remains illegal and “unacceptable.” When you drop your package off at the FedEx or UPS store to be mailed you’re putting the property into the possession of a third party and the Supreme Court has ruled that giving your package to a third party “removes any reasonable expectation of privacy.” We should note that none of these couriers’ policies explicitly address delta-8 products.

FedEx

According to their terms and conditions FedEx not only prohibits the mailing of cannabis flower and THC products but also hemp plants oil and seeds. Compliant CBD products however can now be shipped. To compound this in 2014 the US Department of Justice indicted FedEx with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances over its alleged role in transporting illegal prescription drugs. While this isn’t marijuana it does strongly indicate that FedEx and other private couriers will be scrutinizing packages much more closely for any illegal substances.

UPS

UPS similarly prohibits shipping any cannabis products but it does allow for raw hemp plants and CBD products that comply with state and federal laws (minus vapes) as long as they are shipped domestically and do not come from companies who also produce or handle marijuana or THC products.

DHL

DHL accepts packages containing hemp plants and derived products with under 0.3% THC but only within the US. While DHL claims to inspect 100% of their packages they and other couriers are not required to x-ray all shipments.

The USPS seems like the safest bet

In contrast to these policies the US Postal Service seems like the preferred carrier for many drug shippers because it offers more stringent Fourth Amendment protection. Postal inspectors must acquire a search warrant based on probable cause before inspecting mail and parcels. According to the USPS:

“…first class letters and parcels are protected against search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution and as such cannot be opened without a search warrant.”

However although postal inspectors do have to obtain a warrant to search a suspicious package suspicion alone is enough to get parcels singled out and tracked. USPS actively encourages workers and the public to get involved in the identification of packages containing drugs by offering $50000 to anyone who provides information that leads to the arrest and indictment of a drug trafficker.

When it comes right down to the illegal transportation of cannabis via mail USPS is—relatively!—your safest bet. And we mean relatively. Remember the act is an illegal one and without a doubt carries a significant level of risk.

What happens when USPS or FedEx finds weed in packages? Are there penalties?

Crunching the numbers the Postal Service faces an enormous task in preventing the trafficking of illicit substances. Put simply the sheer volume of packages the carrier handles every day offers the chance that contraband packages will get delivered unchecked; the United States Postal Inspection Service enforces over 200 laws with over 1200 inspectors. They can put their collective shoulder to the wheel but no matter how hard they try it is virtually impossible for the USPS to catch all wrongdoers. In 2015 alone they seized 34000 pounds of marijuana from mailed packages.

For third party couriers the onus of responsibility falls on them to report illicit packages to the authorities who can acquire warrants and open investigations. Without reported data it’s impossible to estimate how many packages found to contain marijuana or other scheduled substances have been cited to open investigations.

Shipping drugs through the mail probably seems safer than it should be. The USPS as well as partnering law enforcement agencies simply don’t have the resources to try to figure out where the drugs are coming from and who’s expecting them.

However it would be unfair to fault the USPS in the matter; they are just not equipped to x-ray and investigate each package nor is there an official x-ray policy. Not only are packages given extra protection as we’ve outlined but the agency has also been losing money pretty much every year for the last decade due to a decrease in mail volume. The increasingly under-resourced organization faces increasing pressure to downsize exerted by the government.

In 2016 despite turning a profit in a financial quarter for the first time in five years President Obama still proposed the agency slash 12000 employees in his fiscal 2017 budget. The Trump-appointed and current Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has made further cuts to plant locations office hours and mail delivery times.

Does where I’m mailing the weed to impact the risk?

In short no. Since the USPS operates on federal law it remains illegal and risky to mail cannabis and cannabis products anywhere in the US including out of the country state to state and within a state even if medical and/or adult-use laws are in place. Like third party couriers the USPS does ship compliant hemp-derived products within the US if state laws allow and most states allow the shipping of delta-8 products.

What makes a package suspicious?

Post inspectors have a long list of signs and tells that help them determine if a package could contain marijuana or other illicit substances. In fact in 2016 the USPS founded the Administrative Non-Mailability Protocol (ANP) program which “does not require postal inspectors to obtain search warrants to open detained packages.” In fact if a package is detained and they don’t receive a response form the mailer or addressee in 21 days the package is considered abandoned and they can open it anyway. Factors that raise suspicion with packages include:

Outdated handwritten or missing return addresses

Odd shapes

Excessively taped

Excessive postage

Leaking unidentifiable substances

Excessive odor

What about mailing edibles cartridges and concentrates?

Unfortunately if it’s got any THC above 0.3% any cannabis-derived edible cartridge concentrate and even topical can be seized and even used as proof of a drug-trafficking crime. Even CBD and delta-8 vapes are prohibited though CBD and delta-8 edibles and concentrates that comply with federal and state regulations are allowed.

Drug trafficking is an existing problem

Ever since the closure of the infamous Silk Road and the media furor surrounding it people now know of the existence and the nefarious proclivities of particular groups within the Dark Net. Most Americans can access illegal substances with a simple click thanks to Internet access Dark Net markets and social networks like Instagram. Still these hidden online drug dealers don’t have access to some secret underground delivery method us mere mortals are unaware of; they simply use the Postal Service.

According to former Attorney General Eric Holder the problem is endemic:

“The postal service—the mails are—being used to facilitate drug dealing … It is shocking to see the amount of drugs that get pumped into communities all around this country through our mail system and we have to deal with that.”

Leafly previously contacted the Postal Service in the hope of getting more information on their policies regarding illicit substances in particular cannabis being transported in the mail. The USPS promptly responded while also providing some useful data:

“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is committed to eradicating illegal drugs and their proceeds from the U.S. Mail. We pursue traffickers of all forms of illegal narcotics—including marijuana which remains illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act and is therefore unmailable. Our prohibited narcotics program focuses on the disruption of organized narcotics-trafficking operations to help protect employees and customers from the violence related to drug trafficking and to inhibit the spread of illegal or unmailable substances into neighborhoods across America.”

On average 1000 suspects are arrested by postal inspectors each year for trafficking drugs and laundering drug money via the U.S mail in 2019 they made over 2500. In addition to seizing cash obtained through criminal activity postal inspectors have used federal forfeiture laws to seize houses vehicles boats artwork and other high-value items purchased with drug money.

Statistical trends: Mailing marijuana and other drugs

Despite these hefty risks and the fact more than half the country has legal access to either medicinal or adult use programs some cannabis users continue to dismiss the run-of-the-mill driving delivery system and keep mailing their product. In 2019 the USPS processed almost 55000 packages they suspected of containing marijuana.

The black market even in adult-use states continues to thrive so many might find mailing weed a lucrative endeavor. Even as DEA seizures od marijuana continue to decline year after year it’s unclear if this trend will be reflected in weed packaged mailed.

We’ve previously reported that while the overall number and weight of marijuana package seizures has been declining for years there was an uptick in 2016; since then however the numbers seem to decline but no one really knows just how much marijuana successfully makes it through the Postal Service undiscovered. Is it just a coincidence though that the level of detected cannabis has fallen as more states wholly legalize?

Prohibition has been seen in the past to encourage and incentivize the black market. Perhaps as cannabis becomes increasingly mainstream and regulated the lure of the black market will wane through easier access and the realization that shipping the drug is no longer worth the risk of harsh federal charges.

Why do people risk getting caught mailing cannabis?

Is it really such a bad thing to put some eighths in the mail? Why are there so many people willing to take a chance on something like mailing cannabis? Actually the data shows that it’s likely happening less and less.

Increasingly favorable legislation in the US coupled with Canada’s federal legalization and Mexico’s recent decriminalization means more legal avenues for cannabis careers and by extension a drop in related crimes. The latest data shows that while agents hit a seizures pinnacle in 2009 getting their hands on around 4 million pounds of cannabis they only confiscated about 1.5 million pounds last year. In 2021 the DEA made less than 1000 marijuana trafficking charges.

But let’s face it the USPS has been in financial trouble for the better part of a decade. In the past 10 years total volume has declined by more than 56 billion pieces (or 26%) first-class mail volume has declined by 34.5 billion pieces and single-piece first-class mail (primarily letters bearing postage stamps) has declined by 24.4 billion pieces.This translates to $47 billion in operating losses since 1971. Ultimately can beggars be choosers? To paraphrase Gertrude Stein traffic is traffic is traffic.

As the population and economy of Northern Colorado continue to grow companies and developers are flocking to build industrial logistics and distribution facilities to support the region’s needs. Even with the state’s population growth slowing and inflation and supply-chain constrictions dragging on the economy demand for these types of spaces in Northern Colorado remains at record levels.

“It’s no secret that all of these spec industrial buildings are coming” said Kelly Jones economic development director for Loveland. “What’s slightly surprising is the pace they’re coming at now. I can tell you just by looking at the permits and activity in our queue it’s not slowing down.”

Mike Eyer first vice president for the commercial brokerage CBRE said a record 600000 square feet of industrial space have been leased in Northern Colorado through the first two quarters of 2022. About 900000 square feet more are in the pipeline to be delivered. Buildings are also being absorbed more quickly than normal Eyer said. Usually it takes about a year and a half to two years to fully lease out industrial projects of this scale. Now most buildings are fully leased out within a year of completion.

“It’s still true on a number of fronts (that the industrial market remains hot)” Eyer said. “There is still a pretty strong appetite from developers looking to gain entry into the market.”

The market they’re trying to enter is one that has experienced robust growth over the past decade. Between 2010 and 2020 Weld and Larimer counties were the second-and-fifth-fastest-growing counties in the state — Weld grew 30 percent Larimer 20 percent.

Some of the individual municipalities in the region have grown exponentially. Timnath grew 938 percent. Severance and Berthoud each experienced greater than 100% growth. Wellington Windsor and Johnstown grew more than 75 percent. Lochbuie Frederick Firestone Erie Dacono Milliken and Mead grew more than 40 percent. Jobs in Northern Colorado grew by 9.3 percent from 2015 to 2020.

Although statewide population growth slowed in 2021 the state is still expected to reach 6.5 million inhabitants by 2030.

“Assuming the population growth trajectory remains the same you’ll continue to see a number of these companies come to the area” Eyer said.

Clyde Wood president of commercial development for McWhinney Real Estate Services Inc. said it’s no secret why the need for industrial distribution and logistics facilities has increased along with the population.

“I think the connection is pretty clear” Wood said. “Over the years as population growth and the new-home market have been robust for several years those industries that support that growth need space. The connection is pretty clear why we’re seeing so many of those growing and needing space here.”

The list of major companies to move into these types of spaces in Northern Colorado over the past few years is impressive. McWhinney made the first big splash with Centerra Industrial a 660000-square-foot campus in Loveland. In 2016 it landed Safelite Group Inc. as one of the area’s first major Class A industrial tenants. Amazon and Home Depot also leased space in Centerra Industrial.

“That was fairly pioneering at the time” Wood said. “I think that caught a lot of people’s attention.”

Hines Interests LP and U-Haul both also leased space in Loveland on Byrd Drive. Denver developer Etkin Johnson built Axis 25 in the city.

Further south along Interstate 25 Mead has also made itself a logistics hub. It landed a FedEx regional distribution terminal in 2020. Multiple other industrial distribution facilities are underway: Elevation25 by Silver Point Development and Access 25 by The Broe Group.

Access 25 will be the only dual highway-rail-access park in the region and it has already landed Home Depot as a tenant.

FedEx also has a regional distribution facility in Johnstown in McWhinney’s Iron Horse industrial park.

Then there’s the crown jewel: the 3.87-million-square-foot logistics center Amazon is building in east Loveland. That facility which is slated to open in 2024 could have 62 loading docks and employ more than 1000 people.

Many of these companies previously had a presence in the state but not in Northern Colorado

“A lot of them have been in Denver and are looking to plant a flag up here” Eyer said. “Prior to two or three years ago the region didn’t have the population to support that.”

This means that municipalities that developers and large companies previously wouldn’t have considered are now on the map for potentially massive developments.

“Cities like Loveland and Johnstown we’re all getting the looks we wouldn’t get 10 years ago” Jones said. “The speed at which the consumer is wanting products is forcing companies to put their distribution facilities in locations closer to population centers.”

Getting the Amazon logistics center was a multi-year journey for Loveland one the city hopes will not stop with this facility.

“It’s difficult to land these” Jones said. “The process we went through was not easy. There is prestige in getting that. It was very competitive. It points other developers toward us … It was a huge coup to earn this from one of the world’s largest companies. Eventually we would like to keep building this relationship as they get familiar with us. There’s momentum beyond just that facility.”

For other projects in the region ones that aren’t purpose-built for a company such as Amazon competition for tenants will be fierce Eyer said.

“These projects are all very similar” Eyer said. “The buildings are similar. For the most part the locations are close. It’s a very competitive market. Developers that started construction a year ago have a significant advantage over those starting now because they have a lower cost basis. These buildings are almost like commodities where whoever can offer the most competitive lease rate is going to win.”

How long this trend can continue is dependent on how the region’s population and economy continue to grow. The need for more industrial logistics and distribution facilities should scale along with the area’s growth. At what point — if any — the industrial market could become oversaturated is unknown but it’s a factor weighing on the mind of experts.

“I would say absolutely” Wood said. “In Northern Colorado it’s something we are very focused on. For several years we were the only game in town. We proved the concept that there is demand for Class A industrial space up here. That got the interest of outside developers. They want a piece of the pie but that pie is not nearly as large as metro Denver. Even though demand is steady it’s not that deep … We are very cautious about oversupply but we are still bullish on the market in general.”

Even so Eyer said that hasn’t happened yet.

“I think we haven’t reached that saturation point” Eyer said. “I think we have the demand to handle what is currently being built. It’s impossible to tell how much demand there will be. We’re just not there yet. We’re seeing record leasing activity. I have no doubt we’ll absorb the current construction.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9nb2xmL25ld3MvMjAyMi1yb2NrZXQtbW9ydGdhZ2UtY2xhc3NpYy1mdWxsLWZpZWxkLXB1cnNlLXBheW91dHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Rocket Mortgage Classic Final Payouts: Tony Finau Wins $1512000,"In the penultimate event on the regular season schedule Tony Finau won for the second consecutive week to move into the FedEx Cup top 10.

Its plan to be a launchpad for a solar manufacturing resurgence was already audacious in an industry so dominated by China whose cheap products drove the closure of many American solar plants. Government investment championed by the White House was supposed to position domestic firms to compete but a paralyzed Congress was refusing to write the check.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYzI2LmNvbS9mb25kZHVsYWMvbWVyY3VyeS1tYXJpbmUtcGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC1hbGxpYW50LWVuZXJneS10by1idWlsZC1zb2xhci1mYXJt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mercury Marine partners with Alliant Energy to build solar farm,"FOND DU LAC (NBC 26) — Mercury Marine is building a solar array—also called a solar farm—in eastern Fond du Lac County thanks to a partnership with Alliant Energy. The 5-megawatt 32-acre project will generate electricity to power the equivalent of 1300 homes and will offset the Mercury Marine Fond du Lac campus's energy usage by 10%.

“We're a company that's here in Fond du Lac that is here to stay and we’re advancing what we can through sustainability and renewable energy"" said Scott Louks the Mercury Marine sustainability manager.

This facility will be located on a privately-owned family farm in eastern Fond du Lac. Because of this setting it has one particularly unique aspect: sheep which Louks describes as ""groundskeepers"" of the facility. And the relationship is symbiotic as the sheep reap the benefits of the solar panels as well.

“The solar project is a great fit for our grazing flock because the animals will get the extra benefit of shade in their pasture under their solar panels where currently they are grazing in a field and don't have the extra benefit of shade"" Farm owner Olivia Halbur said.

Mercury Marine is paying for all costs to tie the solar facility to the power grid but they could not disclose the project's price tag.

The energy will be distributed through a partnership with Alliant Energy.

""We're pleased to help them move in the right direction because we know sustainability and renewable energy is the future"" Chris Caporale Alliant Energy communications partner said.

The project is slated to be completed by spring of next year.

Mercury Marine took on its first solar project in 2017—with a 2000-panel array at the company’s eastern headquarters in Belgium. Its first solar project in the U.S. was at its world headquarters in Fond du Lac where it installed 320 panels on its roof.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pZGVhc3RyZWFtLm9yZy9uZXdzL2Vudmlyb25tZW50LWVuZXJneS8yMDIyLTA3LTMwL29oaW9zLWpvYi1ncm93dGgtaW4tdGhlLXNvbGFyLWVuZXJneS1pbmR1c3RyeS1yZW1haW5zLXN0ZWFkeS1zdXJ2ZXktc2F5c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ohio's job growth in the solar energy industry remains steady survey says,"Ohio added 879 new jobs in the solar energy industry last year according to a new study from BW Research Partnership.

Larry Sherwood is the CEO of the nonprofit The Interstate Renewable Energy Council that commissioned the comprehensive study. It took data from the Department of Energy's 2022 United States Energy and Employment Report and from follow-up surveys of individual solar energy companies.

Sherwood said Ohio's relatively strong solar energy job numbers can be attributed to a few things.

""The number of installations in Ohio is growing and growing rapidly and Ohio also has more manufacturing jobs than most other states"" he said in an interview with WYSO.

Most of the state's manufacturing jobs are at the First Solar panel factory near Toledo. First Solar is slated to be the largest solar panel producer outside of China by 2023.

More locally companies have applied to build utility-scale solar installations in Champaign Clinton Greene Logan and Preble counties. Thousand-plus acre solar farms have already been constructed and are up and running in Brown Hardin and Highlandcounties. The IBEW Local 82 in Dayton now includes solar panel work in its electrician apprenticeship training program to help meet the local demand.

Despite the growth in Ohio's solar energy industry in 2021 Sherwood said 2022 brought some headwinds.

""There have been trade issues that have caused difficulty in importing some solar products. There have also been general supply chain issues that we've seen throughout the economy after the pandemic and then the lack of a real long term policy on the national level has also inhibited growth.""

At the state level legislation has also inhibited renewable energy's growth in Ohio. Specifically HB6and SB52 subsidized coal and nuclear energy generation and added hurdles to utility-scale solar development respectively.

Anticipated savings for the City over the 25-year lifespan of the project are estimated to be more than $270000. This is the first solar project of many that the City hopes to install at municipal facilities to offset energy use and meet the City’s 100% renewable electricity goal by year 2030.

Prior to the cutting of the green ribbon speakers discussed the milestone project and its significance not only to Goleta but to the region.

Mayor Paula Perotte said “This is a truly historic day for the City of Goleta. Monarch 1 named for our famed butterfly is the first municipal solar installation for the City and represents years of hard work and the City’s dedication to a greener more sustainable future.”

Councilmember Kyle Richards said “This project is not only a reminder of the City’s commitment to sustainability but a reminder that we as a community are coming together to address climate change. We are moving forward to meet our goals to reduce our carbon footprint and in the process we are working to safeguard our region against vulnerabilities due to wildfires and grid disruptions.”

2nd District Santa Barbara County Supervisor Gregg Hart was impressed with the event turnout and said ““The Goodland continues to be at the forefront of our regional efforts to advance sustainability. This project demonstrates the City of Goleta’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions while generating clean energy and putting our values into practice.”

Planning and Environmental Review Director Peter Imhof said “The Monarch 1 Solar Project is a cornerstone of the City’s Strategic Energy Plan and our first step towards developing onsite generation at City facilities. It not only meets our environmental goals but shows fiscal prudence and responsibility.”

“Our City is committed to completing more projects like Monarch 1 to build a more climate resilient community and clean energy future” said the City’s new Sustainability Manager Dana Murray. “I look forward to collaborating with our elected officials staff residents and stakeholders to ensure that Goleta is prepared for and buffered from the local effects of climate change while reducing our City’s carbon emissions.”

The head of Ford Blue the company’s traditional business in internal combustion engine vehicles Kumar Galhotra said that the US automaker is looking to fix these issues as soon as possible and looking to make quality its top priority.

Ford's CEO Jim Farley has been promising to cut down billions from warranty repair costs since he took the lead in October 2020 and the company made progress last year. But this year Ford had to recall of 100000 hybrid models due to a fire risk and stop delivering the popular Mach-E due to a defect that could cut power to the vehicle while in motion. Federal investigators are looking into the catastrophic engine failures on Ford's hot-selling Bronco SUV.

On a call with analysts Farley said that the company continues to be hampered by recalls and customer satisfaction actions. “This affects our cost but more importantly it falls short on our most fundamental commitment to our customers"" Farley said.

Ford is also closely monitoring social media to see what customers are complaining about. To analyze customer complaints Ford has also hired a quality expert from researcher JD Power. Further the company is beefing up engineering manufacturing and supplier involvement. “We have more work to do in this space"" Farley said.

In a separate development Ford has launched the purpose-built F-150 Lightning pickup truck for police fleet in the US called Ford F-150 Lightning Pro SSV. The vehicle is modern always-on work-ready truck and will help police departments save costs drive efficiency and accelerate customers' sustainability goals. Ford vehicles have been in use in police departments for more than 70 years.

Yet legacy automaker Ford Motor says it plans to be profitably building millions of EVs a year in just four years.

This week the Detroit automaker gave investors a little more clarity about how it plans to reach that goal and transform its business built on gas-guzzling cars.

As electric vehicles account for a growing share of the global car market Ford in March announced it would reorganize its business and separate its internal-combustion engine and electric vehicle efforts. By 2026 it said it expects to build more than 2 million electric vehicles annually — about a third of its total global production — while expanding its operating profit margin.

Wall Street analysts were generally positive about the plan but some expressed skepticism about the lack of specifics around how the company plans to overcome the supply challenges in the market. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas called it a ""stretch"" goal and said he lacked confidence in Ford's ability to secure enough raw materials and tooling to manufacture batteries to even come close to its projection.

Ford addressed some of those concerns in another presentation on July 21 when it told investors that it has secured enough batteries to get to its near-term target: 600000 EVs per year by the end of 2023. As of now it said it has secured about 70% of what it needs to hit its 2026 goal.

Ford promised to share more about how it plans to hit its goals during its annual capital markets day next year. But during its second-quarter earnings call last week CEO Jim Farley gave some more hints about the automaker's strategy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hNDA3NjMwOTQvZm9yZC1nbS1wcmljZS1nb3VnaW5nLXNhbGVzLXJ1bGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford GM Push Harder to Stop New Car Flipping and Price Gouging,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a40763094/ford-gm-price-gouging-sales-rules/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hNDA3NjMwOTQvZm9yZC1nbS1wcmljZS1nb3VnaW5nLXNhbGVzLXJ1bGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZm9yZGF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy9oZXJlcy13aHkteW91ci1uZXctZm9yZC1oYXNudC1hcnJpdmVkLWF0LXlvdXItZGVhbGVyLXlldC_SAV9odHRwczovL2ZvcmRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvaGVyZXMtd2h5LXlvdXItbmV3LWZvcmQtaGFzbnQtYXJyaXZlZC1hdC15b3VyLWRlYWxlci15ZXQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here’s Why Your New Ford Hasn’t Arrived At Your Dealer Yet,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://fordauthority.com/2022/07/heres-why-your-new-ford-hasnt-arrived-at-your-dealer-yet/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZm9yZGF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy9oZXJlcy13aHkteW91ci1uZXctZm9yZC1oYXNudC1hcnJpdmVkLWF0LXlvdXItZGVhbGVyLXlldC_SAV9odHRwczovL2ZvcmRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvaGVyZXMtd2h5LXlvdXItbmV3LWZvcmQtaGFzbnQtYXJyaXZlZC1hdC15b3VyLWRlYWxlci15ZXQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLzIwMjIvMDcvMzAvZm9yZC1pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLXBvbGljZS12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLXRoZS1lbGVjdHJpYy1mLTE1MC1saWdodG5pbmcv0gGDAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F1dG9zLzIwMjIvMDcvMzAvZm9yZC1pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLXBvbGljZS12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLXRoZS1lbGVjdHJpYy1mLTE1MC1saWdodG5pbmcvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford introduces police version of the electric F-150 Lightning,"Ford Motor Co. will introduce a version of the all-electric F-150 Lightning for police use.

TOTTENHAM Ontario—Noah Goodwin stood tall Sunday at the Sotheby’s International Realty Canada Ontario Open. Actually he towered above the competition in all four rounds of the PGA TOUR Canada event to capture his first professional victory. The rookie did so in impressive fashion finishing 17-under and winning by seven shots. He also jumped into the top five in the Fortinet Cup standings improving 89 positions into the No. 4 slot.

“It’s still sinking in right now. It was just kind of one of those days everything fell into place. I wouldn’t change anything about it” Goodwin said. “The stars aligned for me this week.”

Goodwin’s margin of victory was the largest on the Canadian circuit since current PGA TOUR player Taylor Pendrith rolled to an eight-shot triumph over Kyle Mueller at the 2019 Quebec Open.

“I was just able to stay patient and give myself chances” Goodwin said. “I wasn’t trying to force anything or get too fancy—just played some consistent golf.”

Diagnosed with a growth-hormone deficiency as a child doctors told Goodwin he wouldn’t grow to be very big. That led to his focus on golf. The 22-year-old 5-foot-9 155-pounder was more than big enough to post the wire-to-wire tournament title. The Texan topped the leaderboard all four days at the Woodington Lake Golf Club becoming the first to do so on PGA TOUR Canada since Robby Shelton won the GolfBC Championship in 2017.

Goodwin’s final round featured highs and lows. Armed with a three-stroke lead when the day began he birdied the first hole. Trouble however came shortly thereafter with bogeys on Nos. 5 and 6.

The response was swift and decisive. Goodwin turned things around with birdies on the next two holes and an eagle on No. 9. He moved to 17-under with a birdie on the 11th hole extending his lead to seven.

“I was able to regroup. I came to terms with everything” Goodwin said of his stumble midway through his opening nine. “I knew I had a game plan that was going to work and it had been working. I just needed to kind of re-center myself with that.”

It more than sealed the deal. No serious challenges followed as he claimed the 500 Fortinet Cup points and the $36000 paycheck. Goodwin moved to No. 4 in the Fortinet Cup standings.

Goodwin said it “was just a beautiful day out there.” Made even more memorable with his father carrying the bag.

“I wouldn’t be where I am without him” noted Goodwin.

Lee Detmer Cameron Sisk and Thomas Walsh tied for second at 10-under.

“Overall it was a solid week. I have a lot to build off. Knowing I had a lot left in the tank is a really good sign” Sisk said. “I struck it well not as well as I can. I just didn’t make too many momentum putts that you need to make to put yourself in contention.”

Ian Holt Trent Phillips and Danny Walker shared fifth place at 9-under. Another group—Blake Hathcoat Dylan Meyer and Easton Paxton—tied for eighth at 8-under.

PGA TOUR Canada heads to Blainville Quebec next week. The Quebec Open begins Thursday and concludes Sunday at the Club de Golf Le Blainville.

Did you know tournament champion Noah Goodwin just turned pro in June? The former Southern Methodist standout was 12th in the final PGA TOUR University Global Velocity Ranking to earn his playing privileges. As a hedge to that ranking he played in the Qualifying Tournament in mid-April at The Wigwam in suburban Phoenix. There he earned his playing privileges by tying for fifth and was also the low amateur that week.

The last wire-to-wire PGA TOUR Canada winner was Robby Shelton at the 2017 GolfBC Championship in Kelowna British Columbia. Shelton a current Korn Ferry Tour member opened with an 8-under 63 and followed with scores of 68-65-69 to lead after every round on his way to a one-stroke victory over Cody Blick Johnny Ruiz and Adam Webb.

Along with winner Noah Goodwin two other PGA TOUR University alums finished in the top 10. Cameron Sisk (Arizona State) tied for second while Trent Phillips (Georgia) tied for fourth.

This week Mike Van Sickle made his first PGA TOUR Canada start since 2016’s Niagara Championship where he tied for 46th down the road in Fort Erie Ontario. Van Sickle a Monday qualifier rebounded from an opening 4-over 75 with scores of 67-70-66 over his final 54 holes. Van Sickle tied for 18th a finish that earned him an invite to next week’s Quebec Open.

Sunday’s top climber was Ian Holt. He shot a 64 to move up 29 positions and into a tie for fifth at 9-under. Thomas Hutchison fired a 66 to rise 25 spots up the board. He finished 5-under and tied for 25th.

Noah Goodwin is the fifth PGA TOUR Canada winner in five tournaments played this season. The previous four champs all played in the Ontario Open. Danny Walker (Osprey Valley Open winner) Brian Carlson (Prince Edward Island Open winner) and Wil Bateman (ATB Classic winner) made the cut while Scott Stevens (Royal Beach Victoria Open winner) did not. Walker finished at 9-under. Carlson and Bateman wound up 7-under and even-par respectively.

Mike Van Sickle (6-under) and Branson Ferrier (1-over) were the only Monday qualifiers to make the cut. Thus far nine of 40 qualifiers have made it to the weekend this season.

Peyton Callens the lone amateur to make the cut finished at 2-over. The University of Nevada star who is from Langton Ontario earned All-Mountain West Conference honors as a senior and still has a year of eligibility remaining.

The trial in Austin where Jones lives and Free Speech Systems is based is to determine how much Jones should pay for defaming Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis whose 6-year-old son Jesse Lewis was among the 20 children and six educators killed in the nation’s deadliest school shooting in Newtown Connecticut.

They and other Sandy Hook families suing Jones say they have suffered years of harassment and threats resulting from Jones' repeated false claims that the shooting was a hoax perpetuated to induce gun control measures or didn't happen. It wrapped up its first week of testimony Friday and is expected to conclude next week.

Jones' attorney Andino Reynal announced the bankruptcy filing late in the day Friday.

CONNECTICUT JUDGE FINDS ALEX JONES LIABLE OVER ‘HOAX’ SANDY HOOK CLAIMS

Both he and attorneys for the family suing Jones told Judge Maya Guerra Gamble of Travis County District Court that the bankruptcy filing would not halt the lawsuit. The New York Times reported that Gamble therefore ordered that the trial continues to a verdict despite the bankruptcy filing which in other circumstances would have stalled the litigation.

It is not the first time a bankruptcy filing has come amid litigation against Jones by the Sandy Hook families. In April Jones’ company Infowars and two more of his business entities filed for bankruptcy protection which led to a trial delay. Free Speech Systems is the parent company of Infowars.

Courts in Texas and Connecticut have already found Jones liable for defamation for his portrayal of the Sandy Hook massacre as a hoax involving actors aimed at increasing gun control.

In both states judges issued default judgments against Jones without trials because he failed to respond to court orders and turn over documents.

Christopher Mattei an attorney for the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut case issued a statement Friday evening blasting the bankruptcy filing.

""Just two days before jury selection is due to begin in Connecticut Mr. Jones has once again fled like a coward to bankruptcy court in a transparent attempt to delay facing the families that he has spent years hurting"" Mattei said. ""These families have an endless well of patience and remain determined to hold Mr. Jones accountable in a Connecticut court.""

Jones claimed in court records last year that he had a negative net worth of $20 million but attorneys for Sandy Hook families have painted a different financial picture.

Former President Donald Trump hasn't appeared on Fox News in 100 days.

According to The New York Times he'd rather have negative coverage than be ignored.

Trump has reportedly complained to aides that Sean Hannity a longtime friend is also overlooking him per the NYT.

Former President Donald Trump is reportedly angry that Fox News is no longer putting him front and center in its coverage according to The New York Times.

The Times reported that it would be more than 100 days since the former president was last interviewed by the network.

Fox News which Trump appeared on around eight times more than any other TV channel during his presidency is instead focusing on other potential candidates for the Republican nomination in 2024 per the newspaper.

Instead of broadcasting a July 22 Trump rally in Arizona Fox News aired a Laura Ingraham interview with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis The Times said.

A live broadcast of Trump's event with conservatives in Washington earlier this week was ignored by Fox News for a live speech by former Vice President Mike Pence.

According to The Times which cited two people who have spoken to the former president recently Trump is angrier about being ignored than he would be if Fox News were to cover him negatively.

Trump has recently complained to aides that Sean Hannity who he was once friends with also seems to be overlooking him per The Times.

According to several people close to the Fox Corporation which Rupert Murdoch owns the moves to exclude Trump are not coincidental The Times reported.

As Insider previously reported Fox News is inching towards a post-Trump era.

Trump and Fox News had a falling out when the network called Arizona for President Joe Biden during the 2020 election. Fox News defended the call made by its decision desk despite Trump protesting it. Trump then moved towards appearing on Newsmax and the One America News Network.

Since then Insider reported that a roster of Fox News hosts and contributors have issued stern critiques of the former president and support for other potential Republican nominees for 2024.

In a recent opinion piece by Fox News contributor Liz Peek DeSantis was touted as a ""cure for an ailing America.""

The trial in Austin where Jones lives and Free Speech Systems is based is to determine how much Jones should pay for defaming Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis whose 6-year-old son Jesse Lewis was among the 20 children and six educators killed in the nation’s deadliest school shooting in Newtown Connecticut.

They and other Sandy Hook families suing Jones say they have suffered years of harassment and threats resulting from Jones' repeated false claims that the shooting was a hoax perpetuated to induce gun control measures or didn't happen. It wrapped up its first week of testimony Friday and is expected to conclude next week.

Jones' attorney Andino Reynal announced the bankruptcy filing late in the day Friday.

CONNECTICUT JUDGE FINDS ALEX JONES LIABLE OVER ‘HOAX’ SANDY HOOK CLAIMS

Both he and attorneys for the family suing Jones told Judge Maya Guerra Gamble of Travis County District Court that the bankruptcy filing would not halt the lawsuit. The New York Times reported that Gamble therefore ordered that the trial continues to a verdict despite the bankruptcy filing which in other circumstances would have stalled the litigation.

It is not the first time a bankruptcy filing has come amid litigation against Jones by the Sandy Hook families. In April Jones’ company Infowars and two more of his business entities filed for bankruptcy protection which led to a trial delay. Free Speech Systems is the parent company of Infowars.

Courts in Texas and Connecticut have already found Jones liable for defamation for his portrayal of the Sandy Hook massacre as a hoax involving actors aimed at increasing gun control.

In both states judges issued default judgments against Jones without trials because he failed to respond to court orders and turn over documents.

Christopher Mattei an attorney for the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut case issued a statement Friday evening blasting the bankruptcy filing.

Jain believes that though these companies have good free cash flows multiples do not justify their growth. In fact he was the earliest to have sold off Page Industries after which the prices continued to still head north. “If you look at the past 10 years in many cases consumer companies’ top line growth was in high single digits but the multiples they trade at are anywhere between 50x and 100x. The reason for that probably lies in the margin expansion which was partly on account of the GST cuts which probably were not passed on to consumers” Jain told Fortune India.

But the steadfast devotion to valuation also meant Jain’s funds had to endure long periods of underperformance and the recent one being the longest — seven years long between 2013 and 2020. But he never let the pressure get to him. “I’m a veteran at periodically underperforming... and I have come out of it. If you try to jump from one style to another in the long term the outcome is very likely to be very mediocre. My best chances for delivering long-term returns are by doing something that I understand and I firmly believe in” said Jain.

Bhaskar believes Jain has been able to weather the storm because he had the backing of a strong franchise in HDFC group. “His long track record by staying at the same fund and the strong backing of a retail bank helped him wade through the tough times. The brand ensured that flows never went off during the period of underperformance” feels Bhaskar.

But the tenacity of Jain can be gauged from the fact he persisted even as other value funds more so in the U.S. wilted under the prolonged underperformance since 2008 as near zero interest rates gave wings to growth stocks. Quantitative fund manager AJO Partners which manages $10 billion shut shop in 2020. Similarly International Value Advisors liquidated two funds in 2021. But the tide is changing with the era of zero interest rate coming to an end globally giving a fillip to value investing. Closer home the frenzy around the new age stocks is waning as momentum is now favouring cyclicals — a large weightage in Jain’s portfolio.

“We have not seen real GDP growth since 2016 and now when you have genuine GDP growth of 6-7% then all sectors participate. A lot of cyclical sectors do not have debt and now even steel firms are making money. In this kind of market 50 PE stocks on one side and 6 PE stocks on other will not sustain and that is the phase we are in for the next two years” says Bhaskar.

While Jain has not indicated on whether he will be starting a fund of his own Sivasubramanian is looking forward to a catch-up. “We hardly met during our days in fund management. But even after I retired he used to call me over for a lunch meeting whenever he was in Chennai. Our talks were less about investing and more on the kind of books we were reading” says Sivasubramanian.

Bhaskar believes Jain is set for an encore. “He couldn’t have timed his exit any better. Both Jain and S. Naren (ICICI Prudential MF) are like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant who will retire with the same jersey” says Bhaskar.",,,,,,,,,

The long awaited Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar is an excellent activity tracker which you will need if you want to improve your athletic performance /health/fitness/garmin-forerunner-955-solar-review-is-this-watch-for-you-111659090066090.html 111659090066090 story

It took time but it’s finally here: the Garmin Forerunner 955. The activity tracker is an upgrade to its top end triathlon GPS watch Forerunner 945 which was launched three years ago. In fact Garmin didn’t just issue one but two models as part of this upgrade—Forerunner 955 and Forerunner 955 Solar. While it was announced in the US in May the Forerunner 955 and 955 Solar debuted in India four weeks later on 30 June.

I have worn the 955 Solar non-stop since 8 July and I have been busy using it to track my runs strength training sessions football games and swims. Despite tracking eight activities of about 40 minutes on average the battery lasted two weeks. This is the Solar advantage in this watch which improves battery performance by slowing down the drain.

Garmin claims it lasts 49 hours in GPS mode on full charge and 20 days in smart watch mode. Even if real world performance is a tad poorer than the claims you can easily complete an easy-paced triathlon or use it for a 24-hour endurance activity and still have enough juice to make it back home. For practical purposes if your watch is fully charged you won’t need an extra charging cable on your business trip or a two-week vacation and can still track your runs and workouts.

Battery isn’t the only upgrade on this one. Garmin has kitted out the 955 with improved GPS sensors as well. On my Forerunner 735 from 2017 it sometimes takes up to 3 minutes to catch on to the GPS in case of cloud cover tall buildings or too many trees. I have been using the 955 during the monsoons and in a park with thick tree cover still the longest it has taken is about 30 seconds for the watch to lock in the GPS.

The FR955 Solar continues with the standard five button design has a much better display compared to the older models and a lot more refined and responsive touch screen. You have the option of disabling the touch screen yet it falls short of the sharp AMOLED displays that we are used to on smart watches from Apple or Samsung. However that’s one of the sacrifices you need to make for the vastly superior battery life of this watch.

Garmin has also added the standard new age smart watch feature of incident detection to this upgrade: the watch can automatically dial your emergency contact but you would need to have your paired phone to use that feature. It also plays music and can store up to 2000 songs on the device. And yes the watch also displays notifications from your phone but you cannot make or receive phone calls directly from the watch.

Like the Apple Watch the FR955 Solar also gives you a morning report and a lot more comprehensive one at that. It greets you good morning and gives you the weather lowdown and also goes on to add your workout for the day training readiness and sleep quality and ends off with a motivational quote.

One complaint that existing Garmin users have had is about the straps that keep snapping. The company has changed the compound for its new straps and claims better performance for the ones attached to the new range. However the FR955 Solar still doesn’t come with quick release straps that watch aficionados are used to just in case you want to liven things up.

The FR955 Solar is a watch for the serious endurance athlete—especially ultrarunners long distance cyclists and triathletes—who would get the best use out of its expansive battery life. If you just want an activity tracker this is not for you. The metrics it measures are very advanced and are designed to help endurance athletes analyse and improve their performance. Apart from the standard distance pace steps-per-minute and heart rate this one also keeps track of your heart rate variability.

This is fast becoming a popular metric to measure athletic conditioning and performance. It also measures your running power when you pair it with a heart rate monitor chest strap as well as training readiness and status. It also has a smart-race-and-training calendar and a race event widget that gives you the weather conditions start times and location of the hydration and assistance booths for major races. The older Garmins used to merely split your running report in moving time and total time but the new offering gives you the run walk and rest time and this can give you a better perspective of your effort.

Training Readiness is a metric unique to the FR955 range and it is a fair indicator of whether you should train or not. Whenever I have had a sleepless night or have had poor recovery after a tough session the watch displays my training readiness as low and it has usually been on point. The Body Battery widget which now comes bundled with most Garmin watches captures excellently how I am feeling at most times of the day.

Based on your performance during the workouts the watch also lets you know your Training Status as “detraining” “productive” and “overreaching”. You will have to use this watch in conjunction with the excellent Garmin Connect app which is the best in the category and is now actually better than before. The app now has an added Garmin Coach feature and once you choose a distance then one of its three coaches will design an AI-powered training plan for you. You will also have to use the app to load advanced workouts created by you on to your device using Garmin Connect on a mobile device or a computer.

To sum up the Garmin FR955 Solar is an excellent GPS watch and would definitely improve the tracking and analysis of your training and race performances. The one thing that I am wary of is its high price: ₹63990. The non-solar FR955 with a slightly poorer battery life offers all of these features for ₹53490. What you need to decide is: Is the extra battery life worth the difference?

Pros:

-Big battery life.

-Light weight.

-Better display than most triathlon watches.

-GPS connects quickly despite cloud or tree cover.

-Can track many outdoor and indoor workouts.

-Touch screen can be switched on and off.

-Tracks multiple metrics for better performance and optimal training plans.

Cons:

-At 46.5mm it is huge and if you have a slender wrist it will stand out.

-Poor display compared to an Apple Watch.

-Expensive.

-No LTE capability despite the price tag.

-No quick release on straps.

Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar costs ₹63990 and is available at Garmin brand stores Helios Just in Time Croma Amazon Flipkart and Tata CLiQ.

This Coros GPS watch is exceptionally accurate

I started my trial period with the Apex Pro by putting the GPS to the test running a warmup route on a canopied trail followed by a track workout to see how similar each loop would look in the data once complete. To my surprise the Coros GPS watch excelled at both tracking the trail portion within 1 percent of the measured distance and using the algorithm cleaned up all the track data in an impressive fashion. Only dual-frequency GPS watches can give you more accurate GPS tracking.

The navigation tools make finding your way simple and convenient

I also enjoyed the navigation tools available with the Apex Pro. Coros recently rolled out a software update — which are frequent and seamless — that unlocked touch navigation. While I haven’t tested this added feature much it does feel unique and likely will improve over time. The standard navigation tools come with an altimeter barometer and compass on par with any competitor. Like the watch the Coros app is simple and intuitive too. It integrates with third-party apps easily unlike other closed systems like Garmin Connect.

What’s Less Than Ideal About the Apex Pro?

The bare-boned profile might offer too little for some enthusiasts

If you’re someone who wants every whiz-bang possible the Apex Pro isn’t for you. When compared to other top-tier multi-sport watches the ecosystem comes up a little short. Health metrics are lacking and you can’t pay from your watch — like with Garmin and Apple. Additionally the Apex Pro is unable to store or play music offers no virtual training partner mode and cannot charge via solar power.

That said other than solar charging these bells and whistles are rarely used tools when it comes to multi-sport watches in my opinion Most people will enjoy the simplicity of the Apex Pro’s design as well as the quality built into the present features. Plus omitting these add-ons certainly helps keep the price lower in part making this one of the best value GPS watches on the market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2hzY2hvb2wvc3BvcnRzLWF3YXJkcy8yMDIyLzA4LzAxL25ld2J1cnktcGFyay1ib3lzLXhjLW5hbWVkLXVzYS10b2RheS1oc3NhLWJveXMtdGVhbS15ZWFyLzEwMTg2Mjc4MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Newbury Park boys cross country squad named USA TODAY HSSA Boys Team of the Year,"The Newbury Park boys cross country team from California was named the 2022 USA Today High School Sports Awards Boys Team of the Year during the live show on July 31.

The USA Today High School Sports Awards is the largest high school sports recognition program in the country. Over 800 athletes were honored and winners for 29 sports and other special awards were announced during the live show which was hosted by former NFL tight ends Rob Gronkowski and Vernon Davis.

After sweeping the top four spots in record fashion at CIF Division 1 state cross country championships Newbury Park shattered national records at the Garmin RunningLane Nationals

Led by two pairs of brothers — the Sahlmans and the Youngs — the Newbury Park boys blasted state and national records on their way to high school cross country lore.

The Panthers swept the top four spots and scored a state-record 16 points at California’s large-school championship meet; their team-time of 73 minutes 23 seconds was a runaway course record. They set their sights even higher entering the Garmin RunningLane Nationals in Huntsville Alabama — hunting the national individual 5K record of 14 minutes 10 seconds. Three of Newbury Park’s runners — national Boys Athlete of the Year finalist Colin Sahlman and twin brothers Leo and Lex Young — decimated that mark which had stood for 20 years. Colin’s younger brother Aaron Sahlman finished sixth in the race and just missed being the fourth panther to better the record.

That performance by the Panthers in one of the nation’s biggest races have distance running historians collectively ending the argument: The 2021 Newbury Park High School boys cross country team is the greatest not of the past decade … not of the past century … but of all time. All four brothers were also among the 24 nominees for the All-USA Today High School Sports Awards Boys Cross Country Team.

The other finalists for Boys Team of the Year were the St. Mary’s Prep baseball team in Orchard Lake Michigan which sported a 44-0 record and a roster with nine Division I college recruits in route to the state’s Catholic League championship; and the football team from Westlake High School in Austin Texas which captured its third straight Texas Class 6A championship and behind Clemson-bound quarterback Cade Klubnik and title-game MVP receiver Jaden Greathouse.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXIuY29tLm15L3RlY2gvdGVjaC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDcvMzAvZm9yZ2V0LXlvdXItd2FsbGV0LXdoeS1oYXZlbnQteW91LXN3aXRjaGVkLXRvLXBheWluZy1ieS1waG9uZS15ZXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Forget your wallet: Why haven't you switched to paying by phone yet?,"BERLIN: A tap of your phone a quick beep and you’re done. What was still new a few years ago has become mainstream during the pandemic.

Anyone who has switched to making contactless payments – often called “tap to pay” in restaurants and shops – with their phone won’t miss the times when they were rummaging around in their pockets for cash.

For those who are still concerned: Holding a bank card or smartphone or smartwatch up to a payment terminal might seem faster but is it secure? And what actually happens to the data transmitted during the payment process? Here are the most important questions and answers.

What options are there for contactless payment?

Debit and credit cards often come ready to tap on a card reader at any checkout without additional setup needed but most smartphones and smartwatches can also easily be set up for mobile payments.

You can either download the app of a payment service provider or use the often more universal offerings from Apple Samsung or Google. The cards of cooperating banks can then be stored in their apps.

And many supermarket chains are also getting involved. With their customer apps you can redeem vouchers and pay for your shopping for example. Loyalty programmes in many countries are also often involved in contactless payment via their apps as are payment services from Bluecode to PayPal.

Fitbit and Garmin for example offer their own payment systems for their sports watches. But even some analogue watches can become wallet substitutes: This is possible for example with certain “unsmart” models from the manufacturer Swatch where an integrated chip enables the transaction.

What do I need?

The basis for most contactless transactions is near-field communication (NFC) a set of communication protocols. To make a transaction the card smartphone or watch must have an NFC chip. Newer smartphone models as well as smartwatches now do this across the board.

For those with older mobile phones supermarket apps or other payment services are an alternative where you can store bank details or a credit/debit card. Here you pay with a barcode or QR code that you present or scan at the checkout.

With the exception of the Swatch models mentioned above it’s generally necessary for the respective device to have enough battery power and still be on. The same applies to having an Internet connection: Some providers require this but some don’t.

How secure is it?

Pretty secure. “It’s very unlikely that data will be extracted” says Stefan Fischer from Stiftung Warentest consumer organisation.

Compared to a credit card paying by app can even be considered very secure. This is due to the fact that the card data stored is not read directly during the transaction but rather an individual sequence of numbers a kind of code.

The Consumer Advice Centre in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia is also not aware of any cases in which “criminals specifically attack contactless payment” says lawyer David Riechmann.

For security fanatics there are special protective sleeves for bank cards that prevent near-field communication. In addition after a certain number of payments or for higher amounts usually €25 (RM250 in Malaysia) or more you’ll need to enter the PIN. With smartphones there is an additional level of security: the device must first be unlocked for each transaction.

What about companies spying on my spending habits?

Here things don’t look quite as good. Germany’s Stiftung Warentest consumer organisation found flaws in the terms and conditions and data transmission behaviour of several payment apps.

Consumers must be aware that their data is not only sent to the app provider but also to payment service providers and other possible partners.

Supermarket apps in particular are keen to collect data they know in which branches the customer shops and whether or not they’ve changed their preferences. “Cash is really the only anonymous payment method. Paying by card be it with an actual card or with your smartphone also leaves traces” explains consumer advocate Riechmann.

What if you lose something?

If you lose your smartwatch mobile phone or debit/credit card it’s important to lock or block it immediately. The risk of payments for higher amounts being made is unlikely as the criminals would have to know either the PIN (in the case of a contactless card) or the code to unlock the respective device.

Those who use biometric data to access their device and make payments have even less to worry about. And even if unauthorised purchases have already been made: As long as the smartphone or card is appropriately protected and you cannot be shown to have been careless then the bank has to cover the losses in most countries. – dpa"

Think about the Great Toilet Paper Shortage of 2020.

Two years on we’re still facing pandemic-related shortages (looked at buying a new car lately?). Now we’ve also got the Russian war against Ukraine wreaking havoc on everything from gasoline to food supplies.

The timing of Gartner’s 2024 Top 25 rankings for both universities and supply chain companies couldn’t be more prescient.

“Certainly it’s been a transformational two years for the education sector but also for the companies that we work with” says Caroline Chumakov senior principal analyst at Gartner a research and advisory firm for industry executives.

PREPARING FOR ‘THE GREAT REORGANIZATION’

Gartner’s supply chain Top 25 series releases rankings for both undergraduate and graduate supply chain management programs at universities as well as a ranking of the top companies in the global supply chain. A major trend Gartner is watching is the “great reorganization.”

“Deloitte estimates that the supply chain talent shortage will leave 2.4 million positions unfilled between 2018 and 2028. So orders aren’t shipping trucks aren’t driving lines aren’t running. We see this period of really unprecedented movement and churn in the supply chain workforce that we’ve never really seen before” Chumakov says in a Gartner webinar for industry executives and school administrators.

On top of that baby boomers are retiring and there aren’t enough Gen Z workers to replace them. “So these pressures are essentially providing an opportunity for many companies to take stock of their current approach to university engagement and to do a kind of reset.” (See the list of the Top 25 Companies on page 2).

TRENDS IN SUPPLY CHAIN EDUCATION

In the webinar Dana Stiffler distinguished VP analyst points to three emerging trends in undergraduate and graduate supply chain programs: First Diversity of students and faculty ticked up at both undergrad and graduate programs but particularly at the undergraduate level. Women account for 40% of supply chain undergrads compared to 39% in 2020. “Some programs in fact have a have majority female participation which is really interesting considering the history of our programs” Stiffler says.

Diversity among faculty however is still lagging with only 26% of women up 2% from two years earlier. In terms of ethnicity more than half of schools score at least some points in the ranking for student diversity and 44% for faculty diversity both increases over the previous ranking.

Starting salaries for students in supply chain roles also increased. In terms of compensation U.S. undergraduates finding their first jobs in supply chain roles are earning about $1600 more per year than in 2020. While the average starting salary is $61769 graduates from the top 10 programs can expect around $65000. The highest salary from the ranked schools was $80000.

Finally in terms of curriculum schools are incorporating more environmental social corporate governance and ethics lessons into their supply chain syllabi.

“This makes perfect sense if we look at our overall global supply chain trends” Stiffler says. “A big reason for companies to reorganize their global supply chain networks is resilience in the current environment and cost and sustainability are very close together. So that is right in line with what global supply organizations” are reporting.

TOP 25 GRADUATE PROGRAMS

Gartner’s biennial pair of school rankings are intended to support chief supply chain officers heads of supply chain strategy and supply chain HR partners in their quest to identify the B-school programs from which they can recruit the best talent. A major change for this year’s school ranking was the inclusion of 100% online programs. Traditionally Gartner only covered on-campus and hybrid programs but the rapid change of delivery following the pandemic caused them to react to those changes.

This year University of Tennessee a longtime participant in Gartner’s ranking claimed the top spot for the very first time.

“They are big their graduates get paid and they improved on the curriculum score this year” Stiffler says. The school also has a great alumni network working with faculty and the university board to extend the supply chain community.

The University of Arkansas improved more than any other school since 2020 jumping 19 spots to No. 2 in 2022.

“The reason for their very steep trajectory is their improvements across the board – in their curriculum; in diversity equity and inclusion and especially in their strong growth.”

Other schools with the biggest gains include University of South Carolina (No. 6 in 2022) which jumped 16 spots University of Southern California (No. 10) jumping 13 spots and Rutgers University (No. 5) gaining 12.

The graduate supply chain program list saw six new or re-entrants in 2022. These include University of Houston (No. 11) University of Wisconsin (No. 13) Auburn University (No. 14) HEC Montreal/University of Montreal (No. 16) Indiana University (No. 20) and Syracuse University (No. 25).

Arizona State University (No. 23) dropped the farthest losing 16 points. Others with big drops include Purdue University (No. 24) falling 12 spots and North Carolina State University (No. 21) falling 11.

(Gray News) - Authorities in Pennsylvania say a man will spend years behind bars for sexually assaulting his children.

According to the Dauphin County District Attorney’s Office Jorge Caraballo Sr. was convicted of multiple sexual offenses including the rape of a child incest and unlawful contact with a minor in December 2021.

State officials said Judge Scott Arthur Evans deferred Caraballo’s sentence to obtain a sexually violent predator assessment. On July 15 the court determined Caraballo was a sexually violent predator.

The district attorney’s office reported that Dr. Robert Stein testified during the hearing that Caraballo’s exploitation of the children was particularly callous and noted that the children endured sexual abuse by him for years.

After the ruling Judge Evans sentenced Caraballo to 48 to 96 years of imprisonment in a state correctional institution.

Pennsylvania authorities praised the victims’ strength shown in the case after coming forward soon after Caraballo had moved out of their home.

Judge Evans ordered all of Caraballo’s sentences be served consecutively.

Amazon Health Services last week moved beyond experimenting with in-person care via provider agreements (Crossover Health TTA 17 May) to being in the provider business with an agreement to acquire One Medical. Earlier this month news leaked that One Medical as 1Life Healthcare was up for sale to the right buyer having spurned CVS and after watching their stock on Nasdaq plummet 75%.

The cash deal for $3.9 billion including assumption of debt is certainly a good one representing $18 per share a premium to their $14 share IPO in January 2020. (The stock closed last Wednesday before the announcement at just above $10 per share then plumped to ~$17 where it remains.)

then plumped to ~$17 where it remains.) The announcement is oddly not on One Medical’s website but is on Amazon’s here .

. The buy is subject to shareholder and the usual regulatory approvals. The IPO was managed by JP Morgan Securities and Morgan Stanley. It is primarily backed by Alphabet (Google).

One Medical’s CEO Amir Dan Rubin will stay on but there is no other executive transition mention.

Also not mentioned: the Iora Health operation that serves primarily Medicare patients in full-risk value-based care models such as Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicare shared savings quite opposite to One Medical’s membership-based concierge model. However Iora’s website is largely cut over to One Medical’s identity and their coverage is limited to seven states.

There is a huge amount of opinion on the buy but for this Editor it is clear that Amazon with One Medical is buying itself into in-person and virtual primary care for the employer market where it had limited success with its present largely virtual offering and entree with commercial plans and MA. One Medical has over 700000 patients 8000 company clients and has 125 physical offices in 12 major US markets including NYC Los Angeles Boston and Atlanta. It has never turned a profit. Looking at their website they welcome primarily commercial plans and MA (but not Medicare supplement plans).

Amazon with both a virtual plus provider network now has a huge advantage over Teladoc and Amwell both of which have previously brushed off Amazon as a threat to their business. There is the potential to run two models: the current Amazon Care pay-as-you-go model and the One Medical corporate/concierge model. This puts Amazon squarely in UHC’s Optum Health territory which owns or has agreements with over 5% of US primary care practices is fully in value-based care models such as Medicare shared savings through its ACOs and is aggressively virtual plus integrating services such as data analytics pharmacy and financial. Becker’s

What doesn’t quite fit is Iora Health and the higher cost/higher care needs Medicare market that is less profitable and requires advanced risk management a skill set that Amazon doesn’t have. This Editor will make a small prediction that Iora will be sold or spun off after the sale.

This Editor continues to believe that the real game for Amazon is monetizing patient data. That has gained traction since we opined that was the real Amazon Game in June and October last year To restate it: Amazon Care’s structure offerings cheap pricing feeds our opinion that Amazon’s real aim is to accumulate and own national healthcare data on the service’s users. Then they will monetize it by selling it to pharmaceutical companies payers developers and other commercial third parties in and ex-US. Patients may want to think twice. This opinion is now shared by those with bigger voices such as the American Economic Liberties Project. In their statement they urged that the government block the buy due to Amazon’s cavalier attitudes towards customer data and far too much internal access unsecured to customer information (Revealnews.org from Wired). Adding PHI to this is like putting gasoline on a raging fire and One Medical customers are apparently concerned. For what it’s worth Senator Bernie Sanders has already tweeted against it. MarketWatch

Whether this current administration and the DOJ will actually care about PHI and patient privacy is anyone’s guess but TTA has noted that Amazon months ago beefed up its DC lobbying presence last year. According to Opensecrets.org they spent $19.3 million last year. In fairness Amazon is a leading Federal service provider via Amazon Web Services. (Did you know that AWS stores the CIA’s information?) One Medical is also relatively small–not a Village MD/Village Medical now majority owned by Walgreens Boots. This is why this Editor believes that HHS DOJ and FTC will give it a pass unlike UHG’s acquisition of Change Healthcare especially if Amazon agrees to divest itself of the Iora Health business.

Treat yourself to the speculation including that it will be added as an Amazon Prime benefit to the 44% of Americans who actually spend for an Amazon Prime membership. It may very well change part of the delivery model for primary care and force other traditional providers to provide more integrated care which is as old as Kaiser and Geisinger. It may demolish telehealth providers like Teladoc and Amwell. But as we’ve also noted Amazon like founder Jeff Bezos deflects and veils its intents very well.

This is great news since health care on campuses is notoriously awful. Caraway will leverage technology to make all-encompassing health care accessible for college students who conveniently are always using their smartphones.

The Deets

Caraway spun out of a partnership with 7WireVenture OMERS Ventures and digital health experts Lori Evans Bernstein and Joshua Tauber. This latest fundraising round comes from 7WireVenture OMERS Ventures Hopelab Ventures and angel investors.

Caraway is a digital health app that Gen Z women+ on partnered college campuses can download to their phone giving them 24/7 access to a whole team of clinicians and providers:

Currently health care on college campuses is abysmal. According to a Washington Post survey of college campuses around 70% of sampled colleges didn’t have a full-time psychiatrist and one-third didn’t have a full-time physician. So much for $60000 tuitions am I right?

Alyssa Jaffee from 7WireVenture sums it up nicely:

Caraway will focus on women+ for several reasons according to OMERS Ventures investor Chrissy Farr:

College populations skew female.

Women are under-diagnosed and mistreated.

Reproductive health is one of the top reasons students visit their college health services.

About twice as many women as men experience depression.

Caraway will launch on college campuses this fall in New York and California.

Dash’s Dissection 👨‍🔬

The healthcare status quo isn’t ideal for Gen Z-ers who prefer hybrid care and ease of access. Therefore Caraway’s niche focus on Gen Z women+ and college campuses will shake things up in the virtual care world. To my knowledge this is one of the first companies focusing on a generation of people. And Gen Z is certainly a unique generation.

Able Partners and Springbank Collective recently published a quantitative and qualitative research study to see how Gen Z navigates healthcare. It shouldn’t surprise you that nearly 100% of Gen Z-ers own a smartphone and 55% of them use it more than five hours per day. This generation prefers in-person health care but they have high expectations for flexibility. Alas the “hybrid” model of care that elegantly balances in-person and virtual services.

Gen Z wants telehealth options and the ability to text or call their clinicians or providers. They also expect quick responses and easy scheduling although they may not be unique in these desires—millennial me wants them too.

The current generation of students in college was birthed with a smartphone in their hand.

TREDX aims to unite small businesses financial institutions (FIs) corporations and suppliers to create an online marketplace TREDXonline for digital invoices. TREDX will facilitate digital factoring that is real-time transactions selling approved invoices from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to FIs at a discount.

According to M Masrur Reaz managing director for Think Big SMEs make up around a quarter of the country’s gross domestic product. But a large number of them have limited access to formal finance.

Reaz said the idea was to make more access to credit as many don’t have very much collateral but also have working capital tied up in invoices payable by larger corporations.

“So factoring as a product is best suited to meet the needs of SME suppliers wherein the factoring companies and banks could have discounted their approved invoices and provided the suppliers with much needed liquidity” he said.

Recently companies based in the U.S. have been required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to disclose details on supply chain financing programs.

The firms will now have to report the outstanding balances tied to the programs and the terms of the financing arrangements.

The rule was proposed last December and will take effect early next year. It will address the fact that clearer accounting would spotlight the effects the programs have on the capital and cash flows.

The programs offer a lifeline to suppliers in which payables arrangements can help buyers pay vendors with third party financing and earlier than usual.

Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 MSRP $1680.00 Score Details “The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 isn't a performer but excels in battery life and security.” Pros Solid build quality

Dizzying array of display options

Excellent keyboard

Above-average battery life

Good business support Cons Touchpad is too small

Expensive for the performance

A laptop should be fairly refined by the time it’s hit its 10th generation. That’s particularly true with one as iconic as the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon the company’s marquee business-oriented thin and light laptop.

Lenovo didn’t mark the X1 Carbon’s 10th generation with a spectacular reworking. Instead it further refines the celebrated design with a few small but meaningful refinements as it’s been doing in every generation since its launch.

These small tweaks alongside an update to Intel’s 12th-gen CPUs leave this premium business laptop at the top of its game even if its price still doesn’t make it a particularly realistic mainstream consumer option.

Price and configurations

I reviewed a $1680 configuration with a Core i7-1260P CPU and a 14-inch 16:10 UXWGA (1920 x 1200) low-power IPS display.

Of course Lenovo provides several other configuration options with the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10. CPUs range from the 28-watt 12-core/16-thread Core i5-1540P to the 28-watt 14-core/20-thread Core i7-1280P with vPro. As we’ll see in the display section below there are a dizzying number of display options that make it possible (if challenging) to dial in precisely the desired efficiency and display resolution and quality.

Regarding pricing and using Lenovo’s configurator things start at $1320 for a Core i5-1540P 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM a 256GB PCIe SSD and a 14-inch 16:10 WUXGA (1920 x 1200) low-power anti-glare IPS display. At the high end you’ll spend $2595 for a Core i7-1280P with vPro 32GB of RAM a 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD 4G LTE and a 14-inch 16:10 WQUXGA (3840 x 2400) anti-reflective anti-smudge touch display.

These are steep discounts from the retail prices and they aren’t out of line for the business audience that’s likely to be most interested in the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10. In terms of price it’s less expensive than the more powerful Apple MacBook Pro 14 and around the same price as a similarly configured Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 7.

Design

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 enjoys the same thin and light chassis as before constructed of magnesium alloy in the chassis and carbon fiber in the lid. It’s subjected to the usual military testing for robustness as all ThinkPads. Still like most laptops with magnesium and carbon fiber there’s some bending in the lid and flexing in the keyboard deck.

In the ThinkPad’s case though it’s very minor and most people won’t notice it but it doesn’t quite live up to the standards of more solid machines like the Dell XPS 15 and the MacBook Pro 14. The hinge is perfectly balanced light enough to open the lid with one hand but stiff enough to hold the display in place.

The magnesium and carbon fiber do bring a meaningful benefit in terms of the ThinkPad’s weight which comes in at just 2.48 pounds. It’s also thin at 0.60 inches with larger bezels for a modern laptop and thus more width and depth than some.

What can I say? The latest ThinkPad X1 looks precisely like a ThinkPad.

By comparison the solid aluminum MacBook Pro 14 with a 14.2-inch display weighs 3.5 pounds and is 0.61 inches thick while being just slightly thinner and shallower in spite of the larger panel. The MSI Prestige 14 on the other hand is a little wider and a little shallower while weighing a whopping 4.64 pounds and coming in at 0.63 inches thick. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 is one of the lighter 14-inch laptops around while being reasonably sized in all dimensions.

Aesthetically what can I say? The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 looks precisely like a ThinkPad — all-black chassis minimalist lines and angles red LED do on the stylized ThinkPad X1 logo on the lid and red TrackPoint nubbin in the middle of the keyboard. It’s a conservative iconic design that’s recognizable from a distance. Ultimately it’s more striking than simplistic machines like the Prestige 14 and Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 7 while being less elegant than the MacBook Pro 14. But nobody will be embarrassed taking it into a business meeting.

Ports and connections

Connectivity is mostly solid for a 14-inch machine with two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 support two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports a full-size HDMI 2.0b port and a 3.5mm audio jack. There’s no SD card reader which is disappointing.

Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 provide the latest in wireless connectivity and a Nano SIM slot is optional supporting 4G LTE WWAN.

Keyboard touchpad and webcam

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10’s keyboard has slightly changed from the standard ThinkPad version. The keycaps are squared off giving a more streamlined appearance and in my opinion a better feel. The switches seemed a bit lighter than many ThinkPads I’ve tested and that’s an improvement in my book. I’ve usually found ThinkPad keyboards to require too much force. There’s still plenty of travel and a precise snappy bottoming action making it an excellent keyboard for long typing sessions. Lenovo also built air intake holes into the keyboard to improve thermal performance and waterproof seals maintain the keyboard’s spill resistance. The layout remains the same including the odd swapping of the left Fn and Ctrl keys.

The touchpad is wider than previous models and still hosts two buttons to support the red TrackPoint nubbin in the middle of the keyboard. That makes the touchpad slightly larger than in the past but still smaller than you’ll find on many competitive 14-inch laptops. Its glass surface is smooth and provides reliable support for Windows 11 multitouch gestures. And the TrackPoint works as well as ever for those ThinkPad diehards who prefer it.

Windows 11 Hello passwordless support is provided by a fingerprint reader built into the power button embedded in the deck above the keyboard. The power button’s placement helps avoid accidentally pressing the wrong key and the fingerprint reader worked quickly and reliably in my testing.

Finally the webcam is Full HD (1080p) and has a webcam privacy shutter. The webcam provides excellent video quality in normal and low-light environments and should meet anyone’s videoconferencing needs. There are options for a Full HD webcam with infrared for facial recognition and another with Lenovo’s Computer Vision technology.

Performance

Intel’s 12th-gen Core i7-1260P is our most-reviewed CPU over the last several months. It’s popular among thin and light laptops like the Carbon X1 Carbon and we’ve seen some stratification in the chip’s performance. As a 28-watt 12-core (four Performance and eight Efficient) 16-thread processor the Core i7-1260P has provided at least solid productivity performance but some laptops have performed better than others. The Acer Swift 3 2022 and MSI Prestige 14 are two laptops that provided overall superior performance than the average while the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 is among those providing significantly less performance.

That’s not a surprise given how previous models in the line have handled performance. This ThinkPad was particularly slow in our CPU-intensive benchmarks compared to competitors including video encoding in Handbrake and the 3D rendering benchmark in Cinebench R23. The laptop’s PCMark 10 Complete result a measure of a mix of productivity multimedia and creative tasks was also lower than the average and even fell behind the 9th generation model with a Core i7-1165G7.

Performance didn’t live up to this CPU’s potential.

Oddly enough I used Lenovo’s thermal management utility and it performed worse in some tests in performance mode than in balanced mode.

Despite having a higher wattage chip inside the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 7 performed more like the Dell Inspiron 14 2-in-1 with a 15-watt 10-core (two Performance and eight Efficient) 12-core Core i7-1255U. I can’t say that the ThinkPad suffered from any unusual issues with throttling at least no more than the rest of the thin-and-light field but it didn’t perform up to this CPU’s potential.

Of course that doesn’t mean you’ll notice. It’s still a fast enough laptop for demanding productivity tasks and it’s faster than Intel’s 11th-gen equivalents in most cases. But the ThinkPad’s ability to handle heavier tasks in creative applications is significantly less than with some other competitive machines.

Display and audio

Lenovo offers a mind-boggling assortment of display options for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10. There are seven 14-inch 16:10 panels to choose from differentiated by an alphabet soup of acronyms. First there are three WUXGA (1920 x 1200) LP (low-power) AG (anti-glare) panels one non-touch and two touch-enabled. One of the WUXGA displays with touch includes Lenovo’s Privacy Guard feature. Next is a 2.2K (2240 x 1400) AG IPS screen followed by a 2.8K (2880 x 1800) OLED AGARAS (anti-glare anti-reflection anti-smudge) display. Finally there are two WQUXA (3840 x 2400) IPS displays one LP AG non-touch and one LP AOFT (Add-on Film Touch) AGARAS touch.

Whew.

My review unit was equipped with the WUXGA LP AG touch display which seemed fine during my testing. It was plenty bright colors seemed dynamic without being oversaturated and blacks were deep for an IPS panel.

My colorimeter confirmed my subjective experience. The display hit 411 nits of brightness which is well above our 300-nit threshold and more than bright enough for any indoor lighting condition you’re likely to face. Its contrast was also excellent at 1660:1 well about the 1000:1 we like to see in premium displays. That resulted in true blacks for example text that pops on a white background (my personal standard) and plenty of detail in dark images.

Colors hit the premium laptop average of 98% of sRGB and 76% of AdobeRGB although I’ve seen more displays lately falling in the 80s for AdobeRGB. Color accuracy was okay at a DeltaE of 1.96 below the 2.0 mark that’s the minimum for creative work but still higher than I like to see. The MSI Summit E14 Flip and Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 7 had wider and more accurate colors.

This is an excellent display for productivity workers and media consumers but it falls short of what creators are looking for. However Lenovo offers so many display options that certainly anybody can dial in a display that will meet their needs.

Two downward-firing speakers put out a surprising amount of volume and the quality was better than I expected. Along with clean mids and highs without distortion I heard a touch of bass. The speakers were strong enough for Netflix binging sessions and informal music listening although a good pair of headphones will still provide the best quality.

Battery life

My review unit used a 28-watt CPU and a low-power WUXGA (also known as Full HD+) display. Its 57 watt-hours of battery capacity is a little light for a 14-inch laptop especially compared to the Lenovo Yoga 9i Gen 7 with its 75 watt-hour battery. I wasn’t expecting all-day battery life.

After running our suite of battery benchmarks I came away mostly impressed. Its 7.5 hours in our web browsing test that cycles through a series of complex websites is about half an hour less than we like to see but it was competitive among our comparison group. The Yoga 9i Gen 7 lasted longer as did the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 7 (with 71 watt-hours) and the AMD-equipped Asus ZenBook S 13 OLED with a power-hungry display. Even so the ThinkPad did okay. In our video test that loops a local Full HD Avengers trailer it lasted for 14.5 hours a strong score likely thanks to its low-power display. And finally in the PCMark 10 Applications test that’s the best indication of productivity battery life the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 made it to 10.75 hours an above-average result.

Overall the ThinkPad’s battery life is pretty good promising a full day’s work unless you push the CPU. You’ll get less out of some of the available higher-resolution displays as well as the OLED option but stick with this display and you won’t need to carry your charger with you.

Our take

The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 is a well-built and highly configurable laptop with options for the kind of management and security that businesses crave. For that audience it’s a solid offering at a fair price.

For anyone else the ThinkPad’s performance is lacking and it doesn’t offer as much to justify its high price. ThinkPad fans will love it but other mainstream buyers should do their shopping first.

Are there any alternatives?

Dell’s Latitude 7430 is a likely alternative for the business market offering similar management and security and a similar pricing scheme. It doesn’t offer the same breadth of display offerings as the ThinkPad.

Lenovo’s Yoga 9i Gen 7 is a strong competitor for the mainstream market offering a more stunning design the flexibility of a 2-in-1 better performance and similar battery life. It costs a bit less as well.

Finally Apple’s MacBook Pro 14 is a compelling option that’s exceptionally well-built and offers superior performance and battery life. It offers just one display option but it’s as good as anything Lenovo has to offer. You’ll spend a bit more at the high end though.

How long will it last?

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 is well-built and should last for years of typical abuse. Its components are fully updated and will keep Windows 11 humming along. I’m glad to see the three-year warranty which should be included with all business class and premium laptops.

Should you buy it?

Yes if you’re a businessperson who will benefit from plugging into an enterprise environment or a ThinkPad fan who’s looking for the latest and greatest.

It's a search engine.,"Zach Carter a 24-year-old brand strategist from Los Angeles curates his searches to which social platform he’s on. ""I'll go to TikTok for fashion food or culture because I know the user base of the app provides that content whereas on Twitter I’ll search for the news."" Carter isn't the only one: Increasingly young people are using social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram to search for things to do and places to try even seeking out news and important information rather than consulting traditional discovery tools like Google Search and Google Maps.

According to TechCrunch  Google’s Prabhakar Raghavan a senior vice president in charge of Google Search said ""In our studies something like almost 40 percent of young people when they're looking for a place for lunch they don't go to Google Maps or Search. They go to TikTok or Instagram."" He's referring to a survey of U.S. users ages 18 to 24.

As someone within that age group the statistic doesn't surprise me. Growing up with access to the internet I've learned to customize my experience on the internet. I know where to go for what and when searching for something hyper-specific sometimes Google Search isn't always my best friend. But I was curious how other people within Google’s age range searched so I spoke with 30 of my peers about their online search habits.

A UK survey found that TikTok is the fastest growing source of news among young adults ages 16 to 24. This obviously raises alarm because of the rampant misinformation on the platform  but TikTok isn't only being used as a news source.

Amanda Cash a 22-year-old law school student searches TikTok for recipe ideas and travel recommendations. Meanwhile 24-year-old Teresa in Southern California seeks out instructional how-to videos that are ""shorter and more to the point"" then what she’d typically find on YouTube.

I found that people are using TikTok similarly to how they use Pinterest. In February of this year TikTok launched a new feature called Collections essentially copying Pinterest’s defining feature. Collections allows TikTok users to organize their favorited videos into folders. Instagram implemented a similar feature in 2019 . The Collections feature allows users to save recommendations and organize them into useful categories making it easier for users to quickly return to ideas and recommendations.

""I'll search 'thrifting in Paris' or 'restaurants in Lisbon' and save the things that look good to a little folder to refer back to. I also have a little recipe folder. [I am a] big fan of the folder feature"" explained Cash.

It's not just that people are searching for suggestions on TikTok. They're also relying on their individual algorithms to feed them geo-specific recommendations. If you find something you want to try you can save it to a folder and return to your favorites when you need inspiration for where to go or what to cook.

In talking to my peers three things came up in nearly every conversation about what people turn to social media for: recipes restaurants and travel recommendations.

People are sick of the Google recipe algorithm that prioritizes obscure search engine optimized blogs. It's been a running joke on the internet that in order to read a recipe you have to get through the blogger’s entire life story but this is actually deterring the young people I talked to from searching for recipes on Google. Because a TikTok has to quickly grab your attention recipe videos on the platform are to the point putting the focus on the food not the creator.

Emily Mariko one of the most popular food creators on TikTok doesn’t talk to her 11.5 million followers in her videos rather she lets the food speak for itself. She draws the viewer in with her straightforward visual recipes and tidy plating showing how enticing video recipes can be without someone telling you every single step. It's a huge draw for 23-year-old Kyra Papazian. ""I mainly use TikTok and Instagram to look up recipes as opposed to searching that on Google"" she told Mashable. ""It can be a specific search like 'banana bread' or [a] general search like 'dinner ideas.' It's so much easier than searching a recipe on Google and scrolling through a long article.""

Emily Mariko's tiding plating allows the food to speak for itself. Credit: TikTok / emilymariko Credit: TikTok / emilymariko

Natalie Gomas a 23-year-old student from Boston uses TikTok for recipes and workout ideas. ""The way recipes are done on webpages annoys me a lot. You have to scroll through so much stuff to get to the actual recipes"" she told Mashable. Similarly the workouts she finds on the app ""aren't too complicated"" to try at home. ""The workouts on TikTok are workouts I'd actually want to do.""

In a TikTok you can immediately see what a restaurant looks like and see the person recommending it. It allows for maximum vibe reconnaissance. Additionally if someone made a TikTok on it and it came up on your FYP chances are it’s something you'll actually enjoy and the information is up to date. Since the pandemic began it's hard to know what information on Google Search is current. Several times I've found a restaurant through Google Search only to later discover that it's since gone out of business.

Ella Boyce a 23 year-old who has spent the past year traveling in South America and Europe relies on TikTok and Instagram for travel recommendations. ""A lot of blogs aren't designed for phones so it's hard to read and there's no centralized fount to crowd source info; it's all random decentralized blogs from Google” Boyce explained to Mashable. ""It's harder to tell someone's credibility from an article than from a video because you can see the person.""

So the next time you’re looking for travel inspiration or a place to grab a slice of pizza you might find what you’re searching for on TikTok."

On July 8 2019 the U.S. State Department has made a determination approving a possible Foreign Military Sale to TECRO (Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States) for the M1A2T Abrams Tanks and related equipment and support for an estimated cost of $2 billion.

TECRO has requested to buy one hundred eight (108) M1A2T Abrams Tanks and fourteen (14) M88A2 HERCULES Vehicles as well as associated weapons ammunition and military equipment.

The M1A2T tank prime contractor is General Dynamics Land Systems Sterling Heights Michigan. Production will be at Anniston Army Depot Anniston Alabama and the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center Lima Ohio. The M88A2 recovery vehicle prime contractor is BAE Systems York Pennsylvania. The M1070Al Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET) prime contractor is Oshkosh Defense.

The M1A2T is a tailored version of the American M1A2 SEP V2 according to Taiwanese army requirements. The M1A2 SEP V2 is an improvement of the M1A2 SEP main battle tank. Upgrades include improved survivability automotive power pack computer systems and night vision capabilities.

The M1A2 SEP V2 has improved microprocessors color flat panel displays improved memory capacity a better Soldier-machine interface and a new open operating system designed to run the Common Operating Environment (COE) software.

The main armament of the M1A2 SEP V2 is similar to the M1A2 Abrams which consists of one 120 mm smoothbore M256 cannon. It can fire a wide range of ammunition as the M829 APFSDS-T (Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) M830 HEAT-MP-T (High Explosive Anti-Tank-Multi Purpose - Tracer) M831 TP-T training round and M865 TPCSDS-T training round but also the M829A3 kinetic the M1028 canister rounds and the M829E4 120mm Advanced Kinetic Energy tactical tank round.

The M1A2 SEP V2 has a crew of four including a driver commander gunner and loader. The design of the M1A2 SEP V2 is similar to the standard M1A2 Abrams but fitted with improved frontal and side armor for enhanced crew survivability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L21hcmluZXMlRTIlODAlOTktbmV3ZXN0LXZlaGljbGUtd2lsbC1iZS1kcm9uZS13YXJmYXJlLWp1Z2dlcm5hdXQtMjAzODYw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Marines' Newest Vehicle Will Be a Drone Warfare Juggernaut,"The Marine Corps’ new Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle (ARV) will hunt enemies from ship to shore in support of amphibious attacks launching highly-lethal loitering attack drones to surveil and possibly destroy enemy targets.

The service is now evaluating ARV prototypes from Textron and General Dynamics Land Systems to determine which is best suited to meet future Marine Corps warfare requirements. General Dynamics’ offering attempts to align with future Marine Corps needs by providing the capability to launch reconnaissance and attack drones from the vehicle itself. This will prepare the platform for manned-unmanned teaming which will allow the Marine Corps to extend its surveillance reach even deeper into highly contested enemy territory.

In fact General Dynamics has already launched drones from its ARV prototype with the ultimate goal being to connect drones to other drones manned vehicles and even aircraft and surface ships General Dynamics developers say. General Dynamics developers say they aim to ensure that both the ARV vehicle and its forward-launched drones can connect with manned and unmanned combat nodes through a multi-domain sphere.

The manned-unmanned teaming concept of operation now being pursued tested and implemented across the military services is fundamental to the vision outlined in the Marine Corps’ Force Design 2030 strategy. The document calls for the elimination of tanks and other heavy platforms in favor of faster more deployable amphibious systems and weapons. Part of the rationale is in some ways based on the fighting in Ukraine where dispersed fast-moving fighters armed with anti-armor weapons have been able to prevail in ambushes and hit-and-run attacks against heavy armor. These tactics have often been enabled by small vehicles or hand-launched surveillance drones capable of identifying approaching enemy forces.

“As a ‘stand-in’ force of the future the Marine Corps requires a family of UAS [Unmanned Aerial Systems] capabilities. We need to transition from our current UAS platforms to capabilities that can operate from ship from shore and be able to employ both collection and lethal payloads. These future capabilities must be expeditionary and fully compatible with Navy platforms and command and control networks” Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger wrote in the Force Design 2030 strategy.

General Dynamics’ ARV offering may be able to do just that. “UAS being launched from the ARV can go out to a distance to target or collect enemy information. We use sensors both on and off the vehicle as we underwent testing for some of the networking and cyber functions. The vehicle performed well” said Phil Skuta General Dynamics Land Systems’ director of strategy and business development for the U.S. Marine Corps and Navy.

The U.S. Marine Corps Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle (ARV) a new platform in prototype form waiting for additional service testing and evaluations will likely include a range of laser weapons systems.

The ARV program which could enter production sometime next year is a key part of the U.S. Marine Corps strategy for future amphibious warfare particularly in the Pacific theater. The service is now evaluating two industry prototype offerings and vehicles from both Textron and General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) will soon be delivered to the service.

While there is some chance the new reconnaissance mission might be fulfilled by a modified version of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) a new ship-to-shore attack platform the U.S. Marine Corps has remained committed to developing a lighter expeditionary ARV to perform scout surveillance and reconnaissance missions. As a deployable light-weight vehicle as many as four ARVs could fit on a Landing Craft Air Cushion or Ship-to-Shore connector.

At the moment there is no formal U.S. Marine Corps requirement for lasers on the ARV. However industry builders such as GDLS are planning for the possibility that the service might want to add lasers to the vehicle. GDLS engineers have designed special accommodations for the vehicle to operate with enough power to support weapons such as lasers.

“We are anticipating in the future that the power demands for things like directed energy will be part of the Marine Corps future” Phil Skuta the director of strategy and business development US Marine Corps and Navy General Dynamics Land Systems told The National Interest in an interview.

High-tech weapons and rapid modernization for systems such as lasers are a point of emphasis in the U.S. Marine Corps Force Design 2030 document which anticipates multi-domain maritime warfare circumstances requiring advanced precision weaponry. Modern weapons for example will need to operate in what the U.S. Marine Corps calls a “stand in” capacity able to operate inside of an enemy’s engagement zone.

The Force Design document intends to prepare U.S. Marine Corps platforms for future weapons advanced tactics and warfare scenarios so it makes sense that GDLS and Pentagon developers would be considering lasers. Force Design 2030 does stress the importance of operating effectively within what it refers to as a “Weapons Engagement Zone.”

“Forces that can continue to operate inside an adversary’s long-range precision fire weapons engagement zone (WEZ) are more operationally relevant than forces which must rapidly maneuver to positions outside the WEZ in order to remain survivable” Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger wrote in the Marine Corps Force Design 2030 Document.

Operating from a highly-dangerous yet strategically advantageous position these so-called WEZ “stand-in” forces can “attrite adversary forces enable joint force access requirements complicate targeting and consume adversary ISR resources and prevent fait accompli scenarios” General Berger explained.

GIS,General Mills,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vaW93YWNhcGl0YWxkaXNwYXRjaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8zMS9nZW5lcmFsLW1pbGxzLWJvb3N0cy1kLWMtbG9iYnlpbmctcHJlc2VuY2UtYXMtY29uZ3Jlc3MtcmV2aWV3cy1mb29kLXBvbGljeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Mills boosts D.C. lobbying presence as Congress reviews food policy • Iowa Capital Dispatch,"By Emma Loop

WASHINGTON — The Minnesota-based food manufacturing giant best known for its sugary cereals and snacks is slowly expanding its lobbying operation in the nation’s capital as a Democratic-led Congress reviews sweeping food policy legislation.

General Mills spent $360000 on lobbying in the first quarter this year — nearly half of what it spent in all of 2021 and more than half of what it spent in the three years prior according to public disclosures.

This year the company has also doubled the number of lobbyists representing its interests in Washington from three to six. Among them are veteran Democrats with ties to Capitol Hill and the Obama administration.

The figures suggest General Mills is fortifying its government influence operations after several years of reduced activity and comes as lawmakers in D.C. craft a food and agriculture bill that will set policy for years to come and spend hundreds of billions of dollars.

What’s the point of the lobbying cash? Tough to say. A spokesperson for the company declined to answer specific questions about its lobbying activity.

But one likely target: Congressional committees have already started holding hearings on the Farm Bill which lawmakers need to reauthorize every five years and covers everything from crop insurance to food assistance programs. The last Farm Bill was enacted in 2018 meaning Congress is working to pass another one for 2023.

General Mills reported spending $330000 on in-house lobbying in this year’s first quarter and a similar amount at the end of last year. That lobbying was directed towards the U.S. House and Senate as well as the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce and involved a range of issues including “regenerative agriculture to mitigate climate change” and “anti-dumping duty on raw honey.”

General Mills has also used both its in-house operation and a new outside firm to lobby Congress and the USDA on federal nutrition programs. That firm Washington-based Olsson Frank Weeda Terman & Matz PC reported making $30000 lobbying for General Mills on “[h]ealth and nutrition standards in food assistance programs” in this year’s first quarter and recently reported another $40000 in income for the second quarter.

The firm which specializes in the food and agriculture industry lists three of its lobbyists as representing General Mills. One of them is Phil Karsting who served as head of the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service under former president Barack Obama and supported President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign. Another lobbyist Roger Szemraj worked as an aide to Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur on the powerful House Appropriations Committee and lists Farm Bills and food assistance programs as areas of expertise.

A General Mills spokesperson provided a link to a “Civic involvement” page on its website. That page lists some past lobbying efforts including “[s]upporting strong U.S. school nutrition standards including encouraging USDA to balance meal program flexibility and efficiency while ensuring Dietary Guidelines recommendations are followed especially related to whole grain-rich offerings” and “[s]upporting flexibilities in USDA food and nutrition programs to ensure full benefit access […] during the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Representatives for the House and Senate Agriculture committees which handle the Farm Bill did not respond to requests for comment.

Until the recent uptick General Mills’ lobbying efforts appeared to be declining after a peak in 2014 when it spent more than $2.7 million on influence efforts. It had spent millions on lobbying in the two years before and in 2012 had 11 lobbyists.

Around that time General Mills appears to have seen a significant drop in its business with the federal government. Up until 2012 the company was taking in around $200 million each year from the Department of Defense for food products.

In 2011 the United States officially ended the war in Iraq which at its peak saw more than 150000 US troops stationed in the country.

Here’s a look at General Mills and its lobbying activity in 2022:

We’ve covered how brands condemn greedy dealer markups and how they’ll add stipulations saying that certain cars can’t be resold for a certain period after the initial purchase. What we haven’t seen is a new move from General Motors where they’re planning to cancel warranty coverage on desirable vehicles that trade hands within the first 12 months of ownership.

First spotted on Twitter a letter from General Motors North American president Steve Carlisle went out to GM dealers recently addressing the practice of vehicle flipping. We’ve already seen a number of high-profile vehicles like the Hummer EV trade hands at prices far above their original MSRP. One sold in April for $275000 and GM says that such behavior can damage the brand.

To combat that the letter to dealers says that “we are limiting the transferability of certain warranties and barring the seller from placing future sold orders or reservations for certain high demand models.” So not only will the warranty be affected but the flipper can be banned from buying future models.

“Currently the products impacted by these changes include the following: 23MY Cadillac Escalade-V Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and GMC HUMMER EV” the letter says. It’s worthy of note that the letter specifically uses the word “currently” which makes us think that GM might apply this tactic to future products if it deems it successful.

Carlisle goes on to mention that more information will be headed to specific brands in the near future and at that time dealers will get full details on the new limitations.

Specifically buyers can resell their cars if the purchase was made within the past 12 months. On the other hand General Motors also announced that sellers would be restricted from placing future reservations or sold orders for some in-demand models.

""When vehicles are quickly resold particularly by unauthorized dealers or other resellers that do not adhere to GM's standards the customer experience suffers and GM's brands are damaged"" explained Carlisle.

He added that the new warranty transferability changes are now being rolled out saying that these adjustments will ensure buyers can have exemplary customer service experiences.

The warranty transfer limitations are also expected to strengthen GM's branding and encourage ownership by brand critics and loyal consumers.

GM Models Affected

GM's new warranty limitations will affect the GMC Hummer electric vehicles (SUV and SUT) the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 as well as the 23MY Cadillac Escalade-V.

As of press time General Motors is having a hard time with its electric Hummer models because these EVs were developed from scratch.

Various sources said that the automaker only manufactures around 12 of its Hummer EVs per day. You can click this link to see more about GM's production issues.

Recently GM and Ford are expected to overtake Tesla in the EV market around 2025.

On the other hand General Motors' EV First Responder Training Program was launched to train employees.

GM had sent out emails to Z06 order holders offering them $5000 worth of rewards points if they keep their cars for at least one year. However GM is taking even further action to prevent people from flipping its high-demand cars.

A GM spokesperson told The Drive for certain high-demand products: ""we are limiting the transferability of certain warranties and barring the seller from placing future sold orders or reservations if the vehicle is resold within the first 12 months of ownership."" Those high-demand products are the Corvette Z06 the Cadillac Escalade-V and the GMC Hummer EV.

So if someone flips a Z06 or any other high-demand GM vehicle the flipper won't be allowed to place any orders on any future GM products. It also isn't great for the second buyer of the car who will not only pay above MSRP to the flipper but will find out the hard way that it doesn't actually come with much of a warranty. Though I guess that's what you get when you encourage car flipping.

GM’s North America President Steve Carlisle sent out a letter to dealers on Friday alerting them of the new policy. Carlisle told dealers back in January that when a high-demand vehicle is bought and sold so quickly especially when it's sold to an unauthorized dealer it not only hurts the customer but the brand. He also reminded dealers of their contractual requirements and GM's policies on selling new cars for resale.

A GM spokesperson also told The Drive: ""This will help prioritize ownership by our top brand enthusiasts and most loyal customers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2hvdy1yZWxpYWJsZS1hcmUtZ21zLWxzLWVuZ2luZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's The Truth About The General Motor's Popular LS V8 Engine's Reliability,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2hvdy1yZWxpYWJsZS1hcmUtZ21zLWxzLWVuZ2luZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Manufacturers of Yutong Bus and Kojo Motors a reputable auto distributor of vehicles in Nigeria have pledged to ensure that buyers of the sturdy bus get good returns on investment.

They plan to do this by providing only original parts and high quality original parts according to Kojo Motors officials during a forum for customers fleet operators and partners at the 2022 Service Marketing Campaign in Ikeja Lagos recently.

They reassured users of the bus particularly transporters of the gains in buying any bus in the range and according to

The National Sales Manager of Kojo Motors Limited Chino Ogwumike said the Yutong national service marketing campaign was put together among others “to take a look at many years of Kojo Motors market presence amid teething economic challenges.”

The company presented a new range of Yutong models discussing the improvement in the planning and quality of customer maintenance work to reduce the failure rate of customer vehicles “so as to improve the operation rate of the vehicles.”

The day’s programme also provided an opportunity for the audience to discuss “the importance of promoting dealer parts consigned parts that have not been sold for a long time as well as service spare parts that have not been cancelled for a long time.”

Officials analysed steps that should be taken towards improving the popularity and reputation of Yutong buses in the country and enhancing the influence of dealers while information about intending customers and sales promotions was gathered.

At the event presentations about Yutong service programmes including technical training driver and personnel training and Yutong genuine spare parts promotions were also discussed.

The Executive Director Kojo Motors Chinedu Oguegbu and other facilitators stated the need for the local automotive market to transition to sustainable energy vehicles including natural gas vehicles (NGV) and electric vehicles (EV) in line with global quest to combat climate change.

Guangxi Yuchai one of the leading engine manufacturers also made presentations about their natural gas engines. There was a very engaging interaction with all attendees.

Suggestions and innovative ideas were also deliberated upon to ensure continued growth of the Yutong bus presence on the road and increased customer satisfaction in the Nigerian market.

Kojo Motors officials said they are currently running a promo on spare parts with a generous 20 per cent discount on orders that will take 90 days to arrive in Nigeria.

The automobile dealership company is also offering 4 per cent discount if order is placed in USD and 3 per cent discount for cash purchase in Naira. The promo will lasts till September 30 2022.

According to the company’s national sales manager Chino Ogwumike “We at Kojo wish to assure and re-assure Yutong; our bus manufacturers with their strong marketing and after-sales support the bus brand shall continue to show more and more presence on Nigerian roads. And to our teeming transport companies using the products we can confidently say that the Yutong bus is durable built to last and guarantees higher returns on investment (RoI).”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The World Trade Organization recently agreed to suspend patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines. The trade body is now considering going one step further: extending the intellectual property waiver to Covid-19 therapeutics and diagnostics. That misguided idea would have disastrous consequences: further eroding intellectual property protections will discourage research and development and make it even harder to fight deadly diseases and future pandemics.

South Africa and India first proposed an intellectual property waiver nearly two years ago. They claimed that suspending patents would allow manufacturers in developing countries to produce generic versions of vaccines and therapeutics without paying royalties to the companies that developed them which was necessary to curb the pandemic and vaccinate people around the world.

Even then the argument was a stretch. But now at a time when the global vaccine market is glutted and drug companies have formed countless voluntary partnerships with manufacturers in developing countries the original logic behind the waiver has proven patently false.

Consider Aspen a South African manufacturer that inked a licensing deal to produce Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine late last year. As of mid-May after two months of production Aspen hadn’t received a single order for its version of the J&J shot. Other manufacturers are reporting similar stories. The Serum Institute of India the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer halted production of Covid-19 vaccines in April after accumulating 200 million unused shots. Hundreds of millions of the country’s excess doses are expected to expire in September.

Simply put vaccine supply isn’t the problem. The true barriers to global vaccination have been and remain vaccine hesitancy logistical problems and trade barriers. No number of doses or licensing deals — either voluntary or coerced — can overcome those administrative and cultural hurdles.

advertisement

That hasn’t stopped WTO members from latching onto the erroneous idea that patents are the culprit for lagging global vaccination efforts and the prolonged fight against Covid-19. The recently-agreed-upon vaccine waiver resulted from months of closed-door negotiations between South Africa India the EU and the United States.

The WTO has pledged to consider expanding the waiver to Covid-19 therapeutics within six months — despite the fact that the manufacturers of those therapeutics like vaccine manufacturers have already made voluntary agreements to help get the medications to those who need them across the globe.

In May 2020 Gilead Sciences established a voluntary licensing program for remdesivir an antiviral initially developed for hepatitis and Ebola that proved somewhat effective against Covid-19. The company reported in July 2022 that more than 11 million people in 127 low- and middle-income countries had access to the drug because of its licensing agreements with generics manufacturers.

In October 2021 Merck agreed to a deal with the United Nations’ Medicines Patent Pool that allows manufacturers in more than 100 countries to make molnupiravir its Covid-19 antiviral medication. A few weeks later Pfizer made a similar agreement with the UN organization for Paxlovid its antiviral pill. As of March 35 generics companies had signed up to begin manufacturing Pfizer’s pill.

In other words patents aren’t preventing generics manufacturers in low-income countries from licensing and producing Covid-19 therapies so waiving patent protections wouldn’t increase the availability of those drugs. It would simply force companies like Gilead Merck and Pfizer to give up their intellectual property without earning any royalties from it.

That would set a dangerous precedent one that could have disastrous long-term consequences for future innovation — and people who are hoping for better treatments and cures.

It takes roughly $2 billion to bring a drug to market. Exclusive patent rights give biotech investors confidence that they’ll be able to generate adequate returns if they’re lucky enough to get their experimental medicines through the regulatory approval process and onto pharmacy shelves.

Knowing that the WTO could invalidate those patent protections would cause investors to hesitate backing the next groundbreaking treatments both for Covid-19 and other future health crises.

That will make the development of drugs like Paxlovid — which reduces risk of Covid-19 hospitalization or death by 51% — increasingly unlikely. It will make it harder for companies like Gilead to ramp up manufacturing and delivery of stockpiled drugs to combat new threats. And it will cause drugmakers to think twice before researching and developing treatments for deadly diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer’s.

Anyone looking for future cures can only hope the WTO declines to further weaken protection for intellectual property.

Football was my first passion in life. Not only did I enjoy the competition and ability to improve my playing skills it gave me the opportunity to meet an inspiring community of professional football players many of whom I have stayed in touch with. However there came a moment when I felt the time was right to launch a professional career.

Don’t get me wrong women’s football has grown in popularity hugely over the last few years. We only need to see the excitement the Euros is generating with the progress the England team is making. It is rightfully getting the recognition and funding it deserves. When I played however it wasn’t exactly like that so it was sadly quite difficult to sustain a living just playing football.

I knew I wanted to pursue a career in finance but I wasn’t interested in taking the traditional university path. Like playing and training on the football pitch I wanted a hands-on experience instead of sitting in a lecture theatre. So when I was 18 I did an accounting apprenticeship. It proved to be a very rewarding and insightful experience and whilst my career in finance gained traction sadly I no longer had the time to do both so I made the hard decision to hang up my boots and focus on my career in finance. I then qualified as a chartered accountant and started my own business in 2017.

Tell us about Transact365 – who are you and how did it come about?



After getting my ACA I worked in a corporate services firm. At the time I spotted a gap in the payments market for a system that truly served merchants in emerging markets. I saw merchants being held back by the options that were available to them so in 2017 I set up Transact365 alongside my fellow co founders.

Transact365 has fast become one of the leading global payment platforms in the UK. We’re headquartered in London and have hundreds of merchants using our platform for their local payment processing solutions.

Can you tell us about your current markets and ambitions for growth?

We are based in the UK and Europe and our ambition as a business is to provide merchants in these regions with access to new and prosperous emerging markets including Latin America India and Asia. Our goal is to make sure our merchants can efficiently process local payments through our payment gateway.

We’ve grown considerably over the past few years – we recently achieved 300% year-on-year growth which was a huge achievement for us. Our ambition as a business is to continue giving merchants a new way of reaching their customers in the best way possible. Our chargeback ratio currently for instance has hit an all time low of 0.004% – something we’re incredibly proud of as a team.

Does your football career give you any skills or experience that you can take into business?

From my perspective there are key parallels between football and fintech. To become both a professional footballer or a fintech founder you need discipline dedication passion and a hunger to always be the best – the competition in both fields is fierce. These are all character traits I learnt from a very young age on the pitch that I took into the boardroom with me. I am naturally a very competitive person which I have found to be beneficial for me in my career although it annoys my family sometimes!

How heartening is it as an ex-footballer to see the women’s game become so popular and does it offer any comparisons to the world of finance?

It’s been amazing to see the buzz around the women’s Euros at Old Trafford [where the previous record attendance was broken earlier in the championship]. Having been brought up near Manchester it’s great to see my home county flying the flag for women’s football. While it’s fantastic the games are selling out and the footballers are getting the attention from the fans and media they deserve it is a shame it’s taken us so long to get to this point. Only 10 years ago the women’s game was hardly spoken about despite the huge amount of talent we had across the country.

On a positive note however it does show how quickly gender stereotypes and inequality can change and that’s something we’re certainly seeing in the fintech sector too. More and more women are entering the industry and making the most of the endless opportunities fintech offers. I’m confident this will only improve as time goes by.

And finally will you be cheering on the Lionesses in the final?

Absolutely! A couple of my ex-teammates are in the England team so I will definitely be looking out for them and cheering them on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tb25leS8yMDIyL2p1bC8zMC9icmV4aXQtdWstc2hvcHBlcnMtcGF5LW1vcmUtZXUtemFyYS1pa2VhLWRlY2F0aGxvbtIBYGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tb25leS8yMDIyL2p1bC8zMC9icmV4aXQtdWstc2hvcHBlcnMtcGF5LW1vcmUtZXUtemFyYS1pa2VhLWRlY2F0aGxvbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Brexit to blame’: UK shoppers pay up to 50% more than those in EU,"Zara is charging British shoppers as much as 50% more than in Spain while Decathlon partly blames Brexit for markups on e-bikes that can be up to £250 pricier in the UK than in France.

The figures come from a snapshot survey by Guardian Money that examined prices of popular items at pan-European retailers including Ikea Apple JD Sports and H&M as well as Zara and Decathlon. It compared prices in the UK Germany France Spain Italy and Ireland.

It found that while at some retailers such as JD Sports prices are broadly similar across Britain and the EU countries at others prices in the UK are markedly higher. None of the retailers had generally lower prices in the UK.

The findings add another twist to the current UK cost of living crisis.

Zara Europe’s biggest clothing retailer has some of the biggest percentage price differentials between the UK and the rest of Europe.

A British shopper pays £49.99 for a linen blend tunic dress at one of Zara’s stores in the UK equal to €58.70 at current exchange rates. But at Zara in Germany France Italy and Ireland the price is €49.95 and in Spain only €39.95.

A men’s hoodie that sells for £45.99 in the UK equal to €53.99 sells for only €35.95 (£30.62) in Spain meaning a buyer in Manchester is charged 50% more than in Madrid for the identical item.

Decathlon the French sports goods retailer that operates 2000 stores across 56 countries charges £1299.99 for a Riverside electric bike in its UK stores equal to €1525. But in France Spain and Italy the price for the same item is €1199. The e-bike buyer at Decathlon’s Brighton store is therefore paying €326 (£278) more than if they popped across the channel and bought it in Dieppe.

Decathlon largely blamed Brexit for the price differentials. It said: “The UK’s exit from the European Union has made it more expensive to import stock. It also meant that Decathlon UK had to expand the size of the supply team in order to deal with the additional administration costs and duties associated with Britain’s exit from the customs union.

“In the UK specifically we have the obvious challenges involved in dealing with constantly changing exchange rates coupled with the post-Brexit burden of having to pay import duties twice on a number of products (once as goods enter the EU and again once they enter the UK).”

The research findings were shown to Zara but the retailer declined to comment.

The survey had substantial limitations: it only compared prices on a relatively small number of identical items at each retailer and comparative prices for the UK are subject to change according to daily fluctuations in the euro-sterling exchange rate.

But it was notable that shoppers in Britain are paying either significantly more or largely the same as shoppers elsewhere in Europe. Rarely did we find examples of prices that were lower in the UK than on the continent.

The following is what we found when we went shopping at each retailer in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.

Zara

Our survey found a fairly consistent pattern of pricing with the lowest prices in Zara’s home market of Spain then a consistent band of prices across Euro-denominated countries then often (although not always) higher prices in the UK.

We found that for the store’s lower-price items – such as shirts – its prices in the UK were on a par with most other European locations although higher than in Spain.

Concerned that we were being unfair on the retailer – maybe chancing across some items that just happened to be more expensive in the UK – we trawled through multiple items at the store and found even bigger price differentials than at first.

Take for example a printed kaftan dress that sells for £79.99 at Zara in the UK – equal to €93.90. In Germany it is €69.95 and in Spain only €59.95. So British buyers are paying 56% more than the Spanish.

However we also found a men’s linen shirt that is £32.99 in the UK equal to €38.73 that was €39.95 in Germany – €1.22 more expensive. But in Spain it was €29.95.

Zara is part of the Inditex group which includes brands such as Massimo Dutti Pull&Bear and Bershka.

At Massimo Dutti we found similar price differentials to Zara. A men’s wool suit blazer sells for £229 in the UK equal to €268. But in Germany it’s only €219 and in Spain €179. The buyer in Britain is paying €89 more than the buyer in Spain for the identical jacket.

We don’t know why Zara and Massimo Dutti appear to charge so much more in the UK and how much of the difference is because of Brexit as the company declined to answer our questions. What we do know is that Inditex made a £98m profit in the UK in 2021 according to its global annual report.

The conclusion? If you are heading to Spain this summer and have your eye on a Zara dress or top it’s definitely worth buying it there rather than in the UK – subject to the UK’s post-Brexit customs and duties rules when you bring it back into the country.

Decathlon

The retailer has 47 stores across the UK usually edge-of-town big-box outlets near companies such as Ikea. But while it is highly regarded for the quality of its own-brand sports merchandise we found prices in Britain can be significantly higher than elsewhere in Europe.

As noted previously its Riverside e-bike retails in Britain for 27% more than in France or other European locations.

There are similar price differentials on other items. For example its standup paddleboard sells for £299 in the UK equal to €351. But in France it is €269. France is Decathlon’s home turf but elsewhere in Europe prices are lower than in the UK. That paddleboard is €269.99 in Germany and Italy.

Guardian Money included Ireland in the overall price survey because in many cases what is sold in Irish stores is sourced from logistics centres in the UK so one might assume prices would be similar to the UK plus maybe a bit extra for the additional transportation.

But even in Ireland where consumers have long endured some of Europe’s highest retail prices Dublin’s Decathlon came out cheaper than the UK – in some cases substantially so.

Decathlon explained that Brexit plus other factors were behind the higher UK prices. “First and foremost it is important to note that each Decathlon business unit operates as an independent autonomous entity in its respective country. Decathlon has a range of very different competitors in each of the countries in which it operates and pricing has to reflect this.”

In relation to Ireland the company added: “Their stock comes directly from France and given that they are an EU member state they are not burdened with the same additional costs as the UK.”

Ikea

The first item we chose to price-test was the furniture retailer’s classic product: the Billy bookcase. The basic version is £50 in the UK equal to €58.70 at the time of the test. In Spain it was €59 and in France €59.99 – so almost no difference. But in Germany it was €55 so a few quid cheaper than the UK.

We then moved on to a chest of drawers: the Koppang. This was £150 in the UK equal to €176. Germany and Spain were this time significantly cheaper at €149 or 15% cheaper than the UK although France was higher.

Next we examined a sofa. Ikea’s bestselling basic Klippan two-seater sofa in dark grey is £279 (€327) in the UK but €259 in Germany and €249 in France. So shoppers at Ikea in Britain are paying almost a third more for a basic Ikea sofa than those in France.

We asked Ikea the same questions as we put to Zara and Decathlon. It declined to answer the questions and sent a statement instead. It said: “We are not immune to the current macroeconomic developments facing businesses retailers and the public at large. Many Ikea countries have seen price changes; however the changes will differ from country to country as prices are influenced not only by the raw material prices but also by transport logistical costs and local market conditions.”

JD Sports

This UK company based in Bury now operates in 29 countries with 3300 stores.

But don’t wait to buy your trainers on holiday – prices were very similar across the UK and elsewhere in Europe.

For example the Nike React Vision men’s trainers are £120 in the UK equal to €141. But in every other European market we tested the price was €135. So the UK price was more expensive – but only by 4%. That is the sort of gap where movements in the euro-sterling exchange rate could soon wipe out any difference.

Apple

Apple products have long been cheaper in the US than in Europe but within Europe the differences judged by our price test are minimal.

We looked at the new iPhone 13 Pro Max 6.7in 256GB in various markets around Europe. This was the only item where the UK came out cheapest – although by only 1.5%.

The UK price was £1149 or €1349. In Germany it is €20 more expensive and in France and Spain it is €30 pricier. Inevitably we found it cheaper in the US where it retails for just under £1000 on current exchange rates – a saving of £150 compared with the UK.

Apple appears to run a pricing model with small price variations across Europe which makes it pointless for shoppers to cross borders to buy while offering its products significantly cheaper on its home turf the US. It did not respond to questions submitted by Guardian Money.

H&M

We found that the clothing company H&M prices its goods in the UK almost identically to the rest of Europe.

We looked first at a linen blend shirt dress which retails in the UK stores for £39.99 equal to €46.97. In every other EU market we tested the price was €49.99 so the shopper in Britain is saving about £3.

We then examined some men’s cargo joggers that are £29.99 in the UK or €35.23. In EU markets the price was €34.99 so a few cents cheaper.

In a statement H&M said: “Our prices should be more or less the same across markets; however they can differ slightly due to local taxes cost levels and local external variables. We are happy to see the outcome of your price comparison reflects that and we continue to meet our customer offer.”

How we did the survey

Prices were taken from each retailer’s direct-to-consumer website in each individual country. Prices taken 18-19 July. The sterling-to-euro conversion was made on 22 July at a rate of £1 = €1.1740.

Duties and taxes: beware extra charges

View image in fullscreen Britons have to declare any goods worth more than £390 on their return. Photograph: Tommy London/Alamy

If you spend more than £390 in shops elsewhere in Europe this summer get ready to pay customs duties and VAT on your return – which can easily add 20% or more to the price paid.

This is the first big summer getaway where millions of returning British holidaymakers will have to decide if they should walk through the “something to declare” gate at British airports after shopping abroad.

The vast majority of holidaymakers whose spending consists of little more than flip-flops or sunglasses will not be hit by the tariffs.

But a holidaymaker splashing out on say a €500 suit or dress while in an EU country would have to pay up to £99 in duties and VAT when they return to the UK.

The British government has an online tool for calculating and paying tax and duties.

Holidaymakers are liable for taxes and duties on all goods bought over the £390 allowance

Most of the extra can be VAT rather than customs duties which are charged at a flat rate of 2.5% on goods worth between £390 and £630. Using the example of a €500 suit the HM Revenue and Customs site shows a £10.76 customs charge and an £88.24 VAT charge.

Holidaymakers are liable for taxes and duties on all goods bought over the £390 allowance. For example if you are bringing in a £500 laptop and a £100 watch you will need to pay tax on the watch and the laptop.

Navigating the rules is not easy. You have to declare where the item was made as well as where it was bought. That €500 item of adult clothing bought in Spain comes with a £99 charge if it was made outside the EU but £86.08 if made inside.

If you live in Northern Ireland then it’s a completely different story with the province treated as if it is inside the EU for customs purposes. That means the tax on an item of adult clothing bought in Barcelona and taken home to Belfast is zero.

HMRC’s website says: “You do not pay duty or tax on alcohol tobacco and most other goods you bring in to Northern Ireland from the EU.”

One bonus for the holidaymakers is that duty-free shopping is once again good value when visiting EU countries from Britain.

You can bring in up to 18 litres of wine 4 litres of spirits or 42 litres of beer duty-free into the UK.

Never once did Russell believe any of those big men who may have earned hundreds of millions more than him would ever be able to score on him or outwork him or screen him from a rebound. Or most importantly stop him from winning.

Never could enough be said about Bill Russell a man we mere mortals considered indispensable. A man we thought would live forever sharing stories with his bushy gray beard and cackling laugh. A man who impacted generations because he appreciated those who came after him. He admired their games presented them with awards appreciated their physical prowess.

How do you begin to compliment the person who is beyond compliments? How do you begin to laud the person beyond adulation?

Russell was the ultimate winner. There are those who scored more points pulled down more rebounds or even blocked more shots but Russell’s records were on the scoreboard.

And a man who accomplished so much success on the floor had the guile poise and patience to be a leader off the floor despite the racism despite the outright hatred he endured in some cities even at home. He persevered broke barriers and personified Black greatness.

We almost overlook that Russell was the first Black professional head coach of any major North American sport. We almost forget he won two championships as a player-coach. We almost forget that he made the smooth transition into television. We should never forget that he personified class and grace and perseverance in a time when Black achievement was notoriously difficult.

He shared a difficult relationship with this city. He withstood so much criticism and adversity outside the Boston organization. He never quite felt welcome here until his later years. He didn’t give America a break for being slow to accept and embrace diversity and civil rights.

Boston tried to repay its debt to Russell. The Celtics retired his number despite him refusing to attend the ceremony. The city gave him a statue. He was treated regally each time he stepped foot in the Garden including last November. One would hope Russell completely forgave the city.

Russell bonded with players young enough to be his great grandsons. He appeared at the first Celtics-Lakers game after the tragic January 2020 passing of Kobe Bryant wearing a Kobe jersey and cap. He chatted with Kevin Garnett. He gave the middle finger to Charles Barkley and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at the NBA Awards. He eulogized old buddy/adversary Wilt Chamberlain at his 1999 funeral.

He remained a visible influential figure 50 years after his final game. He is the No. 1 athlete to put on a Boston uniform. He is the greatest Celtic of all time. Any athlete that wore No. 6 from Julius Erving to LeBron James to Ryan Howard was always associated with Russell. He owns No. 6.

Russell should be remembered as more than a Celtic more than an 11-time champion more than a civil rights pioneer. As someone who eradicated barriers erased stereotypes and removed perceptions with his brilliance his class his strength and his stubbornness. He refused to be viewed as anything but a man. He did not spend a fraction of compassion on those who were intimidated by him. Those who looked at his 6-foot 10-inch frame his brown complexion and goatee and were daunted.

That was their problem. He was not here to make them comfortable to show his tender side to display what was an engaging and affable personality to those who did not deserve such treatment.

He was very comfortable in his own skin. He told you exactly what he thought. Time and reflection warmed some of those bitter feelings some of those chilly past relationships such as with Bob Cousy and others he felt weren’t as supportive during his difficult times in Boston. Some of those old grudges dissipated and even old Russ softened a little as he aged.

The world has changed so much since Russell’s last game in 1969. The NBA is filled with Black coaches. Diversity and inclusion are the benchmarks of the league. It wasn’t always that way. There were some owners frightened by the possibility the league could become mostly Black. They were scared of the possibility that young Black men from the inner city would someday dominate their league.

Russell was not the intermediary. He was not the articulate man who made those power brokers feel comfortable. That was beneath him. His primary goal was to prove through his actions that he was better than they would have expected or envisioned.

He was a man in his own class. There has never been a match. He fused athletics and social activism. He fused his generation and this generation. He was beloved not for always being a nice guy not for signing autographs or being congenial but for being the ultimate competitor the ultimate winner the ultimate teammate.

In a generation consumed with stats captivated by numbers Russell remains the transcendent example that winning is all that matters. It’s the bottom line.

And there was never a bigger winner than Bill Russell in basketball and in life.

India broke several temperature records. The warmest March in more than a century was recorded across the country and a new high of more than 49C was hit in Delhi in May.

Record-breaking heat has also been recorded elsewhere this year including the UK which smashed its previous record by an incredible 1.6C reaching more than 40C. Portugal reached 47C on the 21st of this month the hottest July day on record while several places in France recorded new highs.

These heatwaves have reignited the debate about how we can protect people from rising temperatures – and how high we can stand them to go. But the headline figures do not give the whole story when it comes to the impact of high temperatures on humans because humidity which is not factored into these figures plays a huge role in how we actually experience heat.

Recent research has found that we may actually already be nearing the threshold values for human survivability of temperature and humidity for short periods in some places of the world – a measure known as the “wet-bulb” temperature – and that this threshold may actually be far lower than previously thought.

What does wet-bulb temperature mean?

Wet-bulb temperature (WBT) combines dry air temperature (as you’d see on a thermometer) with humidity – in essence it is a measure of heat-stress conditions on humans.

The term comes from how it is measured. If you slide a wet cloth over the bulb of a thermometer the evaporating water from the cloth will cool the thermometer down. This lower temperature is the WBT which cannot go above the dry temperature. If humidity in the surrounding air is high however – meaning the air is already more saturated with water – less evaporation will occur so the WBT will be closer to the dry temperature.

“The [wet-bulb] temperature reading you get will actually change depending on how humid it is” says Kristina Dahl a climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “That’s the real purpose to measure how well we’ll be able to cool ourselves by sweating.”

Humidity and temperature are not the only things that affect a person’s body temperature: solar radiation and wind speed are other factors. But WBT is especially important as a measure of indoor environments where deaths often occur in heatwaves says W Larry Kenney a physiology professor at Penn State University.

When do wet-bulb temperatures get dangerous?

Concern often centres on the “threshold” or “critical” WBT for humans the point at which a healthy person could survive for only six hours. This is usually considered to be 35C approximately equivalent to an air temperature of 40C with a relative humidity of 75%. (At the UK’s 19 July peak temperature relative humidity was approximately 25% and the wet-bulb temperature about 25C.)

Humans usually regulate their internal body temperature by sweating but above the wet-bulb temperature we can no longer cool down this way leading our body temperature to rise steadily. This essentially marks a limit to human adaptability to extreme heat – if we cannot escape the conditions our body’s core can rise beyond the survivable range and organs can start failing.

The oft-cited 35C value comes from a 2010 theoretical study. However research co-authored by Kenney this year found that the real threshold our bodies can tolerate could be far lower. “Our data is actual human subject data and shows that the critical wet-bulb temperature is closer to 31.5C” he says.

Bill McGuire director of the Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre in the UK says if the new finding is true we are in “a whole new ball game” when it comes to extreme heat. “The numbers of people exposed to potentially deadly combinations of heat and humidity across the world would be vastly higher than previously thought.”

It is important to note that heat gets dangerous for many people far below the threshold WBT.

Where could the wet-bulb threshold be passed?

In a global context the UK is a relatively low-risk area for wet-bulb extremes – it has rarely reached above 28C so far. “My personal feeling is that a wet-bulb temperature of 35C would not be possible in the UK although 31C may well be later in the century” says McGuire. “Then again the Met Office certainly didn’t expect 40C [dry temperature] heat in 2022.”

The risk of passing the WBT threshold is larger elsewhere however. One 2015 study concluded extremes are likely to approach and exceed 35C in the region around the Arabian Gulf towards the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions are not reined in posing questions for human habitability there.

In 2020 research found that some coastal subtropical locations have already experienced WBTs of 35C albeit only for a few hours.

“Previous studies projected that this would happen several decades from now but this shows it’s happening right now” said lead author Colin Raymond a climate scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “The times these events last will increase and the areas they affect will grow in direct correlation with global warming.”

The study also found that globally the number of times that a WBT of 30C was reached – still considered an extreme humidity and heat event – more than doubled between 1979 and 2017. There were about 1000 occurrences of a 31C WBT and about a dozen above 35C in Pakistan India Saudi Arabia Mexico and Australia.

One important question is how temperature rises because of the climate crisis correlate with rises in WBT extremes. A study last year found that the maximum WBT in the tropics will rise by 1C for each 1C of average warming. This means limiting global heating to 1.5C above the pre-industrial era would prevent the majority of the tropical area – where 40% of the global population lives – from reaching the survival limit of 35C the paper said.

Heatwaves are worsening many times faster than any other type of extreme weather because of the climate crisis. Scientists estimate that it made the India and Pakistan heatwave 30 times more likely. As another paper put it asking whether today’s most impactful heatwaves could have occurred in a pre-industrial climate is “fast becoming an obsolete question”.

Instead as heatwaves begin affecting more people’s lives more frequently the question of what we can do about them is becoming ever more important. As the world sees the deadly mix of high humidity and high temperature more and more often this could ultimately mean that some places simply become too hot to live in opening up the need for migration pathways to enable millions of people to get away from their home areas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9nbG9iZWdhemV0dGUvbmFtZS9zdGVwaGVuLW1pbGVzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MDgyMDIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stephen Miles Obituary (2022) - Mason City IA - Globe Gazette,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/globegazette/name/stephen-miles-obituary?id=36082021 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9nbG9iZWdhemV0dGUvbmFtZS9zdGVwaGVuLW1pbGVzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MDgyMDIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The new owner promised to compete with Paris-Saint-Germain's domination stating in a press conference that he has ""invested [his] own funds."" Of the 523 million euros obtained Mr. Textor is already planning on injecting 86 million in the summer transfer window. Mr. Aulas is expected to remain OL's president for the next three seasons but he is no longer the majority shareholder.

This takeover is part of a pattern that has been observed for 10 years now in French professional football: a wealthy foreign investor coming in to take over a club's ownership.

Ligue 1 club owners Saint-Etienne Bordeaux and Metz were relegated this year. Toulouse Ajaccio and Auxerre were promoted from Ligue 2.

Various motives: diplomacy business or sporting results

In France the year 2011 was marked by the purchase by investors of two of the biggest Ligue 1 clubs. They had deep pockets and planned to inject financial sums unheard of in the French league. In 2011 Colony Capital the majority shareholder of Paris-Saint-Germain with more than 95 % of the shares was losing money. The fund sold 70% of its shares to Qatar Sports Investment part of the nation's sovereign wealth fund. The nation uses football's soft power to improve its reputation. During the 2010-2011 season PSG's budget was almost doubled from 80 to 150 million euros and has not stopped rising since.

In 2011 the Principality of Monaco sold two-thirds of the shares of AS Monaco to Russian businessman Dmitri Rybolovlev for one symbolic euro after several refusals. At the time according to an administrator of the Monegasque club the princely family did not want to continue to ""totally finance the club"" whose accounts were in bad shape. The Russian businessman's investments eventually paid off and transformed Monaco into a top club upon its return to Ligue 1 in the 2013-2014 season at which point the club's budget was increased by 100 million euros.

A decade-long race

While French professional clubs have increased their budgets over the years the gradual arrival of foreign investors has more than doubled the average budget of clubs in Ligue 1 which have risen from €52 million in 2011 to €116 million in 2022.

Today the top five Ligue 1 budgets (Paris Lyon Marseille Monaco and Lille) belong to teams owned by foreign investors: Americans Russians Luxembourgers or Qataris. In 2022 foreign capital will represent three quarters of the total budget of Ligue 1 clubs.

French professional football is being outbid financially by foreign investors just like the English Premier League or the Italian Serie A which are also coveted by foreign capital. While this was still impossible 20 years ago in the early days of football as business the gaps are widening between clubs in the same division like the giant PSG and its 620 million euros against AC Ajaccio – which is moving to Ligue 1 next season – and its 8.5 million euros last season although a relative increase in the budget was confirmed by the club's president. The combined budget of Ligue 1 clubs in 2000 was 915 million euros compared to nearly 2.4 billion euros next season. The combined budget of Ligue 1 clubs in 2000 was 915 million euros compared to nearly 2.4 billion euros next season.

Foreign capital represents three-quarters of the total budget of Ligue 1 clubs. Ligue 1 clubs budgets for the 2021-22 season. In green  foreign-owned clubs and in yellow  French-owned clubs



These amounts make it increasingly difficult for small clubs to keep up with the level of financial competition. For example Angers SCO which is experiencing budget difficulties and is under scrutiny by French football's financial authorities will have to change its majority shareholder in order to reclaim management of the club. On May 18 Saïd Chabane told his employees that he would sell his shares probably to American investment group GFC for between 65 and 75 million euros according to L'Equipe.

Buying a club: a risky investment

The takeover of French clubs by foreign capital has followed the same pattern for the last 10 year. Clubs with declining performances (PSG Bordeaux...) or in a poor financial situation (Angers Monaco...) are bought by investors hoping to move them up in the rankings.

These buyouts are not safe investments for investors but rather bets on the future of the clubs as was the case with Girondins de Bordeaux which despite a large recent financial injection failed to stay in first division. On the other hand the 100 million euros in revenue that PSG received in the 2010-2011 season has turned into 556 million for the 2020-2021 season under the leadership of the club's president Nasser Al-Khelaïfi in the form of television rights along with ticket and merchandise sales.

While foreign capital has been pouring in to buy French professional clubs over the past decade French investors are losing interest in foreign sports clubs. Under Mr. Aulas' ownership OL Group did acquire the Seattle Reign the club where Megan Rapinoe plays. But now the group is now owned by John Textor."

The ministry’s press office said Halliburton is continuing its normal work in the Libyan oil sector adding that it is “a large company with extensive experience that manages its operations in a professional manner.”

Earlier former head of the Libyan Investment Authority Mohsen Dreijeh reported that Halliburton would be urged to leave Libya immediately and minimize staff.

Several reports have been circulating online indicating that the tense security situation in the country compelled the world's second-largest oil field service company to leave.

Halliburton did not confirm or refute such news but Libya's oil ministry issued a statement assuring that ""what was published in this regard is baseless and a distortion of reality.""

""Halliburton is continuing its normal work with the Libyan oil sector... it is a leading and experienced company that manages its operations professionally"" the statement said.

However news about Halliburton demanding its employees- mainly foreigners- to quickly leave Libya has been making rounds on Libyan social media.

One of the pages quoted an unnamed company source as saying that the company decided to reduce its activities and its Libyan-based staff as it did in 2015 demanding its staff to vacate their positions and leave all their equipment immediately.

According to the source the company is planning to evacuate three locations and reduce its staff to the minimum in the company's office in Tripoli.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA3LTMxL3NoYWxlLXByb2ZpdHMtZmluYWxseS1ibG9zc29taW5nLWFmdGVyLWRlY2FkZS1vZi1zdGVlcC1sb3NzZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shale Profits Finally Blossoming After Decade of Steep Losses,"Why did this happen?

By Ronni Newton

Hours after presiding over a meeting of the State Bond Commission which on July 29 approved more than $800 million in funding for transportation infrastructure economic development and other programs Gov. Ned Lamont visited one of the organizations which will greatly benefit from the state support.

The Noah Webster House & West Hartford Historic Society will receive $415000 from the state – an allocation which is transformative for the nonprofit Executive Director Jennifer DiCola Matos said as she enthusiastically gave the governor a personal tour of the historic site in West Hartford and spoke about the important legacy Noah Webster left not only for West Hartford and the state but far beyond.

“The bond funds we will be getting will be to preserve our collections” Matos told Lamont carefully handling and showing the governor some of the artifacts which include original editions of some of Webster’s best known publications.

The Noah Webster House located at 227 South Main Street in West Hartford was the birthplace of American lexicographer Noah Webster. State Historian Emeritus Walter Woodward state Rep. Tammy Exum Town Councilor Adrienne Billlings-Smoth and members of the Noah Webster House & West Hartford Historical Society Board of Trustees and staff were also on hand for the visit and tour.

Matos showed the governor the actual room where Noah Webster was born in 1758 when West Harford was known as the “West District” of Hartford as well as other bedrooms and the kitchen of what was originally a four-room farmhouse that was donated to the town in 1962 and has been operating as a museum since the late 1960s.

Webster undertook the creation of a dictionary “to unite the country” Matos told the governor “to create an American language that would unite us.”

While not a “Founding Father” Webster was “the founder of American English” Matos said. He was also a champion of federal copyright law.

Webster created “A Grammatical Institute of the English Language” which had a blue cover and “colloquially became known as the “Blue Backed Speller” Matos said. The namesake of Blue Back Square the Blue Back Speller which dates to 1783 was used by generations of school children to learn spelling and punctuation.

Webster’s first dictionary “A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language” was published in 1806 included “American spelling” of words as well as uniquely American words that were not included in existing British dictionaries. He eventually followed with the “American Dictionary of the English Language” a much more comprehensive dictionary published in 1828 – which contained about 70000 words took more than 20 years to complete and was written by hand. That dictionary also included definitions of flora and fauna native to North America.

Following his tour Lamont declared that Noah Webster’s history is vitally important and suggested that all elementary school students in the state should see the museum. “I love it. Everybody should visit.”

The museum plans to use the funds awarded by the state to construct an archival shelving system that will complete the West Hartford History Center. Funds will also provide support for renovations to the orientation area and the West Hartford Gift Shop – a social enterprise business featuring local products that will provide future revenue for the nonprofit. Earlier this year the Noah Webster House – which was greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to the lack of visitors and inability to host in-person field trips – also received a grant of $100000 from the state through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

More of Noah Webster’s story can be found on the Noah Webster House & West Hartford Historical Society website.

Exum said that the Noah Webster House will be in the 19th District which she represents once statewide redistricting takes effect as of the November 2022 election. But she said efforts to procure funds for the nonprofit were also supported by state Sen. Derek Slap and state Reps. Jillian Gilchrest and Kate Farrar. “We approach all as a delegation” Exum said of working to get the proposal included on the Bond Commission agenda.

A total of $8906664 for West Hartford-specific projects were approved by the State Bond Commission on Friday. Other projects include improvements to Park Road’s infrastructure support for affordable units at West Hartford Fellowship Housing on Starkel Road work on “operational lanes” for a portion of I-84 in West Hartford that is currently under construction and funds for the completion of Phase 6 of the Trout Brook Trail.

To celebrate the return of this particular Peter Parker they’ve got a pretty deluxe version coming out with gigantic Sandman hand-and-face base. Now officially designated “Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man” the original cinematic Spidey looks older wiser and more prone to backaches. But the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man can still throw down. And save the newest one from himself.

Sideshow Toys’ website offers two versions of the deluxe figure both at $445. The difference? One comes with a bonus Doc Ock tentacle accessory. Read the small print before buying. A non-deluxe version of the figure without the base should show up later but seems MIA as of publication time.

Per the official description however all versions include “a newly developed head sculpt with amazing likeness a masked head sculpt; a highly-poseable body with great range of articulation; beautiful recreation of Spider-Man’s red and blue suit with raised silver webbing patterns; highly-detailed accessories including Sandman’s cure Spider-Man mask and assorted spider-web shooting effect parts.”

The figure’s expected to ship any time from next fall to spring of 2024. So there’s plenty of time for that monthly payment plan of $50.06 per to kick in. Take a look through the gallery below then tell us if this is for you in comments.

For good or for ill Michael Bay's run of films in the ""Transformers"" series from the first in 2007 to 2017's ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" defined that era of the blockbuster. He took the Hasbro toy line (and associated media) and blew it up to massive proportions with each successive movie somehow expanding the scale even more. Excess was the word for the series — star-studded casts huge explosions some incredible action scenes and the blinding orange-teal color grading that became inescapable in the late '00s all suggested something that had little to do with the original ""Transformers"" media. Which shouldn't surprise anybody given that Bay had little to no understanding of the material he was adapting.

To watch the first ""Transformers"" movie today it's shocking how small-scale next to what the series would become. For all intents and purposes it's got two major plot threads: an alien invasion (of giant robots) galvanizes the U.S. Military and a teenage boy's purchase of an old car leading to him being responsible for the fate of the world. The story is simple enough with broad archetypal characters who make for a nice entry into the main event: giant robots fighting and destroying cities. Bay understood how to get there but when the idea for the series was first pitched to him he had no interest in it.

Candy maker Hershey announced during an earnings call on Thursday that it would not be able to meet the demand for Halloween candy this autumn CNN reported. The shortage is due in part to a surge in demand since the start of the pandemic and supply chain issues that have affected various industries.

While the company saw net sales growth of 19.3% this quarter compared to 2021 according to a press release it uses the same manufacturing lines for regular and seasonal products meaning it can only focus on speeding up production for one or the other.

“We have a strategy of prioritizing everyday on-shelf availability” said CEO Michele Buck according to CBS News. “It was a tough decision to balance that with the seasons but we thought that was really important.”

Supply chain issues have also made it more difficult to source ingredients according to the CBS report and suppliers have upped prices.

According to the National Confectioners Association sales of chocolate and candy hit an all-time high in 2021 hitting $36.9 billion in retail sales.

In addition to the classic Hershey bar and Hershey Kiss the brand also manufactures popular candies such as Kit Kats Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups Almond Joy Milk Duds Jolly Rancher Rolo and Twizzlers that can usually be counted on to fill children’s treat bags in October. Instead competitors like Mars Wrigley which makes Snickers M&Ms Twix Skittles and Milky Way or Nestle which produces Butterfinger Crunch 100 Grand and Baby Ruth can be expected to step up to the plate.

That left the Bears without a bench boss.

ESPN’s Kevin Weekes reports that the affiliate’s vacancy may be filled very soon and the main candidate Todd Nelson has prior ties to both the Caps and Bears.

Nelson played two games for the Caps during the 1993-94 season and scored the only NHL goal of his career in one of those games. He would go on to spend the rest of his career playing either in the minors or in Europe. That latter stint featured a 1995-96 season spent with Hershey where he recorded 50 points in 70 games from the blueline.

The Saskatoon native has coached for over 20 years which includes stops in the NHL with the Atlanta Thrashers as an assistant coach (2008-10) the Edmonton Oilers as both an assistant and interim head coach (2014-15) and the Dallas Stars for the past four seasons as an assistant (2018-22). In the AHL he has been an assistant with the Chicago Wolves (2006-08) head coach of the Oklahoma City Barons (2010-15) and head coach of the Grand Rapids Griffins (2015-18) where he won a Calder Cup in 2017.

He left Dallas in mid-May when then Stars head coach Rick Bowness announced he was stepping away from his position.

According to reports Buck admitted that Hershey “will not be able to fully meet consumer demand” this Halloween as consumers are looking for more regular and Halloween-themed candy that the company can currently produce. The ongoing supply chain issues have affected Hershey’s production; the demand for sweet treats rose during the pandemic and have not died down since while the public’s interest in Halloween continues to grow.

Hershey experienced double-digit sales growth during the second quarter of the year in comparison to last year however as the company utilizes the same manufacturing lines for its regular and seasonal products it is unable to increase production for both — it can only focus on either one.

In addition to the supply chain problems Hershey is suffering from rising dairy prices and the scarcity of ingredients forcing the company to get the items from other suppliers at a more expensive rate.

“We had a strategy of prioritizing everyday on-shelf availability” Buck said during an analyst call. “That was a choice that we needed to make” she continued. “It was a tough decision.”

Part of the holidays is having candy around. Whether it is candy for Trick or Treating or just little bowls of sweet treats around the house for guests to snack on at Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner it is something that we all love to have during the holiday season.

However this year we may not have as much candy available to us as in previous years.

Hershey CEO Michele Buck told investors that the company will not be able to meet the demand for candy heading into the Halloween and holiday seasons.

“Seasonal consumer engagement is expected to remain high and we expect high single-digit sales growth for both our Halloween and holiday seasons” Buck said. “Despite this strong growth we will not be able to fully meet consumer demand due to capacity constraints.”

The Hershey Company is currently taking steps to address the candy shortage before the holiday rush begins.

“As trends began to improve and the labor market became increasingly difficult we struggled to efficiently ramp up production back to our historical levels” Buck said. “We have taken a lot of action to address these issues including deploying manufacturing expertise and lean teams to the plant and streamlining the portfolio to reduce complexity and increase output. We are seeing improvement every week and this will remain a key focus area for our supply chain teams until our production and service levels are optimized.”

The main reason for this little inconvenience is inflation and the impact that it has had on the candy business.

While higher prices are something that we are all having to struggle with right now. Buck did say that Hershey is expecting 20% of their products to continue to retail at $2 or less.

According to ESPN’s Kevin Weekes the Hershey Bears are “closing in” on hiring former Dallas Stars assistant coach Todd Nelson as their new head coach. Nelson would replace former Bears head coach Scott Allen who was promoted to assistant coach for the Capitals on July 25.

Nelson was originally drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft but played primarily in the minors and played just one game for the Penguins.

Capitals Ties

Nelson then signed as a free agent by the Capitals and helped guide the Capitals’ minor league affiliate Portland Pirates to the Calder Cup in 1994. He was inducted into the Pirates Hall of Fame in 2007.

Nelson played in just two games for the Capitals and played in the minors until his retirement in 2002.

Coaching Career

Nelson began his coaching career for the Muskegon Fury of the UHL for the 2001–02 season. He then moved to be an assistant coach for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the AHL for the 2002–03 season before returning as head coach of the Muskegon Fury from 2003 to 2006. The Fury won the Colonial Cup his first two years as their coach.

Nelson then moved on to be the assistant coach for the Chicago Wolves of the AHL from 2006 to 2008 who won the Calder Cup in his final season as an assistant.

On July 25 2008 Nelson accepted an assistant coaching position with the Atlanta Thrashers of the NHL. On July 15 2010 he was introduced as the first head coach of the AHL’s Oklahoma City Barons affiliate of the NHL’s Edmonton Oilers.

After the firing of Dallas Eakins on December 15 2014 Nelson was promoted to head coach of the Oilers on an interim basis for the remainder of the 2014–15 NHL season. He was replaced as head coach by Todd McLellan on May 19 2015.

On June 16 2015 Nelson was named the head coach of the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL). Nelson became the third person ever to win the Calder Cup as a player (1994) assistant coach (2008) and head coach (2017) joining Bob Woods and Mike Stothers.

Dallas Stars

On May 31 2018 Nelson left the Griffins to become an assistant coach with the Dallas Stars in the NHL until his resignation on May 20 2022.

Stars Head Coach Rick Bowness announced on May 20 that he was stepping away as Head Coach of the Dallas Stars effective immediately. Additionally General Manager Jim Nill announced that assistant coaches John Stevens Derek Laxdal and Todd Nelson would not return next season.

HOUSTON – Hess Corp. is reportedly “encouraged” by drilling operations at its operated Huron well in the US deepwater Gulf of Mexico a top company executive said July 27.

The well drilled in Green Canyon block 69 to a depth of nearly 29000 ft showed “very encouraging results…particularly for the Northern Green Canyon basin where we have a very competitive leasehold” said Greg Hill the company’s COO and president of exploration and production. Hill quoted in an S&P Global report offered his views in a second-quarter earnings conference call.

Huron had targeted a new Miocene subsalt fairway in the Northern Green Canyon area and Hess discovered “high-quality oil in good quality Miocene sands” Hill said.

Hill added “Our objective in the Gulf is to add a minimum sustained production cash flow through tieback opportunities and also selectively pursuing hub-class exploration opportunities. If we can grow it we want to.”

In recent years Hill said the company has been “selectively rebuilding” its portfolio in the US Gulf and since that time has acquired 60 new lease blocks in the region for a current total of 80 Hess-leased blocks.

Those opportunities are balanced between high return tiebacks – prospects near existing production hubs that are relatively cheap to drill and can be tied in fairly quickly but also may have a lower reserves – and hub-class new exploration prospects that often contain large reserves but could take five or more years to drill appraise build and bring online.

Hess is planning an appraisal sidetrack on Huron and the company is enthused over the results they have seen there Hill said. But he added that even more encouraging is the fact that the well has opened up additional opportunities in the surrounding areas nearby.

“As a result of what we’re seeing at Huron we see additional prospectivity in that Northern Green Canyon area and we have a very competitive leasehold position there” Hill was quoted to say in the S&P Global report.

Hill declined to provide pre-drill reserve estimates saying the company does not release that information. However he noted that the well is still under evaluation and that more information will be released as the company appraises the asset.

New York July 31 (RHC)-- As fossil fuel giants this week reported record profits for the second quarter an analysis out Friday highlighted how eight oil companies have raked in nearly $52 billion over the past three months ""while Americans continue to struggle at the pump.""

The review by the watchdog group Accountable.US revealed that from April through June Chevron Equinor ExxonMobil Hess Corp Phillips 66 Shell and TechnipFMC ""saw their profits skyrocket from the same time period last year with income shooting up 235%.""

The analysis also pointed out that leaders at Equinor Halliburton Hess Corp and TechnipFMC have boasted ""about excellent quarters while dismissing high prices for consumers.""

Jordan Schreiber of Accountable.US called the companies' collective profit boost ""eye-popping"" but also unsurprising ""after spending the past three months price gouging consumers by raising gas prices to unprecedentedly high levels.""

""Make no mistake; these profits mark a large transfer of wealth from working- and middle-class people to wealthy oil executives and shareholders"" she said. ""While many consumers were feeling the heavy burden of a life necessity suddenly doubling in price oil executives were keeping prices high to maximize their profits.""

The Q2 profits of U.S. energy giants Chevron and Exxon—$11.62 billion and $17.85 billion respectively—along with that of Europe's largest oil company Shell—$11.47 billion—drew widespread criticism along with calls for action by lawmakers and President Joe Biden.

""Big Oil companies are making a killing and pouring fuel on the climate fire while communities pay for more and deadlier climate disasters. It's outrageous"" said Richard Wiles president of the Center for Climate Integrity in a statement Friday.

""Exxon and other oil and gas corporations lobbied and lied for decades to keep the world addicted to fossil fuels making billions while hardworking families pay for higher gas prices and costlier heatwaves wildfires droughts and floods"" he continued. ""Now Exxon is once again using its record profits to line the pockets of executives and shareholders.""

Wiles asserted that ""elected officials cannot remain silent in the face of this injustice. Whether it's taxing these companies' record profits or taking them to court to make polluters pay for climate damages they knowingly caused it's time to stand up to Big Oil.""

Public Citizen president Robert Weissman declared that ""Big Oil is laughing all the way to the bank—and the joke's on us."" ""We don't have to be suckers"" he argued. ""A windfall profits tax with rebates to taxpayers would offset the pain at the pump and end Big Oil's profiteering. Banning U.S. oil exports would actually lower prices for American consumers.""

According to Weissman: ""It's time for Congress and the Biden administration to stop complaining about Big Oil's rip-off and start doing something about it."" Some lawmakers agree. While Republicans ""will continue to play politics and blame Biden for gas prices"" Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) said of the fossil fuel giants' quarterly profits ""we need to crack down on Big Oil.""

Amid rising fears of recession in recent weeks calls have been mounting for federal lawmakers to more forcefully take on corporate greed. The Inflation Reduction Act unveiled Wednesday features some related policies but climate activists have also sounded the alarm about its energy provisions. The bill—negotiated with fossil fuel ally Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.)—contains major handouts that are reportedly ""delighting"" the oil and gas industry.",,,,,,

In the U.S. 69% of people are working either fully remote or hybrid according to Future Forum's latest Pulse report which surveyed more than 10000 knowledge workers in the U.S. Australia France Germany Japan and the U.K. in May.

Recent research from Ladders a career site for jobs that pay $100000 or more projects that 25% of all professional jobs in North America will be fully remote by the end of 2022.

The question is: where are all of these remote jobs? In the U.S. certain states are more conducive to remote work than others — that's at least according to a new report from Coresignal a firm that collects data for investment intelligence lead generation and trend forecasting among other objectives.

Coresignal analyzed more than 40 million job openings in North America and Europe posted online between 2020 and 2022 to determine which states and countries offered the most remote job opportunities.

California leads the list with Texas and New York trailing close behind. Here is the full list of states that had the highest share of remote jobs in 2021 and are expected to have a high number of remote job opportunities through 2022:

California Texas New York New Jersey Florida Illinois North Carolina Arizona Colorado Washington

Coresignal notes that the highest share of remote jobs over the past two years have been in the tech industry and are usually offered by either very large companies (more than 1000 employees) or very small companies (those with 50-200 employees).

One reason to explain the list is the ""distribution of tech companies between those regions"" the report notes. California is still the heart of the tech industry however many companies in Silicon Valley have started to relocate to southern states to escape California's high taxes and regulations.

Oracle and Tesla are just two of the tech companies that have recently moved their corporate homes from California to Texas. Other companies headquartered in Texas include Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

As a result the report adds ""it's possible that Texas might overcome California [in remote job opportunities] in the foreseeable future.""

There are currently over 6800 Hilton properties across the globe giving us various ways to spend our Hilton Honors points. Along with its more traditional brands Hilton has started new brands like Motto Signia and Tempo to keep up with ever-changing demand from travelers. Hilton also partners with Lyft to help you earn even more points.

We love getting hotel rooms completely booked on points but what about premium hotel rooms on points? Can you use your points to book larger rooms rooms with better views or even suites? In this guide we'll show you how to do exactly that the next time you redeem Hilton Honors points.

Hilton Honors upgraded rooms on points

Hilton is probably the simplest hotel loyalty program for reserving premium rooms with points. After all you go through the same process as booking a standard room with one key difference: Instead of choosing that standard room you select an upgraded room.

To start this process log in to your Hilton Honors account and enter your search criteria making sure to check the ""Use Points"" box. On the results page you'll see the lowest number of points required for a free night at the listed hotels during the date(s) of your stay. Most of them should list a ""standard room reward"" price which indicates that a base-level room is available using your points.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

However sometimes standard rooms may not be available. If that's the case you'll see a higher price (you can use Hilton's Points Explorer tool to see the range of expected award rates) along with the ""premium room rewards"" designation.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

The ""premium room rewards"" designation indicates that the property only has upgraded rooms available using points.

To view these room options click ""View Rates."" Then you'll see all the available rooms for your desired dates and the required prices. After seeing the options you can decide whether it's worth redeeming extra points to snag the upgraded accommodations.

For this example I selected the Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas. As noted above the standard award for my date is 80000 points which would book a 500-square-foot city-view room.

The Honors Discount rate is listed as $390. However once I factor in the pesky resort fee and other taxes the final price turns into $493.21. Using 80000 points instead gives me a redemption value of 0.62 cents per point just slightly above TPG's most recent valuations (which peg Hilton Honors points at 0.6 cents apiece).

However many travelers come to Las Vegas looking for luxurious suites and villas so let's say that I want to use my points for one of these instead. I scroll down the list and am intrigued by the one-bedroom villa suite. Unfortunately this comes with a steep price tag (both in cash and in points).

Selecting the Honors Flexible Rate comes to a total of $1115.66. So given the 347000 points per night award rate I'd enjoy a redemption rate of just 0.32 cents per point.

Herein lies one of the main problems with Hilton's premium room rewards option. These awards typically offer a redemption rate between 0.3 and 0.4 cents per point. As a result you'll often sacrifice some redemption value when booking these accommodations instead of a standard room.

Another issue with these awards applies to anyone with Hilton Honors elite status: Premium room rewards are not eligible for the program's fifth-night-free perk on award stays. As a result a stay of five nights or longer in an upgraded room would affect your redemption value even more.

Let's look at an example that illustrates this phenomenon: the Parc 55 in San Francisco which is on TPG's list of hotels for family trips to the Bay Area. A standard award books a room with either one king bed or two double beds and rates over the summer are typically 60000 points per night. However an elite member's five-night award stay in September would only require paying with points for four nights. Thus you'd redeem 240000 points (instead of 300000 points) for your five-night stay.

The lowest flexible paid rate for this stay in cash would be $1892.30 giving you a redemption rate of 0.79 cents per point. This rate is higher than TPG's valuation of Hilton points at 0.6 cents each as the fifth-night-free perk is a great way to maximize your Hilton Honors redemptions.

If you were looking to book an upgraded room at the Parc 55 it's a much pricier proposition. I looked into the beautiful Skyline Suite which you can book for just over $3000 for the same five-night stay noted above.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

The nightly award rate for this room is 205000 points. However unlike standard room rewards you don't get the fifth night free by booking an upgraded room. Thus you'd pay 1025000 points for the five-night stay. In comparison the cash price for your stay would be $3029.02. As such your overall redemption rate would be just 0.29 cents per point.

However don't be discouraged and cross off this award option yet. There are two other ways to get that beautiful hotel suite you are eyeing.

Using Points & Money

Hilton also has a very handy feature called Points & Money. This feature is available on all award stays whether you book standard or premium accommodations. It allows you to select a combination of points and cash so you can still use your points even if you're short of the full amount needed for your stay.

In the context of premium room rewards Points & Money can let you redeem the points required for a standard room and effectively pay cash for the upgrade. Let's look at this in the context of our example with the Skyline Suite at the Parc 55.

The minimum amount of points you can use for a Points & Money booking is 5000 points. Redeeming 5000 points would drop the cash price from $665.45 to $650.24. Thus 5000 points will save you $15.21 — a value of 0.3 cents per point.

(Screenshot from hilton.com)

You can drag the slider bar to add more points to your stay and you'll receive a consistent 0.3 to 0.33 cents per point in value as you use more points to defray your out-of-pocket cost for the stay.

Redeeming the number of points required for a standard room and then paying the cash difference for a nicer room can also be a nice way to confirm a room on an executive floor. Certain properties in Hilton's more upscale brands (including Hilton and Conrad) have an executive lounge that offers complimentary breakfast snacks and — in some international locations — alcohol.

If you want to minimize your expenses during your trip using additional points to book a room that includes lounge access could make sense — especially if you aren't a fan of Hilton's food and beverage credit for elite members. However there are a couple of things to keep in mind with this type of award:

Like premium room rewards Points & Money awards are not eligible for the fifth-night-free benefit. When you move the slider off the full reward option the cash rate will jump significantly to cover the formerly free night.

Any combination of points and cash at a property with a resort fee will require you to pay the resort fee. As a result you should generally try to pay entirely in cash or entirely in points at properties that levy a resort fee.

If you are short a small number of points from either of the two scenarios above your best bet would be to buy points especially if there's a current promotion on buying Hilton points.

Hilton Honors elite status upgrades

Complimentary space-available upgrades are a perk of certain Hilton Honors elite status tiers. While you can earn Hilton Honors elite status the old-fashioned way (by physically staying at Hilton hotels) that can take quite awhile. Luckily you can also snag Hilton Honors elite status as a perk of the following credit cards:

The information for the Hilton Aspire Amex card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

The benefits at these tiers differ but Gold and Diamond members are eligible for upgrades on all stays including those booked with points.

I currently hold Diamond status and I've been able to get great upgrades in numerous locations. These include the DoubleTree by Hilton St. John's Harbourview Hampton Inn & Suites Mexico City Hilton Cabo Verde Sal Resort Canopy by Hilton Sao Paulo Jardins the presidential suite at the Hilton Garden Inn Long Island City New York and a suite at the Hilton Garden Inn Tuxtla Gutierrez when my wife and I went to Dia de Los Muertos (Day of the Dead) festivities last year.

Of course this can be a gamble as you're hoping these enhanced room types are still available when you arrive. If you're not willing to take the chance — and want to ensure your stay is in more comfortable accommodations — you can use the above strategies to guarantee an upgraded room before arrival.

Bottom line

Using points and miles can help you save money and enhance your vacations. With Hilton Honors points you can easily take the sting out of paying cash for a hotel and — in certain circumstances — you may want to spend more to get a better room even if you don't get the absolute best value out of your points.

However if you are looking for premium hotel rooms without burning a ton of points I highly recommend a card like the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card to earn automatic Diamond status. Hilton Honors Diamond status will give you a great chance at getting a premium room upgrade on arrival during your next hotel stay.

Over the same weekend I also got a chance to stay at the Conrad New York Midtown. I have wanted to try this property for a long time; standard rooms used to be suites (I can’t recall whether that was when it was still The London or after it converted to a Conrad) and the property is very well-located just a couple of blocks from Central Park 5th Avenue shopping the theater district and subway lines. While Hilton’s new take on the old breakfast benefit still disappoints me I think this hotel makes for a great use of a Hilton Free Night Certificate.

Conrad New York Midtown: Bottom Line

Bottom line: The Conrad New York Midtown is a top-tier Hilton property with a great location and excellent rooms. If you’re looking to stay in Midtown Manhattan and you have a free night certificate to use this could be a great choice particularly if you can score an upgrade to a Park View suite which was both large by Midtown standards and had fantastic views.

Points Price : May vary but it was 95000 points on the night we booked. The phone agent said that this was the only date available in the month of July at the time (it just happened to be a convenient night for us).

: Varies but is very frequently north of $500 per night. Points Value : When rates are high this is a pretty good value. If the cash rate were $500 that would yield about 0.625c per Hilton point which is ahead of our Reasonable Redemption Value of 0.4c per point. Considering the fact that we used a free night certificate from the Hilton Aspire card we were very pleased.

: None on an award stay. Parking: Valet parking starts at $75 per night plus tax ($85 for oversized and luxury vehicles). I used Park Whiz and booked a garage for about $50 per night all-in (I saw one option nearby this hotel for about $40 per night). See Stephen’s post from a couple of years ago for more on Park Whiz: How Park Whiz Saved Us $100+ On Parking In Chicago.

: There is a fitness room but I forgot to check it out. Hilton Diamond Elite Benefits: Upgrade : Yes! We were upgraded proactively 3 days before check-in receiving both an email and a notification in the app of an upgrade to a 1 bedroom Park View suite. The view was fantastic and the room had doors that closed between the bedroom and living room (they were a little difficult to close as you had to get them just right but it did work). Club Lounge : None. Breakfast: Breakfast is served in the lobby restaurant. Both Gold and Diamond members receive a food & beverage credit of $25 per day per registered guest in the room (up to two) that can be used toward breakfast. The menu only featured buffet options (a $25 “continental” buffet and a $45 “American” buffet that included hot items) though I did hear someone come in after us and ask to order “just an omelet or something”. I didn’t see a menu for that and both the hostess and server appeared a little confused but it seems that perhaps it can be done as they were seated. My wife and sons had the Continental buffet (I didn’t) and the total came to about $64 — which was almost taken care of by the F&B credit. The options on the Continental buffet were actually pretty extensive.

Would I stay again? Possibly if I needed to be in Midtown. The rooms were very nice and the proactive upgrade days before arrival (and before reaching out to the property at all) was very nice in terms of elite member recognition. Breakfast could still get pricey for a family here though (just as at the Conrad Downtown).

Breakfast could still get pricey for a family here though (just as at the Conrad Downtown). Conrad New York Midtown pros : Proactive upgrade days ahead of time with an email notification several days in advance True 1 bedroom suite with door with the upgrade Fantastic view (YMMV by room) We checked in early (around 12:30pm) with no problem Very close to subway stops Great location if you want to be in midtown. Close to the park 5th Ave shopping theater district (the Stephen Colbert show tapes a couple blocks away Times Square is several more blocks or easily accessible via subway)

: Conrad New York Midtown cons : Nothing done to go above and beyond apart from the upgrade (I only make this con in comparison to the Conrad Downtown which really went over and beyond in its welcome for us) Breakfast could get expensive for a family (we only purchased 2 continental breakfasts).

:

Overall we enjoyed our one-night stay very much.

As was the case with the Conrad Downtown breakfast could be quite pricey since the only options on the menu were a continental buffet for $25 or a buffet with hot items for $45:

That said the continental buffet was pretty extensive:

The Continental Buffet certainly provided enough options to fill you up. Given the fact that the Hilton Gold and Diamond member food & beverage credit almost covers the continental buffet it’s not a bad deal if you have one or two people in the room. In our case my wife and 4yr old son ordered the continental buffet. We were not charged for our ~2yr old (which is nice since he barely ate anything). I did not eat at the hotel because I used the Too Good to Go app to pick up half a dozen bagels and cream cheese for $4.99 on Sunday.

The room itself was really nice. It was spacious and comfortable and everything felt premium and nice. Frankly I’d have thought this hotel was almost new if I didn’t know better. It compares really well to most Midtown properties I’ve ever seen.

As you can see above the room was in great condition. I’ve stayed at a good number of Manhattan hotels before and have often been surprised by how badly some high-end hotels show their wear in terms of worn curtains scuffed up or stained furniture etc. There was none of that here. Everything looked to be in terrific condition with the one exception being the edges in the closet where bags get rolled in and out. The sofa and chairs and curtains and floors were all in excellent shape (and that was all the more impressive given the traffic that Midtown properties get).

Given the location in the heart of Midtown (on 54th St) this hotel seems like a great option for Hilton free night certificates though of course the quality of this stay was largely influenced by a nice upgrade. For what it’s worth this stay was booked via my wife’s account and she was informed of the upgrade three days before arrival so I think that upgrade simply came by virtue of her Hilton elite status. I’m not very familiar with this hotel’s make-up but since 1 bedroom suites used to be a standard room option I wonder if they have very few “standard” rooms and frequently upgrade Diamond members to 1 bedroom suites? Even if that is the case (and I certainly don’t know that’s true) the upgrade here wasn’t just to a 1 bedroom suite but a 1 Bedroom Park View suite which is a higher category altogether. Again that’s some nice elite recognition considering the fact that we didn’t even need to request it.

Service was good if not quite as enthusiastic as at the Thompson or as ambitious as the Conrad Downtown. The couple of doormen remembered us — one who knew we were going to the Mets game informed us of the score the moment we walked in (runs had been scored while en route back to the hotel since we left early) and another made it a point to remember my sons’ names. Our interactions with staff were limited but positive.

Keep in mind that Hilton’s breakfast benefit won’t quite cover breakfast for two and I didn’t see a separate kids’ menu so I imagine that breakfast for a family could quickly get pricey particularly if you want the hot buffet. But for those who don’t care much about hotel breakfast since there are many other local options this hotel certainly provides a very comfortable stay in Midtown. I’d probably return though as we said on this weekend’s podcast it is hard for me to turn away from Hyatt in New York City since Globalists get free parking on award stays and free breakfast. Still for use of a free night certificate and especially if I didn’t have a car to park this would be a solid option.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9qLXNwb3QvYXJ0aWNsZS03MTM0OTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Just for a view from a window: The long saga of Jerusalem's King David Street,"Paris has l’Avenue des Champs-Élysées. London is proud of Oxford and Regent streets and Rome of Via Veneto. Gran Vía is the delight of Madrid and Friedrichstraße of Berlin. Which street is the pride of the capital of Israel? A tough question indeed. I would put my money on King David Street.

This is how my presentation to owners and Hilton executives started 30 years ago as part of my role as head of public relations for Hilton Hotels in Israel. Construction for a new luxury hotel just started in the Mamilla district footsteps from the Old City walls and Jaffa Gate. Hilton pulled out of its veteran hotel at the city entrance and since a new hotel was underway a need arose to find a name to differentiate the old and new. “The Jerusalem Hilton on King David Street” was my suggestion for the obvious reason. This is apparently the most prestigious street in the capital.

My proposal was adopted unanimously and I felt that the new hotel was another step of turning this amazing street to the Gran Vía of the city.

“Man plans and God laughs” my father used to joke. As usual he was right. Hilton pulled out of the hotel in 2001 in unfortunate circumstances after only three years of operation. Is the street in a better shape ever since?

King David Street came back to my mind just recently as US President Joe Biden had a schedule that included a voyage of approximately 400 meters from the King David Hotel where he stayed with his entourage to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel where he held meetings with Prime Minister Yair Lapid. Was he impressed with the illustrious street seen from the armor-plated limousine “The Beast”? One can only speculate.

It is a rather bizarre street bearing in mind it is Jerusalem’s most prestigious lane. When it was just a dirt road in the Ottoman period turning into an urban boulevard during the British Mandate it offered something unique: a spectacular view to the east of the walls of Jerusalem and of Mount Zion on the other side of Ben Hinnom Valley. The British called the street “Julian’s Way.” The view was partly blocked toward the end of the 1920s.

What the street has

Famed architects designed two impressive buildings the YMCA and the King David Hotel at the top of the hill facing each other with the street passing between them. The road became one of the symbols of the British Mandate’s rule when in 1938 the authorities decided to house British Government offices in the King David Hotel. Additional Mandatory governmental and administrative offices were built sparsely scattered along the street. Being that the road connected the center of Jerusalem with the city’s train station and its amazing architectural gems in the southern neighborhoods – the German Colony Baka Abu Tor – it became extremely popular.

After the end of the mandate and the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 a decision was made by city council to call Julian’s Way “King David Street.” While the hotel and the YMCA remain two of the most beautiful structures in the city the rest of the older buildings today don’t look prestigious at all. Some of them house old dusty antique shops. Some empty galleries.

Relatively impressive new buildings dominate the northern part of the street – the new Hilton now the impressive David Citadel Hotel and The Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion the main seminary for training rabbis cantors educators and communal workers in Reform Judaism.

The southern part remains an unbuilt open space and on either side are gardens planted in the 1970s – the Bell Sparrow Garden and Bloomfield Garden. An amazing spacious “green lung” in the heart of the city with the Old City walls and the magnificent scenery including the breathless 1857 Montefiore Windmill.

The most prestigious and beautiful street in the capital of Israel offers a gas station however not a single restaurant or a coffee shop. No shopping attractions. No public parking facility. People are not strolling to enjoy the moment and relax on the most prestigious street in Jerusalem. The sidewalks are empty. No chairs and tables for a snack with a pampering double espresso in a porcelain cup and a saucer are to be found. Some say it’s an uncomfortable hilly street to enjoy. Isn’t Gran Vía in Madrid steeper? Is Paris’s Champs-Élysées flat?

NIS 52 million was spent recently by the municipality for “an upgrade project including development of the street – preservation of existing historic trees on the street sidewalk restoration with placement of additional benched and decorative elements” according to the official announcement. Walking along the approximately 400 meters part of the street Biden made from the King David to the Waldorf Astoria people are not to be seen. And that’s hardly because of security restrictions which were enforced during Biden’s visit.

Real estate along the street has become one of the most prestigious and expensive in the country. Most of the residences added along the street over the years bear names that commemorate King David and feed on the prestige of the name - Kfar David (the residential neighborhood of the Mamilla complex) King David Gardens King David’s Courtyard King’s Crown David and the Mishkenot Melech David and appeal mainly to affluent tourists and wealthy English-speaking foreigners. Not to the locals unfortunately.

The most prestigious and beautiful street in the capital of Israel is mainly viewed from a public transportation window or while driving in a traffic jam to and from the downtown area. A much longer version of Biden’s experience. Regrettably a street with just a view from a window.

But in a recent book called ""The Man Who Broke Capitalism"" reporter David Gelles argues that Welch popularized an approach to management that focused on shareholder value at the expense of workers and ultimately the company he ran.

One of Welch's former mentees disagrees with that characterization.

“I have only the highest regard for Jack Welch” said former Home Depot CEO Bob Nardelli in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance's editor-in-chief for ""Influencers with Andy Serwer.""

Nardelli began his career as an entry-level manufacturing engineer at General Electric in 1971. He worked his way up the ranks eventually becoming president and CEO of GE Power Systems in 1995. Along the way he got to know Welch who became his mentor and role model. In fact Nardelli soon became known as “Little Jack.”

He still remembers how Welch pushed him to be his best.

“He was the individual that could be very stern and give constructive feedback. But he would still put his arm around you and you know make you feel extremely important” says Nardelli who also served as CEO of Chrysler. “He had the magic of being able to you know challenge you ... And at the same time make sure that you were highly regarded and respected.”

Welch served as chairman and CEO of GE for roughly two decades. During that time he massively grew and diversified the company. He expanded it into businesses including financial services real estate and jet engines among many other areas.

He even ventured into entertainment. In 1986 GE acquired RCA (Radio Corporation of America) which owned NBC.

“He was a real special breed that could run a conglomerate” Nardelli said. “Many people can't do that.”

As GE grew Welch adopted a management style that emphasized a hands-on approach to business as well as radical accountability. For instance he famously identified and fired the bottom 10% of GE’s workforce annually to keep the company competitive.

""He set expectations that encouraged you to reach and stretch to reach goals you otherwise may not have achieved and hold you accountable"" said Nardelli.

Under Welch's leadership GE enjoyed striking success. The company’s market value leaped from $14 billion in 1981 to $410 billion in 2001. Fortune magazine heralded Welch as the “Manager of the Century” in 1999 and other executives began emulating his approach to business.

Story continues

'It's heartbreaking to see what happened to GE'

But Welch’s critics contend that his approach to management though profitable in the short-term was ultimately unsustainable.

Since Welch retired in 2001 GE has experienced a precipitous decline especially during the 2008 financial crisis. GE also made several ill-fated acquisitions. For example in 2015 it took over French company Alstom SA’s gas turbine operations only for gas turbine demand to collapse. The failed deal resulted in a $23 billion write-down.

In an article for Fortune Yale School of Management Professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld attributed many of GE’s failings to Welch’s mistaken belief that he could succeed across industries with his management philosophy rather than with industry-specific knowledge.

“That notion of interchangeable management expertise like interchangeable parts in an assembly line contributed to massive strategic stumbles under Welch” Sonnenfeld said.

The company was dropped from the Dow in 2018 and three years later the once-dominant conglomerate revealed that it planned to split its businesses into three public companies focused on aviation energy and health care. Its market cap is now $81 billion — roughly 20% of what it was under Welch's leadership.

“It's heartbreaking to see what happened to GE. I put 30 plus years of my life in it” Nardelli said. “To have some something that was at the top the highest performer highest market capitalization to now see that it's barely a fraction of what it was is heartbreaking.”

In “The Man Who Broke Capitalism” David Gelles argues that the spread of Welch’s management philosophy had a corrosive effect on society. He even draws a connection between Welch's influence and two Boeing airplane crashes that occurred in 2018 and 2019. He explains three successive Boeing CEOs had previously worked at GE under Welch and internalized his focus on financial success. Consequently they prioritized high shareholder value over strong aeronautical engineering as they led Boeing according to Gelles.

“If you look at the history of Boeing over the past 25 years you see very clearly the imprint of his leadership his priorities as delivered through his disciples” Gelles said in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance. “There was a bigger cultural problem inside Boeing. And that cultural problem ultimately leads back to Jack Welch.”

Though he said he respected Gelles’ right to an opinion Bob Nardelli remains steadfast in defending his former mentor who died in 2020 at the age of 84.

“I don't think it's appropriate to go after someone that's passed away that doesn't have the ability to defend themselves"" Nardelli said. ""So that's just my point of view. I mean I know some people have applauded that book. I'm not one of them.”

As the population and economy of Northern Colorado continue to grow companies and developers are flocking to build industrial logistics and distribution facilities to support the region’s needs. Even with the state’s population growth slowing and inflation and supply-chain constrictions dragging on the economy demand for these types of spaces in Northern Colorado remains at record levels.

“It’s no secret that all of these spec industrial buildings are coming” said Kelly Jones economic development director for Loveland. “What’s slightly surprising is the pace they’re coming at now. I can tell you just by looking at the permits and activity in our queue it’s not slowing down.”

Mike Eyer first vice president for the commercial brokerage CBRE said a record 600000 square feet of industrial space have been leased in Northern Colorado through the first two quarters of 2022. About 900000 square feet more are in the pipeline to be delivered. Buildings are also being absorbed more quickly than normal Eyer said. Usually it takes about a year and a half to two years to fully lease out industrial projects of this scale. Now most buildings are fully leased out within a year of completion.

“It’s still true on a number of fronts (that the industrial market remains hot)” Eyer said. “There is still a pretty strong appetite from developers looking to gain entry into the market.”

The market they’re trying to enter is one that has experienced robust growth over the past decade. Between 2010 and 2020 Weld and Larimer counties were the second-and-fifth-fastest-growing counties in the state — Weld grew 30 percent Larimer 20 percent.

Some of the individual municipalities in the region have grown exponentially. Timnath grew 938 percent. Severance and Berthoud each experienced greater than 100% growth. Wellington Windsor and Johnstown grew more than 75 percent. Lochbuie Frederick Firestone Erie Dacono Milliken and Mead grew more than 40 percent. Jobs in Northern Colorado grew by 9.3 percent from 2015 to 2020.

Although statewide population growth slowed in 2021 the state is still expected to reach 6.5 million inhabitants by 2030.

“Assuming the population growth trajectory remains the same you’ll continue to see a number of these companies come to the area” Eyer said.

Clyde Wood president of commercial development for McWhinney Real Estate Services Inc. said it’s no secret why the need for industrial distribution and logistics facilities has increased along with the population.

“I think the connection is pretty clear” Wood said. “Over the years as population growth and the new-home market have been robust for several years those industries that support that growth need space. The connection is pretty clear why we’re seeing so many of those growing and needing space here.”

The list of major companies to move into these types of spaces in Northern Colorado over the past few years is impressive. McWhinney made the first big splash with Centerra Industrial a 660000-square-foot campus in Loveland. In 2016 it landed Safelite Group Inc. as one of the area’s first major Class A industrial tenants. Amazon and Home Depot also leased space in Centerra Industrial.

“That was fairly pioneering at the time” Wood said. “I think that caught a lot of people’s attention.”

Hines Interests LP and U-Haul both also leased space in Loveland on Byrd Drive. Denver developer Etkin Johnson built Axis 25 in the city.

Further south along Interstate 25 Mead has also made itself a logistics hub. It landed a FedEx regional distribution terminal in 2020. Multiple other industrial distribution facilities are underway: Elevation25 by Silver Point Development and Access 25 by The Broe Group.

Access 25 will be the only dual highway-rail-access park in the region and it has already landed Home Depot as a tenant.

FedEx also has a regional distribution facility in Johnstown in McWhinney’s Iron Horse industrial park.

Then there’s the crown jewel: the 3.87-million-square-foot logistics center Amazon is building in east Loveland. That facility which is slated to open in 2024 could have 62 loading docks and employ more than 1000 people.

Many of these companies previously had a presence in the state but not in Northern Colorado

“A lot of them have been in Denver and are looking to plant a flag up here” Eyer said. “Prior to two or three years ago the region didn’t have the population to support that.”

This means that municipalities that developers and large companies previously wouldn’t have considered are now on the map for potentially massive developments.

“Cities like Loveland and Johnstown we’re all getting the looks we wouldn’t get 10 years ago” Jones said. “The speed at which the consumer is wanting products is forcing companies to put their distribution facilities in locations closer to population centers.”

Getting the Amazon logistics center was a multi-year journey for Loveland one the city hopes will not stop with this facility.

“It’s difficult to land these” Jones said. “The process we went through was not easy. There is prestige in getting that. It was very competitive. It points other developers toward us … It was a huge coup to earn this from one of the world’s largest companies. Eventually we would like to keep building this relationship as they get familiar with us. There’s momentum beyond just that facility.”

For other projects in the region ones that aren’t purpose-built for a company such as Amazon competition for tenants will be fierce Eyer said.

“These projects are all very similar” Eyer said. “The buildings are similar. For the most part the locations are close. It’s a very competitive market. Developers that started construction a year ago have a significant advantage over those starting now because they have a lower cost basis. These buildings are almost like commodities where whoever can offer the most competitive lease rate is going to win.”

How long this trend can continue is dependent on how the region’s population and economy continue to grow. The need for more industrial logistics and distribution facilities should scale along with the area’s growth. At what point — if any — the industrial market could become oversaturated is unknown but it’s a factor weighing on the mind of experts.

“I would say absolutely” Wood said. “In Northern Colorado it’s something we are very focused on. For several years we were the only game in town. We proved the concept that there is demand for Class A industrial space up here. That got the interest of outside developers. They want a piece of the pie but that pie is not nearly as large as metro Denver. Even though demand is steady it’s not that deep … We are very cautious about oversupply but we are still bullish on the market in general.”

Even so Eyer said that hasn’t happened yet.

“I think we haven’t reached that saturation point” Eyer said. “I think we have the demand to handle what is currently being built. It’s impossible to tell how much demand there will be. We’re just not there yet. We’re seeing record leasing activity. I have no doubt we’ll absorb the current construction.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlY29yZC1jb3VyaWVyLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA3LzMxL3N0cmVldHNib3JvLW9oaW8tZmFtaWx5LWRheXMtZmVzdGl2YWwtYmljZW50ZW5uaWFsLzEwMTkzMjU2MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Streetsboro Family Days Celebrated 20 years with fun at City Park.,"NEWS

Edgar Delgado 31 of Passaic was arrested Friday for the crash in Clifton that prosecutors said happened earlier that day. The Passaic cop faces multiple charges including assault by auto causing serious bodily injury.

Passaic County Prosecutor Camelia Valdes said that Delgado was driving near the intersection of Central and Yereance Avenues early Friday morning. Shortly before 4:30 a.m. he crashed into a parked car according to Valdes.

Valdes said that when Clifton police got to the scene they found Delgado's car but not him.

Instead cops found a 28-year-old woman from Clifton in the passenger seat. She was taken to Saint Joseph’s University Medical Center.

""The investigation revealed that Mr. Delgado had been operating his vehicle recklessly under the influence of alcohol and left the scene following the crash"" Valdes said.

Along with the second-degree assault by auto charge Delgado faces three third-degree charges including leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident resulting in serious bodily injury endangering an injured victim and hindering apprehension. He is also charged with driving while intoxicated.

What would happen to NJ if we were attacked by nuclear weapons? We used NUKEMAP by Alex Wellerstein to see what would happen if a nuclear warhead hit New York Philadelphia Washington or New Jersey.

The models show what would happen in aerial detonation meaning the bomb would be set off in the sky causing considerable damage to structures and people below; or what would happen in a ground detonation which would have the alarming result of nuclear fallout. The models do not take into account the number of casualties that would result from fallout."

HRL,Hormel Foods,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9hZnRlci1jbG9zZS1wcmltYXJ5LWJyYWQtZmluc3RhZC1sb29rcy10by1rZWVwLWdvcC1jb250cm9sLW9mLWZpcnN0LWRpc3RyaWN0LzYwMDE5NDQwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After close primary Brad Finstad looks to keep GOP control of First District,"WASHINGTON - Brad Finstad is trying to find a balance between mainstream appeal and conservative credentials as he aims to win over a swath of southern Minnesota known for its political swings.

Running for the open First Congressional District seat Finstad portrays himself as a southern Minnesota farm kid. The kind of farmer who wakes up knowing things will be broken and have to be fixed.

""Some folks on both sides of the aisle are more interested in the celebrity of the position. They're interested in the bomb throwing the elbows to the throat kind of politics the name calling the finger pointing"" Finstad who lives in New Ulm said in an interview. ""And I'm less interested in that.""

Whether Finstad will succeed the late GOP Rep. Jim Hagedorn in Congress depends on if he can overcome a challenge in the Aug. 9 special election from former Hormel Foods CEO Jeff Ettinger. Campaign finance records show that Ettinger a DFLer has already poured $900000 of his own money into the race. Two other candidates — Haroun McClellan of the Grassroots-Legalize Cannabis Party and Richard Reisdorf with the Legal Marijuana Now Party — are also on the special election ballot.

""He's like a career government guy. He's been either a political officeholder or an aide to a politician or a lobbyist or a policy person"" Ettinger a first-time candidate said of Finstad. ""Basically that's his career. I don't really see him as being a very likely change agent for Washington.""

Finstad 46 served in the Minnesota House from 2003 to 2009. His work in the years since includes time as executive director of the Center for Rural Policy and Development a tenure as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's state director for rural development in Minnesota during the Trump administration and a leading role with the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. He and his family own and operate the agronomy company Frontier Labs and have a farm growing soybeans and corn according to Finstad's campaign.

""He's a principled man"" said Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Glenn Thompson the leading House Republican on the agriculture committee who endorsed Finstad early in his primary bid. ""I think Minnesota would add another excellent member of Congress should he be elected.""

During his time in the statehouse Finstad was the lead House sponsor of a bill that culminated in a new ballpark for the Twins. He also signed on to an unsuccessful amendment to the state constitution that would have banned same-sex marriage as well as a failed amendment that would have established that ""there is no constitutional right to abortion"" in the state.

Finstad won a May special Republican primary for the First District by only 427 votes out of more than 35000 cast for GOP candidates barely fending off state Rep. Jeremy Munson in a crowded field that also included Hagedorn's widow Jennifer Carnahan. Outside groups supporting either Munson or Finstad poured more than $3 million into that primary race according to federal campaign finance records.

Brad Finstad left talked with Scott Brogan and his family as he campaigned at the Olmsted County Fair.

Given the timing of Hagedorn's death in February after a battle with kidney cancer the Aug. 9 special election to fill the remainder of the late Republican's term is being held on the same day primary voters in the new First District will decide which candidates make it to the November general election. In this fall's race where Republicans are favored a full two-year term to represent the congressional district is at stake.

Theresa Keaveny chair of the DFL Rural Caucus said she's troubled by Finstad's positions on abortion health care and other issues.

""When I look at his website and see his campaign literature it causes me concern in terms of well what policies is he actually going to support?"" Keaveny said.

In the wake of the May primary Munson conceded to Finstad but then filed to run against him in the Aug. 9 primary happening on the same day as the special election.

After initially staying quiet about his intentions Munson recently started a longshot bid to defeat Finstad in the GOP primary.

""He's a Republican from the George Bush era. That's the last time he was in office and everything's changed for the Republican Party since the time of George Bush"" Munson said. ""People are more focused on fighting for freedom and liberty and limited government than being a George Bush Republican.""

Munson's move was criticized by the state GOP's chairman as the party tries to both win the Aug. 9 special and hold on to the seat in the regular November election.

""Jeremy is sure a good guy and he gets people fired up"" Greg Bartz the chairman of the Brown County Republican Party and a supporter of Finstad in the May primary said earlier this month — before Munson started his last-minute push. ""I like Jeremy but I think Finstad can appeal to the middle a little bit easier.""

Democratic Gov. Tim Walz held the First District seat for six terms before winning the governor's office in 2018. Hagedorn won the seat twice and was among the Republicans who voted against certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election win in two swing states. Finstad differs from Hagedorn on that matter and said he would have voted to certify the election.

As the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade ripples throughout the country Finstad touts his past work to help start a crisis pregnancy center in New Ulm called First Choice Pregnancy Services. And when asked about his policy goals Finstad said ""it all starts with family pocketbook issues.""

He views himself as a conservative who knows he won't see eye to eye at times with someone in the middle. But he thinks there could be issues where they can work together which he sees as a different mindset than ""I'm right you're wrong we'll never be able to talk again.""

At the same time Finstad's campaign website boasts familiar base-friendly language: that he's ""Pro-Trump"" ""Pro-Gun"" ""Pro-Life"" and ""a conservative fighter running for Congress to fire Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House.""

As the campaign closes in on its final stretch it isn't lost on Finstad that his party has only gotten over 50 percent of the vote in a general election for the seat once in the past 16 years.

""There's just political history that says that we need to do a better job appealing to southern Minnesota folks as southern Minnesota folks"" said Finstad ""and not necessarily as trying to run to one extreme or the other.""

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

Compact

Solid performance

No thermal concerns Our Verdict HP’s Thunderbolt Dock 120W G4 Dock (4J0A2AA) is business-focused meeting NIST 800-193 protocols. But with 100W of charging power at the ready plus a tidy form factor any home office could use this Thunderbolt dock too.

HP’s Thunderbolt G4 Dock is a compact little cube of connections supplying more than enough power for most laptops. As a business solution it’s a top Thunderbolt dock.

HP sells two versions of this Thunderbolt G4 Dock: the 4J0A2AA (this model) and the 4J0G4AA which we haven’t tested. The difference is that thelatter includes a “combo cable” that supplies up to 280W of power via the combination of a Thunderbolt 4 cable plus a barrel charger for HP workstations. The 4J0A2AA supplies up to 100W to the host laptop via the Thunderbolt cable—still among the highest we’ve seen. Even then there were no thermal issues at all.

Overall we’ve ranked this as the best business solution we’ve seen among our best Thunderbolt docks.

USB-A ports and USB-C ports surround the HP Thunderbolt G4 Dock and there’s a power button on top to power down the dock when not in use.

Mark Hachman / IDG USB-A ports and USB-C ports surround the HP Thunderbolt G4 Dock and there’s a power button on top to power down the dock when not in use. Mark Hachman / IDG Mark Hachman / IDG

HP’s squat little plastic Thunderbolt G4 Dock (3.9 x 3.9 x 2.7 in) feels a lot more solid than its rated 1.68 pounds would indicate and it sprouts ports to all sides: a 10Gbps USB-C port capable of 15W charging on the front; a 5Gbps USB-A port on either side plus two more on the back all capable of 7.5W out. The back also houses two DisplayPort 1.4 ports an HDMI 2.0 port and a USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 port designed for video. We only tested this dock with two 4K/60 external displays but it’s capable of driving three 4K/60 displays provided you have a DisplayPort 1.4-capable laptop with Display Stream Compression or DSC.

There’s also an ethernet port capable of 2.5Gbps as well as another Thunderbolt 4 port outlet. The ports are crammed together with barely enough space for DisplayPort cables or USB keys but a couple of the outside ports are slightly skewed outwards to provide more room a nice touch.

This business-oriented Thunderbolt G4 Dock includes vPro support and the power button/LED can be used to turn itself on and off —but only when connected to supported HP notebooks. The throughput is excellent meeting expectations on all of the ports. The front USB-C port delivered 15W of power as the HP’s manual says it should—although weirdly the dock lost connection with the displays for a few seconds when a smartphone was connected. We expect a firmware upgrade to solve these issues and we don’t consider them dealbreakers because of the charging capabilities of the other ports.

When notified of our findings HP reps said they couldn’t reproduce our results.

With the potential for V8 levels of power out of a compact and lightweight 2.4-liter four-cylinder block it's the engine of choice for those who value lightness over raw displacement.

Funnily enough that's the same design principle that spawned the Lotus Elise the guiding philosophy of the company's tragically deceased founder Colin Chapman. But somehow we think if he were able to gaze eyes at this 800-horsepower turbocharged monster with his brand's name on it he'd be pretty darn happy. It comes to us via a native of Thailand named Chaiyos Tripuwaphrut.Through the help of the tune-shop=SHOP Factory in San Kamphaeng Chiang Mai Thailand Chaiyos removed the stock Toyota engine standard with this generation of Elise and swapped it with something only slightly larger but capable of so much more power it's almost hilarious. Scratch that. It most definitely is hilarious.The very special sauce that comes with any K24 engine is the ability to handle more boost than most engines twice their size. Couple that with a Precision Gen2 6266 turbocharger E-85 fuel modification a Skunk2 Ultra Race intake manifold and a TPS 90 mm throttle body with 2150cc injectors and you have yourself something that can blitz quarter miles as well as it can shred a circuit track.Power is fed from the middle section of the car back to a front-mounted Quaife QKE8J five-speed sequential transmission with a Tilton twin-plate clutch and Driveshaft Shop 5.9 axles. It's not a true manual but it is at least a racing transmission through and through.



This Elise does come with a number plate and registration tags so it is at least legally able to drive on public roads.

We need a hypercar that goes beyond reality. MotorBiscuit has found it. Buckle up because this stretches credibility beyond any boundaries. But it is a fun look at the exploits of a Bulgarian company claiming to be building a 5000 hp hypercar with the ability to go 363 mph. But that’s just the beginning as we present the Alieno Arcanum and Unum EVs.

Where did the Alieno Arcanum hypercar EV go?

Alieno Unum hypercar | Alieno

Going way beyond the capabilities of the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ Alieno (Alien in Italian) first brought the Arcanum in 2018. Its horsepower was claimed to be between 2610 hp and 5221 hp depending on which battery and electric motor combo you bought. Unfortunately there are no actual images of an Arcanum but that shouldn’t sway you now that Alieno has released its second hypercar.

The Arcanum’s predecessor is the Unum (“one” in Latin). Now hang on while we give you some of its specifications. The all-electric platform is called THF. This stands for “The Heavenly Founder.” It features a cold air thruster system called TRS or “The Rocket Successor.” Part of the system involves pressurized gas it says.

The Alieno Unum hypercar EV has an “octopus synergistic system”

These two systems the THF and TRS form what Alieno calls its “octopus synergistic system.” We’re not sure whether we should be scared or laugh. Stay with us while we delineate the models available for Unum.

Alieno will make the Unum in four versions; the RP2 RP3 RP4 and RP5. The “RP” stands for “raw power.” We were sure it stood for “real puzzling.” Within these offerings there is the STR which stands for Street TRC which is the Track model and the RCE which is the Race version.

The Unum RP5 features six electric motors per wheel

As with the Arcanum the RP2 Unum starts with 2610 hp which it gets from two electric motors per corner. So now you know where this is going right? With the ultimate RP5 version you get 24 electric motors. This means six motors per wheel. Why not an RP8 with 48 motors?

Alieno claims that this combination clearly establishes the Unum as the fastest production vehicle ever made. We would wholeheartedly agree except for one tiny problem. It is not in production. Nor was the Arcanum. We hate to be naysayers but right now they’re 0 for 2.

A full charge in under 10 minutes?

Now let’s discuss the battery packs for the Unum. Three battery packs will be offered the 180kWh Street Battery Pack 120 kWh Track Battery Pack and 60 kWh Race Battery Pack. These all tie into an 800-volt charging system that truly goes beyond anything available now.

So a zero to 100 percent charge with a 350 kW charger takes 30 minutes with the SBP 20 minutes for the TBP and 10 minutes with the RBP. If you don’t believe these claims you’re really going to be shaking your head now. Alieno says that with its own charging network which it will build up it can charge at 900 kWh for the RBP then 1800 kW with the TBP and 2700 kW for the RBP. If you do the math these figures mean a full charge could take less than five minutes. We’re not confirming these results we’re just relaying the figures Alieno gave us.

Step up if you have hypercar fever faith and $4.5 million

Are you still with us? That means you might be interested in an Alieno EV for your own? First you’ll have a wait on your hands as deliveries won’t start until 18 to 30 months. Still with us? For the RCE version you can figure around $4.5 million. Give or take.

So if the numbers and design intrigue you and you can wait up to five years and have an extra $4.5 million you could be styling in an Unum. But keep in mind that the Arcanum could be considered a vapor hypercar. With the emphasis on “vapor.” But if this is actually a real deal it could be worth 4.5 just to have such an insane over-the-top EV for your transportation needs."

CLAIRSVILLE — First Settlement Physical Therapy has officially opened up shop inside its new St. Clairsville location filling the former Convenient Food Mart building.

A grand opening ceremony was held Thursday morning.

Employees of the physical therapy office gathered alongside members of the St. Clairsville Area Chamber of Commerce to cut the ribbon at the new location.

Afterward members mingled and talked about the new business and the chamber which allows businesses to support one another.

The office began seeing patients in February; however the grand opening was postponed until now when the company was settled in. Kecia Barr marketing director for FSPT said they lease the building from the current owner who purchased it last year. The building formerly held CFM for years prior to the store moving locations to the old Crosby gas station last summer. The building was then purchased renovated and leased out to the new and current tenants – Hema and Simon Hargus who own FSPT.

Barr said they felt it was the perfect location for the business which now has 35 locations.

“We’re super excited to be in St. Clairsville. We try to see what towns have a lot of people asking about us or are in need of our services. … It’s the perfect location where we can serve a lot of people and there is plenty of parking” she said.

First Settlement is a family-owned physical therapy practice that offers an array of services and “strives to treat its employees and patients as part of the family.” Barr said they accept everyone at the practice regardless of insurance provider.

“A lot of places won’t take some insurances or won’t take somebody based on a condition. We try to see everyone. Everyone gets treated the same. We take all insurances it’s all one-on-one and we don’t have a waiting list” she said.

Barr said they are grateful to the city’s residents who have been welcoming of the business from the start.

“It’s been awesome. Everyone has been super welcoming and we really appreciate that” she added.

Wendy Anderson director of the chamber said they are excited to have the new business in the city and for it to become a vital part of the community.

Barr said they are looking forward to treating patients in the area.

FSPT offers completely free screenings to anyone in need of discovering what treatments are needed or available.

“If a person has any pain and wants to see if physical therapy might be an option for them or we can provide a recommendation on where to get the proper treatment” Barr said.

She said they are looking forward to treating patients in the area.

The St. Clairsville location is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Friday at 248 E.

As we reported earlier the Chief of Naval Operations’ just-released released Navigation Plan 2022 sees the U.S Navy’s fleet of 2040s as including “a host of manned unmanned and optionally-manned platforms operating under on and above the seas.”

The Navy is putting big bucks into researching the large unmanned surface vessel (LUSV) components of that host. On Friday it awarded six companies contracts for “continued studies of a large unmanned surface vessel.”

Here’s who was awarded what:

Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. Pascagoula Miss. was awarded a $13071106 firm-fixed-price modification to a previously awarded contract for continued studies of an LUSV. The contract modification includes options that if exercised would bring its cumulative value to $ 15071106. Work will be performed in Pascagoula Mississippi and is expected to be completed by September 2024. If all options are exercised work will continue through September 2024.

Lockheed Martin Corp. Baltimore Md. has been awarded an $11320904 firm-fixed-price modification to a previously awarded contract for continued studies of an LUSV that includes options which if exercised would bring its cumulative value to $15070904. Work is expected to be completed by September 2024. If all options are exercised work will continue through September 2024.

Marinette Marine Corp. Marinette Wis. has been awarded a $10212620 firm-fixed-price modification to previously awarded contract for continued studies of an LUSV Work will be performed in Marinette Wisconsin and is expected to be completed by September 2024.

Bollinger Shipyards Lockport LLC Lockport La. has been awarded a $9428770 firm-fixed-price modification to previously awarded contract for continued studies of an LUSV that includes options which if exercised would bring its cumulative value of this contract modification to $13958770. Work will be performed in Lockport Louisiana and is expected to be completed by September 2024. If all options are exercised work will continue through September 2024.

Austal USA LLC Mobile Ala. has been awarded a $9115310 firm-fixed-price modification to a previously awarded contract for continued studies of an LUSV. It includes options which if exercised would bring its cumulative value to $13285309. Work will be performed in Mobile Alabama and is expected to be completed by September 2024. If all options are exercised work will continue through September 2024. ington D.C. is the contracting activity.

Gibbs & Cox Inc. Arlington Va. has been awarded an $8981231 modification to a previously awarded contract for continued studies of a large unmanned surface vessel. It includes options which if exercised would bring its cumulative value $15071231. Work will be performed in Arlington Virginia and is expected to be completed by September 2024. If all options are exercised work will continue through September 2024.

The Naval Sea Systems Command is the contracting activity for all these awards.

WHAT IS AN LUSV ANYWAY?

So what is the Navy’s idea of a large unmanned surface vessel? According to a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report updated July 26:

“The Navy envisions LUSVs as being 200 feet to 300 feet in length and having full load displacements of 1000 tons to 2000 tons which would make them the size of a corvette. (i.e. a ship larger than a patrol craft and smaller than a frigate). The Navy wants LUSVs to be low-cost high-endurance reconfigurable ships with ample capacity for carrying various modular payloads—particularly anti-surface warfare (ASuW) and strike payloads meaning principally anti-ship and land-attack missiles. Each LUSV could be equipped with a vertical launch system (VLS) with 16 to 32 missile-launching tubes. Although referred to as UVs LUSVs might be more accurately described as optionally or lightly manned ships because they might sometimes have a few onboard crew members particularly in the nearer term as the Navy works out LUSV enabling technologies and operational concepts. Under the Navy’s FY2023 five-year (FY2023-FY2027) shipbuilding plan procurement of LUSVs through the Navy’s shipbuilding account is programmed to begin in FY2025.”",,,,,,,,,

I am just wondering the north side of the IBM property has been used for parking by Mayo Clinic employees but the south side has so much open parking that is not being used. Why isn't that an option?

Curious commuter

Commuter

I’m glad you asked because it provides me the opportunity to dispel the myth that city park-and-ride lots are solely designed for Mayo Clinic employees.

ADVERTISEMENT

While the stops and related routes tend to cater to the city’s largest employer they are available to anyone who wants to pay for the bus ride and bypass the expense of downtown parking. Think $4 for a round trip rather than $14 for a full day in a downtown parking ramp.

Granted park-and-rides are not convenient for a downtown lunch or shopping trip but anyone who works a 9-5 job in the heart of the city could benefit from the four sites served by city buses.

However it’s not debatable that the park-and-ride system does rely on Mayo Clinic’s purchase of employee bus passes to cover costs and as a result the employer helps dictate how many spaces are needed at each site.

When it comes to the IBM park-and-ride the city currently contracts for 350 spaces which are grouped on the north side of Big Blue.

A sign at the city's park-and-ride location on the IBM campus shows were commuters can park and leave their vehicles at no charge while catching a bus to go downtown. Answer Man/ Post Bulletin

Nick Lemmer marketing and outreach coordinator for Rochester Public Transit and Parking told one of my minions that it’s up to the property owner to decide where leased spaces are located but the north side is well suited for quick access to and from 37th Street Northeast both for commuters and the city buses.

He said any decision to lease more space would be made with Mayo Clinic and the owner of the 3.1 million-square-foot IBM campus Industrial Realty Group LLC but current supply appears to closely match demand.

During Rochester Public Transit’s monthly survey of park-and-ride use on July 6 there were reportedly 339 cars in the 350 available spaces but anecdotal reports indicate the cars can routinely spill over the allotted spaces on weeks that don’t include a federal holiday.

That’s compared to 182 cars in the 245 spaces the city reserves at Olmsted County’s Graham Park.

ADVERTISEMENT

With the city paying $30 to lease space at IBM taxpayers are well served by RPT’s efforts to monitor use and make adjustments as needed. The results appear to rule out seeking more spaces at the IBM location before other spaces are filled.

At the city’s park-and-ride lot near the Chateau Theater in Northeast Rochester where the city leases spaces for $10 a month 68 of the available 300 spaces were used on July 6 and at the Rochester Community and Technical College park-and-ride 55 of 746 potential spaces were full on the same day according to Lemmer.

While the IBM lot is clearly the most popular it’s equally obvious that alternatives exist without adding to city expenses

Additionally the city is likely to see the park-and-ride landscape shift in the near future as work on the planned bus-rapid-transit system continues with anticipated private and public parking options on each end of the service.

The city is also working to create its own 490-space public park-and-ride lot on 75th Street Northwest near U.S. Highway 52 which would use approximately $1.6 million in federal funds to reduce the reliance on long-term lease contracts.

As a result commuter parking will likely be a shifting concern as the city continues to grow and seek new opportunities to help out-of-town employees find the ideal options for that last link to work.

If you saw our recent More Cores More Better AMD Arm and Intel Server CPUs in 2022-2023 piece you may have seen this photo. This is a 128 core Ampere Altra Max Arm CPU (lit by a yellow spotlight) next to a Huawei / HiSilicon Kunpeng 920 48-core Arm processor. One cannot buy the Kunpeng 920 in the US nor the dual CPU server it is in (the Huawei TaiShan 200) but we managed to get one. This is in addition to the Ampere Altra 80 core CPUs that are from the family used by Oracle Cloud Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. We could not get the AWS Graviton2/ Graviton3 to test with but if there is a way we will hopefully get one one day.

The other one that many may not have seen on STH previously is that we actually have several IBM Power9 LC921 servers in the lab. We were able to use the PCIe Gen4 slots (albeit not with hot-swap bays) to get connectivity for the drives. On a relative scale Ampere Arm was easy Huawei/ HiSilicon was more challenging (our first tests were ~80% of AMD EPYC performance) but the IBM Power9 servers have taken a lot more time to get working for this. We may do a review of the LC921 just for YouTube later this quarter just for fun.

With that we also had AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” EPYC 7003 “Milan” EPYC 7003X “Milan-X 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable (Ice Lake) and the new Ice Lake-D 2700 using the Supermicro platforms from our Welcome to the Intel Ice Lake D Era with the Xeon D-2700 and D-1700 series. Here are the ten PCIe Gen4-based CPU architectures we could test the drives with using the AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” as the base case. We used our four corners numbers and then averaged the percentage deltas from the Rome results:

Since we now are within a 6% relative performance range here is the non-zero X-axis chart zooming in on the results:

Again a disclaimer the above is zoomed in and a non-zero X-axis version of the chart above. We were fairly close on these results.

Being a bit fair here the Huawei HiSilicon Kunpeng 920 is the newest platform in our lab but we now are getting ballpark results that we would expect from that PCIe Gen4 platform after taking into account the non-standard NUMA architecture that we see on the CPUs. Intel’s PCIe Gen4 controllers are great and we get perhaps very weak scaling with memory and frequency. Still we can see the Ampere parts in an almost even heat with the AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” and the Milan-based parts slightly ahead.

Perhaps the best part is that despite these drives still carrying the “Intel” branding we got them working reasonably well on many non-Intel architectures. Really only the IBM Power9 and the Kunpeng 920 were off by more than a +/- 2% margin that most folks do not care about.

For those wondering where the Cooper Lake 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Xeon D-2700 D-1500/ D-1600 Cascade Lake AMD EPYC 7001 “Naples” results and so forth are since we now have ten PCIe Gen4 platforms we decided to just limit testing to PCIe Gen4 platforms and not include PCIe Gen3 platforms.

Final Words

Overall the Solidigm D7-P5520 is a nice NVMe SSD. This drive really shows a lot of the hallmark features that we had come to expect of Intel’s NVMe line. Namely the focus on low queue depth performance and a lot of the reliability features that made Intel drives the gold standard for generations. We saw great performance both in our synthetic and real-world application testing.

To us perhaps the biggest item we would want to see changed is the swap to the Solidigm label. That branding swap needs to happen and it will. We are rapidly approaching the PCIe Gen5 generation of SSDs as those platforms are launched over the next few quarters. Hopefully that will be the inflection point for Solidigm’s branding.

Still we delayed this review just to get to test with a bunch of different architectures in what may be the first SSD review to utilize ten different PCIe Gen4 CPU platforms. It was great to see compatibility beyond just x86 here."

Woodworkers visiting booth #400 will witness the first Canadian public showing of the Endurance Diamond Finger Joint Tool which was nominated for the Challengers Award. Endurance was developed using a proprietary PCD grade that Peak Toolworks created in 2018. Peak Toolworks says Endurance is a “game changer” further noting that it has a 200- to 500-times run rate compared to HSS finger joint knives.



Peak Toolworks says the tool can cut through all types of solid wood materials including wood with knots or defects. It can be used with softwoods and hardwoods for structural or non-structural work. Endurance diamond insert knives are designed with adjustable radial lateral and angular run out (0.001 inch to 0.002 inch). The diamond finger joint cutter does not have to be sharpened between replacements.



Because the PCD tool does not wear out when cutting solid wood Peak Toolworks says there is a dollar savings for downtime and labor for sharpening. Other customer benefits include increased productivity and reductions in inventory product reject and maintenance labor costs.



New T-Slot Planer Head

Peak Toolworks will also exhibit the new T-Slot Planer Head that was created based on research of its woodworking customers. Peak Toolworks says the tool’s design addresses the need for a quieter planer head that is cost-effective while still meeting the high feed rates that are required in large planer operations.

The T-Slot Planer Head is designed to utilize popular and less expensive carbide turnover knives that come in many different grades.

The T-Slot Planer system is customizable and modular in design; diameters wing count and cutter length are application specific. A typical T-Slot Planer Head length is 150mm long and can be mounted end to end on an arbor to achieve any cutting width required. The clamping system for the knives allows for the carbide inserts to be changed while the tool is still mounted on the arbor.



The T-Slot Planer Head is designed to utilize popular and less expensive carbide turnover knives that come in many different grades. If applicable Peak Toolworks says the clamping blocks can also be tipped in diamond for longer run times and fewer tool changes. The T-Slot Planer Head design allows for higher wing counts than are possible with typical insert-type planer heads. For example a 6-1/2-inch-diameter head with a 2-1/8-inch hydro bore is capable of a full 12-wing effective cut. Depending on the ratio of cutter blocks to spacer blocks that the tool is loaded with Peak Toolworks adds that the same cutter head could be reduced to a 2-wing cut.



The tool’s head and all other components are made of steel. However they can also be manufactured from aluminum if weight is an issue. In addition the insert blocks can be designed with greater gullet capacity when a larger amount of material removal is necessary.

It renovates an old building in the heart of downtown.

It’s part of what company director of community relations Jonathan Weyer calls “moral capitalism.” The phrase comes from a book by economics and business writer Steven Pearlstein.

“We’re saying capitalism can be good and is good if it’s done right” Weyer said.

Atlas 46 makes tool belts tool vests tool bags tool pouches and anything else that can used to carry tools. It also makes a line of gear specifically for the needs of firefighters. The products are generally made from nylon or leather or a combination of the two and are hand-sewn on sewing machines.

The company takes its name from the Greek god who held up the heavens and the 46th parallel in Montana where company founder John Carver owns a ranch.

Part of the company’s moral capitalism mission is to open plants in small towns that need a boost in both energy and jobs. In order to maintain a town’s character and charm the company refurbishes and repurposes old buildings in its fading business district.

According to Weyer the company chooses small towns that have been hit by globalization and the loss of manufacturing in the hopes of helping them to thrive again. Investing in those areas builds a sense of community he said and can also train a new workforce to find advancement in Atlas 46 or elsewhere.

“We’re getting more from them than they’re getting from us. Their work ethic is rubbing off on us” said Paul Witwer vice president of product development.

The company opened 8 years ago in Fenton on the site of Eagle Industries a previous company that John Carver owned that sold backpacks holsters and other nylon gear to the military. Brian Carver John’s son and Atlas 46’s CEO said he used to play in the building when he was 5 years old.

That plant in Fenton is more of a traditional style of manufacturing building with concrete floors and an interior designed to be ignored. But the newer locations in Hillsboro Illinois and Vandalia Illinois have hardwood floors and exposed brick walls.

“They look like microbreweries” Brian Carver said.

Each plant employs no more than 70 to 100 people he said so they can help improve the towns without dominating them. They are now looking at other similar towns in Illinois and Missouri for expansion.

The Atlas 46 business model also means believing in second chances and they company often hires people recovering from alcoholism and people who have been incarcerated.

Similarly officials is investigating the possibility of providing employment for prisoners on a day-release program at the Vandalia Correctional Center or other facilities in the Illinois Department of Corrections said Weyer.

Company officials are also beginning to discuss training people inside prisons to give them a skill such as sewing or design they can use when they are released.

The company makes note of the fact that its products are made in America. Many of its 220 employees are immigrants — nine languages are spoken in its plants Brian Carver said.

Competition comes largely from countries such as China which can make similar products for less money. Atlas 46 fights back with speed quality and innovation.

Brian Carver 41 said the company maintains its speed of production by staying lean and nimble. Little inventory is kept in stock. When a new product is proposed either by a corporate customer or one of the in-house designers it can go from an idea to production in a matter of weeks.

The quality is maintained by making or at least assembling most items by hand.

Sewing is becoming something of a lost art in manufacturing. Brian Carver estimated that 90% of his employees did not know how to sew when they first joined Atlas 46.

The company is one of the few places around that specialize in sewing so some local fire companies ask them to mend their coats and pants. Though they aren’t in the business of mending and they don’t even make the clothes that are torn they make the necessary repairs.

Innovation is also key to their competitive edge; on average they come out with one new product every two weeks or so. Such speed and innovation have led them to project sales of $14 million to $15 million this year.

One reason for this sustained creativity is the company’s requirement that its designers watch tradesmen at work — sometimes it’s their customers sometimes just people they ask for help. That way they learn what workers really require from their equipment.

To that point a quote from Witwer adorns a whiteboard on the Fenton office wall: “There is no substitute for the direct observation of and interaction with the people who will be using the product.”

From such observations come a wealth of ideas. Seeing that most workers simply toss their tools into their bags at the end of the day the company now makes bags with extra-wide openings — and they are closed with magnets for easy access.

Many of their bags now also come with a detachable sturdy pad so the workers have something handy to kneel on.

Innovations such as these usually come from the designers and the designers all come from the ranks of the workers who hand-sew each product. This ability to rise quickly through the company’s ranks — the possibility of upward mobility — is a powerful motivator Carver said.

Justin Shultz who is in charge of purchasing and corporate maintenance began working at Atlas 46 five years ago as an assembler. Darren Patterson who has been at the company a little more than two years started in the shipping department. He now is in charge of the kitting department a quality-control position that makes certain the production line has everything it needs to make each product.

Carver and the executives take management cues from the Kaizen method a theory of business that emphasizes constant incremental improvement.

“How do you improve each and every day?” Carver said.

One way he said is to take the famous words of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky to heart: “I skate to where the puck is going to be not where it has been.”

But another way to improve is more practical. It has to do with connecting with their customers and thinking like the workers who use their products: Atlas 46 employees build their own desks.

Some are better made than others but the point is that the people who work there get a feeling for the process.

Witwer said “We build stuff because the people we work with build stuff.”",,,,,,,,,

But a significant part of the path to recovery goes through Israel. Investors were angry at the processor giant over the weekend not only because its business performance was particularly weak but also because it came without warning. A miss of monumental proportions by Intel in the quarter that ended in June is not a surprising event that happened at the last minute and the expectation in such a case is to provide a profit warning. Pat Gelsinger the relatively new CEO of Intel has so far enjoyed the confidence of investors and tried to convince the analysts in a conference call after the reports that the deterioration in the global macro environment was surprising and rapid.

This is bad news not only for Intel but a signal for the economic situation in the field when in the background the question is: Is the U.S. entering a recession? But the second aspect of the weakness in Intel's results is the continuous disruption in the supply chains and ths stocking up by consumers which mainly affected the central computing division (CCG). Intel's management should have recognized this trend in the market at an earlier stage and informed the investors about it.

After the publication of the reports Intel's stock fell by nearly 10% but according to market sentiment this is probably not the end of the decline. The reason for this is not only the missed forecasts for the second quarter but also a dramatic reduction in the forecasts for the second half of 2022. Intel reported revenues of $15.3 billion which was $2.7 billion lower than forecasts and reflect a 17% decrease compared to the same period last year. It now expects revenues of $15-16 billion for the third quarter well below the previous forecast of $18.7 billion. In an annual summary Intel should reach revenues of only $65-68 billion compared to a previous expectation of $76 billion. There was also no good news in the field of profitability and against this background Intel officially announced a slowdown in the pace of recruiting new employees and a $4 billion cut in capital expenditures from $27 billion to $23 billion. Even after this cut it should register a negative flow of $1-2 billion in 2022. Fortunately for Intel just as it published the difficult reports congress passed legislation that encourages the establishment of chip factories in its territory (the Chips Act) with a budget of $52 billion and to this end grants a 25% subsidy to companies like Intel that have already started work in Ohio.

The weakness in Intel's performance came in contrast to the optimism that the management conveyed when it implemented Gelsinger's plan to focus only on the core activities: he closed and sold six of the company's activities but in the meantime Intel suffered a blow precisely in its main growth engine with the data center and AI division seeing its revenue plunge by 16%. Sales of the computing division the largest division in Intel fell by 25% and even worse Intel now says that the division's potential market has shrunk by 10%. What sets Gelsinger apart however is taking responsibility: ""The sudden and sharp drop in economic activity is the main driver for the miss but there were also problems with our execution."" Gelsinger promised to make adjustments and speed up the ""implementation of our 'smart capital' strategy.""

Here Israel where Intel is the largest private employer enters the picture. From Gelsinger's words it is implied that the local operation plays an important role in the future growth of Intel. Against this background it is likely that when the cuts come they will not focus specifically on Israel even if they will not completely skip it. The activity in Israel that is most exposed to the negative impact of the Intel crisis is manufacturing. The combination of a cut in the investment budget with the adoption of the Chips Act in the U.S. puts Israel at a disadvantage when it comes to expanding production here. Following the Chips Act whose counterpart was also adopted in Germany these countries will participate in about a third of the costs of setting up new Intel plants compared to about 10% in Israel.





Putting hope in Israel

On the positive side Intel has placed a lot of hope in Israel even if for now these activities are relatively small. The first is of course the chip manufacturing division the establishment of which is based at this stage on the purchase of the Israeli company Tower for $5.8 billion. Last week Intel also reported on an important contract with Mediatek from Taiwan and Gelsinger noted at the end of the week that in addition to this there are already negotiations with six of the 10 largest fabless companies (that do not manufacture their own chips) in the world and in total it is in the process of examining 30 customers. According to Gelsinger these processes can lead to contracts worth $6 billion. He noted that the Tower purchase has already received approvals in four regions of the world including the U.S. and he expects the deal to be closed in early 2023.

Especially surprising certainly in relation to the size of the company was the sentence Gelsinger included in his opening remarks about Israeli company Granulate which was acquired only last March for an estimated sum of $500-600 million and according to Intel's CEO is already yielding results: ""Since we acquired Granulate its customer pipeline has doubled and the revenues have tripled"" he said. Grabulate entered the data center division at the center of which was already the Israeli company Habana Labs which was purchased for $2 billion and recently released the promising chip under the Gaudi brand. The artificial intelligence capabilities provided by Granulate and Habana are supposed to cover Intel's weakness in the data center field which is losing market share to competitors in the last few quarters. The other local brand that is concentrated almost entirely in Israel is Mobileye which was the only activity that showed rapid growth in the second quarter and reached a record revenue of $460 million an increase of 41% compared to the corresponding period. The operating profit also rose by a similar rate to $190 million. These numbers provide an excellent explanation for Intel's desire to issue Mobileye on Wall Street a plan that had to be shelved for the time being due to the state of the markets. Intel was aiming for a $50 billion valuation for the autonomous vehicle division that is run by Amnon Shashua a value that seems disconnected from reality these days. However Gelsinger noted that Intel is determined to bring Mobileye to an IPO near the end of the year subject to market conditions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9pbnRlbC1jb25maXJtcy0xNHRoLWdlbi1tZXRlb3ItbGFrZS1oYXMtdmVyc2F0aWxlLXByb2Nlc3NpbmctdW5pdC1mb3ItYWktZGVlcC1sZWFybmluZy1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel confirms 14th Gen Meteor Lake has 'Versatile Processing Unit' for AI/Deep Learning applications,"Versatile Processing Unit for deep learning and AI inference

Intel is adding VPU to Meteor Lake and newer.

A new commit to Linux VPU driver today confirms that the company has plans to introduce a new processing unit into consumer 14th Gen Core processors a Versatile Processing Unit.

The VPU driver is included into the Linux Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) the same way their graphics driver is integrated. The VPU appears 6 years after Intel acquired a company called Movidius which has been developing their own VPUs. It is not entirely clear if and how Intel plans to incorporate Movidius designs into Meteor Lake it could be a full-blown SoC-like integration or just a copy of architecture bits needed for Meteor Lake. Obviously after so many years VPU design should be much more complex.

The confirmation on VPU comes from Kerner.org patches where the following description is added:

Intel VPU for Meteor Lake Source: kernel.org

Thus Intel confirms the new VPU has five components including CPU to VPU integration unit memory management RISC controller network on chip and the most important part the Neural Compute Subsystem (NCS) doing the actual work. This VPU unit could be considered Intel’s alternative to NVIDIA’s Tensor Cores a dedicated chip that is heavily focused on AI algorithms.

Intel Meteor Lake is now officially coming next year eventually it should become available for mobile and desktop platforms packed with new hybrid architecture featuring Redwood Cove and Crestmont CPU cores and Intel’s newest Xe-LPG graphics architecture.

The origin differential is an additional country quality premium that has traditionally been determined by the market.

It is a key factor in determining cocoa prices and together with the Living Income Differential (LID) as well as the Intercontinental Exchange Europe Price (the London Futures market for cocoa) guarantees a higher price for farmers in the world’s top cocoa producers.

The new levels are therefore a minimum of zero pounds per ton for Côte d’Ivoire and 20 pounds per ton for Ghana.

The CIGCI started publishing the origin differentials at the end of May 2022 to have more transparency in the sector after establishing that the effects of the LID were being eroded due to the discount chocolate makers and cocoa merchants were getting on the origin differential. The CIGCI-published origin differential is indicative and the minimum amount cocoa will be sold at.

“The issue came up during a recent meeting with industry where our member countries expressed the fact that the quality of their cocoa hadn’t diminished and that they therefore shouldn’t have to settle for discounts on this matter” said Alex Assanvo CIGCI executive secretary.

“We will therefore no longer accept cocoa sold below this level as we head into positive territory” he said.

Last month the origin differential was set at minus 125 pounds per ton in Côte d’Ivoire and minus 50 pounds per ton in Ghana for July.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Globally the total number of incident cases deaths and DALYs due to ovarian cancer increased significantly. Studies of GBD 2017 showed the same trends of incidence and mortality burden while one of them didn’t analyze related DALY data which is a crucial indicator of the dynamics of OC disease burden. Similar with the findings from previous study using 2017 GBD data the number of cases deaths and DALYs of ovarian cancer worldwide increased significantly maintaining the trend shown in the 2017 study [6 8] but the age-standardized rates did not change. Thus we speculate the reasons caused this phenomenon were partly owing to the population increase as well as aging. At the same time relatively stable ASIR could be explained as new risk factors not to introduce or the variation of exposure to risk factors in different parts of the world. Differences in access to health care in different regions of the world and poor implementation of interventions to address ovarian cancer in some regions could also contribute to a rise in global ovarian cancer deaths while ASDR remained unchanged. Moreover the differentiation of OC burden varies greatly among regions. The incidence of OC in high SDI region was much more severe than in other regions but fortunately the value in these regions continued to decline. Worryingly in contrast we found a significant increase in OC morbidity and mortality in low SDI quintile although age-standardized morbidity mortality and DALY rates in these countries remained relatively low. High SDI regions are more severe than other regions and East Asia has the highest burden of disease. This is associated with social and economic development maternal number and the decrease of breastfeeding infertility and the increase in obesity is the promoting factors of ovarian cancer [252627] but fortunately with the progress of treatment technology in recent years and the active involvement of patients in treatment The mortality rate of OC in these regions continued to decrease. In contrast we found a significant increase in most developing countries. According to the data of the present study disease burden of Caribbean showed an extraordinary growth in the last 30 years. Besides the influence of social and economic factors genetic factors also played a big role. Studies have confirmed that breast and ovarian cancer patients who was born in the Caribbean one in seven cases of ovarian/breast cancer was inherited [28 29]. At the same time young patients have a higher rate of genetic variation and the range of variation is very wide which may be traced back to the period of European colonization and slave trade.

In this study we found that the overall burden of ovarian cancer was heaviest in the age group 50–69 while the increase was the largest in the age group 70 +  which was similar to the conclusion of previous studies [29]. Such a result may be closely related to the emergence of aging which is the same as the reason for the stabilization of age-standardized rates discussed above. For the two main types of epithelial ovarian cancer patients before the age of 40 mostly belong to type I which usually appears in the early stage and has a good prognosis. In older patients type II epithelial neoplasms make up a large proportion accounting for approximately 75% of it and are usually present in advanced stages with poor prognosis [30]. At the same time the elderly has more underlying diseases and more adverse biological factors [31] which may also be the reason for the difference in the incidence and death burden of ovarian cancer in different age groups.

At the same time of all the risk factors high fasting plasma glucose led to the most severe burden of ovarian cancer and the burden changed a lot during the limited time period of this study. Therefore this study confirms that carrying out effective policies based on local conditions and actively implementing prevention strategies for different risk factors are of great significance for the prevention and treatment of ovarian cancer.

Previous studies suggested that the high mortality and low survival rates of ovarian cancer are mainly due to the lack of screening [32] but a recent randomized controlled trial of the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) [33] which has a high compliance rate among women showed that the number of deaths among patients who had undergone annual multimodal screening (MMS) and annual transvaginal ultrasound screening (USS) was not significantly higher than those who did not and could not be considered to have a significant reduction in mortality from ovarian cancer. This shows that future research still has a great potential to select better methods for the detection and treatment of ovarian cancer. At the same time some previous analysis failed to take full advantage of the different types of data on incidence mortality disability-adjusted life years and risk factors reported in the GBD [7].

If people consume high GI foods for a long time in daily life they will have a higher risk of high fasting glucose. Some studies have shown that the overall insulin response increases dramatically after eating high GI foods and insulin has been shown to be a cancer cell growth factor and cancer promoter [34] and like supplying energy to normal cells ingested glucose can also provide energy to tumor cells thus promoting tumor growth. Currently diabetes is now proven to be an independent risk factor for ovarian cancer mortality [35] and age-standardized death rate of ovarian cancer worldwide due to high fasting plasma glucose was on the rise among all SDI quintiles which may be associated with death due to diabetes comorbidity. And among them over the past 3 decades the age-standardized death rate of OC had the smallest rise in the high SDI region which may be associated with the declining diabetes mortality in women in this region with data showing a decreasing trend in female diabetes mortality in 24 of 28 EU countries as of 2019 [36]. Similarly for Eastern Europe and Australasia high fasting plasma glucose was not the first risk factor for ovarian cancer mortality. In contrast high fasting plasma glucose led to the largest increase in ASDR in low SDI and low-middle SDI regions. In a nationally representative cross-sectional survey in Iran researchers found that the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes increased at an alarming rate among adults with an age-standardized prevalence rate of 25.4 (18.6 to 32.1) per 100000 [37]. In addition to regional differences in the prevalence of diabetes unequal distribution of government health resources may also contribute to this situation. In highly developed countries up to 75% of government health care spending on diabetes is spent on hospital treatment for its complications. In developing countries however the structure of diabetes-related spending varies considerably with most of the costs shifting to patients who must pay for their own treatment [38].

Occupational exposure to asbestos was the second-leading specific risk factor for deaths from ovarian cancer in 2019 contributing to 3.3% (1.5 to 5.4%) of all deaths. Current studies uniformly suggest that human mesothelial cells are highly sensitive to asbestos toxicity [39] but further scientific investigation is needed urgently to clarify the causal relationship between asbestos and ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer due to asbestos exposure was listed as a new occupational disease in gynecology in 2017. Although asbestos has been banned in 55 countries or regions (e.g. Denmark the USA) [40] it is still widely used today. High SDI region showed extremely high ASDR values in 2019 but the large decline in the past 3 decades may reflect the industrialization and cumulative occupational exposures of decades ago. For other quintiles with rising ASDR which may face continued national industrialization in the future should also introduce appropriate policies which are not protective against cancer mortality reduction for the time being only by controlling asbestos exposure limits [41] but should ban the use of asbestos or manage the corresponding structures that already contain asbestos.

Our study indicated that high body-mass index was the third-leading specific risk factor for deaths from ovarian cancer in 2019. Numerous studies have now shown a correlation between obesity and ovarian cancer risk and obesity is also associated with reduced survival rates specific to ovarian cancer at the same time. And in a Women's Health Initiative cohort study low-fat dietary patterns and physical activity showed the possibility of a negative association with ovarian cancer risk [42]. This provides an effective solution for ovarian cancer risk avoidance at the individual level.

The accuracy of the results of this study depends on the quality and quantity of GBD data. In terms of quantity the GBD study cannot cover all regions of the world. In terms of quality the possibility of missing information in less developed countries cannot be excluded. In addition information bias is inevitable. Due to the limitation of information we could not investigate further history to capture the influence of genetic factors on ovarian cancer. Also different risk factors may have different effects on different histological subtypes of ovarian cancer and we are currently unable to specifically distinguish between these histological subtypes and GBD still faces some challenges in estimating the cause-specific non-lethal and lethal burden of ovarian cancer [43]. In order to develop more effective preventive measures there is a need to analyze the severity grading and subtypes of ovarian cancer according to the etiology in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJwcy5vcmcudWsvZ3VpZGVsaW5lcy10ZXN0aW5nLWFuZC10ZXN0LXVzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guidelines on testing and test use | BPS,"Guidelines on testing and test use

It wasn’t until after his death in 1973 that his works discovered by his landlords trickled onto Chicago’s art scene with his fanciful stories and sometimes-violent imagery eventually gaining worldwide appreciation — and skyrocketing value.

Now nearly a half a century later a brewing legal battle over the rights to Darger’s legacy has landed in Chicago’s federal court where a lawsuit was filed this week by his estate accusing the landlords of copyright infringement.

The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court on Wednesday names Kiyoko Lerner as well as the estate of her husband Nathan who together rented the third-floor room of their walk-up on West Webster Avenue to Darger beginning in the 1930s.

A piece by Henry Darger titled “93 At Jennie Richee are chaced for long distance by Glandelinians with blood hounds” is from the collection of Marjorie and Harvey Freed. It’s a watercolor graphite collage and carbon transfer on pierced paper.

According to the suit the Lerners have been illegally profiting from Darger’s works for nearly five decades including his massive 15000-page illustrated manuscript “In the Realms of the Unreal” despite having no claim as heirs. Nathan Lerner a photographer and industrial designer who first promoted Darger’s work died in 1997.

The lawsuit comes six months after several of Darger’s purported relatives all first cousins several times removed filed an action in Cook County Probate Court seeking to be declared heirs to his estate. That suit is still pending.

The Lerners have long maintained that Darger was clear before his death that he didn’t care what happened to his work. An attorney who represents Kiyoko Lerner in the probate matter did not return calls seeking comment.

Darger’s back story as a solitary and unknown artist who skyrocketed to posthumous fame bears striking resemblance to Vivian Maier the Chicago-area nanny who became one of the world’s most acclaimed street photographers only after her discarded images were discovered in an old storage locker.

Personal belongings and artifacts from Henry Darger are on display at the Henry Darger Room at Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art as pictured on Jan. 31 2017.

As in Darger’s case Maier who died in 2009 was a pack rat and a recluse who never sought to publish her work in her lifetime. But the accidental discovery of tens of thousands of Maier’s negatives led to a messy legal squabble over her suddenly lucrative estate including an exhaustive search for a rightful heir.

The Cook County public administrator wound up taking over Maier’s affairs and filed a similar copyright lawsuit at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse against some of those who profited off of the photographs.

Meanwhile the copyright fight over Darger’s estate has connections to the same Chicago collector Ron Slattery who was one of the first to buy Maier’s photo negatives. Slattery told The New York Times in February that he took it upon himself to track down some of Darger’s relatives and showed them a 2019 article in the Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property that questioned the rights to the Darger estate.

“After all the research it just seemed like the right thing to do” Slattery told the Times. “How can you let that just sit there?”

Slattery did not return calls seeking comment Friday.

By now the story of Darger’s unlikely rise to world acclaim is well known. After he was born in Chicago in 1892 his mother died when he was 4. His father a tailor struggled with health issues. After Darger had behavioral problems at school he was sent to what was then known as the Illinois Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children in downstate Lincoln.

Personal belongings and artifacts from Henry Darger are on display at the Henry Darger Room at Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art pictured on Jan. 31 2017.

Darger would later incorporate many of his experiences at the asylum including children being subjected to forced child labor and severe punishment into his art. After his father died in 1908 Darger escaped from the facility and walked 160 miles back to Chicago where he found work as a custodian at a Catholic hospital. Aside from a brief stint in the military during World War I it would remain his profession for the next 50 years.

In 1930 Darger began renting a large third-floor room in a brick home at 851 W. Webster Ave. He’d been living there for nearly 30 years when Nathan Lerner bought the building in the late 1950s. In the 2004 documentary “The Realms of the Unreal” Kiyoko Lerner and others who had contact with Darger in his later years remembered him as quiet and idiosyncratic detached from reality in many ways but not dangerous.

He was obsessed with the weather and was a voracious reader of newspapers and magazines according to the documentary. He wore the same threadbare army coat and could often be seen prowling alleys near the apartment looking for collectables in the trash. At night when he’d return home from work neighbors would hear voices coming from his room like a large group of people having a boisterous discussion. It was Darger immersed in his world talking to himself.

In the mid-1960s after he was forced to leave his job due to declining health Darger was spending virtually his entire life in the room. There he continued working on his life’s opus the fantasy story of the Vivian Girls seven Christian princesses who join a bloody rebellion against child enslavers. The work which ultimately filled some 15145 typed pages is illustrated with hundreds of painted scenes drawings and stencils featuring tranquil landscapes and mystical creatures coupled with terrifying images of young children being tortured and murdered.

By early 1973 Darger was too sick to live alone and was moved to St. Augustine’s Home for the Aged the same institution where his father had died. When the Lerners and some neighbors went into his room to begin clearing out his things they couldn’t believe their eyes.

“I distinctly remember going up that narrow staircase and entering a totally new world” Lynne Warren then a neighbor and art student told the Tribune in 2000. “I really felt like I had stepped inside Henry’s mind.”

At Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art Henry Darger’s apartment is recreated with personal belongings and artifacts in the Henry Darger Room shown on Jan. 31 2017.

Resting on an iron bed were the volumes making up “In the Realms of the Unreal.” Also found were Darger’s detailed memoirs a meticulously kept weather journal and decades-old newspaper clippings of disasters and missing or slain children tacked to the wall.

“We were stunned” Kiyoko Lerner told the Tribune. “We didn’t know what to make of it.”

David Berglund a tenant in the building said he remembered visiting Darger in the hospital before he died and praising his old neighbor’s work.

“He looked at me like I’d sucker-punched him” Berglund remembered. “He looked at me and said ‘It’s too late now. It belongs to Mr. Lerner.'”

Darger died on April 13 1973. He’s buried at All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines where his headstone is inscribed with the words “Protector of Children.”

Nathan Lerner saw the potential in Darger’s work and used his connections in Chicago’s art world to try to drum up interest. They preserved Darger’s room and invited artists and students to dive into the dense and mysterious creations.

Personal belongings and artifacts from Henry Darger are on display at the Henry Darger Room at Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art pictured on Jan. 31 2017.

Four years after Darger’s death his work was first featured in a show at the Hyde Park Art Center but international acclaim wouldn’t come until the 1990s with a show at the American Folk Art Museum in New York. Since then Darger has been recognized as one of the world’s premier “outsider” artists and his work has inspired poems an opera even a rock band called the Vivian Girls.

With the notoriety of course came the inevitable dollar signs and Darger’s works particularly the illustrations began fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars in art house auctions.

The value continues today. According to the lawsuit Christie’s auction house estimated the sale price for one page from “In the Realms of the Unreal” to be between $200000 to $400000. The painting wound up selling for $675000.

The lawsuit alleged that over the years the Lerners “have generated tens of hundreds of millions of dollars from the unauthorized exploitation of the Darger works.”

But even if the Lerners are found to have violated the law how much could be recouped for Darger’s estate — and who would share the proceeds — is still a very murky picture. In Cook County Probate Court Judge Kent Delgado has granted the petitioners an extension to prove up their claim as Darger’s rightful heirs which can be a lengthy process.

Meanwhile many of the contents of Darger’s old room on West Webster Avenue which had been preserved by the Lerners are now on display at Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art on Chicago’s Near West Side.

But the room itself is long gone. Back in 2000 Kiyoko Lerner’s stepson Michael told the Tribune he was gut rehabbing the building with Darger’s room serving as the master suite.

The building sold in 2006 for $2 million records show.

It went viral on TikTok.,"LAND O’ LAKES — Imagine you’re peacefully sharing a summer afternoon with your family when suddenly you get a notification from your Ring home security camera. Two Pasco deputies and a third person are standing on your doorstep trying to evict you.

Is it a prank?

That’s what Jennifer Michele of Land O’ Lakes wondered. Michele 39 was 15 minutes from home visiting her mother on Thursday when she had to explain remotely through a camera that her property did not have an eviction order.

“I was freaking out the whole time” said Michele who works as a disability case manager at a human resources services company. “How is it possible?”

Michele shared the footage Friday on her TikTok account @jennifermichele82. In a matter of hours the video went viral on the social platform something Michele never planned.

“It was starting to go crazy” she said.

When she decided to post it Michele thought no one would be interested. By Sunday the TikTok had more than 5 million views.

“It was a complete surprise” she said.

The doorbell video shows the deputies and a rental representative from Invitation Homes in front of her house. She asks what they’re doing. One of the deputies says they’re trying to serve an eviction notice.

“What eviction?” Michele asks.

“It was posted a week ago” the deputy replies.

Seconds later the deputies realize the mistake and confirm it’s their fault after Michele gives her last name.

“We have the wrong house” says a deputy after he checks the house number. “It was the next door neighbors.”

Michele said she was in shock and angry. She has lived in the same home almost 13 years without any incident. She owns the house and has plenty of cameras installed because she and her husband like to check their home day or night and from any location.

“I am not familiar with the eviction process” said Michele. “How is it possible that three people didn’t have the right address?”

Pasco Sheriffs Office’s spokesperson Amanda Hunter said the agency was aware of the situation and reviewing the incident.

“The deputies worked with the resident when the mistake was discovered to resolve the issue” Hunter told the Tampa Bay Times.

“I was worried about my three dogs who were home alone when this all happened” Michele said. “They were just a little scared and were in their crate barking the whole time.”

The deputies eventually found the home they were looking for and apologized to Michele. However they had already pried off her door lock.

“Happily they fixed it right away” Michele said. The deputies bought a barbecue lunch for her family even when she told them it was not necessary.

“I’m not angry anymore because I understand that people make mistakes” said Michele. “But I’m very grateful that I have that Ring device because I was able to catch the situation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dHNwLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcGFzY29jb3VudHkvcGFzY28tY291bnR5LWRlcHV0aWVzLWV2aWN0aW9uLXdyb25nLWhvbWUtdGlrdG9rLzY3LTgzZjdmOTMxLWNlMTAtNDI5NC1iN2I1LTkwZWYwOWQ3OTAzONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Viral TikTok show 2 Florida deputies serve eviction in wrong home | wtsp.com,"A woman in Land O'Lakes caught the incident on her home Ring camera.

Example video title will go here for this video

LAND O' LAKES Fla. — Jennifer Michele was at her mother's home on Thursday afternoon in Land O' Lakes when she saw a notification from Ring that someone had rung her doorbell. Ring security systems have a video component and she said she was alarmed by what she saw.

""I checked it and it was two officers and some guy and the guy was drilling my door"" Michele said.

Using Ring's ""live"" video feature Michele said she could see the two Pasco County deputies and a man who works for a leasing company were still at her door and began to speak to them through the system.

""I just started speaking to them through the Ring to find out what they were doing"" she said. ""They informed me that they were finalizing the eviction that was posted last week which was new to me because I have a mortgage.""

The deputies were also disabling her front door's lock the video showed.

Michele expressed disbelief in the video and insisted that she doesn't owe anything on her house.

One deputy asked for her full name as the other checked the home's address. In seconds it became clear to the people at the door that they were at the wrong home.

""We actually we do apologize"" one deputy said in the video. ""We have the wrong house. It was the next door neighbor.""

Michele said she understood the deputies made a mistake but it was an unusual experience for her.

""I was very angry. My dogs are inside and they were barking up a storm"" she said. ""Yes it was a mistake and I get that people can make mistakes but that’s a big mistake to make.""

The lock was fixed that afternoon and the deputies even bought her lunch for her trouble. While Michele said she accepted their apology she still thought about how much worse the situation could have been.

""If I didn't have my Ring all of my stuff would have been put out on my driveway"" she said. ""If I was out of town would they have gotten rid of my stuff? Would they have taken my dogs to animal control? I have no idea.""

A spokesperson for the Pasco County Sheriff's Office says the incident certainly appears to be a mistake but they're still investigating to determine how it happened.

A spokesperson for the leasing company serving the eviction Invitation Homes told 10 Tampa Bay they are deeply sorry about what took place and have apologized to Michele. They also said they take this situation seriously and are reviewing procedures to ensure this does not happen again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZ2xhbWFkZWxhaWRlLmNvbS5hdS9ib29rLXJldmlldy10aGUtYWpvb25hLWd1ZXN0LWhvdXNlLWJ5LXN0ZXBoZW4taG91c2UlRUYlQkYlQkMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Book Review: The Ajoona Guest House by Stephen House,"An acid trip down memory lane. 5

If Alan Ginsberg or any of the famous Beat Poets were alive today they would probably be best friends with Stephen House.

The full text of House’s latest monologue The Ajoona Guest House is currently available online as a chapbook and is a little gem. Chapbooks are interesting. They are small books usually self-published and more often than not poetry which are delivered traditionally as hand-stitched pieces of paper or in our current digital world as a PDF.

After the premiere performance of The Ajoona Guest House in Adelaide directed by Rosalba Clemente this performance monologue is touring Australia though its content I believe has a global appeal. House has an increasingly large body of work and has won a raft of awards for his poetry and plays. He has a natural and engaging style that works both for performance and reading though I do suggest if you can’t get to see House perform The Ajoona Guest House monologue live you read it out loud; it brings the atmosphere of the story to life with engaging clarity.

The energy smells and sounds of modern India and the India of the ‘60s and ‘70s jump from the pages of this chapbook and drop us into a world of memory driven by the sensual sexual and confronting world the mature artist experiences in the current India and the India he experienced as his younger self. It is a journey filled with excitement discovery death and danger. It has an underlying need to find closure through experience both past and present which has a provocative and sensual core. It activates the power of memory through experience re-experience regret and hope. For the baby-boomers of the world it is a flashback to a time where we explored and experimented often with no thought for the consequences as we found more and more ways to expand and enhance our reality with mind-altering experiences and substances. For the current generation who is searching for motivation they are given a window into how memory shapes us as we grow and how our past experiences and influences shape our future.

This is a piece of literature that has several homes. It is a short story a play and a revisiting of the world of beat poetry; it exists comfortably in all three worlds. As I said at the beginning of this review Allen Ginsberg Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs would have all been on Stephen House’s invitation list to a backyard BBQ. Well worth a read.

(WLUC) - The Northern Lights YMCA got dirty in Iron Mountain Saturday.

It was the Mountain Mud Sling a fun run through Pine Mountain with a twist. Teams had to maneuver through obstacles such as a slip and slide 500 stairs and the famous giant mud pit.

There was even a King of the Mountain competition to see which team could run the obstacle course the most times. Team Josh and Team Parker tied for first each team completing the course five times.

Organizers say the event was a great opportunity to get active.

“It’s just a great chance for everybody to get together and do something active” said Sandi Bingham Northern Lights YMCA health and wellness coordinator. “At the Y we like to promote health and wellness and this is just one great opportunity that we have.”

Saturday’s Mountain Mud Sling ran from 8 to 11 a.m. CT. The Northern Lights YMCA would like to thank sponsors and volunteers for their efforts in organizing the muddy event.

At the end of the existence of the school a brand new era of education in the life of Orangeburg’s Black and white students took on a combination between Orangeburg High School and Wilkinson High School.

Orangeburg County in 1704 was settled by Blacks and whites. At that time they both played a vital and different role in the development of our county. For more than 200 years whites dominated all of the major functions in the life of the people who lived here.

All of the aspects of life here in Orangeburg were controlled and led by the whites. From the years of slavery to the year 1865 when freedom was granted to all of the people residing in America the Blacks have been the majority of the population of our county.

Then in 1954 our United States Supreme Court laid out their landmark decision that “the United States state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality.”

Wilkinson High School which became the first school built in South Carolina for the exclusive instruction of Negro high school students was founded in 1938. Prior to this time the education of Black students in Orangeburg came from the Johnson School the Sterling School the Dunton Memorial School Claflin University and South Carolina State College.

The Times and Democrat printed on Jan. 11 1938: “C.M. Brice the resident WPA engineer said yesterday he plans to begin construction next Monday on the new negro high school building to be erected in this school district. The building will be located in the vicinity of the Dunton Memorial School. The cost of the project will be approximately $25000 of which the sponsor the local board of trustees will provide around $7500.”

Dr. A.J. Thackston was the first superintendent. The school was named Wilkinson High School in honor of the late Dr. Robert Shaw Wilkinson the second president of South Carolina State College.

Dr. J.C. Parler was named the first principal. The faculty consisted of seven teachers with an enrollment of 204 students. The school was located on Goff Avenue adjoining Dunton Elementary School. The first building contained the principal’s office auditorium and nine classrooms.

On March 8 1939 The T&D printed: “News of Interest to Colored People —Negro High School Making Progress — Wilkinson High School Orangeburg’s new school plant (the first to be devoted exclusively to the instruction of Negro high school students) is rapidly taking its place as one of South Carolina’s secondary schools after less than six months of operation under the guidance of James C. Parler.”

Then at the end of the school year in 1940 The T&D printed on May 31 1940: “Wilkinson High Ends Session-Large Class of Graduates to Receive Diplomas Next Week — The second Commencement address at Wilkinson High School will be delivered by the Rev. A.J. Thomas Chaplin of Civilian Conservation Corps Hardeville Friday May 31 at 8 p.m.

“This program is intended to stimulate further interest in continued studying either in the atmosphere of formal training to be found in a college or in improving one’s labor bargaining power in the modern industrial world.”

After 8-1/2 years Wilkinson became accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. It was the seventh high school for Negroes in South Carolina to meet the rigid requirements of this accrediting agency.

On June 3 1942 the president of South Carolina State College M.F. Whittaker delivered the address to the 88 seniors of Wilkinson High School.

The May 1945 commencement for the school started with the annual senior sermon at Trinity Methodist Church. The final exercises were held at White Hall on the campus of State College. In that year there were a total of 92 candidates graduating.

Then on Dec. 5 1947 The T&D printed: “Branch Library Opened At Wilkinson School — The Wilkinson Branch of the Orangeburg County Free Library has been opened to the public at the Wilkinson High School grounds library officials announced.

“Visitors were invited to inspect the library which is operated jointly by the Free library and Wilkinson High School which supplied the site for the building. It is being used by both school children and by the Negro public.”

The 1949 school year in Orangeburg brought a record number of students. The white pupils included 1119 in elementary schools and 709 in high school. The Negro elementary enrollment was 1582 and 583 were enrolled at Wilkinson High School.

Understanding the value of Wilkinson High School to the community the first Wolverine Club was started in 1949. The T&D reported on Oct. 22 1949: “Wolverine Club Membership Drive Started — Well-wishers of Wilkinson High School are invited to become members of the Wolverine Club a booster’s organization recently formed to help and encourage the athletics and extra-curricular activities of Wilkinson High School.

“The club has been organized along the lines of other quarterback clubs and has as its objective to encourage good sportsmanship among the players and aid in the promotion of good sportsmanship on the part of spectators. They propose to give financial aid to the extra-curricular program of the school.”

In 1952 Dr. Parler was promoted to the position of administrative principal of Negro schools. Robert E. Howard was appointed the second principal for Wilkinson High School.

Then in 1953 Wilkinson was relocated. It is now located just east of the intersection of the Belleville Road and Highway 21 bypass. Chester A. Ray became the assistant principal. That year marked the 15th annual commencement exercise and there were a total of 85 students to graduate.

The school was housed in a modern structure containing 13 wings library and gymnasium. The faculty had grown to 57 teachers serving some 1300 students.

On Feb. 2 1954 The T&D announced: “Community Education Center Opens Feb. 11 — The Community Education Center for 1954 will begin Thursday February 11 and continue for six consecutive Thursday nights at the Wilkinson Senior High School. The school recently moved into new and modern buildings on the Belleville Road according to announcement released this week.

“With all the Orangeburg City Schools cooperating the Community Education Center will offer an opportunity for adults young and old to return to school and keep abreast of the times through the study and discussion of the many challenging problems of the day.”

Then in May 1954 James Green representing Wilkinson High School won the Junior Singles Championship of the National Junior Development Tennis Tournament held at Virginia Union University. Green defeated Willie Daniels of Washington North Carolina in the finals 7-5 6-4.

He qualified to participate in the National Interscholastic Championship in Charlottesville Virginia on June 20.

The students at Wilkinson High School always participated on a high level in all types of events that were sponsored in the state. In April 1955 Marion Johnston won first prize in the field of mechanical drawing at the State Trade and Industrial Tournament and Convention that was held in Georgetown.

Also in May of 1955 the Wilkinson tennis team won its eighth state tennis crown. James Green and George Hunter rallied to beat Coleman Blalock of Mather Academy.

In the girl’s singles Beverly Rhodes defeated Minion Dickerson of Booker Washington High.

During the 1956 Wilkinson High School football season they closed with a 58-0 victory over Findley High of Chester. Albert Owens and John Harper a pair of lightning fast halfbacks led the Wolverines to their most decisive win of the season. Owens scored three times twice after snaring passes and once on a 35-yard dash while Harper raced 53 yards for one score and ran back a punt 65 yards for another.

The 1957 Palmetto State Science Fair was held in April at the Columbia Township Auditorium. Of the many projects entered in the competition Wilkinson High School carried away all of the honors.

A first-place honor went to Eima Ruth Sullivan for her project on a cycling plant for natural gas. The second-place honor went to John McLeod for an atomic power plant; and the third-place honor went to Robert Moore for his project on a jet engine.

In March of 1958 the Wilkinson boys won the Lower State AAA basketball title with a conference record of 12 wins and no losses. The team was coached by William Senior.

Then on March 27 1958 The T&D printed an article on one of its carriers and a 16-year-old student from Wilkinson who developed the “Trip Meter:” “T&D Carrier Invents Parking Meter Tripper — Shellie Louis Jr. 16 Times and Democrat carrier boy Negro son of a carpenter who lives at 271 Treadwell St. and Evelyn Louis an elementary education teacher at Reevesville School who commutes to her classroom each day invented a Trip Meter.

“It is a device added to a parking meter which trips the meter when an automobile leaves thus nullifying any free time the departing motorist might have left. It works with a hose and air pressure which activates a spring-loaded cylinder. The idea is very similar to that used by many service stations to let the operator know that an auto has arrived.”

That year of 1958 Harris A. Marshall superintendent of Orangeburg City Schools presented 125 diplomas to the graduating class. Dr. K.W. Green dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at South Carolina State College delivered the annual Wilkinson High School Senior Sermon.

On May 31 1960 The T&D reported: “Graduation Slated For Wilkinson — One hundred and thirty-three students will receive their high school diplomas tonight in graduation exercises of Wilkinson High School. The theme for the event will be “Educational Principles and Life.”

Sadly The T&D announced on Jan. 2 1961 the passing of the first principal of Wilkinson High School. “Dr. J. C. Parler died early Sunday morning in the Orangeburg Region Hospital. In 1938 he became the first principal of the Wilkinson High School.”

Since the year of 1950 the Orangeburg city school system had built individual plants for its school system. By 1961 they included Orangeburg High Edisto Drive and Sheridan -- all white; and Wilkinson Nix Elementary Whittaker and Randolph -- all Negro.

This period of growth by the Orangeburg city schools was called the “Financial Fifties.”

The Wilkinson High School boys and girls track team displayed their talent and ability more and more as the years moved forward. In May 1961 the Wilkinson boys and girls captured the lower state AAA titles for the second straight year at the South Carolina State College stadium.

Later on June 6 1961 The T&D reported: “Wilkinson High Graduate To Go To West Point — Harold A. Jenkins Jr. a 1961 graduate of Wilkinson High School and son of Major Harold A. Jenkins professor of military science at South Carolina State College and Mrs. Bernice M. Jenkins has been accepted as a candidate to the United States Military Academy at West Point.”

Then in 1962 the Wilkinson High School Wolverines football team won its first state title championship. The T&D reported on Nov. 25 1962: “Wilkinson Wins State AAA Title — Wilkinson High School’s Wolverines of Orangeburg rolled to an overwhelming 21-7 triumph over Carver High School here Saturday night to win the South Carolina Negro AAA football Championship.

“Quarterback Stanley Jacobs was at his peak as he consistently hit his targets with passes for long yardage. Two of his aerials were for touchdowns — both to end Thomas Kennedy on plays covering 25 yards.”

The next year in 1963 the boys scored 12 points to win the Lower State track and field meet at South Carolina State.

In 1964 the push by the Blacks in Orangeburg to integrate the school system grew more and more as the parents fought to get their children enrolled in the white schools. The parents of the Black students were successful in their efforts in the courts. Plus the 1964 Civil Rights Bill and Titles would authorize the attorney general to sue to compel school desegregation.

Wilkinson High School like many other schools of that time had an ample number of outstanding students to win awards and scholarships. In May of 1964 Marian Theresa Day a senior was announced as one of 35 winners of a $500 Donald Russell Scholarship Award in English.

The scholarship was for the school year 1964-65 to any school of her choice in the state.

In the fall of 1964 a total of 19 Black students were the first to be admitted to formerly all-white schools in the city of Orangeburg. The careful planning by the leaders in the school system paid off when the schools began their classes without any incidents.

The T&D reported on Aug. 25 1964: “18 Negroes To Integrate Four O’burg White Schools Friday Orangeburg High Thackston Junior High Mellichamp and Ellis Avenue Schools Will Desegregate.

“At that time the local school system began to operate under the Freedom of Choice plan whereby a student could decide where he or she wanted to attend school.”

Also in August of 1964 Wade Hampton Academy opened its doors as a private school for whites who did not want to attend the public schools in Orangeburg. The academy had a total enrollment of 293 students 185 in the elementary school and 108 in the high school.

As these changes in the education of the Black and white school children here in Orangeburg came about it marked the beginning efforts to integrate the public schools.

The school life at Wilkinson basically remained the same in the instructions activities and the other aspects. In March of 1965 the Wilkinson High Wolverettes won the 4-A State Girls Basketball Championship.

The Orangeburg Massacre happened on Feb. 8 1968. Delano Middleton a 17-year-old Wilkinson High School student was killed along with two college students Samuel Hammond and Henry Smith near the campus of South Carolina State College.

The loss of Middleton was devastating to his Wilkinson classmates as well as the community state and nation. In that same year the Wilkinson High School girls basketball team won their fourth straight state championship.

On March 1 1970 The T&D printed the article “Wilkinson Girls Win Sixth Straight AAAA Title — The Wilkinson Wolverettes concluded their victory march and took their sixth consecutive AAAA state title against the Sims Tigerettes out of Union 67-41 Saturday night at South Carolina State College Coliseum.”

That win marked the last girls’ basketball championship by Wilkinson High under the coaching of Nathan Perry. The next and last year of the winning girls’ basketball team in 1971 was led by Coach Anthony Jarvis. Unfortunately the girls were ice-cold in their efforts to win the state championship for a seventh and last time in the name of Wilkinson High School. Their efforts were wiped out by the score of 43-27 by the Union Yellow Jackets.

From 1964 until the 1970-1971 school year the efforts by the federal government to desegregate the entire school system continued to push for a completion. Here in Orangeburg more and more black students were attending Orangeburg High School and the other predominately white elementary and middle schools.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Jack Henry Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Vance Sherard: Thank you Alan. Good morning and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me on the call today is David Foss Board Chair and CEO; Mimi Carsley CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson President and COO. After my opening remarks I will turn the call over to Dave for his comments on our business and the industry. After Dave concludes his comments Greg will discuss our recent strategic benchmark survey recent success metrics for multiple solutions our strategic focus on AI plus other key initiatives. Mimi will then provide commentary around the financial results and updated guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website.

Concluding our prepared remarks Dave will add some closing comments. We will then open the lines for Q&A. As a reminder this call includes certain forward-looking statements including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations events objectives strategies trends or results. Like any statement about the future these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements.

On this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday’s press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave.

David Foss: Thank you Vance. Good morning everyone. I’d like to begin today’s call by remembering Jack Henry Board member Laura Kelly who passed away unexpectedly on March 15. Laura served on our Board for over a decade and was a cherished colleague and friend to all who had the privilege of working with her. With over 30 years of experience in senior leadership roles she brought invaluable insights wisdom and financial expertise to our organization. Beyond her remarkable professional achievements Laura was known for her kindness generosity and unwavering dedication to making a positive impact. Our thoughts and deepest condolences go out to John and Jake and the rest of Laura’s family during this incredibly difficult time.

Let’s now transition to our quarterly results. We’re very pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue growth and overall business performance. As always I’d like to thank our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024 total revenue increased by 6% for the quarter and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Operating income increased 3% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the segments. We again had a strong quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue was up by 7% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed very well posting a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

We also had a solid quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I highlighted in the press release this was our best third quarter ever for sales bookings. During the quarter we inked 11 competitive core takeaways with one of them being a multibillion-dollar institution. For the year we’ve now signed six multibillion-dollar institutions topping last year’s full-year total of five. Additionally we signed seven deals to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. We are seeing strong interest in our new Financial Crimes Defender solution with 11 new contracts in Q3. Additionally we signed 45 new contracts for our new Financial Crimes Defender fraud module for the Zelle FedNow and RTP payments networks that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect fraud and money laundering in real time.

We continue to see success with our card processing solution signing 14 new card processing clients this quarter. Our Banno digital banking platform remains very popular with 69 new signings in Q3 including 37 contracts for Banno business. We now have over 11.6 million users live on Banno and we’re continuing to add approximately 200000 users per month. Even with our strong sales success in Q3 we continued to replenish our sales pipeline and keep it near an all-time high. As we look towards the end of our fiscal year we remain very optimistic about the industry the demand for our solutions our ability to deliver outstanding service and our long-term prospects for success. With that I’ll turn it over to Greg for more detail on our solutions and businesses.

Gregory Adelson: Thank you Dave. As some of you have seen we recently released the 2024 results from our Annual Strategy Benchmark survey. This survey offers insight into concerns opportunities and technology priorities from bank and credit union CEOs. The survey indicated that 80% of bank and credit union CEOs plan to increase technology spending over the next two years. Of those the largest segment 35% plan to increase investments between 6% and 10%. We also inquired where they plan to invest over the next two years. The top four areas for planned investment were fraud detection digital banking data analytics and automation all areas where Jack Henry has been investing and executing with innovative solutions through our technology modernization strategy.

As previously announced we recently launched our cloud-native AI-powered Financial Crimes Defender fraud detection platform. We now have 16 clients live and another 175 clients in the implementation queue. In addition we announced in March the Financial Crimes Defender was named the best fraud prevention platform by fintech breakthrough an independent market intelligent organization. Dave mentioned earlier that we have more than 11.6 million registered users on our cloud-native Banno digital banking platform. We continue to see strong interest in our recently launched Banno business solution that provides a modern banking experience for small and medium-sized businesses. As of March 31st we had 124 clients live and about 70 additional clients in various stages of implementation.

In terms of data analytics we continue to make progress on our data broker and executive dashboard solutions. Both are part of the cloud-native API first Jack Henry platform. Data broker which is currently in beta will eventually provide access to all of a client’s Jack Henry data in a single repository with innovative AI intelligence capabilities. To complement the data broker solution we are developing an executive dashboard with real-time event monitoring to help executives at our financial institutions make informed dynamic decisions throughout the day based on metrics they customize. Related to automation technology one new Jack Henry platform offering we haven’t spoken much about yet is our cloud-native online deposit and loan account opening solution.

This integrated solution will provide a seamless digital account opening experience for our clients that enables them to streamline processes automate workflows and better serve both retail and commercial loan clients. We plan to begin the beta phase with clients in early calendar year 2025. The survey also found that 96% of our clients plan to add payment services over the next two years. We continue to offer a full range of payment solutions in our pay center application as well as other areas of our payment groups. As of March 31st we had 312 clients using Zelle 275 clients using RTP the real-time payments network which represents 48% of the live RTP clients and 190 clients using FedNow representing 29% of the live FedNow clients. One final point on the survey findings.

They were consistent with what we heard from our clients at our Annual Strategic Initiative Symposium in late April. While financial institutions are concerned about the increasing cost of deposits and impact to interest margins there is a general feeling of optimism and less concerned about an economic slowdown this year versus what we heard a year ago. One topic we spent a lot of time discussing that the strategic initiative Symposium is artificial intelligence. We presented in detail Jack Henry’s framework for building the necessary guardrails education training use of acceptable tools et cetera. We continue to actively identify opportunities to leverage AI aiming to enhance client solutions and optimize internal process and work streams.

Incorporating AI into select client solutions like financial crimes defender data broker executive dashboard and Banno conversations is part of that strategy. We are approaching AI deployment thoughtfully ensuring it benefits our clients and associates and aligns with our commitment to data privacy protection and security. Our strategy ensures we are responsibly bold and balanced. It’s been about 18 months since our corporate rebranding initiative to retire the Symitar ProfitStars and Jack Henry banking brands as we now simply go-to-market as Jack Henry. As we said at that time uniting the brands reflects Jack Henry’s role as a well-rounded financial technology provider and enables us to speak from a single consistent brand voice one Jack Henry.

We recently received results from an independent brand study that showed that Jack Henry’s brand equity has increased by nine points in just 18 months. We specifically saw significant improvement with large regional financial institutions and millennials. This is important as we continue to execute on our strategy to provide innovative technology solutions to larger financial institutions beyond what we already provide today through both our payment and complementary groups. And millennials are a critical audience because they are taking on larger leadership roles at these financial institutions and having more influence and technology buyer decisions. Speaking of brand equity hopefully you all have seen the new corporate sustainability report that we published on March 29th.

We believe the 2024 report is an excellent representation of the key initiatives and accomplishments we’ve been working on over the past year. This year’s report details how we are we’re supporting local communities with a focus on financial wellness through both our investments and innovative technology in a variety of philanthropic efforts. We also continue to further our commitment to valuing people with disabilities with the launch of a new associate-led business innovation group focused on awareness of visible and invisible disabilities. The report also highlights some of the public Best Places to Work recognition we received from organizations like Newsweek Computer World and USA Today. As part of our planned organizational changes we recently announced the promotion of Shannon McLaughlin who is currently President of Jack Henry Credit Union Solutions to Chief Operating Officer effective July 1st.

Shannon has been with Jack Henry for nine years but has close to 30 years working with both banks and credit unions and senior technology and operational roles. Shannon is a strategic visionary leader who has significantly contributed to our company’s overall success and we’ll continue to do so as the next Chief Operating Officer. I want to close by recognizing Dave for the exceptional job he has done as CEO over the past eight years. Under Dave’s leadership Jack Henry has experienced outstanding growth both organically and through strategic acquisitions. I also want to thank Dave for his mentorship and guidance. He has prepared me well as I step into the CEO role on July 1st and I’m honored to continue leading our company with an unwavering focus on our associates clients and shareholders.

With that I will turn it over to Mimi for more details on the numbers.

Mimi Carsley: Thank you Greg and good morning. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I’ll start with the details driving our third quarter and year-to-date results then conclude with our full-year guidance update. Q3 GAAP revenue increased 6% and non-GAAP revenue increased 7% a continuation of consistently solid performance and keeping us on track for a strong fiscal 2024. Year-to-date growth was 7% on a GAAP basis and stronger on non-GAAP at 8%. Deconversion revenue of approximately $800000 which we pre-released last week was down approximately $5.3 million reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation of our clients.

Year-to-date deconversion revenue is $9.9 million $7.2 million less than the prior period. Now let’s look more closely at the details. GAAP services and support revenue increased 4% while non-GAAP increased a more robust 6%. Year-to-date the increase was 6% for GAAP and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Service and support growth during the quarter was the result of increases in data processing and hosting revenues. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings which again increased 10% in the quarter and for the year-to-date. This reoccurring revenue contributor is 32% of our total revenue and has long been a key to double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue which is 43% of total revenue and another key component of our long-term growth model.

We saw positive performance with 8% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and year-to-date delivered 9% for both. Consistent with recent results drivers include positive demand for our digital solutions card processing other payment processing and other processing revenues. In closing out revenue commentary I would like to highlight total recurring revenue exceeded 91%. Next moving to expenses. Beginning with cost of revenue which increased 7% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and 7% for GAAP versus 6% for non-GAAP year-to-date. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs consistent with increases in related revenue higher personnel costs and increased internal license and fees. Next R&D increased 4% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter.

The increase is primarily due to cloud consumption costs net of capitalization. For the year-to-date R&D increased 4% on a GAAP basis and 3% for non-GAAP. And lastly on a GAAP basis SG&A rose 7% for the quarter and 8% on a non-GAAP basis primarily due to higher personnel costs. Year-to-date SG&A expense increased 23% on a GAAP basis and 9% on a non-GAAP basis. The primary GAAP differences are the $16.4 million in onetime related costs related to the voluntary early departure incentive program. [indiscernible] in Q1 and prior period $7.4 million gain on asset sales. For non-GAAP the difference is primarily due to the higher personnel costs and absence of gain on sale of assets. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion and the quarter results delivered 30 basis points of increased non-GAAP margin which was 20.8%.

Non-GAAP margin benefited from focused process improvements and disciplined management of our workforce while retaining key talent. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.19 up 7%. Separating results into the 3 operating segments we’re pleased to see across the board positive performance. Our core segment revenue increased 8% for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis with non-GAAP operating margins increasing 216 basis points. We continue to benefit from private cloud trends and strong cost control. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth was 8% and the associated margin increased 124 basis points. Payments segment revenue increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. The segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 121 basis points.

This was due to continuing growth in our EPS business and moderate card growth consistent with U.S. consumer spending trends and a slightly tough comp combined with the focused cost management. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth matched the quarter at 6% with 103 basis points of margin expansion. And finally complementary segment non-GAAP revenue increased 8% with 33 basis points of margin expansion. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue also increased 8% with 28 basis points of margin expansion. Growth year-to-date reflects digital solution demand and beneficial overall product mix. Segment quarterly margins were impacted by moderate headwinds from direct support costs and license and fees. Let’s now turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation.

Year-to-date operating cash flow was $336 million $129 million increase over prior period. Excluding proceeds from the sale of assets free cash flow was $172 million significantly more than the $54 million last year. Our base case entering the year included an elevated level of cash tax payments based on the Section 174 impact. Based on legislative clarity and internal efforts we were able to meaningfully lessen the impact. The net result was lower cash taxes equating to an approximately $29 million overpayment last fiscal year as well as improved cash tax outlook this fiscal year. Our consistent dedication to share value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 19%. Additionally I would highlight other notable return on capital metrics for the year-to-date period including $20 million in share repurchase offsetting annual dilution $25 million in debt reduction and $116 million in dividends.

With three quarters of the year complete we’re nearing the conclusion of our fiscal year and therefore I’ll conclude with guidance changes. As you’re aware yesterday’s press release included updated fiscal 2024 full-year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to non-GAAP metrics. As a reminder we filed an 8-K on August 3rd that described how starting in the current fiscal year we’re using a revised approach for deconversion guidance. While we reported third quarter deconversion revenue of approximately $800000 we are reiterating our full year deconversion guidance of $16 million. We are reiterating both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth and expect non-GAAP growth to potentially have a bias towards the lower end of our 7.4% to 8.0% growth range.

Due to the continued positive operational results and a focus on cost management we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 45 to 50 basis points compared to the 35 to 40 basis points previously provided. The full-year tax rate estimate remains at 23.5%. Incorporating the noted positive update full-year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upward to $5.15 to $5.19 per share from the previous guidance of $5.09 to $5.13 per share. As a reminder the guidance or deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue VEDIP severance-related costs and nonrecurring gain on asset sales results in approximate $0.37 headwind for GAAP EPS for fiscal 2024. Due to the better than initially anticipated cash tax payments improved margins and contributions from favorable net interest our full year guidance for free cash flow conversion has increased to 70% to 75% from the previous commentary of 60%.

In conclusion Q3 results reflected continued momentum of the strong execution we’ve seen thus far this year and we expect a solid finish for the remainder of the fiscal year. We remain exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovative and in-demand solutions the resilience of our clients and our focus on execution and shareholder value creation. We appreciate the contributions of our diligent and dedicated associates that drove these strong results in Jack Henry investors for their continued confidence. Before I turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks. While I haven’t had the pleasure of working with Dave as long as others I cherished our time together. I want to thank Dave for giving me the opportunity to work for this amazing company for being so incredibly generous with his wisdom and support for so many small and meaningful pieces of guidance over the past two years.

He is a role model of service leadership and doing the right thing. We are fortunate to have him lead the Jack Henry Board and I look forward to this continued journey together. Dave?

David Foss: Well thank you Mimi. As you are all undoubtedly aware this marks my final earnings call as CEO before my transition to Executive Board Chair on July 1st. Reflecting on my career at Jack Henry this has been an incredibly humbling journey for me both personally and professionally. And I’m beyond grateful to have had the opportunity to lead this great company for the past eight years. As we move forward I have the utmost confidence in Greg and the rest of our exceptional team to sustain our reputation for great technology and service as well as our strong financial performance. I’ve cherished the opportunity to get to know all of you over the years and appreciate your insightful questions and thorough analysis.

I thank our investors for their trust in Jack Henry and our clients for allowing us to serve their needs. And lastly I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to our associates. It is their dedication and unwavering commitment to supporting our clients and each other that drives our success and makes this company special. With that we’ll open up the floor for questions. Alan if you would please open the line.

Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.

Kartik Mehta: Well Dave it’s been good talking to all these calls. We’ll miss speaking with you in the future at least on the calls anyways.

David Foss: Thank you Kartik.

Kartik Mehta: Dave I wanted to get your perspective on maybe just the backlog. I know Mimi you said as you’re expecting maybe the lower end of the non-GAAP revenue for fiscal ’24 and maybe backlog is a wrong word to use. But just your perspective on based on what the sales pipeline looks like and how good you feel about as we move forward the ability to predict revenue and maybe why the lower end of the guidance.

David Foss: So I’ll give you my perspective and then I’ll ask Mimi to comment. So first off I mentioned in the release and in my comments that this was a — the best sales quarter we’ve ever — best third quarter sales quarter we’ve ever had. And I also highlighted the fact that the sales pipeline has been replenished almost to that same record level that it was at last quarter. So as I see what’s going on in the sales pipeline but even more importantly as I see what’s happening here in the quarter that we’re in right now which of course we’re not here to announce I feel really bullish about the future opportunity as far as sales at Jack Henry and our ability to continue to deliver. So that’s a sales perspective. I’ll ask Mimi to go — oh did you want to say something.

Gregory Adelson: Well let me just add this. So I think the other thing is that we’ve had unbelievable sales success this year. But as we’ve highlighted many times the deals that we’re selling this year for the most part don’t actually become revenue opportunities until future years and future quarters. So I think part of this is yes there are some things that are in an implementation queue and we’re working through all those as we always do. But there isn’t really anything that is signaling anything other than hopefully future success based on what we’ve seen. So I just want to make sure that you understand that all of the sales success we’re seeing right now will be in future quarters.

Mimi Carsley: Yes. The only thing I would add Kartik is that we feel really good about all three operating segments revenue. The total revenue is still very much in line with our long-term algorithm and what we thought about at the beginning of the year. There is a part of our business that does relate to economic factors in U.S. [indiscernible] that’s the card business. So I think as we look out for the year we feel really confident about our ability to hit that range.

Kartik Mehta: Perfect. And then Greg just you talked about AI and maybe the opportunities in there. But I’m wondering for Jack Henry is there an opportunity for you to use it internally and could that lower cost? And if so is there an upfront cost that you’re dealing with in an effort to implement that?

Gregory Adelson: Yes it’s a great question Kartik. So the short answer is we are spending a lot of time on internal operational efficiency opportunities throughout our entire organization. In fact we most recently had a corporate leadership team meeting where each of the individual business units and nonoperating business units all presented their ideas for utilization of AI and specifically generative AI. And so we’re going through prioritization. We’ve done a really good job of spending time making sure that we’re focused on building the efficiencies first. Getting the learnings and all the other stuff. We’ve just approved a couple of utilizations for the Microsoft copilot for internal use and the GitHub codeveloper stuff for the developers — or copilot sorry.

And we’re actually in the process of going through all of those things and looking for ways that we can continue to build efficiency and effectiveness first as we’re actually doing some other things within some of our products that I announced as well.

Mimi Carsley: The only thing I would add on there as Greg said responsibly bold and balance is our approach and that covers both the usage as well as the investment. And so we’re using the internal existing policies and processes to prioritize to develop business cases to think about the benefits not — this isn’t just a curiosity. There has to be business cases. And so all of that will still sit within our planned budget and R&D and internal expense policies.

Kartik Mehta: Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Schmidt of Citi. Please go ahead.

Andrew Schmidt: Hi Dave Greg Mimi. Thanks for taking my questions. And Dave congrats again on the transition.

David Foss: Thank you.

Andrew Schmidt: Want to start on the margin front. Good performance here. Mimi maybe you could put a finer point on this. I know that there were some — you mentioned some operational efficiencies that drove this maybe some mix factors as well. But maybe a finer point on that. And then as we think about the go-forward margin trajectory it seems like you’re above this year kind of what you’ve outlined for the longer term. So how does this — this year’s margin performance kind of inform the view on the longer-term margin progression? Thanks a lot.

Mimi Carsley: You’re welcome. So Andrew I would say for this year it came down to strong execution operational focus it’s a bit of product mix as well but we’re being very diligent around headcount around spending for the year. There’s also some timing around products and how that amortization impacts us as well which is also something that we’re just going to be thoughtful about for next year. It’s really early still in our budget planning. Our teams are getting together and thinking about the prioritization I would say at this point still thinking about that long-term range we’ve given versus an elevated state but we’re always trying to deliver shareholder value. And so that’s going to always be a focus for us.

Andrew Schmidt: Perfect. And then maybe just digging into the average contract size of recent cohorts. I know the attach rates have gone up over the past few years but maybe you can put just a finer point in terms of what you’re seeing in terms of just a complementary product adoption and just average contract sizes perhaps recent periods versus maybe a year or two years ago. Thank you very much.

David Foss: Andrew it’s Dave. So one of the challenges in this whenever we have a conversation like this is there is no such thing as average when it comes to our contracts. You’re correct. The attach rates tend to be high with our core clients. But remember we sell a lot of solutions that are outside the core base and the variety of solutions that we sell roughly 300 different solutions. They range from very small ticket price to very large ticket price. Most of the solutions — almost everything we sell today is hosted. So it’s rare for us to sell a licensed version of a solution. Well then in the hosted contract or are they going to be hosted for three years or 10 years or so they’re trying to talk about average is pretty challenging.

The best indicator because we have used the same measurement approach for sales quota attainment for many years now the best measure is the fact that as I just mentioned Q3 was the best Q3 we’ve ever had. That’s the most significant indicator of sales success is the fact that — we’ve used the same way of measuring contracts for many years. And so it’s a good relative performance indicator for our sales organization. and sales overall are up. So I know it’s frustrating to not be able to talk about averages but it’s just really not a practical thing to try and do in our world.

Andrew Schmidt: No it makes sense yes. A lot of different shapes and sizes that they’re [indiscernible]. Congrats again Dave. Thank you very much.

Gregory Adelson: Thank you.

David Foss: Thank you.

Operator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Darrin Peller: Thanks. And Dave I want to — also my congrats as well. [indiscernible] so always appreciate the help. Guys maybe just start off on a free cash discussion. If we could just revisit it obviously has gone through its periods of strength above 80% and below 60%. Now you’re saying back to 70%-plus. Maybe just give us a sense a little more on what the driving factors are and the sustainability of it now and — maybe just help us understand if we’re back to 80% going forward in the next couple of years?

Mimi Carsley: Darrin it has been a bit of a roller coaster ride. And in part that was due to the lack of clarity from a legislative front. As we said on last quarter’s call we were hopeful the progress on Congress addressing the Section 174 R&D-related impact on cash taxes would go through — we were optimistic but not betting on that. But even in the absence of that the clarity that the treasury to IRS our outside consultants our incredible tax team here Jack Henry have had has really helped us from being able to discover savings from a cash tax perspective that impacted effectively last year a benefit so that would mean less cash tax paid this year. And so even if that legislation does not get fully addressed I think we’re in an improved position versus where we thought earlier in the year.

We’re still hopeful that it will be addressed. But that’s the biggest driver that represents over $29 million in last year’s impact alone let alone some additional for this year. So that’s a biggest impact for the free cash flow. And I think that’s a sustainable for the Dave board.

Darrin Peller: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thanks. Greg maybe just on your side if you just talk about what you’re seeing in the market more specifically around demand for core commercial use order. Obviously the cloud discussion we’ve had for some time now. Again just inflections you’re seeing for specific products or offerings or maybe vice versa anything that’s weaker? Any more color would be great. Thanks.

Gregory Adelson: Yes sure. So I think a couple of things as part of our survey and even just obviously with our regular conferences and conversations with our clients deposit growth continues to be a big driver. Operational efficiency continues to be. And that’s why we really highlighted some of those key products that we’re already focused on and fraud being a big one things that we’re already focused on and driving out in the market set and we’re continuing to see some nice pickup in all of those. So those continue to be big ones. I think related to the tech modernization and what we’re doing with our modules. We’re continuing to have a lot of success on the execution side of that. We’ll continue to talk more about that in future calls.

But right now we’re really excited about what we’ve done with data broker and executive dashboard. We think those are some products that really are not out there in the space today and we’ll continue to create an opportunity for us to show the advancement of what we’re doing in our cloud native technology and utilization of generative AI as part of that. So all of those will kind of tie in to what the demand has been around deposits fraud opportunities operational efficiency as the three big things.

Darrin Peller: Great. Thanks guys.

Operator: Our next question comes from Vasu Govil of KBW.

Vasundhara Govil: Hi thanks for taking my questions. I guess first quick one for Mimi. I know it’s a little too early to talk about the ’25 outlook but just based on the new sales momentum that you’ve had this year it seems like you’re setting up for stable if not accelerating revenue growth into next year. Any reason to think that may not be the case? And then Mimi if you could also specifically comment on the payment segment trending slightly softer than we would have thought just how it performed relative to internal expectations and what you’re expecting for the go-forward trend line there?

Mimi Carsley: So Vasu I wish I could tell you with more precision the next year targets but it’s just a little too early. We’re still during the budget process. But there’s no reason to have any other expectation than grow the algorithm at a high level. There are some things that present challenges each year from a grow-over perspective that even though we’re having tremendous success with the sales pipeline there’s lower convert merge that impacted this year. You just never know from a grow-over perspective. But I think the growth algorithm is a pretty good framework to think about for next year. As it relates to this year and the payments question I would say that that really — to categorize it we saw slower transaction growth broadly slower growth in debit."

The two are twin brothers and Andrew once held an offer from Tennessee. Andrew is now playing football at South Dakota.

So when Andre Jacobs committed to Ole Miss on Sunday afternoon we got to scrambling trying to find out exactly who he was. Thankfully he answered our phone call.

Andre Jacobs won't get to Ole Miss until January of 2023. He just finished up class work at St. Frances Academy in Baltimore Md. He will arrive as a preferred walk-on. He will spend the fall honing his body and preparing for what lies ahead at Ole Miss.

""I haven't got everything figured out yet but I know whatever I'm going to do will be preparing me to go down there and work"" said Jacobs. ""I haven't really figured that out. I've gt to talk to my parents about that but I would love to be able to just workout and be get ready for this sick opportunity ahead of me.""

Jacobs was on campus over the weekend making the trip down to Oxford with Ole Miss target Neeo Avery whom he describes as his brother. Avery announced his commitment to the rebels about two hours prior to Jacobs.

""That's my guy right there"" Jacobs said of Avery. ""We've been locked in since we were eight years old.""

Jacobs came to camp for the Ole Miss staff on Saturday and he caught the attention of the Rebel coaching staff.

""I can bring a lot to the program"" Jacobs said. ""I'm a dude that can play inside and outside. I went down there worked out and pretty much showed them that I'm a route runner. I'm going to bring a lot to the table because I'm a guy that's going to work. I'm going to put my head down and work. I know coming as a PWO is not going to be easy but I'm going to come in and work. And they know that I'm going to come in and work. That's why they wanted to bring me on. They know that they're getting a hardworking guy.""

Jacobs gave wide receivers coach Derrick Nix the credit for recruiting him.

""I was just going down for the camp honestly. Coach Nix really liked me at the camp. He said I performed well I was a really polished route runner and they were like 'If you can do it we want you.' I told them alright"" said Jacobs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rdnVlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2gvc2NpZW5jZS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9qYWNvYnMtd2VsbC13YXRlci1zdG9wcy1mbG93aW5nLWRyb3VnaHQvMjY5LTczZWVmNTVhLTY2Y2YtNDc4My04OGJkLWU2YmU3MDU5YWVjYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Water flow stops at Jacob's Well due to drought increased groundwater pumping,"This is only the fourth time in recorded history that the water has stopped flowing at the swimming hole near Wimberley.

HAYS COUNTY Texas — Jacob's Well is one of the state's most popular swimming holes known for its cool springs and underwater cave. But the ongoing drought conditions in Central Texas have halted the Wimberley-area hot spot's water flow.

The Facebook page for Jacob's Well posted an update on Wednesday saying that the U.S. Geologic Survey measured a zero cfs discharge from the swimming hole in recent days. That means that Jacob's Well has officially ceased flowing for only the fourth time in recorded history.

The post said the situation is cause for concern and is the result of both the ongoing drought and increased levels of groundwater pumping.

""This is the worst I have ever seen it. I have lived here 34 years and I have never seen this condition in such a short period of time"" said Wimberley Valley Watershed Association Executive Director David Baker.

Water from Jacob's Well flows into Canyon Creek. Baker said when it comes to the environment Canyon Creek is very important for wildlife in the area and he said they are seeing the impacts.

""Those aquatic species that depend on that water have either perished or migrated downstream to pools that are there it means lower dissolved oxygen where there is water"" Baker said.

Swimming at Jacob's Well remains canceled for the foreseeable future but the park is still opening for hiking and viewing the spring.

(AP) — Las Vegas Raiders running back Josh Jacobs acknowledges this is a big year for him.

Big as in when the team didn’t exercise Jacobs’ fifth-year option it meant 2022 would be an audition.

Taken 24th overall in 2019 Jacobs leads all rushers drafted since then with 3087 yards. He’s also caught 107 passes for 752 yards.

.@Raiders RB Josh Jacobs was asked whether he’s concerned that his 5th-year option wasn’t picked up: “I really don’t think too much about it honestly. I’m a firm believer in the work that you put in is going to pay off for itself.” This is a contract year for Jacobs. pic.twitter.com/lYTyY4Bznn — Ryan Sakamoto (@BEASTwriter) July 23 2022

By exercising its option on Jacobs’ contract Las Vegas would have committed to paying him about $8 million in 2023. Instead the 24-year-old carries a base salary of roughly $2.1 million into this season.

But rather than dwell on it Jacobs used the situation to fuel him as he learns a new system under first-year coach Josh McDaniels and gels with what’s become an expanded running backs room with the addition of several others.

Unseen during OTAs and mandatory minicamp last month Jacobs said he didn’t have anything “too crazy” going on in terms of injuries and “was just getting my body right” in time for training camp.

“I’m a firm believer in the work that you put in is gonna pay off for itself” Jacobs said. “And I had to be here either way. And this is where I want to be.”

Another fellow Alabama alum was complimentary Thursday as seventh-year running back Kenyan Drake said it’s Jacobs’ love for the game that ignited his spark during the offseason.

“He’s gonna challenge the energy of everything around him to continue to elevate his game personally” Drake said. “I know he’s somebody that likes to have a lot of people around him that believe in him and at the end of the day we believe in him.”

One week into camp Jacobs is enjoying what might arguably be the best training camp of his career with his first step and speed looking explosive and his attitude exactly what the team needs during its transition under McDaniels.

“You can see him he’s taken a lot of reps in there and trying to work as a lot of guys are is work themselves into ultimately playing condition” McDaniels said. “Josh got himself ready to go. He rehabbed hard in the offseason and got ready to participate in the beginning of camp. He did a great job of that and he was in condition when we reported like the rest of our team was and continued to grind away through the basics.”

Jacobs said the preparation for this season started when the team announced it would not retain interim coach Rich Bisaccia who took over for Jon Gruden midseason last year. Accepting the fact he’d need to learn a new offensive system with different schemes under a third head coach in four years allowed him to prepare mentally and physically.

And that was before the team declined to pick up that fifth-year option.

Jacobs said he stayed off social media and got in the gym to quietly start working on areas of his body that would help him perform at a higher level. Once McDaniels was hired away from the Patriots where he served as offensive coordinator and he had his staff in place Jacobs’ excitement grew.

“These group of guys when you see the way they think and the reason why they do certain things it’s just amazing to me; I’m just trying to follow their lead right now” Jacobs said. “It’s obviously a great offense it’s a great group of guys. I mean we are still learning this scheme and everything right now. So I’m still trying to figure out the ins and outs of everything. But man I’ve been happy with my progression. Hopefully I keep stacking days and it translates.”

Though he admitted there was a feeling of added pressure entering camp he said he has welcomed the added competition in the running back room with six backs vying for spots on the final 53-man roster.

“I mean it’s fun man” Jacobs said. “I’m a firm believer of having a group of guys that’s ready to compete. I believe that iron sharpens iron.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzMwL2phY29iLWRlZ3JvbXMtcmV0dXJuLXRvLW1ldHMtcm90YXRpb24tY29taW5nLWludG8tZm9jdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacob deGrom's return to Mets' rotation coming into focus,"MIAMI — Jacob deGrom remains on track to pitch for the Mets in the coming days but Buck Showalter still hasn’t officially placed the right-hander into the rotation. DeGrom was back with the Mets two days after throwing 67 pitches in a rehab start for Triple-A Syracuse.

Before the Mets’ 6-4 win over the Marlins on Friday night Showalter revealed that deGrom experienced leg cramps in his last outing and that may have contributed to the two home runs he allowed and decreased velocity.

If deGrom stays on normal rest he would pitch Monday in Washington. The Mets ace hasn’t appeared in a regular-season game since July 7 2021.

Showalter said he is hopeful reliever Trevor May will rejoin the Mets on Wednesday a day ahead of catcher James McCann’s probable return. Both players are on minor league rehab assignments.

David Peterson was optioned to Triple-A as the Mets recalled relievers Sam Clay and Stephen Nogosek. The bullpen additions came a day after Drew Smith was placed on the injured list with a right lat strain.

“[Smith] will be back” Showalter said. “I know the time periods they are giving us and it’s a pretty wide range so I know it’s more than two weeks.”

Dominic Smith who is recovering from a sprained right ankle might begin a minor league rehab assignment during this road trip according to Showalter."

Johnson found that out in heartbreaking fashion on Wednesday in the Class 4A state championship match at Duluth High School.

The Knights fell 2-0 to Westminster in a rematch of the 2023 title match snapping several impressive streaks in the process. They had their 14 straight postseason game win streak going back to 2021 snapped; saw their 15 match win streak in 2024 come to end; and had their state title run end at two as they were looking to defend their Class 4A state title.

“It’s soccer. You win some you lose some” Johnson coach Frank Zamora said in a rainy interview afterwards. “This is still a young group. They now see what it’s like to lose at this stage and I'm sure they’ll learn from this and come back stronger and motivated next year.”

The Wildcats (17-4-2) dominated much of the first half against the defending champions. They produced a solid scoring chance just two minutes in and Benjamin Villatoro was forced to make a diving save on another shot in the 9th minute.

The Knights' usually consistent ball-control offense sputtered for the first 19 minutes with six midfield turnovers. As a result the Wildcats were able to generate 7 shots many within 20 yards.

Johnson’s 6th turnover would contribute mightily. The Wildcats would take advantage as Will Stewart found himself alone on the left side for a 10-yard blast. Villatoro was able to make a diving save but that left Aditya Kaul wide open for an easy goal on the rebound for a 1-0 lead with 21:16 left in the first half.

The Knights (18-2-1) would get a huge break two minutes later however as Westminsters’s Tristen Lewis received a red card when he upended Vazquez who was on a breakaway just outside of the box.

Johnson turned that into their first two shots of the game moments later but Andres Galacia’s blast from 20-yards sailed wide left.

From there the Johnson offense awakened. They created three corners and outshot the Wildcats 4-1 over the final 20 minutes. But it would still go to the half 1-0 Westminster despite two huge opportunities for the Knights in the final two minutes..

A 15-yard blast by Vazquez after a beautiful long ball into the box sailed just over the crossbar in the 38th minute. Another Galacia shot from 22-yards out sailed just wide of the left crossbar in the final 30 seconds.

Westminster outshot the Knights 9-4 in the opening 40 minutes but generated just one shot after the red card to Lewis.

Johnson took the man-advantage into the second half but it was quickly erased on a questionable call against Jalil Chavez who got a red card of his own in the 42nd minute.

With the match back to even strength the Knights were able to generate a 6-2 shot advantage midway into the second half. But they could not cash in for the equalizer.

The Wildcats added a huge insurance goal with 14 minutes left to essentially seal it on a header from Alex Na off a corner in the 66th minute.

“Westminster came out with a lot of intensity and we did not match it” Zamora said. “We definitely picked it up when we had the man advantage but we missed some really good opportunities that would have changed the momentum. Then we got the red card and changed the momentum back a little bit.

“We had chances. We just couldn’t finish and find the net. But I think there were a lot of people that did not think we could get back to this point and the younger guys showed that they can play. I’m very proud of the season they had.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9lbWlseS1tYXluYXJkLWpvaG5zb24tc2hhcmVzLWFkb3JhYmxlLXBob3RvLW9mLWhlci1zb25zLWdpYnNvbi1hbmQtam9uZXMtODY0NDA2MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Emily Maynard Johnson Shares Adorable Photo of Sons Gibson and Jones Wearing Matching Pink Messi Jerseys,"Emily Maynard Johnson's sons are proving they're Leo Messi's most adorable fans.

The former prime minister was initially told by polling station staff he would not be allowed to vote in the police and crime commissioner election in South Oxfordshire without proving his identity.

The misstep was embarrassing for Johnson because the requirement to bring photo ID is a stipulation of the Elections Act he introduced in 2022 while in Downing Street.

The Electoral Commission has warned that hundreds of thousands of people could be excluded from voting because of the law which it said could have a disproportionate effect on some groups.

A source close to Johnson confirmed he had forgotten the photo ID but did later vote. “Mr Johnson voted Conservative” a spokesperson added. Earlier on Thursday he had posted on X: “The polls are now open. Vote Conservative!”

It came after the veterans minister apologised to former military personnel who were prevented from using their veterans ID to vote in the local elections in England.

Downing Street said it would “look into” changing the controversial rules which require photo ID in order to vote to allow veterans’ ID cards on to the list of valid identification.

The minister Johnny Mercer was responding to a complaint from a veteran who said he had been turned away at a polling station. “I am sorry about this. The legislation on acceptable forms of ID came out before the veterans ID cards started coming out in January this year. I will do all I can to change it before the next one” Mercer tweeted.

A government spokesperson said it was the intention to add the veterans’ card to the list of accepted ID and that defence identity cards for serving armed forces members were already accepted. “We are already consulting on this” they said.

Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson said earlier that Downing Street had no concerns about voter ID more generally adding: “We don’t want to see anyone turned away from polling stations we want everyone to be able to vote. Experience from the last local elections was that 99.75% of people were able to cast their vote successfully.”

Ministers have faced significant criticism over the limited number of acceptable forms of ID particularly the decision to allow documents such as the older person’s bus pass but almost none issued to younger ones such as other travel passes and student documents.

The Electoral Commission warned last year that it was difficult to assess the consequences of requiring photo ID before voting.

Among people who did not vote in May last year 4% said this was because of voter ID. If this figure went up to 5% it could mean about 800000 people staying away from the polls at a general election.

A Tory MP was among those caught out by the voter ID requirement as polls opened for the local elections in England and Wales. The Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said his dyspraxia was the reason he had lost his documents.

Hunt sent a message to his local Conservative WhatsApp group stating: “Bit of drama. Turns out I have no appropriate ID to vote tomorrow. There is an emergency proxy option if you lose your ID … who would like the honours?”

But Hunt said it was inappropriate for Labour and social media users to mock him for misplacing his documents given his developmental coordination disorder.

“I don’t want to blame everything on my dyspraxia but it’s a factor in my life I have to deal with” he told the Evening Standard. “It’s all well and good people saying we need to have more neurodiverse members of parliament but having a massive pile-on on them I don’t think it’s going to encourage more people.”

The Electoral Commission said “most voters” were able to cast their ballots despite the ID requirements.

“Our initial assessment of the elections is that they were well run and millions of voters were able to exercise their democratic rights” a spokesperson said. “This is a testament to the efforts of electoral administrators who work tirelessly to ensure the smooth delivery and integrity of polls.”"

Right now however it’s a massive construction zone as workers hurry to ready the site for Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinement festivities which start Thursday.

On one side of the property the new football-themed zipline – dubbed the Forward Pass – is being tested. On another workers are finalizing construction of the new Center for Performance a 100000-square-foot domed space where many enshrinement events will be held. At the entrance workers are building a new waterfall feature to greet guests.

It’s been a long time coming for the project’s backers who have had to counter years of skepticism about when – even if – the project would happen.

“Seeing is believing” said Anne Graffice executive vice president public affairs for the Hall of Fame Village. “A lot of folks didn’t believe that something like this could happen here.”

Despite significant progress however major financial questions remain over the Hall of Fame Village which is a separate for-profit enterprise from the nonprofit Pro Football Hall of Fame which opened in Canton in 1963.

Initially projected to be completed in 2018 and then 2020 village leaders now say all major components including a new 180-room hotel and indoor waterpark will be done by late 2023 or early 2024.

But that assumes financing comes together said David Sangree president of Cleveland-based hospitality consulting firm Hotel & Leisure Advisors.

“The plans are very exciting but the money issue is incredibly hard” he said. “There are a lot of these projects that don’t get to the finish line because they can’t come up with the money. Nothing is definite until you get the money released.”

Graffice acknowledged that financing has been exceedingly difficult in part because of the project’s scope but also due to the downturn in the hospitality industry supply chain issues inflation and other factors.

“Pushing that ball uphill hasn’t gotten any easier” she said. “We’ve worked hard to overcome it.”

The village is involved in a legal dispute with Johnson Controls one of the project’s early backers which wants out of a multimillion-dollar sponsorship deal. In addition the village was recently warned by Nasdaq that its shares have been trading too low -- under $1 a share in recent months - and could be delisted if prices don’t increase.

The financial outlook should improve in the coming months however as additional attractions open and the complex starts to generate more revenue Graffice said.

And newly legalized sports betting in the state is expected to generate a substantial and steady source of revenue for the Hall of Fame Village as soon as early 2023.

Project first proposed in 2014

It was back in 2014 when David Baker then the CEO of the Pro Football Hall of Fame first floated the idea of an elaborate $1 billion development around the hall creating what he called the “Disneyland of football” in Canton.

The concept has been pared down considerably since then and delayed by financing issues COVID-19 and other challenges.

Still finally eight years later the complex is coming together.

Many of the attractions that officials had hoped would be ready for this year’s enshrinement events – when the eyes of football fans everywhere will be focused on Canton – won’t be complete until later this year. That includes most of the components of the Fan Engagement Zone with restaurants retail and other entertainment offerings.

And the Ferris wheel – which is being relocated from Cleveland’s I-X Center and renamed the Red Zone – needs to be refurbished and won’t be ready until later this year or early 2023 according to Graffice.

Despite the delayed timeline Canton resident Stephanie Impagliozza who lives across the street from the construction said she’s excited about the progress.

“Just when you think you’ve seen it all you wake up and see two guys ziplining past you” she said the day after she saw workers testing the zipline not far from the home her family has owned for 50 years.

She said she and her neighbors are pleased that the project is finally happening. “They bought houses and then nothing happened” said Impagliozza recalling a pause in construction in 2018 after financing fell through. “It sat for 18 months. That’s when people got a little panicky.”

But she can see the progress with her own eyes now. “I just wish they would take down the black skirting on the fence so we had a better view of what they’re doing” she said.

Here’s what has been done and what’s still to come:

* The Constellation Center for Excellence an office building at the north end of the stadium built to house sports- and health-related businesses was finished last year although much of the space is still vacant. Graffice said several tenant announcements are expected soon.

* The 100000-square-foot Center for Performance to the west of the stadium is nearly complete and will be used for numerous enshrinement events this year. It will also be used for other athletic events concerts and major consumer events like auto shows and home and garden shows. To cut costs the village converted what was originally conceived as a brick and mortar facility to a soft-sided domed-top building saving as much as $25 million according to Graffice.

* The Play Action Plaza area is partially complete with the Forward Pass zipline set to offer rides in the coming days a walking path amphitheater and more. The Ferris wheel will eventually be part of this area as well.

* The area called the Fan Engagement Zone still under construction won’t be ready for enshrinement but will open in phases this fall according to Graffice. This area includes a Don Shula’s restaurant Topgolf Swing Suites Brew Kettle and other sports-themed restaurants and retailers. It’s unclear however if the development includes a previously announced 7000-square-foot Helix eSports entertainment center. The arena has not been included in recent village promotional material and Graffice declined to comment on the status of the venue. A spokesperson for Esports Entertainment Group did not respond to an email seeking information.

Also coming soon: a new 180-room Hilton Tapestry hotel and adjoining 147000-square-foot football-themed indoor waterpark with construction expected to get started in late summer.

Meanwhile several earlier aspects of the development are fully operational including a renovated Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium which is hosting more events including Journey and comedian Dave Chappelle next weekend the O’Jay’s with Gladys Knight and the Black College Hall of Fame Game in September plus USFL games high school football championships and more.

In addition eight youth athletic fields continue to draw tens of thousands of young athletes to town annually along with their parents.

And business is picking up at the recently renovated McKinley Grand Hotel in downtown Canton which the village purchased in 2019.

During an earnings call in May Hall of Fame Village CEO Michael Crawford said he believes the total package of attractions will be a significant regional draw.

“We’re going to have unique experiences that people won’t have the opportunity in their daily lives to experience without traveling to Florida or the West Coast to see Disney or Universal” said Crawford a former long-time Disney executive who was tapped in late 2018 to see the Canton project through to completion.

Financial challenges

Total cost of the first two phases – including the stadium youth fields Center for Excellence Center for Performance the Fan Engagement Zone Play Action Plaza hotels and waterpark -- is $600 million.

In an interview in 2021 Graffice said that the project would include at least $60 million in public money. More recently she acknowledged that the public-dollar figure had increased although she declined to say by how much.

Canton City Council recently approved a $5 million loan for the village which also received $33.4 million in public-private financing from a program that promotes clean-energy investment. The village is also seeking $5 million from Stark County and is vying for $16 million from the Ohio Department of Development’s Transformational Mixed-Use Development Program.

The NFL’s contribution to the project has been minimal. The league pledged $10 million to the village in 2019 although Graffice said the payment has yet to be made.

Meanwhile the village last month secured a $10.5 million loan from CH Capital Lending a company tied to Stuart Lichter president of Industrial Realty Group and a director on the Hall of Fame Resort board. Lichter and his affiliated companies make up the Hall of Fame Village’s largest shareholders holding more than half of the company’s stock.

Graffice described the CH Capital loan which expires in mid-September and carries a 12% interest rate as a bridge loan that allowed construction to continue. “Priority one is to make sure we do not stop construction” said Graffice.

Meanwhile one of the project’s chief sponsors Johnson Controls is trying to back out of a naming-rights agreement with the village which is worth $99 million through 2034. The dispute is in arbitration.

The Nasdaq too in May put the village on notice – get your stock price above $1 per share or face the possibility of being delisted. The company share price has improved in recent weeks closing on Friday at $0.86 per share.

In better financial news the village is poised to receive one of up to 48 licenses for casino-style sports-betting in Ohio recently legalized by state lawmakers. The Hall of Fame Village is the only applicant for the single license permitted in Stark County under an allocation system based on population.

The village which lobbied heavily for the legalization of sports gambling could see revenue from betting as soon as early 2023.

A recent analyst report from the Maxim Group a New York City-based investment bank lists the village as a good investment noting the promise of sports betting and ongoing construction progress. “We remain bullish for the longer term” reads the report. “Near-term externalities (mainly COVID and supply chain issues) have in our view delayed the full impact of the [Hall of Fame Village] story with investors…”

Graffice too is confident the project will continue to move forward. For proof she only needs to look outside her office located inside the Center of Excellence with a bird’s-eye view of construction in every direction.

“There was great skepticism” she said. “It’s a different conversation now that people can see it.”

JPMorgan has been bought a booking system a restaurant review company and a luxury travel agent. The bank one of the flagship U.S. financial institutions has also built its own airport lounges and hired thousands of travel agents. And there will be a new website launched as well.

It’s all happening as the travel industry becomes ever more important for banks and credit card issuers.

The WSJ report said JPMorgan executives think the bank might be able to capture $15 billion in bookings in 2025 which would be five times what it handled before the recent purchases. That would make it the third-biggest travel agent in the country based on 2021 volumes per stats from Travel Weekly.

The report noted that this is still far smaller than the parent companies of the top two travel agents Booking.com and Expedia — both of which manage more than $70 billion.

JPMorgan’s goal is to turn the travel customers into “lifelong Chase fans” who will spend more with the bank.

JPMorgan also already has a stake in travel with its credit cards letting customers build up travel rewards and cashing them through the bank’s Ultimate Rewards booking site.

Known lounges include New York LaGuardia San Diego Las Vegas Phoenix Boston and Hong Kong but they’re talking up current plans for a total of 9.

Chase sees an opportunity to capture more travel spend and keep customers in their ecosystem. They see the same opportunity in the home and auto ecosystems. Meanwhile travel booking helps them capture their customers’ travel spend in terms of experience. They’ll capture the booking commissions (which could reach $750 million not pocket change). And they’ll have even richer data to cross market to their customers – and to rent to other firms.

J.P. Morgan Chase is going up against American Express and now Capital One in the travel portal and lounge business. The problem is that nobody yet does online travel really well. Expedia hasn’t actually gotten better from a consumer standpoint in 20 years. Instead they spend a lot on advertising to bring customers to their site and they sell those customers to hotels. They don’t actually add value to a customer’s trip guiding them towards better experiences.

JPMorgan executives say they want to dominate on extravagant itineraries helping customers book spas dinners and experiences. “More people are interested in being inspired right now saying ‘I want to have one of those social-media-type moments so tell me where to go’” said Jason Wynn the head of the new travel unit.

Travel is complicated and advice is missing. You go online and see schedules and price or location and property features but little to tell you whether to take that 45 minute connection in Chicago in winter whether for your trip you should go out the night before or take the first flight rather than last flight of the day and what kind of backup options you may have.

Google was supposed to disrupt travel search and booking but that’s been the next big thing in the space for over a decade. Whether or not banks deliver having more competitors can only benefit consumers.

It’ll be exciting to watch but I remain skeptical because most acquisitions turn out badly and nobody has really done it yet because it’s hard. Chase has the resources but so does Google and they have the AI programmers and personal data with which to do mass customization and personalization in a really unique way – yet they haven’t managed it (though Google Flights is quite useful). We’ll have a window soon enough.

Bloomberg

The last time inflation burned hot consumers could put money in the bank and watch it grow like the prices on store shelves easing much of the pain.

Not this time – and that’s stoking profits for U.S. lenders.

The gap between what banks pay depositors and what they earn from lending money to borrowers hasn’t been so wide in the past half-century with the average savings account paying a skimpy 0.06%. Many banks are telling shareholders that so-called deposit betas measuring how quickly deposit rates rise in the wake of Fed hikes will remain advantageous for banks in the months ahead as they’re not yet feeling much pressure to pay savers more.

Betas are now the buzziest bit of jargon across the financial industry. The phrase was invoked more times during Bank of America Corp.’s analyst briefings in the past two months than in the prior two years combined. This month the lender’s executives predicted interest income may climb by as much as $1 billion in the third quarter from the second as they stay “disciplined” in what they pay customers.

“Our consumer-banking segment continues to see good momentum” Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan told analysts July 18. “We grew loans at the fastest quarterly pace in nearly three years.”

The reasons that savers are getting so little relief are myriad starting with the Federal Reserve which waited until inflation was strong before it began raising interest rates from longtime lows. From there it takes time for deposit rates to rise too. The result is pain: The consumer price index jumped 9.1% in June while banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co. offered deposit rates as low as 0.01% according to their websites.

While deposit rates are widely expected to tick incrementally higher as the Fed’s rate hikes for borrowers take hold there’s ample evidence that the benefits for savers will come slowly. That’s because many banks face little competitive pressure to pay more. Many are flush with cash thanks in part to a surge in deposits that piled up during Covid-era lockdowns and stimulus programs.

Even big clients that aren’t doing a lot of business with a bank aside from parking their money will have little leverage to push for a higher interest rate on their deposits.

“Banks have plenty of room on the funding side” said Erika Najarian a banking analyst at UBS Group AG. That means they can allow “more rate-sensitive deposit-only relationships to walk because they don’t necessarily need that funding.

While deposits have been slipping somewhat at many banks it’s unlikely that enough consumers will switch lenders to ratchet up pressure quickly even as online and community-based institutions burnish rates to attract inflows. Synchrony Financial and American Express Co. for example each offer rates of at least 1.5%.

One reason for that inertia is that only people of a certain age can remember an era when banks routinely paid much more interest on deposits blunting the impact of inflation. Another is that accounts aren’t as portable as they were decades ago. Many customers have their paychecks deposited directly and arrange for bills to be paid automatically making switching to a new bank a hassle.

To be sure the more generous rates banks paid for deposits in the 1980s were a result of longstanding inflation and the Fed’s efforts to tame that with much higher interest rates for borrowing.

This time both interest and deposit rates are coming off ultra-low levels said Greg McBride chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com which tracks the deposit rates banks offer. Banks will want to see the benefit from higher borrowing rates before they start to pass that along to savers he said.

Getting to higher deposit rates will also depend on how long the Fed keeps borrowing rates elevated Najarian said. She suggests deposit rates might reach 1.2% before the Fed starts to ease again."

Nokia is deploying its XGS Passive Optical Network (XGS-PON) solution for Cambodian internet service provider SINET as demand for high speed enterprise connectivity escalates in the market.

The initial deployment will take place in the capital Phnom Penh with CommsUpdate reporting that Nokia will expand the solution to other cities and regions of Cambodia. SINET aims to prepare its network to deal with escalating demand for capacity as well as use cases such as 5G backhauling and smart cities.

Nokia will upgrade its existing fibre access nodes as part of the deployment which it expects to complete before the end of this year.

Diep Kong CTO of SINET said: “As the digital ecosystem becomes all-pervasive enterprises need exceptional network reliability along with ultra high speed.

“We are already using Nokia’s GPON solution and are confident that its field-proven XGS-PON solution will allow us to provide a differentiated experience to Cambodia’s enterprises.”

The biggest of course is the Mill Mountain Star which is working just fine. The problem is the other two which aren’t.

One is the the formerly animated H & C Coffee sign. It no longer moves while the H ampersand and parts of the saucer remain dim. The 2 appears missing from the famous Dr Pepper bottle-cap clock sign featuring a 10 2 and 4. And the sign’s 3 o’clock position is dimmer than the rest.

Those neon odes to American mercantilism date back at least 60 years perhaps longer and each needs some tender loving care that they haven’t been getting. But it’s in the works people in the know assure me.

This was brought to our attention by Bonnie Darlene Clark a reader who turns 82 this week. Clark called into our reader hotline recently.

“I’m a citizen of Roanoke. I’ve lived here all my life” she began.

“And I was really astonished at how ya’ll do take care of the Roanoke Star but the Dr Pepper sign and the coffee sign are in terrible shape they’re not lit up at night like they should be part of the Dr Pepper sign is broke.

“And we’re supposed to be the Dr Pepper capital of the world and yet these are just terrible looking. it would be smart for ya’ll to print something about.”

In a subsequent phone conversation Clark told me she’d also called Roanoke City Council about this outrage.

“I just think it looks bad” Clark said. “If we want tourists we should fix those signs.” Otherwise it could leave an impression of downtown neglect.

She was unaware who owns the signs and so was I. So I started making some phone calls.

The first was to a different Clark — Jaime Clark a vice president at Downtown Roanoke Inc. She said her organization’s been hearing complaints too.

“Neither one apparently lights all the way up” Jaime Clark said. “I know people feel very strongly about those signs” she added. DRI has been getting a couple calls a month about them since they’ve been out.

Some years ago during an earlier period when when the H & C sign was taking a neon coffee break DRI’s related Foundation for Downtown Roanoke Inc. raised money to fix and restore it as well as an additional sum for upkeep.

After it was rehabbed ownership of the sign and the excess maintenance funds were turned over to Center in The Square Jaime Clark said.

“The Dr Pepper sign is owned by Pepsi” she added. (She meant Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of Roanoke which distributes both Pepsi and Dr Pepper in the Roanoke Valley.)

Next I called Pepsi’s bottling operation in Hollins and spoke to plant manager Mark Sakash.

It’s probably a stretch to say the Pepsi bottler owns the sign. Sakash told me Pepsi distributes Dr Pepper here in the Roanoke Valley. He said an associate named Troy who works for Keurig Dr Pepper (or KPD) “has been trying to find somebody to fix those lights for three years.”

Unfortunately Troy was on vacation when Sakash and I talked Friday morning.

Sakash called me back Friday afternoon and said the lights on the Dr Pepper sign have been fixed but not all the necessary work has been completed.

“What they’re working on now is a facelift. They’re trying to find a company in Bristol or Richmond not only to do the Dr Pepper sign but also the H & C sign” Sakash said. He knew no other details such as when both signs might be shining once again.

So it appears KPD may be teaming up with Center in the Square to rehab the coffee sign too. I never heard back from a Center in the Square spokeswoman about that.

Hunting through some news clips it appears the signs going dim or partially dim have been a regular topic of news articles as well as in the local history column “Looking Back.” (Sadly the newspaper pulled the plug on that weekly feature in April 2021.)

For example on Nov. 13 2014 my colleague Mike Allen wrote a short story noting the H & C Coffee sign had been lighted but static for a number of days rather than moving and pouring java into a cup like it’s supposed to.

At the time the gizmo that animated the sign had broken. Allen’s story also ran down a bit of the H & C sign’s history:

“Built in 1948 the sign began its neon life atop the old Woods Brothers Coffee Co. building on Campbell Avenue Southeast. In 1964 it moved to the old Billy’s Ritz building on the Roanoke City Market where it stood for decades.

“After a fundraising campaign in 2004 and 2005 that raised more than $150000 for repairs and maintenance the sign migrated to the Mill Mountain Theatre Atelier the former Shenandoah Hotel building owned by Center in the Square. The sign was moved so that it could still be seen from Interstate 581 once the Taubman Museum of Art was constructed.”

In 2015 Allen published another story that noted the Dr Pepper sign was owned by the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.

The Dr Pepper sign was last rehabbed in 2013. We know this from a February 2013 photo by Don Petersen of workers using a cherry picker to give the sign a face-lift.

The accompanying photo caption noted the Dr Pepper sign was first installed downtown in the 1950s.

“The parent company Dr. Pepper Snapple Group sells more Dr. Pepper in the Roanoke Valley area of Virginia than any other metropolitan area east of the Mississippi River” the caption notes. “In the past the city has been named the ‘Dr. Pepper Capital of the World’ and broke world records for its mass consumption of the beverage in the late 1950’s.”

The soft drink’s origins have been debated for decades. According to a 2010 article by my ex-colleague Duncan Adams in the 1960s the soda was known as “America’s most misunderstood soft drink.”

Some of the available information suggests it might have been named for a Dr. Pepper here in Southwest Virginia. But there were two different physicians with that surname which is where things like the drink when spilled get a little sticky. And aside from that neither doctor invented the elixir.

The creator was Charles Alderton a New York-born pharmacist who worked at a drug store in Waco Texas.

Dr Pepper debuted in 1885 about a year before the invention and first sale of Coca-Cola by another pharmacist in Atlanta.

Alderton worked for Morrison’s Old Corner Drug Store in Waco which was owned by Wade Morrison. He named the drink and was reputed to be the first person other than Alderton to taste it.

Morrison had earlier lived in Christiansburg and worked as a pharmacy clerk there. That was documented in some U.S. Census papers from the 19th Century later examined by the Dr Pepper Museum in Dublin Texas. (Yes Dr Pepper has its own museum!)

Those records suggest Morrison and Dr. William Alexander Reed Pepper lived close to each other in Christiansburg at one time. Census takers went door-to-door back then and Dr. Pepper the physician was recorded on the page immediately following the page upon which Morrison’s name was found.

Other parts of the legend say Morrison married Pepper’s daughter and named the drink in honor of her dad. Her name was Mary Ann Pepper and she went by “Minnie.” She was 16 at the time Morrison lived in Christiansburg which was before he moved to north Texas.

Others have Long believed the drink was named after a different Dr. Pepper — a Dr. Charles T. Pepper of Rural Retreat. But the museum noted that at best Morrison and Charles Pepper lived at least 40 miles apart in the 1800s a not inconsiderable distance at the time. No record of them ever crossing paths has been found.

And Charles T. Pepper’s only daughter was barely 8 years old at the time Morrison lived in Christiansburg which makes any marriage between them unlikely.

Hopefully that article will be updated to reflect the refurbished Roanoke icon once it’s lighted again.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Blue-chip companies that need to borrow in the US now are increasingly relying on commercial paper to avoid locking in longer-term borrowing costs in a market beset by turbulence.

Blue-chip companies that need to borrow in the US now are increasingly relying on commercial paper to avoid locking in longer-term borrowing costs in a market beset by turbulence.

The total amount of these IOUs outstanding has mushroomed to nearly $1.2tn this year up more than 20% from its lows in 2020 with computing giant Apple Inc and pipeline-owner Kinder Morgan Inc among those that have been dipping more into the market this year. At the same time investment-grade companies are relying less on longer-term debt markets with sales of high-grade corporate bonds dropping about 7% in 2022 according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

If you strip out banks and other financial companies sales of this kind of debt in the first half of this year were the lowest since at least 2016 according to BMO Capital Markets. Companies are essentially betting that the Fed will get inflation under control and that longer-term rates will stabilise after rising for much of the year.

“All this volatility has corporations just trying to ride this out with commercial paper issuance as more of a placeholder for them until things start to calm down” said Peter Yi director of short-duration fixed income and head of credit research at Northern Trust Asset Management which oversees around $1.2tn.

In re-embracing commercial paper companies are returning to a market that has a history of seizing up during systemic crises. But lately borrowing in longer-term markets has grown trickier than it usually is.

There have been about 49 days in 2022 where not a single company sold corporate bonds which can imply that the market was essentially closed compared with 12 days in the same period last year according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. An index of bond market volatility the ICE BofA MOVE Index had climbed to 128.27 as of Monday from 77.1 at the end of last year.

The Fed is in tightening mode – officials are widely expected to lift the central bank’s benchmark by 0.75 percentage point at its next decision Wednesday so rates at the very shortest parts of the lending curve aren’t likely to retreat much any time soon. The longer-term outlook is harder to forecast especially if rate hikes end up pushing the economy into a slump.

There are already early signs of potential recession including an inversion of key segments of the Treasury yield curve and news this week from big-box retailer Walmart Inc that shoppers are cutting back. That kind of macroeconomic uncertainty has made many investors reluctant to buy longer-term corporate bonds from those companies that have been willing to venture into the market.

Meanwhile heightened investor demand for commercial paper has made it relatively cheap for companies to fund in that market. For example borrowing for 30 days in the commercial paper market can cost about 2.25% as of Monday while yields on high-grade bonds maturing in one to three years were averaging about 3.95%. The gap between those two rates – a measure of the savings from borrowing in the CP market – is wide compared with the averages for the last five years.

“I think supply has followed demand here and it’s a reflection of the large gap in terms of pricing in commercial paper rates versus the front-end bond market” said JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Nathaniel Rosenbaum.

Banks have been significant sellers of commercial paper for years but the biggest shift recently has been among companies outside the financial sector said Erin Gonzalez head of commercial paper trading at Barclays Plc. Commercial paper outstanding bottomed out around $945bn in September 2020 before rebounding Fed data show. The amount of total outstanding is $1.17tn as of July 20 though that’s still only about half the size of its peak in 2007.

“We’re seeing corporations come back” Gonzalez said. “Corporate issuers that termed out during the crisis are returning.”

Even as companies increasingly borrow in the commercial paper market some money managers remain wary of it. During the March 2020 turmoil panicked investors yanked billions from money funds in a matter of weeks contributing to the seizing up of the commercial-paper market. Companies had to pay off their maturing IOUs with either precious cash or money from a bank line.

That required the Federal Reserve to provide emergency support to ensure markets and even money-market funds would continue to function. The Fed had to similarly support the commercial paper market after Lehman Brothers failed.

“The experience we have witnessed over the past two decades with regard to commercial paper – which not only had massive re-pricings but also elicited formal responses from the Fed – is still relatively fresh in our minds” said Jerome Schneider head of short-term portfolio management and funding at Pacific Investment Management Co one of the largest bond fund managers in the world.

Regulatory changes in the US money market industry have sapped demand for commercial paper for years and more changes are coming that could reduce the funds’ purchases even more. Prime money market funds are buying about $480bn of the short-term IOUs annually versus $725bn in 2019 John Kodweis head of commercial paper origination at JPMorgan said at a conference last month.

Despite any misgivings about prior turmoil and potential regulatory changes short-end investors have large piles of cash and are looking for places to invest it. And many companies take comfort knowing the Fed is inclined to keep the market operating if it seizes up said Barclays’s Gonzalez.

“Issuers that were gone for some time probably would’ve felt comfortable coming back by the end of 2020” she said. “Going forward they’re not as worried knowing the Fed stepped in and did what they did.”

A group of banks led by Morgan Stanley has pulled forward the commitment date on a $500mn loan for Avient by a day in a sign of demand.

ThePackHub Nestlé's Purina Pet Food Brand Launches Mono-Material Pouches

Purina is an American subsidiary of Swiss multinational food and drink conglomerate Nestlé and is one of the biggest pet food providers in the world. Recently they trialled a pilot study in the Netherlands testing the level of success with recyclable packaging under their Felix brand. In response to the trial’s performance they have recently launched mono-material recyclable pouches made of polypropylene for two of their major brands across Europe: Gourmet Mon Petit and Felix Soup. The recyclable pouches are to be sold in batches of six in recyclable cardboard boxes. This initiative is congruent with the company’s objective of delivering entirely recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025.

ThePackHub Procter & Gamble's Paper-Based Shampoo Bars Reduce Packaging Usage

The world’s largest consumer packaged goods company Procter & Gamble (P&G) has announced that its shampoo and conditioner portfolio will now be available in a bar format. Head & Shoulders Pantene Herbal Essences and Aussie brands will be in this configuration as an alternative to the conventional liquid in plastic squeeze bottles. The bars have a volume equivalent to two 250ml liquid bottles and are packed in recyclable FSC-certified paper boxes. This activity will help to contribute to the company’s ambition to reduce the amount of virgin plastic they use by 10000 metric tons per year. This would equate to approximately 300 million bottles being wiped out every year. The new bars come in an easy-to-hold shape and have been created to meet consumer preferences and compare with the performance of their liquid equivalent. P&G has made a commitment to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHS) emissions across its supply chain by 2040.

ThePackHub Kraft Heinz's Snack Pot Made From 39% Recycled Soft Plastic is a Market First

In a five-way collaboration Kraft Heinz has been able to trial Heinz Beanz Snap Pots that contain 39% recycled soft plastic which was collected at in-store collection points at UK’s biggest supermarket Tesco. Heinz and Tesco were aided with this achievement by Plastic Energy Sabic (Saudi Basic Industries Corporation) and Berry Global. Following collection at Tesco Stores the material is delivered to London-based Plastic Energy who converts the plastic into an optimal oil feedstock. SABIC then takes the recycled oil and uses it as alternative feedstock in the production process to manufacture virgin food-contact approved polymer pellets. Berry Global thermoforms these pellets into new post-consumer recyclable Snap Pots. The pots are made with 39% recycled plastics based on a mass-balance approach. Finally the pots are sent to Heinz to be filled with beans and delivered back to Tesco stores. Once used the pots can be recycled as part of conventional UK curbside collections.

I think following the lead of legendary investors like Warren Buffett is one great way for investors like me to make money during this period of high volatility.

Global stock markets have bounced back strongly in July. In fact they’ve put in their biggest monthly rise since the Covid-19 pandemic was still raging in late 2020. The FTSE 100 for instance has risen 3% in value since 1 July.

But despite this recent resurgence there are still plenty of great value stocks for investors to snap up today. It’s a scenario that’s bound to have bargain lovers like Buffett smacking their lips.

Why are markets rebounding?

Stock markets are recovering strongly for a variety of reasons. Firstly disappointing economic data — and primarily from the US — has calmed fears that central banks will execute severe rate rises in the months ahead. Rate increases make it more challenging for the global economy to grow.

Secondly a raft of positive trading statements have boosted weak investor confidence. Just this week US shares Amazon Apple and Kraft Heinz all furnished the market with better-than-expected trading numbers.

However share indexes could easily swing lower again given the shocking pace at which inflation continues to rise.

Thinking like Warren Buffett

Guessing which direction stock markets will move in the short-to-medium term can be a fool’s errand. And especially today when investor confidence is at rock bottom.

What I do know however is that share indexes rise over the long term. And that those who pounce on value stocks when markets fall can make a fortune.

Warren Buffett made billions by snapping up beaten-down shares with his Berkshire Hathaway investment firm. He watched them soar in value during the subsequent stock market recovery and reaped the rewards.

I’ve sought to replicate his successes by buying up value stocks for my own portfolio. Many of my purchases are cyclical stocks that might rise particularly strongly during a market rebound. They also come from a broad range of industries to reduce my risk (diversification is another favourite investing tactic of Warren Buffett).

Making miracles

Today Warren Buffett’s personal wealth clocks in at more than $100bn. It’s $102.2bn to be exact at least according to Forbes.

It pays to aim high but it’s unlikely I’ll make billions like the ‘Sage of Omaha.’ However following his key investing principles can help me realise — or possibly even exceed — the long-term average annual return of 8% that share investors tend to enjoy.

Let’s say I have £7000 to spend on stocks today. If I can hit that 8% yearly target I could after 20 years turn that into £32627. This illustrates the mathematical miracle that is compound interest. And it assumes that I buy no more shares either a policy which I have no intention of following.

Few asset classes can deliver the sort of strong and reliable returns that stocks can. I plan to continue building my portfolio and will be ready to snap up more bargain shares if markets slump again.",,,

The original Lt. Uhura has made her final journey beyond the stars. Sci-fi legend Nichelle Nichols reportedly died Saturday evening. She was 89.

As reported by CNN a statement released by her son said Nichols died of natural causes. She had previously been diagnosed with dementia.

“Her light however like the ancient galaxies now being seen for the first time will remain for us and future generations to enjoy learn from and draw inspiration” Kyle Johnson said. “Hers was a life well lived and as such a model for us all.”

Few people have had as wide an impression across industries as Star Trek’s Nichelle Nichols. Her portrayal of the iconic Lt. Uhura paved the way for other strong Black characters in the Star Trek universe including Lt. Commanders Geordi La Forge Worf and Tuvok. In 2017 she appeared alongside Sonequa Martin-Green at the premiere of “Star Trek: Discovery.”

Nichelle Nichols was a “Woman in Motion”

Professor Chanda Prescod-Weinstein author of “The Disordered Cosmos: A Journey Into Dark Matter Spacetime and Dreams Deferred” pointed out Nichols’ 1967 Ebony cover. She leveraged her position as Lt. Uhura the first Black astronaut on television to push NASA in real life.

In 1977 she formed Women in Motion and helped NASA expand its diversity by recruiting more than 8000 people of color into the ranks. A documentary of a similar name “Woman in Motion” highlighting her work is streaming on Paramount+ and Vudu.

She not only helped diversify sci-fi but she also lent her talents to NASA helping to recruit future astronauts like Ronald McNair and Mae Jemison. Jemison the first real-life Black woman astronaut said that as a little girl seeing Nichols inspired her to want to enter the U.S. space program.

Nichols was honored by NASA last December. As previously reported by NewsOne NASA awarded her the Exceptional Public Achievement Medal. She received the agency’s Public Service Medal in 1984.

She was also a triple threat in entertainment

Before Lt. Uhura journeyed with her crew to “boldly go where no one has gone before” Nichols graced the theater stage. She was a talented dancer actor and singer reportedly discovered by Duke Ellington at the age of 15.

Nichols starred in productions of “Porgy and Bess” “The Blacks” and “Kicks and Company.” She received nominations for the Sarah Siddons Award for Best Actress for both.

Screen Rant said show notes from Star Trek’s second season mentioned that Lt. Uhura was popular for singing. In one episode of the original Star Trek series Nichols showed off her skills alongside Commander Spock played by Leonard Nimoy accompanying her on the Vulcan Lute.

She also had an enticing scene in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.

Meeting Dr. King changed the course of her career

Early in the series Nichols considered quitting her role as Lt. Uhura. But a chance encounter with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. made her reconsider. In a 2011 NPR interview Nichols said that the late civil rights leader kept her from leaving the show.

Nichols said she met King at an NAACP event and he introduced himself as her greatest fan.

“He complimented me on the manner in which I’d created the character” she told NPR. “I thanked him and I think I said something like Dr. King I wish I could be out there marching with you. He said no no no. No you don’t understand. We don’t need you on the – to march. You are marching. You are reflecting what we are fighting for.”

Nichelle Nichols inspired many to dream and believe beyond our surroundings and humble beginnings. Now Nichols has transitioned to divine inspiration and honored ancestor.

Some on social media ‌‌suggested it might already be ‌spreading rapidly in communities in Europe and the ‌United States. These reports should have been a code red for federal infectious disease response.

But it wasn’t until late June that the C‌enters for Disease Control and Prevention expanded testing for monkeypox to large commercial labs like Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp for more capacity and access. The C.D.C. had gone through its standard playbook ticking through its protracted checklist.

Compared with the agency’s botched rollout of a test for the coronavirus the monkeypox test came at warp speed. But the virus spread even faster. If ‌American leaders wanted to quash the outbreak ‌‌the United States should have been testing all people who presented with what was presumed to be atypical cases of diseases like genital herpes and zoster infection; both can cause rashes that sometimes resemble monkeypox. That might have required 15000 tests a week by my rough estimate. From mid-May to the end of June the U‌‌nited States tested only about 2000 samples.

Our country’s response to monkeypox ‌‌has been plagued by the same shortcomings we had with Covid-19. Now if monkeypox ‌gains a permanent foothold in the U‌nited States and becomes an endemic virus that joins our circulating repertoire of pathogens it will be one of the worst public health failures in modern times not only because of the pain and peril of the disease but also because it was so avoidable. Our lapses extend beyond political decision making to the agencies tasked with protecting us from these threats. We don’t have a federal infrastructure capable of dealing with these emergencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The fire was reported at 2:02 p.m. Four firefighters were treated for heat exhaustion according to Deputy Fire Chief Glenn Johnson.

The hourlong fire rendered the home unlivable. Johnson said it is thought to have started in the garage while nobody was home.

As smoke first billowed out of the building neighbors notified the Fire Department and the homeowner.

One neighbor Tammy Millette said she ran to the house knowing that a dog was still inside.

With the help of another neighbor she kicked the front door open.

“We had to drag the dog out because it didn’t want to leave” said Millette. “The dog wanted to stay in its home.""

Chewy a burly brown dog with black spots circled contently around the tree on Millette’s lawn.

When Ameryss Stewart arrived at the scene from a birthday party she reported that her cat was also missing.

After a quick search firefighters found Salem hiding under a bed and healthy.

As firefighters brought out the cat in a shopping bag Stewart wept in relief while sitting by the curb of her home.

Johnson said the Red Cross would help Stewart recover from the fire.

“I lost half of my belongings” said Stewart in tears. “I don’t know what I’m going to do.”

The cause of the fire was still under investigation as of Saturday afternoon.

Fire stations from Oxford Leicester Worcester and Millbury helped; Webster EMS was on scene.

Through much of history men have held most of the world’s wealth and as recently as 2014 women made less than 17% of the top 1% of earners in the United States. A large majority of the richest Americans are men. (These are the 30 richest Americans of all time.)

The financial success of women has often been stunted by historical legal and societal biases and prejudices. Prior to the 1848 Married Woman’s Property Act women could not collect rent or lay claim to an inheritance. Women couldn’t legally open a bank account in the United States before the 1960s. Despite these obstacles women have made significant contributions to society and science. These are the greatest women innovators and inventors.

The state of wealth-related gender disparity continues to improve though it is far from parity. Between 2014 and 2019 the number of female entrepreneurs increased by 21% with some women amassing massive financial empires. Other women inherited fortunes some strengthening their family’s companies and changing the future of the world’s wealth landscape.

To identify the world’s richest women 24/7 Wall St. reviewed Money Inc’s article The 20 Richest Women in The World As of 2022. To create its list the site used various sources including Forbes Yahoo Finance Finances Online and Wealthy Gorilla. As with any estimates of personal wealth there is varying information about these net worth amounts with different figures at different sources.

The 20 richest women hail from a variety of countries seven are from the United States and six are from China. France only appears once on the list but it is home to the wealthiest woman in the world Françoise Bettencourt Meyers heiress to the L’Oreal empire. Of the 20 listed women four gained their wealth from technology-related industries three from real estate companies and two from mining businesses.

The fortunes of the 20 richest women were amassed in several ways including entrepreneurship (25%) inheritance (70%) and divorce settlements (5%). Notably every listed self-made female billionaire is from China many of whom came from humble beginnings including No. 16 Zhou Qunfei who grew up in a rural community and worked in a factory.

Many of the richest women are charitable with their wealth. Some have their own philanthropic foundations while others actively donate to various causes.

CEO QTC Management a Leidos Company

Larry Schaefer believes his best recent achievement was serving veterans on Indian reservations.

“That was no small feat and took many years to figure out how to navigate the process for getting our mobile clinic on to the reservation” he said.

More globally he’s proud of taking all of the QTC capabilities and using them in new innovative ways. The mobile medical clinics are a part of that but innovating tools and systems to increase the company’s ability to perform its work in rural locations is a heavy focus.

“Three words that describe Larry are innovation service and leadership” said Liz Porter president of Leidos Health Group. “Larry has transformed how we reach and serve veterans and retiring service members in remote areas with our mobile medical clinics. His leadership and vision have transformed the way the team works together to fulfill these ambitious goals.”

Why Watch

Recently the Veterans Benefits Administration approved the way audio exams for veterans are conducted. Normally hearing exams need to be done in big heavy soundproof booths — QTC Management innovated with a new headset that forgoes the big booth. This is an example of the company’s innovation and pushing the envelope to develop and implement new ways of performing its health care work.

“It’s an honor to lead the QTC team and I am amazed at the accomplishments we’ve achieved to date” Schaefer said. “I look forward to the next round of accomplishments as we work to achieve the Leidos vision of solving our customers’ most demanding challenges.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Special to Fort Myers News-Press

Babcock Ranch is the 10th fastest-selling master-planned community in the United States based on mid-year rankings by prominent real estate consulting firm RCLCO. Babcock Ranch jumped 4 spots since the end of 2021 when it claimed No. 14 on RCLCO’s annual list of the 50 fastest-selling master-planned communities in the country.

Home prices are still increasing despite a cooling housing market.

But price declines lie ahead many experts argue.

Insider recently spoke with three experts calling for median home prices to fall.

The housing market is starting to cool off in a big way thanks to skyrocketing mortgage rates this year.

Homebuilder sentiment is at its second-lowest level in 37 years thanks to tanking demand — existing home sales were down 14% in June year-over-year.

Still home prices have yet to take a hit. The median price of homes sold in the US hit an all-time high of $440300 in the second quarter.

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis

But price declines are coming according to a growing chorus of economists and industry experts.

""The U.S. housing market is due for a reset given the extraordinary home price growth seen since the onset of the pandemic"" Cook said.

José Torres a senior economist at Interactive Brokers said he thinks supply and demand dynamics in the market are moving in such a way that creates a perfect recipe for home price declines.

""A perfect storm is brewing in the real estate market due to near decade high construction levels and plummeting demand"" Torres said.

Desmond Lachman senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former deputy director at the International Monetary Fund broke down for Insider why prices will drop 15-20% as buyer demand gets crushed by rising interest rates and a still-hawkish Fed.

""They're going to keep monetary policy tight even if inflation peaks"" Lachman said.

“I choose to focus on all the bravery all the courage” says Lady Gaga of the pandemic period that saw her Chromatica Ball tour postponed twice. “I want to look back on this last couple of years and I always want to remember us just like this.”

Considering “just like this” involves 60000 people in flashing wristbands watching a purple beetle lady play a piano resembling a burning alien throne – seemingly designed by HR Giger– we’re unlikely to forget it.

We’re somewhat blessed that come 2022 and as an acclaimed actor whose 2016 Americana album Joanne veered towards no-artifice personal exposure Stefani Germanotta remains one of the most eye-searingly bizarre live acts in the world. “Thank you for loving a weirdo like me!” she beams to the crowd a significant chunk of which is clad in its own homemade freak outfits. And it’s hard not to fall for a mind that is avant-garde enough to concoct a four-act stadium show where Brazil meets Hostel A Clockwork Orange Prometheus The Great Gatsby The Warriors Them! The Matrix and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.

The show opens as strangely as it means to go on. An impressionist film like a nightmare on celluloid captures Gaga transforming into an evil bird woman before the Prelude begins wherein she appears atop a row of brutalist mock-concrete cells held tight in a mechanical exoskeleton and singing “Bad Romance” at a troupe of dancing prisoners while spinning on the spot. The metaphor for being trapped in an abusive relationship is blatant but from there the Chromatica Ball pays little heed to matching image and theme.

Gaga breaks out of her metallic strait-jacket for “Just Dance” red alarm lights drench the stage for the Eurythmics-noir “Poker Face” and the monster is loose. By Act 1 (“Alice” “Replay” “Monster”) she’s laid out on a grimy hydraulic operation room slab in a blood-spattered leotard and gore-red dress like the torture-porn victim of a backstreet Budapest spleen robbery. By Act 2 (“911” “Sour Candy” a magnificent “Telephone” and “LoveGame” Gaga’s sizzle-free “…Baby One More Time”) she’s recast as a sci-fi S&M cop while the stage transforms into a steampunk version of the Nostromo. Act 3 (“Babylon” “Free Woman” “Born This Way”) then takes place at a decadent Gatsby party Gaga and dancers dressed in gold suits before they form a procession to a second stage out in the crowd and coronate Gaga as queen of the bug people.

Such shape-shifting largesse has often drawn comparisons to Bowie but Gaga doesn’t display anywhere near the same genre-hopping sprightliness tonight. Drawing heavily from 2020’s Chromatica album her return to dance-pop she often seems almost a tribute act to her pop predecessors: Britney Spears Christina Aguilera Pet Shop Boys and – on the “Vogue”-aping “Babylon” and “Express Yourself” facsimile “Born This Way” – Madonna. These are hardly bad acts to follow but it’s only when Gaga takes to the latest in a long line of surreal pianos for the ballad medley of Act 4 that her individual talent really shines from behind the costume rack. Interrupting tunes to dedicate them to Alexander McQueen and deliver motivational messages about identity she bawls through the epic country “Shallow” from A Star is Born and stands on one leg on her stool as “Fun Tonight” turns from dolorous ballad to U2 disco.

Finally a video of Gaga reciting a poem about how life is art and we are all eternal (tell that to Tottenham’s hangover tomorrow) gives way to an ecstatic Finale of “Stupid Love” “Rain On Me” and “Hold My Hand” with her dressed as a biker Beyonce with one spindly claw hand. It’s fair to say the queen of the freaks is back and still unforgettable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN255LmNvbS9tYXlzb29uLXpheWlkLWRpc2FibGVkLWNvbWVkaWFuLWFjdG9yLWFyYWItYW1lcmljYW4vMTIwODg3Mzkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maysoon Zayid Disabled comedian and actress celebrates her differences,"Disabled comedian and actress celebrates her differences

New Jersey -- Comedian Maysoon Zayid is many things. Funny is just one of them.

""In the oppression Olympics I would win the gold medal. I'm Palestinian I'm Muslim I'm disabled divorced a woman of color and I live in New Jersey"" Zayid said.

Born with cerebral palsy Zayid is kicking down barriers in entertainment. The comedian actress and disability advocate has taken her career from the comedy stage to TV a TED Talk and a gig teaching at Princeton. Yes that Princeton.

A drama queen as a child Zayid was destined for the spotlight. However she saw very few disabled people on screen. That all changed when she saw legendary comedian Richard Pryor who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1986 and realized her Hollywood dream could be her reality.

Zayid studied drama and theater at Arizona State University and set out on her goal: to be cast in ""General Hospital."" The only problem was that disabled TV characters are often miraculously healed.

""I couldn't be healed and I couldn't get cast"" she said. But for Zayid it was only a matter of time.

""I was like 'Oh I'll just do stand-up comedy get really famous and then be on 'General Hospital.' Which I did"" she said. Zayid joined the cast of ""General Hospital"" in 2019 playing the role of Zahir Amir.

A proud Muslim Zayid is the executive producer and co-founder of the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival. She and fellow comic Dean Obeidallah created the festival in 2003 to combat the negative images of Muslims after 9/11. The festival is now an NYC comedy powerhouse showcasing the talents of scores of Arab-American comics and creators.

She's also gone on to star in Live Nation's ""Arabs Gone Wild"" comedy tour. Her other credits include ""The Countdown with Keith Olbermann"" ""In Deep Shift With Jonas Elrod"" and the film ""You Don't Mess With the Zohan"" to name a few.

Zayid is excited for the upcoming release of her first comic book ""Shiny Misfits."" The comic features a disabled lead and other disabled characters. As the story goes between the real world and a dream world the characters stay disabled in both.

Zayid is full speed on her mission to open doors for disabled people. She is using her success to show the world disability doesn't look just one way.

""I would just like to see disability reflecting the diversity of our community"" Zayid said. ""I would also like to see an end of nondisabled people playing visibly disabled on screen.""

As Zayid moves the needle for people with disabilities she also hopes to inspire families with disabled children.

""I would love to see parents who want their disabled children to live their best lives to start connecting with and listening to disabled adults"" Zayid said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tdXNpYy8xNjQ4Mzk0L3RvbS13YWxrZXIta2F0ZS1taWRkbGV0b24tc29uZy1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1nbGFzdG9uYnVyedIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tdXNpYy8xNjQ4Mzk0L3RvbS13YWxrZXIta2F0ZS1taWRkbGV0b24tc29uZy1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1nbGFzdG9uYnVyeS9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Walker wanted to open Glastonbury for Kate Middleton after pianist performance,"Tom Walker reflects on performing with Kate Middleton

It is also currently unclear if an additional concert in Singapore or a shift to a larger venue will be announced. NME has contacted Live Nation for comment.

Singapore is so far the only country in SEVENTEEN’s Southeast Asia tour slate to receive just one concert date. The group are playing two shows each in Jakarta Manila and Bangkok. SEVENTEEN also announced a six-show tour of Japan last month.

Goodyear Racing Eagle tires are stacked up along a wall during practice for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Allstate 400 at the Brickyard at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on July 25 2009 in Indianapolis Indiana.

The American multinational tire manufacturer announced this detail on July 20. Goodyear already manufactured advanced wheels for other space missions.

These include the Apollo 11 mission which launched around 53 years ago. Now the company plans to be involved in another important space effort.

""The company will continue that tradition-focusing on lunar vehicle tires-by joining Lockheed Martin in its development of a lunar mobility vehicle"" said the tire maker via its official press release.

Goodyear's New Moon Tires To Arrive!

According to PC Mag's latest report Goodyear's recent wheels for NASA's lunar rovers are designed to last only a few days.

A Goodyear store is seen on August 19 2020 in Miami Florida. President Donald Trump called for a boycott against Goodyear in reaction to a social media post that was purportedly from a company training session that deemed MAGA attire unacceptable for the workplace.

These tires need to be replaced so that the moon vehicles of the space agency can work properly.

Now the tire manufacturer is expected to develop new lunar wheels that can last longer and endure rugged terrain as well as other harsh conditions.

The company's CTO Chris Helsel said their new collaboration with Lockheed Martin is a big deal.

Designing new moon tires for the defense corporation will give them more experience in wheel making allowing them to create better airless tires.

Can Goodyear's Lunar Wheels Endure Moon's Environment?

As of press time it is hard to conclude that the new tires of Goodyear can endure harsh lunar conditions.

But the wheel maker said that it would use its advanced technologies for airless tires in Earth-based autonomous shuttles passenger cars as well as micro-mobility vehicles.

Although the new lunar wheels are still under development you can definitely expect more longer-lasting moon tires from Goodyear since it has been providing strong wheels for various automakers and other companies.

Meanwhile a luxurious space balloon is now being designed by Space Perspective.

On the other hand Russia confirmed that Roscosmos' ISS stay had been extended until 2028.

The US Air Force has grounded its fleet of F-35 jets over concerns about the ejector seats.

Bloomberg reported that the issue involved the seats' explosive cartridges made by Martin-Baker.

The USAF has the world's biggest fleet of the Lockheed Martin fighter jets.

The US Air Force has temporarily grounded its fleet of Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter amid concerns that the ejector may be faulty.

Bloomberg reported that a potentially faulty component in the mechanism that could endanger pilots in an emergency was being investigated.

Since Thursday Air Force has grounded almost 300 jets according to the report.

An Air Force spokeswoman Alexi Worley told Bloomberg the issue involved the explosive cartridges inside ejection seats that propel both the seat and the pilot from the jet.

Inspections of all the cartridges began on July 19 and all F-35 jets were grounded on July 29 to speed up the process.

The data gathered will be used to determine when operations can resume she said.

The jets all have ejector seats made by Martin-Baker Aircraft.

Steve Roberts of Martin-Baker told Bloomberg only F-35s were affected. He confirmed an ""anomaly"" was found with one of the seat cartridge devices in the fighter in April. ""This was quickly traced back to a gap in the manufacturing process which was addressed and changed.""

""Outside the F-35 not a single anomaly has been discovered worldwide as a result of the forensic investigation which continues at pace"" Roberts added.

The US Air Force has the world's largest F-35 fleet with 348 jets. It says they have the most advanced sensor suite of any fighter.

The USAF and Martin-Baker did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

“The Air Force received information about a safety finding in the ejection seats in the F-35 array that is assessed as low risk. In addition a directive was received to carry out tests during the next 90 days” the IDF said.

“Israel was coordinating its response with the US military and the F-35 Joint Program Office” the military said noting that a decision on possibly also grounding the Israeli fleet would be taken in the coming days by Air Force commander Tomer Bar.

The US Air Force on Friday said it was temporarily grounding its F-35 fleet.

US Air Combat Command units “will execute a stand-down on July 29 to expedite the inspection process” said spokeswoman Alexi Worley adding that the move was taken out of an “abundance of caution.”

The problems relate to a problem with the cartridges used to blast out the ejector seats in the event of an emergency.

The jet’s manufacturer Lockheed Martin said it was working “closely” with the Joint Program Office and customers on the seat ejector issue to “ensure safe and effective operations.”

“We are assisting with seat inspections where appropriate” it added.

Air Force Times reported Friday that the US first discovered the problem in April but waited three months to ground the plane while they investigated the issue.

Seat manufacturer Martin-Baker said the problem was “traced back to a gap in the manufacturing process which was addressed and changed.”

The defective part was loose and missing the magnesium powder used to ignite the propellant that shoots someone to safety Martin-Baker spokesman Steve Roberts told Air Force Times.

The report said that since the problem was first discovered the US had tested 2700 F-35 ejection seat cartridges and found three failures.

Individual US jets will return to service after passing inspection.

Grounding its F-35 fleet would be a major blow to the IAF.

The fifth-generation F-35 has been lauded as a “game-changer” by the military not only for its offensive and stealth capabilities but for its ability to connect its systems with other aircraft and form an information-sharing network.

Israel has agreed to purchase at least 50 F-35 fighter jets from the US defense contractor Lockheed Martin. So far 33 aircraft have been delivered and the remaining planes are slated to arrive in batches of twos and threes until 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA3LzMwLzQtc3RvY2tzLXRoYXQtY291bGQtcHV0LW51Y2xlYXItcG93ZXItb24tdGhlLW1vb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Stocks That Could Put Nuclear Power on the Moon,"The opening bid for this project starts at $5 million and could go to the moon from there.

In less than three years -- in 2025 -- NASA could land astronauts back on the moon. The first step will be to launch a Space Launch System rocket on a three-week trip out past the moon and back (without ever landing) in a mission dubbed ""Artemis I"" that NASA now says could take place as early as August 29.

But that's not what we're talking about today. Today we're going to talk about what happens after Artemis III the mission that actually puts boots on the (lunar) ground. And more than that we're going to talk about the companies working to make it possible for astronauts to remain on the moon for years to come.

Zen and the art of nuclear power plant maintenance

Once you've landed on the moon and once you've asked astronauts to stay there and live on the moon -- how do you keep them alive? How do you provide the power to keep the lights on the air machines running and the moon buggies fully charged?

One possibility that NASA is looking at seriously right now is building a nuclear power station on the moon. To that end last month the space agency partnered with the Department of Energy (DoE) to pick three industry teams to design a lunar nuclear power station. For $5 million apiece each of:

Lockheed Martin LMT 0.48% )

Westinghouse assisted by its partner Aerojet Rocketdyne AJRD)

and the curiously named ""IX"" of Houston assisted by Boeing BA 0.50% ) Maxar Technologies MAXR)

...will draw up plans for the construction of a 40-kilowatt class nuclear power plant that can run for at least 10 years on the surface of the moon.

How big of a deal is this?

Now admittedly 40 kw is not a lot of power -- on Earth. The average nuclear power plant in the United States for example produces closer to 1 gigawatt or 25000 times more power than NASA is looking to put on the moon. Even the solar panels on the International Space Station provide about 160 kw.

40 kw is however a step up in technology from the kinds of nuclear power plants that have been used to power small satellites and space probes since the 1960s most of which have only produced a few kilowatts of power. 40 kw of hourly output (i.e. 350400 kilowatt-hours per year) is enough to power about 30 average U.S. homes for a year and that's enough to make running a lunar base feasible in NASA's estimation. (And if more power is needed NASA could always send up additional systems based on the initial prototype or replace it with a larger model.)

In any case as the DoE's Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner observes developing a 40 kw system is already a ""very achievable first step toward the United States establishing nuclear power on the Moon.""

As for the companies receiving the contracts the initial contracts are described as ""Phase 1 awards"" which implies that further contracts -- worth more than the initial $5 million -- can be expected. If NASA follows the usual practice a ""Phase 2"" might see one or more of the candidates tasked with building prototype nuclear power plants -- followed by one of the three being awarded a final ""Phase 3"" award to build an operational model and send it to the moon.

NASA hopes that this can happen ""by the end of the decade.""

What it means to investors

How much might a Phase 3 award be worth to the eventual winner? That's almost impossible to say because this is something that's never been done before. According to the World Nuclear Association nuclear power plants on Earth generally cost on the order of $6000 per kw to build implying a $240000 construction cost for a 40 kw system. That's clearly not going to be the case here however when just working out a plan for building the thing will cost 20x more.

All I think you can really say is that whoever wins the contract to build a nuclear power station on the moon can expect to be paid a lot for the first unit.

Beyond that NASA notes that a nuclear power plant that can work on the moon could just as easily be used to power spacecraft on ""deep space exploration missions"". And that implies that whichever of these companies survives Phase 1 and emerges the winner of the whole nuclear enchilada can anticipate winning more than just revenue from building a power plant on the moon. It may end up designing the standard nuclear reactor to be used on future spacecraft -- almost by accident -- with all the revenue potential that implies.

The construction of the first two F-35A fighter jets for the Belgian Air Force has begun with a view to their delivery next year sources said on Thursday.

Major components of the two aircraft – the central wing and the external wing boxes – are being assembled at the Cameri plant of Italian company Leonardo an industrial partner in the F-35 programme the US group Lockheed Martin told the Belga News Agency.

The Cameri base near Milan is home to one of the three F-35 assembly lines – known as the ""Final Assembly and Check-Out"" (FACO) – in the world along with the one run by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Nagoya (Japan) and the main one in Fort Worth in the US state of Texas.

Once complete these wing components will be transported to Fort Worth where all Belgian F-35As will be built a Lockheed Martin spokesperson said without providing further details.

No date was given for the first flight of the first aircraft but the start of construction was confirmed by a Belgian specialist in the field. The first four F-35s will be delivered to Belgium next year.

However they will remain stationed in the United States at Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix Arizona for the initial training of pilots and mechanics. This will also be the case for the next four aircraft in 2024. The first four aircraft are not expected to arrive at Florennes Air Force Base in Wallonia until April 2025.

In October 2018 the Belgian government purchased 34 F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighters for €3.8 billion. To this amount must be added the €238 million provided for in the STAR plan approved last June by the current government for the further development of the F-35's capabilities in the period 2031-2035."

The Celtics were coming off a run to Game 7 of the conference finals. Four of their top six in postseason minutes were 23 or younger: Brown Jayson Tatum Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier. Two prime-aged stars -- Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward -- were set to return from injury the next season.

The Celtics decided they were good enough that they didn't need to compromise their future to boost their present with Leonard.

But the exuberance about Boston's young core coming within one win of the Finals blurred analysis of its broader postseason run. A lot of us zoomed past Boston coming within one loss of bowing out in the first round to an untested Milwaukee Bucks team. In between the Celtics upended the young Philadelphia 76ers in a five-game win more ragged than convincing.

We know what happened next: The 2019 Celtics imploded Irving and Hayward left and the Lakers beat out Boston for Anthony Davis. Suddenly the notion that Boston had been set up to contend for a decade seemed quaint. A decade? Ha. Next season is promised to no one.

Three years later the Celtics have reached out about Kevin Durant according to initial reports from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Brown would be the obvious centerpiece in any such trade.

These Celtics came within two games of the championship -- three wins and one round further than in 2018. They appeared to solve whatever chemistry problems they had early last season. They loaded up on depth playmaking and shooting with Malcolm Brogdon and Danilo Gallinari. They might be the championship favorite now. Why should a team so good trade a 25-year-old All-Star for a 33-year-old megastar who has played 90 games in three seasons and seems to grow unhappy fast wherever he goes?

But that ""two games from the title"" label is almost a Rorschach test. You can look at it and see a rising team with a historic defense one or two small tweaks from a title -- a team whose offense was undone more by fatigue and inexperience than any fundamental weakness.

Someone else might see a team who needed seven games to beat the Bucks without Khris Middleton-- then seven more to squeak by the Miami Heat with Kyle Lowry and Tyler Herro missing multiple games and Jimmy Butler limping around the middle of the series. Miami came within a Butler triple of stealing Game 7 after Boston's offense went haywire (again). For the playoffs Boston scored at a rate that would have ranked 21st in the regular-season.

Those offensive issues -- bizarre decision-making stagnancy amateurish turnovers -- tipped the Finals toward the Golden State Warriors who by the way should be even better next season (along with other West contenders).

So how convincing was Boston's playoff run? What if fatigue wasn't the biggest reason their offense sputtered? What if Brogdon and Gallinari -- both injury risks the latter a liability on defense -- don't move the needle?

Durant doesn't move the needle on offense as much as grant you access to an entirely new measuring device. He is elite at almost literally everything. He solves every problem. He's a steadier more accomplished playmaker than Brown -- a regular at five or six dimes per game. Brown last season averaged a career-high 3.5 assists to 2.7 turnovers -- not good enough. Brown outplayed Tatum in the Finals but that may have been in part because his playmaking limitations placed too heavy a burden on Tatum.

Alongside Tatum Durant would not have to carry Boston through regular-season doldrums the way he did as the Nets fell apart around him. Durant's supernova package of offensive skills could have a compounding effect on Boston's offense larger than statistical projections might predict. Boston's offense has backslid when Brown plays without Tatum -- stretches Durant could handle.

Even as he loses athleticism in his late 30s Durant will remain productive as a seven-foot jump-shooter -- a new-age late-career Dirk Nowitzki. Snaring Brogdon fortifies Boston's perimeter depth easing the blow of trading multiple guards and wings for Durant.

In 2018 Leonard was the flight risk. He had one year left on his contract and wanted Los Angeles.

In 2022 Brown is more a flight risk than Durant. Brown can hit unrestricted free agency in two seasons. Boston can offer him a contract extension this summer but it makes no financial sense for Brown. Durant has four guaranteed years left on his contract.

If the Celtics think Brown is likely to bolt they should be more aggressive chasing Durant. I have no idea what Brown might do in two years but I have not yet gotten the sense the Celtics are operating from some position of fear. If Brown does enter unrestricted free agency the Celtics can offer the most years and money. If Brown makes All-NBA in *either* of the next two seasons he will become eligible for a supermax extension only Boston could offer. Players rarely turn that down.

But Brown has never made All-NBA. He's never come close. He's made one All-Star appearance despite playing almost his entire career on a top team. Most advanced stats paint him as a very good player but not a great one -- something like the 20th or 25th-best player in the league. He's almost 26. If the Celtics think he has peaked that should also amp up their aggression with Durant.

Of course the Nets would want much more than Brown. The ask probably starts with Marcus Smart and multiple picks some unprotected swap rights perhaps another young player. (The Nets should ask for Robert Williams III over Smart. Maybe they'd do that if talks ever develop further. Maybe they think Boston views Williams III as a non-starter.)

The Celtics might argue Brooklyn is not in a strong negotiating position. What's the best offer right now? The Toronto Raptors don't want to even discuss Scottie Barnes sources say. Have Toronto and Brooklyn even had a detailed conversation? Do we know for sure Phoenix has offered or will offer the best it can do for now: Mikal Bridges Cameron Johnson four unprotected first-round picks and three swaps? Does Brooklyn have any interest in Miami Heat packages that don't include Bam Adebayo?

Even before the Minnesota Timberwolves warped the trade market by flipping five draft assets for Rudy Gobert several smart people around the league termed the very act of trading Durant ""impossible"" in conversations with ESPN. There was no way to approximate fair value. A player of Durant's caliber with so many years locked in had never before become available.

The Nets are probably waiting for Durant's camp to realize that and maybe for Durant to retract his trade request. The Nets have not given up on this scenario sources say.

Suitors are waiting to see if Brooklyn concludes that kind of reunion is not possible. Durant could accelerate that process by publicly or privately explaining his trade request and emphasizing he will not back off. Would such a stance mean sitting out -- as Ben Simmons did last season? I don't know. League insiders repeat the trope that Durant ""is not wired that way"" -- that he loves the game too much. But that is speculation. Time will tell.

Even if Durant reports will he be content? Will he sulk? Will trade talk become a day-to-day distraction? The Nets may not want to live that scenario. It's draining. The wild card has always been whether Joe Tsai the Nets governor would ever mandate his front office just do a deal: take 70 cents on the dollar end the melodrama move on. Rival suitors are hoping for that kind of intervention.

Every tipping of the leverage scales matters because the extras matter. Start here: If the Nets want Brown Smart and some draft equity -- say two picks and two swaps -- the Celtics should walk away.

That is probably a minority view league-wide befuddling to the ""But it's Kevin freaking Durant!"" crowd.

Trading age 25 for 33 is risky. The notion that Boston might contend for 10 years looked absurd after their disastrous 2019 but they made the conference finals in 2020 and the Finals last season. They are doing it after all.

Durant's injury risk increases with age. He became disenchanted enough to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Warriors and he's disenchanted again. Why should any team assume they'd get even three seasons of a healthy and content Durant?

Is it worth it for just two -- the length of Brown's current deal? Not if the deal includes Smart and draft equity. Boston's starting five in that scenario might be Brogdon Tatum Durant Al Horford and Williams III. The core bench: Derrick White Grant Williams Payton Pritchard and Gallinari.

That's a great team -- probably title favorites! But they are nothing like the Durant-era Warriors in terms of championship probability and it's easy to envision how they might fall short. Brogdon misses dozens of games every season. White was afraid to shoot in several high-leverage playoff games. Pritchard struggled to stay on the floor against the Heat and Warriors; he's 24 barely a year younger than Brown. Grant Williams is solid but how much better will he get?

Williams III hadn't appeared in more than 52 games before 2021-22; he suffered a meniscus injury late last season and played through knee pain in the playoffs. Horford is 36. He had a major bounce back after essentially taking a season off with the Thunder. What does he look like after a long playoff run? What about at age 38?

Smart might be Boston's best passer. He just won Defensive Player of the Year! Boston had by far the league's best defense from mid-January on and its scheme depends in large part on Smart's ability to switch across every position.

Smart is more to Boston than a good player. He's a keystone in its structural identity. Brogdon and White are good defenders but they can't do what Smart does. You almost have to reimagine the team's very constitution with a regular point guard in Smart's place. Meanwhile defense may be the part of Durant's game that declines first with age.

Trading Brown Smart and picks for Durant makes Boston bigger older and thinner. It probably improves their title odds this season but not enough -- here at least -- to justify the hit to Boston's medium- and long-term future. (Durant should also want Smart on the Celtics if he ends up there.)

Boston is already in the inner circle of contenders. Even if you consider their postseason run overblown the totality of that run and Boston's utter demolition of the league in the last half of the regular-season suggests a truly great team coalescing.

The upside of opening the vault for Durant is a slightly better chance at the ring now. The downside scenario is Tatum entering unrestricted free agency in 2026 looking around and asking: How can I win big with this? Trading Brown Smart and picks for Durant would make it harder for Boston to upgrade as Durant ages. Keeping that stuff would put Boston in play for a third star around Tatum and Brown or help them upgrade one smaller deal at a time.

It's easy to counter all this. Tatum is a good bet to hit supermax eligibility ahead of his potential free agency; it's doubtful he'd turn down such a windfall. Smart's trade value may never be higher. Great teams low on trade assets -- like the hypothetical Durant-Tatum Celtics -- can always find buyout guys. And if Tatum is a legitimate No. 1 superstar isn't he alone enough to keep Boston afloat amid any doomsday scenario -- and buy the front-office time?

If Boston somehow convinced the Nets to accept White in Smart's place Brooklyn would demand more draft compensation -- say three picks and two swaps. White's theoretical inclusion should at least make Boston lose some sleep. That's a hard one. In the end I'd lean toward declining and keeping the future wide open.

One reason: Brown may still have room to grow as a playmaker. His weak spots are real. His handle gets wonky and he loses his balance at weird times; handsy defenders can swipe the ball from him and a lot of Brown's stumbling heaves out of traffic are lollipops -- prey for pick-six steals.

He sometimes holds the ball one beat too long instead of making the simple play:

He misses some passes or sees them late:

These blips of bad timing show up in mundane plays:

Dish that early and Smart has an open triple. Instead Brown brings the defense toward Smart.

He played a big role in some of Boston's late-game playoff meltdowns. He would sometimes go one-on-one against good defenders instead of using screens to generate favorable switches:

Brown's inexplicable last-minute drive at Adebayo with Boston nursing a lead nearly cost the Celtics Game 7 of the conference finals.

Some of this is tunnel-vision. Some is Brown's earned confidence in his driving and finishing. He is a rampaging downhill driver and can rise up for tricky floaters turnarounds and step-backs over smaller defenders. He has hit 48% on long 2s over the last two seasons -- an elite number. Those are playoff shots.

There is evidence beyond Brown's assists that he is making real strides as a secondary ball handler. Brown ran 18.2 pick-and-rolls per 100 possessions up from 12 the year before per Second Spectrum. (Durant ran about 18.6.) Boston averaged 1.05 points when Brown shot out of those actions or dished to a teammate who fired -- 26th among 181 ball handlers with at least 200 pick-and-rolls. Durant ranked 11th at 1.084 points per possession.

Brown recorded assists out of pick-and-rolls at a career-high rate per Second Spectrum. His numbers out of isolations are trending the same way and were almost on par with Durant's.

He grew more comfortable against conservative pick-and-roll coverages learning to freeze help defenders and whip the ball to corner shooters:

He would occasionally slow down in the lane trap defenders on his hip and wait for the defense to expose something:

Weaponizing his pull-up 3 would be a game-changer against those schemes. Four seasons ago Brown attempted only 29 pull-up 3s. A year later he shot an ugly 29% on 1.7 attempts per game. He hit 35% on 2.5 per game last season and drained 19-of-44 in the playoffs. The work is paying off.

Brown's bag is getting deeper. He has nasty hesitation dribbles with both hands:

He can transition from hesitations to filthy crossovers in both directions. Sit on that and Brown might fake the crossover and zip into a right-handed in-and-out dribble -- a move that gets him going downhill.

Brown will always be mechanical. He's sometimes slow reading blitzes -- retreating too far instead of threading a quick bounce pass to his screener. He's at ease when he knows what's coming but gets tentative and confused when opponents switch schemes on the fly. You rarely see Brown throw pocket passes. His timing and touch on entry passes and lobs to Williams III are iffy.

He seems to prefer a clear open floor. Boston rarely runs complex multi-player actions for him and has several pet plays -- including corner sets -- designed to catapult him into space with easy reads in front of him.

But you see growth. Brown makes the simple play more than he used to. Boston's offensive ecosystem doesn't always help him; spacing is sometimes cramped and a lot of players stand still off the ball. (Brown could move around a little more too; he's a regular 40%-plus on catch-and-shoot 3s.)

He is beginning to realize all the options that open up when he is either screener or ball handler in unconventional wing-wing pick-and-rolls designed to hunt mismatches; Brown and Tatum have only scratched the surface of how they might work in tandem:

The gap between where Brown is now and a regular All-NBA candidate is perhaps the hardest one to cross. Maybe Brown never bridges it. But he's showing glimpses of the right kinds of gains.

These are really hard choices. Reasonable and smart executives can disagree. Brown and the Celtics are good enough now that Boston can wager on continuity -- and on Brown improving -- instead of tossing away too much of its future for Durant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZnVuZG1lLmNvbS9mL3N1cHBvcnQtbXktZ2lybHMtYW5kLWhlbHAtZ2l2ZS10aGVtLXN0YWJpbGl0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Donate to Pls help 2 support & give stability to my girls organized by Nina Lowe,"Nina here….This is not an easy thing to write but a gofundme page has been suggested by some good friends and it’s time for me to swallow my pride and reach out to my loved ones for some help for the girls and the hard months they face ahead.

My friends and family keep asking me what they can do to help me and I’m not great at accepting help from people….so tend just to plod on and always turn down financial help…. but have definitely got better at accepting everyday emotional and physical support/help with myself and the girls! But….I have one massive worry hanging over my mind as things progress with my illness which would be a huge relief to know that it was perhaps partly sorted before I pass away.

As many of you know I am now receiving end of life/palliative care through St Columba’s hospice having stopped chemotherapy a while back as it was making me extremely ill. With a poor prognosis even with treatment it definitely became a case of quality over quantity and since no chemo had worked for over 2 1/2 years anyway it was the correct choice. It felt like the chemo was killing me quicker than the cancer. However I didn’t realise how quickly the cancer would take over my body the pain has been horrendous as my lung has filled with malignant pleural fluid and the cancer has started wrapping itself around my kidneys….and just spreading overall quite quickly…. but the hospice team are on the case constantly and have been amazing. I had my lung drained of fluid 3 weeks ago and in that time the fluid has collected back up to the same point so is needing drained again. It gives me relief for about a week so is definitely worth it but at the same time I know this fluid collection makes my prognosis even worse. The hospice team are looking to get me in to stay for a short while to get on top of all these symptoms mainly my breathing and pain which will be a great help. So for now I will spend hopefully most of my time at home with the girls and will have overnights in the hospice when neeeded.

As a single parent my only worry is my girls. All I wish for when I pass away is that they have some sort of stability during their grieving process and that they are able to stay in our current rented flat for as long as possible. This will mean their dad has to move up from down south (something I think we have finally agreed on ) and leave all his freelance work to look for something up here. I would be utterly heartbroken if the girls had to move away from everything they know just after losing me. These thoughts are tormenting me. Therefore I am looking to raise enough money to pay the current rent on our house for at least 6 months (£7200) in the hope of giving them a bit of stability in the months after I have gone. This would give me so much comfort it really would mean the world to me.





Despite everything I have gone through the past 5 years I have never wanted to burden people so rarely reach out for help so this is an incredibly difficult thing for me to do. If you can help you have no idea how much that would mean and would bring a lot of peace to me. Equally I know how hard times are just now so please don’t feel any worry or guilt if you are not able to help out.





I’ve thought about a million ways to say goodbye and I’ve realised….there is just no way to say goodbye. I am not ready to leave you all. My heart is broken. It does not break for me….only for those I leave behind. My darling children. My amazing family. My close beautiful friends. My loves and of course our new puppy. Just everyone who has been there for me you have all made me have the most wonderful life. I feel incredibly blessed. I guess I am really one of the lucky ones too as not many people get to even say goodbye.

The crash happened on April 6 2021 near the Glades Road exit.

According to the arrest report investigators said 39-year-old Gregory Scott Lowe intentionally cut off another driver in the southbound lanes. The move caused a second car a Toyota Camry to spin off the highway and crash into a guardrail before overturning and hitting a third car.

Daquan Smith Jr. 16 of Apoka was ejected from the Camry and killed.



A driver of a private ambulance followed Lowe who was driving a black Ford Connect transit passenger van. Authorities said the witness was going at least 80 miles-per-hour in the effort to track Lowe after the crash and that Lowe ""was still creating distance between them."" Lowe according to investigators eventually stopped about 2500 feet down the highway.

The ambulance driver said he called 911 before the crash because he saw the driver taunt the other vehicle and cut him off at least three times. ""It was very obvious this was going to escalate or end p in a crash"" the witness said.

According to the arrest report when the witness approached Lowe on the side of the highway an enraged Lowe started to make comments. ""People are always cutting me off in this m----------r!"" And ""That same vehicle cut me off last week.""



The passenger in the Camry told investigators ""He was riding us telling us to go fast like somebody wanting you to speed up and he got mad at my husband because he was not going as fast as he wanted to go so he came back talking junk and sideswiped us.""

Lowe told investigators he saw the male driver of the Camry make hand gestures and possibly a middle finger as if he was being told to get out of the way or move. He said he changed lanes to get away from the driver of the Camry. He also said he changed lanes to get ready for the exit two miles away. Lowe also claimed he was behind the Camry which didn't match statements from witnesses.

""My van was not contacted I did not hit anybody and drive away"" Lowe told investigators. He also admitted to smoking recreational marijuana on April 3 three days before the crash.

Lowe of Greenacres agreed to a blood test. He tested positive for Delta-9 THC Hydroxy-THC Carboxy-THC but negative for ethyl alcohol.

He faces one count of vehicular manslaughter and three counts of aggravated battery.

After that Lowe went on to tenures with the bands Brinsley Schwarz Rockpile and Little Village and of course a solo career that started in 1978 and produced hits such as “Cruel to Be Kind” “So It Goes” and “I Knew the Bride (when She Used to Rock ‘n’ Roll.” As a producer Lowe was behind the board for key recordings by Elvis Costello the Pretenders the Damned Dr. Feelgood John Hiatt and his onetime father-in-law Johnny Cash among others.

All of that has given Lowe 73 plenty of significant anniversaries but over five and a half decades he’s learned to take them in stride.

“It’s hard to believe that it’s that long ago really” Lowe says by phone from England in front of his current North American tour with the instrumental band Los Straitjackets. “I don’t feel that different really than the way I did when it came out — but when I shave and look in the bathroom mirror I say ‘My God who’s this old goat staring at me?! Where did HE come from?’

“But I’m very lucky to be still at it and not having to be on some sort of grim oldies circuit. I’m very happy about that.”

If he were so inclined Lowe has plenty of laurels to rest on — not the least of which is “(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace Love and Understanding” a song he wrote for Brinsley Schwarz which released it in 1974. Costello and his band the Attractions popularized it on the group’s “Armed Forces” album five years later and it’s been covered by a number of artists since. John Lennon quoted it during his last interview with Rolling Stone magazine in 1980 and Bill Murray sang it during the karaoke scene in the 2003 film “Lost in Translation.”

A version by Curtis Stigers was also included on the soundtrack to “The Bodyguard” which sold seven million copies worldwide and Lowe has acknowledged brought the songwriter his first and only seven-figure royalty payment.

“It’s a really really strange thing; it’s never exactly been a hit but everybody sort of knows it” Lowe says. “I can remember very very clearly writing it because as I’ve said in the past that was the first sort of original idea I’d ever had. Up ’til then I was copying my heroes and then I can remember sitting in my room strumming away and getting that idea and going ‘God this is actually original. What’s happened to you?!’

“But of course I had no idea what would happen with the song. It’s extraordinary.”

Lowe is however sorry that the question posed by the song’s title still resonates especially in the wake of the war in Ukraine and civil unrest around the world.

“It’s a really strange thing playing it” he acknowledges. “People get really sort of moved over it and when it first started happening I used to get a little bit testy and say ‘Oh come on pull yourselves together! It’s not that bloody good!’ I’ve tried saying something a little jokey before I play it like ‘The hippie in me looks forward to a time when this song will be absolutely redundant — but not my publisher’ or something like that. But then I see people laughing but being a bit sort of hurt somehow that I’d say something that crass about it.

“So you have this kind of responsibility I suppose. I’ve never spoken about it in this way before but it is an odd thing to have come up with.”

Lowe’s most recent recordings meanwhile have been made with Los Straitjackets the masked quartet that’s been his primary touring band since 2015. It seemed an odd pairing at first but after seven years of touring and a pair of EPs it’s become Lowe’s longest-lasting association with any one band.

“I think it comes down to they’re an extremely good group” explains Lowe adding with a chuckle that he left the mask they once gave him “in the dressing room.” “I know they have this well-known gimmick with the masks and also they’re an instrumental band — probably the only one left now. We share a manager…so it wasn’t that much of a leap for us to work together.

“They take what they do very seriously but they don’t take themselves very seriously and that’s what I’ve always been attracted to. Those sorts of musicians are the ones that I think are the best really. They’re quite naughty as well which I also like but they’re extremely agreeable people to tour with and it doesn’t really feel like they’re backing me up even though it’s my name on the marquee and we do mainly my tunes.”

More of those are in the offing though Lowe demurs on how many and when. “I tend to write spasmodically so it’s not exactly an avalanche” he says. His last release “Lay It On Me” came out during June of 2020 and Lowe says he’s as interested in finding older less-played songs in his catalog to play with Los Straitjackets as he is to put out something new.

“That (new material) used to be one of the things I was very keen on doing” Lowe says. “But the older I’ve gotten the more I seem to have lost the sort of desire to do that. I think as you get older you tend to lose the sort of desire to tell people stuff. So I’m not really driven anymore like I once was — but that’s OK. I’ve been at this a long time. I don’t think I’m gonna run out of songs to play.”

The company announced this week that it has raised $80 million (KRW 108.5 billion) in a Series C round at a valuation of $529 million (KRW 723 billion) which has surged more than eight times from its Series B funding about $15 million in 2021.

The Series C funding which brings its total raise to around $95 million will go toward mass production of the startup’s inaugural products — DX-V1 DX-V3 DX-M1 and DX-H1 — in late 2024 for global distribution. The startup will also use the new capital to expedite developing and launching its next generation of large language model (LLM) on-device solutions.

DEEPX was founded in 2018 by CEO Lokwon Kim who previously worked at Apple Cisco Systems the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center and Broadcom.

The market size of global edge AI also called on-device AI is projected to reach $107.47 billion by 2029 up from $11.98 billion in 2021 according to a recent report. “The on-device AI market excluding edge servers requires AI capabilities to be implemented bypassing servers or the cloud” Kim told TechCrunch. “The [on-device AI market] is expanding due to computer vision capabilities like facial and voice recognition smart mobility robotics the internet of things and physical security systems.”

Kim said that if its mass production begins this year potential customers such as end-product manufacturers will be able to commercialize their products with DEEPX’s AI chips in 2025.

DEEPX which has around 65 employees is not the only company that has developed AI chip solutions. The Korean outfit competes with Hailo which landed a $120 million funding round last month; SiMa.ai which closed on $70 million also in April; and Axelera a Belgium-based AI chip startup that secured $27 million in 2022.

Kim said that his company’s differentiators include cost efficiency energy consumption efficiency and All-in-4 AI Total Solution a comprehensive solution for various AI applications. Its All-in-4 AI solutions include: DX-V1 and DX-V3 designed for vision systems in home appliances surveillance camera systems robot vision and drones; as well as DX-M1 and DX-H1 which are designed for AI computing boxes AI servers smart factories and AI booster chips. DEEPX now has more than 259 patents pending in the U.S. China and South Korea Kim said.

“Nvidia’s GPGPU-based solutions are the most cost-effective for large language model services like ChatGPT; the total power consumed by GPUs operating has reached levels exceed the electrical energy of an entire country” Kim said. “This collaborative operation technology between server-scale AI and on-device large AI models are expected to reduce energy consumption and costs a lot compared to relying solely on data centers.”

The startup does not have customers yet but is collaborating with more than 100 potential clients and strategic partners such as Hyundai Kia Motors Robotics Lab and Korean IT company POSCO DX to test DEEPX’s AI chip capabilities.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9lc3BuL2JldHRpbmcvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC80MDEwMjE2Ni9taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1wYXJsYXktdGlja2V0LWJldHRvci1va2xhaG9tYS1jaXR5LXRodW5kZXItdGV4YXMtcmFuZ2Vycy1rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1jaGllZnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ticket of dreams? One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

""[I'm] relieved that I get a day to breathe"" Shelton told ESPN Wednesday morning. ""Awesome game and environment.""

This was the only game of the series Shelton was planning on attending. Now it's back to Arizona where the largest sweat of his life -- and perhaps others -- will continue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Ukrainian M-2 Sneaked Up On A Russian Tank—And Hit From A Mile Away,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/05/08/a-ukrainian-m-2-fighting-vehicle-sneaked-up-on-a-russian-t-80-tank-at-night-and-hit-it-with-a-missile-from-a-mile-away/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2RhdmlkYXhlLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvYS11a3JhaW5pYW4tbS0yLWZpZ2h0aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtc25lYWtlZC11cC1vbi1hLXJ1c3NpYW4tdC04MC10YW5rLWF0LW5pZ2h0LWFuZC1oaXQtaXQtd2l0aC1hLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS1hLW1pbGUtYXdheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3VzLW5ld3MvdGVlbnMta2lja2VkLW91dC1vZi1sdXhlLWNhdGhvbGljLXNjaG9vbC1mb3ItYmxhY2tmYWNlLWF3YXJkZWQtMW0v0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvdXMtbmV3cy90ZWVucy1raWNrZWQtb3V0LW9mLWx1eGUtY2F0aG9saWMtc2Nob29sLWZvci1ibGFja2ZhY2UtYXdhcmRlZC0xbS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teens kicked out of elite Catholic school for 'blackface' are awarded $1M by jury after proving it was just acne mask,"Two teens kicked out of their elite California Catholic school while falsely accused of wearing blackface have been jointly awarded more than $1 million after proving it was just a green acne face mask.

The then-students at Saint Francis High School in Mountain View were just 14 when they took a photo during a sleepover in 2017 of them wearing the treatment in solidarity with a friend suffering from severe acne their lawsuit said.

The treatment bought by one of the boys’ mom was light green when applied and turned dark green once dry.

Their “innocent” selfie then went viral three years later when it was found and widely shared during the height of the Black Lives Matter protests following the 2020 murder of George Floyd.

A Santa Clara County jury agreed this week that the school breached an oral contract and did not give them due process before expelling them in 2020 according to the Los Angeles Times.

The students identified only as A.H. and H.H. in the lawsuit were awarded $500000 each and will have their $70000 tuition reimbursed.

“This case is significant not only for our clients but for its groundbreaking effect on all private high schools in California which are now legally required to provide fair procedure to students before punishing or expelling them” said Krista Baughman one of the attorneys for the students.

“The jury rightly confirmed that Saint Francis High School’s procedures were unfair to our clients and that the school is not above the law.”

In a statement A.H.’s family said: “We want to sincerely thank the jury and the court system for helping our boys and our families find justice which now paves the way for their names to be cleared for things they never did.”

The lawsuit had initially sought $20 million. The jury rejected some of the boys’ claims including defamation and violation of free speech.

Representatives for the school said they “respectfully disagree” with the jury’s decision and are “exploring legal options” including an appeal."

Incumbent U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) is running in a well-publicized primary election for the newly-drawn District 12 which includes Dearborn most of Dearborn Heights western Detroit neighborhoods and some new communities to the north.

Though she faces competition from hopefuls from the local Democratic political world Tlaib has a wide lead in terms of financing raising some $2.8 million since last year.

One of her opponents on the Democratic ballot Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey is seeing campaign support from pro-corporate and pro-Israeli occupation sources that have pledged upwards of $1 million on ads to help her unseat the Palestinian American Tlaib.

Tlaib can safely rely on support from voters amenable to platforms espoused by “progressive” Democrats like fellow members of the congressional “Squad” who rallied for her at a fundraising event in Detroit last weekend.

Against a backdrop of dark money attacks against two popular incumbents Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders was showed support for both Tlaib and U.S. Rep. Andy Levin (D-Bloomfield Township) who is running for the newly-drawn 11th District at a rally in Pontiac last Friday.

Lathrup Village Mayor Kelly Garrett and former State Rep. Shanelle Jackson are also running as Democrats. The primary includes two Republicans Steven Elliott and Dearborn Heights resident Hassan Nehme.

“A special place”

Besides the potential to represent historic cities outside of her current district like Southfield and Livonia the 2022 election is significant in that Arab American-concentrated communities in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights now have a chance of electing one of their own to represent them in the U.S. Congress.

“I grew up in southwest Detroit which always touched different beautifully diverse communities predominantly Latino and Black as well as second-generation people from Poland and Hungry” Tlaib told The Arab American News this week. “Of course my grandmother is from the Southend of Dearborn. My mother finally gets to vote for me being a Dearborn resident now.”

Tlaib said that much of the work she started while representing southwest Detroit will be issues of importance to Dearborn residents but her upbringing will also be a boon to the new district.

“Now they can have someone that understands the lived experience of being Arab and being Muslim in America also raising two Muslim boys in America someone that has seen her own family impacted by the erasure of civil liberties having a sister on the no-fly list the fact that I’ve had Palestinian immigrant parents — it’s all incredibly important” Tlaib said.

Tlaib said she always envied the confidence young people had about their identity in neighboring Dearborn a city she called a “special place” but is grateful for her own childhood attending predominantly Black schools.

But Tlaib is no stranger to issues affecting working class Arab families in her own current district like the Yemeni American families in the McGraw/Lonyo area and new Iraqi American residents in Warrendale. She also currently represents a part of Dearborn Heights.

In-district receipts

Her current district covers Wayne County neighborhoods along the heavily industrialized Rouge River area which have seen decades of pollution that has created a sustained public health crisis.

Tlaib said she was intentional about bringing former presidential candidates Senator (Elizabeth) Warren and Sanders to the Southend of Dearborn to show them how the area’s air monitor detects the worst air quality in the state of Michigan.

“Many of our working class communities are the target of corporate pollution and I’m a person that has taken them on” Tlaib said. “From being an attorney that has filed an injunction against those that have literally dumped petroleum coke that can cause cancer to introducing bills like Environmental Justice for All voters can have faith that I don’t take money from people that are poisoning them.”

The Urban Empowerment Action PAC supporting Winfrey is funded by wealthy New York-based hedge fund founder Daniel Loeb an investor in Marathon Oil one of the worst polluters in the area.

Tlaib launched an investigation into Marathon Oil for its role in funding front groups and lobbying to weaken vehicles’ fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards.

Many of our working class communities are the target of corporate pollution and I’m a person that has taken them on… voters can have faith that I don’t take money from people that are poisoning them. — U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit)

Other in-district highlights or receipts touted by the Tlaib campaign include creating four Neighborhood Service Centers throughout her district that assist thousands of residents with constituent services including supporting residents with utility and water payments ensuring residents applied for FEMA assistance after 2021’s flooding and advocacy on landlord/tenant issues and legal services.

During the pandemic Tlaib helped ensure that her district was included in the latest CDC eviction moratorium.

Tlaib has also consistently shown up for immigrant and ethnic families struggling from the unfair criminal justice and immigration practices.

She said voters in the newly-drawn district are becoming increasingly frustrated by attack ads funded by outside pro-corporate money.

“My residents know I’m not going to sell them out to those that profit from our broken health care system from environmental injustices” Tlaib said. “On August 2 folks will see that what we’ve been able to do in these last almost four years is incredibly popular and very much supported by our residents. They know how important it is to move with urgency and being unwavering and understanding that other people’s oppression is connected to ours.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Megan Joyce Mohn 40 was arrested on January 11 and passed away in the hospital 19 days later.

On Thursday nearly six months after her death the Utah Office of the Medical Examiner released the results of Mohn's autopsy. It declared her death as a homicide and specifically determined the cause of her death as ""anoxic brain injury” due to “cardiac arrest” due to “probable methamphetamine intoxication in the setting of an altercation involving physical restraint"" according to a press release issued Saturday by SLCPD.

Details on how this conclusion was determined were not immediately available.

The department activated the OICI protocol on Friday after learning of the medical examiner's findings and after consulting with the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office. This involves an investigation into the incident by members of outside police agencies in the county.

The Salt Lake County Law Enforcement Task Force defines an OICI as:

I) The use of a dangerous weapon by an officer against a person that causes injury to any person;

II) A fatal injury to any person except the officer resulting from the use of a motor vehicle by an officer;

III) The death of a person who is in law enforcement custody but not including deaths that are the result of disease natural causes or conditions that have been medically diagnosed prior to the person’s death; or

IV) A fatal injury to a person resulting from the efforts of an officer attempting to prevent a person’s escape from custody make an arrest or otherwise gain physical control of a person.

According to a statement from the police department officers were called to the Marathon Petroleum refinery on the north side of Salt Lake City early in the morning of Jan. 11 because Mohn was causing a disturbance and attempting to trespass on private property.

Around 3:15 a.m. a security guard for Marathon told an SLCPD officer that a woman (later identified as Mohn) was “walking in circles carrying a piece of rebar"" in the intersection of 400 West and 900 North.

The officer who was working a ""secondary employment shift"" for Marathon at the time learned that Mohn had tried to get into a secure area of the refinery through a truck exit gate. However she was stopped by a truck driver and then ran off of the property and back into the intersection.

The officer approached Mohn around 3:30 a.m. and told her to drop the rebar and she complied. A private security guard who was also at the scene told investigators that Mohn was ""screaming incoherent language"" resisting arrest and trying to run from the officer. The officer was able to get her into custody and seated on the grass about five minutes later and called for backup according to the department's press release.

However police say Mohn later began to resist officers and kicked one of them multiple times while ""screaming randomly."" Officers then moved her from a seated position onto her stomach then applied leg restraints after she continued kicking. After doing so officers said they noticed that she stopped yelling and resisting.

""The sudden change in behavior and lack of physical and verbal response from Ms. Mohn prompted an officer on scene to immediately recommend that Ms. Mohn be placed into the “recovery position"""" the statement from SLCPD read.

Police said she was breathing but unresponsive. Officers attempted to wake her and administered naloxone which is a drug used to reverse opioid overdoses. She still did not react so they removed the restraints and began CPR at about 3:50 a.m.

Salt Lake City Fire Department personnel responded and continued CPR and Mohn was taken to Salt Lake Regional Hospital in critical condition.

At the hospital officers were told by medical staff that the woman's condition was improving and that she was expected to recover. Several hours later hospital staff confirmed that her condition was not life-threatening.

On Jan. 28 just over two weeks after her arrest Mohn was moved to the intensive care unit. She died two days later.

However SLCPD said they were not told that she was moved to the ICU or that she died until Feb. 9.

After learning about Mohn's death the department consulted with the county attorney's office which said the situation ""did not qualify as an officer-involved-critical-incident at that time"" so they waited for the results from the autopsy.

The medical examiner's office released the results Thursday and (as written above) ruled Mohn's death as a homicide with the specific cause of her death being ""anoxic brain injury” due to “cardiac arrest” due to “probable methamphetamine intoxication in the setting of an altercation involving physical restraint.""

Police said that while Mohn was in the hospital they found methamphetamine spice and alcohol among her possessions.

“Police officers make incredibly important and difficult decisions at lightning speed and under incredible stress and volatility. These decisions are heavily scrutinized” SLCPD Chief Mike Brown said in the written press release. “Our officers acted appropriately quickly and professionally to save Ms. Mohn’s life. We welcome and respect the officer-involved-critical-incident protocol. We have confidence this will be a fair and judicious process guided by the rule of law and grounded in evidence.”

Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill says he welcomes the Chief's request for his office to investigate the matter.

“Is a desire to be transparent to try to be above board to sort of invoke the protocol because they were the responding agency"" Gill said. “So we have to kind of look through to see is it tied to the initial incident? Is it tied to subsequent care?...And that is what we are going to sift through…and that’s our process.”

Mohn was officially charged with five criminal counts on Feb. 2 — which was after she had died but before police learned of her death. Her charges were dismissed later that month according to court records.

The four officers involved in her arrest have been placed on administrative leave as per protocol and SLCPD said body-worn camera footage from the incident will be released.

FOX 13 News discussed this case with Chris Bertram a local retired deputy police chief who is now a private investigator and criminal justice professor.

“If this person had died from for instance a medical reason then it's not going to be a homicide"" Bertram said. ""It's maybe circumstances that you know other health conditions other health issues and I think that may have been the complicating factor.”

He also said there's a chance the officers involved could be placed back on duty — partially because the incident in question happened months ago as well as for workforce reasons.

“Salt Lake City has as a manpower issue"" said Bertram. ""And I know that four officers would put a strain although that doesn't seem like a lot for a big department it does. It causes a strain especially in the summer months when you have more people out.”

Incumbent U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) is running in a well-publicized primary election for the newly-drawn District 12 which includes Dearborn most of Dearborn Heights western Detroit neighborhoods and some new communities to the north.

Though she faces competition from hopefuls from the local Democratic political world Tlaib has a wide lead in terms of financing raising some $2.8 million since last year.

One of her opponents on the Democratic ballot Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey is seeing campaign support from pro-corporate and pro-Israeli occupation sources that have pledged upwards of $1 million on ads to help her unseat the Palestinian American Tlaib.

Tlaib can safely rely on support from voters amenable to platforms espoused by “progressive” Democrats like fellow members of the congressional “Squad” who rallied for her at a fundraising event in Detroit last weekend.

Against a backdrop of dark money attacks against two popular incumbents Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders was showed support for both Tlaib and U.S. Rep. Andy Levin (D-Bloomfield Township) who is running for the newly-drawn 11th District at a rally in Pontiac last Friday.

Lathrup Village Mayor Kelly Garrett and former State Rep. Shanelle Jackson are also running as Democrats. The primary includes two Republicans Steven Elliott and Dearborn Heights resident Hassan Nehme.

“A special place”

Besides the potential to represent historic cities outside of her current district like Southfield and Livonia the 2022 election is significant in that Arab American-concentrated communities in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights now have a chance of electing one of their own to represent them in the U.S. Congress.

“I grew up in southwest Detroit which always touched different beautifully diverse communities predominantly Latino and Black as well as second-generation people from Poland and Hungry” Tlaib told The Arab American News this week. “Of course my grandmother is from the Southend of Dearborn. My mother finally gets to vote for me being a Dearborn resident now.”

Tlaib said that much of the work she started while representing southwest Detroit will be issues of importance to Dearborn residents but her upbringing will also be a boon to the new district.

“Now they can have someone that understands the lived experience of being Arab and being Muslim in America also raising two Muslim boys in America someone that has seen her own family impacted by the erasure of civil liberties having a sister on the no-fly list the fact that I’ve had Palestinian immigrant parents — it’s all incredibly important” Tlaib said.

Tlaib said she always envied the confidence young people had about their identity in neighboring Dearborn a city she called a “special place” but is grateful for her own childhood attending predominantly Black schools.

But Tlaib is no stranger to issues affecting working class Arab families in her own current district like the Yemeni American families in the McGraw/Lonyo area and new Iraqi American residents in Warrendale. She also currently represents a part of Dearborn Heights.

In-district receipts

Her current district covers Wayne County neighborhoods along the heavily industrialized Rouge River area which have seen decades of pollution that has created a sustained public health crisis.

Tlaib said she was intentional about bringing former presidential candidates Senator (Elizabeth) Warren and Sanders to the Southend of Dearborn to show them how the area’s air monitor detects the worst air quality in the state of Michigan.

“Many of our working class communities are the target of corporate pollution and I’m a person that has taken them on” Tlaib said. “From being an attorney that has filed an injunction against those that have literally dumped petroleum coke that can cause cancer to introducing bills like Environmental Justice for All voters can have faith that I don’t take money from people that are poisoning them.”

The Urban Empowerment Action PAC supporting Winfrey is funded by wealthy New York-based hedge fund founder Daniel Loeb an investor in Marathon Oil one of the worst polluters in the area.

Tlaib launched an investigation into Marathon Oil for its role in funding front groups and lobbying to weaken vehicles’ fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards.

Roger joined U.S. Travel in 2005 following a successful 34-year career at Marriott International. Though Roger often joked that he had no experience in lobbying prior to taking on the job as travel’s top advocate his sharp business acumen vast network of contacts and decades of experience created a lasting impact on the U.S. travel industry.

His leadership complemented by an abiding sense of optimism was essential in guiding the industry through numerous challenges over the years from the post-9/11 travel slump to the COVID-19 pandemic. Roger was a steady voice of resilience in each of these moments none more so than by rallying the industry to ensure all sectors of travel received the necessary relief to survive the pandemic and keep workers on payrolls. His role in reopening international inbound air travel and repealing the pre-departure COVID testing requirement was a turning point in the industry’s recovery.

Roger’s ability to unite the industry at such a critical time was a direct result of the decades of trust built with our members. His unique capacity to connect with others forge relationships and mentor the next generation of leaders proved invaluable. It was thanks to Roger’s vision and strong relationships that so many new and diverse organizations teamed up with our industry under the Let’s Go There campaign strengthening travel’s voice in its most urgent moment of need.

Throughout his time at U.S. Travel Roger’s forward-thinking approach resulted in significant legislative victories including the establishment and renewal of Brand USA. Due to these efforts—as well as his oversight of U.S. Travel’s IPW trade show and the addition of more than a dozen nations to the Visa Waiver Program—inbound travel to the U.S. has increased 61% during Roger’s tenure.

And speaking of IPW…Roger is not just a staple of the U.S. travel industry but an icon of the global travel community. Anyone who has ever walked a trade show floor with him knows the respect and admiration that our international delegates have for Roger. The energy and productivity of IPW is a testament to his longstanding efforts to elevate the importance of professional meetings and events and the value of conducting business face to face. For his final IPW as head of the association this year delegates from around the world came together to show their appreciation for Roger and his countless contributions to our industry.

But perhaps most importantly Roger has been a tireless advocate of the power of travel and its capacity to bring people together. Roger’s belief that travel can break down barriers connect those of different backgrounds and open our eyes to new and treasured experiences is the ethos of our industry; that the true value of travel is not calculated in dollars but in the cherished memories that are made when we explore this great country and all that it has to offer.

As we say goodbye to Roger we’d like to end on one of his favorite quotes from Mark Twain the essence of which is at the very heart of the industry he has led for 17 years:

“Travel is fatal to prejudice bigotry and narrow-mindedness.”

Thank you Roger for everything.

A little over a year ago CNBC reported on remote workers who’d simply moved into the great outdoors “working from internet hotspots in their vans and spending their free time in nature and exploring new places.” But Kenzo Fong CEO of the tech company Rock did it only during the day using his van as a mobile remote office parking in various locations around San Francisco.

Great chat with @Levitskyyy at @protocol about how I run Rock from my converted sprinter van! By working asynchronous keeping meetings limited and using Rock to simplify how work happens I’ve been able to build my startup while on the road. Read 👇https://t.co/FgE5x93YBs — Kenzo Fong (@kenzofong) October 23 2021

Still not everyone wants to work in a van — and for those people there are hotels.

DoubleTree by Hilton Springfield is offering special day-rate hotel rooms to serve as a private workspace with reliable internet access to folks who are working remote. To reserve a hotel room for the day please call 417-831-3131 and refer to “Day Rate”. pic.twitter.com/EOo6BkEekT — DoubleTree SGF (@Doubletreesgf) March 20 2020

More than two years after that tweet the DoubleTree hotel in Springfield Missouri is still offering a reduced “day rate” to try to attract remote workers. “Yeah absolutely” a hotel employee confirmed in a phone interview this week noting it’s usually 50% of the regular room rate.)

While there was a spike during the peak of the pandemic “It’s not as popular now as it may have been” the helpful clerk noted.

Hilton also has a webpage promising “remote working without distractions.” The hotel site promised that “Our day-use rooms include a spacious desk ergonomic chair and enhanced WiFi — offering you a clean flexible and distraction-free environment for productive remote working.”

And Marriott hotels are now touting remote worker-friendly venues inviting potential customers to “maximize your productivity so you can get the most out of your workday.” Its website lists 18 different locations offering 12-hour day passes — 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. — including “complimentary bottled water” in facilities “where the WiFi is as strong as the coffee.”

And some hotels are now taking things much much further seeing remote workers as the next growth sector of the market and ambitiously offering luxurious remote-working experiences to try to attract their business.

Is a major cultural shift happening right before our eyes?

Saving the Hotel Industry?

Earlier this year a hospitality management school in Switzerland asked their industry’s burning question: “is this growing mobile workforce in fact an unprecedented opportunity for hotels?”

The school’s website goes on to say “From independent hotel venture Zoku in Amsterdam which pioneered the hybrid hospitality-concept to Eaton House in Hong Kong or the Virgin hotel in Chicago or from bigger chains like Ace Hotel or Moxy by Marriott the concept of encouraging flexible working in hotels has been tried and tested and proven its appeal and success.”

The site argues that the change is partly driven by a drop in international travelers — both business travelers and tourists — due to the travel restrictions imposed by various countries. For hotels seeking to adapt “turning to a different kind of guest and local customer is proving a smart way to boost business.”

One added advantage? This ultimately leaves hotels “more integrated and connected with the city and neighborhood in which they find themselves.”

Other industry observers agree. “Hoteliers are wise to work their assets in new ways as they cope with changes to their industry” noted a columnist in the Economist last week pointing out that “business travel is after all unlikely to return to pre-pandemic patterns for a while if ever.”

But hotels catering to remote workers can take many forms with some now trying to morph into co-working facilities.

In 2018 the hotel consulting service Horwath HTL released a report noting hotels were already adding more common areas and shared spaces while turning their business centers into coworking spaces.

But the pandemic may have accelerated that trend since the multinational hospitality company Accor now brags that more than 600 different companies are using its branded “Wojo” coworking spaces in Europe making daily use of its common areas and coworking spaces as well as its private offices and meeting rooms. A promotional page points out that the company is planning to expand it into more than 500 sites and locations.

Their pitch to remote workers includes promises of “a personalized welcome designer surroundings a friendly atmosphere and reliable secure Wi-Fi connection.” A promotional video pushes their offering even harder asking what is work — really? “A 9-to-5? An office…? Let’s be honest that was so 2000… Our habits have changed and so should our mindset…”

“Calling all audacious businessmen and women inspired startuppers world players influential adventurers tech geeks old school traders quirky artists — yeah them too — and everything in between. We welcome you in all our workplaces…

“What if we no longer saw work as a place but as an opportunity…?”

Ditching Distractions

Accor is far from the only hotel that’s begun chasing this trend and pursuing the remote worker market.

Since 2017 the Crowne Plaza hotel chain (spread across nearly 100 different countries) has been integrating working spaces into its lobbies with communal seating semi-private seating — and a dedicated private meeting space that can be reserved by the hour. And in 2019 even an upscale chain of hotels known as The Hoxton added co-working facilities to two of its hotels one in London and one in Chicago. “Like working from home without the distractions” brags its webpage.

That page also claims their comfy sofas have been “the unofficial workspace of choice” since 2006 adding “We’re coworking but better with nice perks rip-off-free rates and none of the distractions of home.”

To entice remote workers the company enumerates all the hotel’s advantages. Pursuing the page for Chicago’s hotel reveals various price levels with the cheapest one being a day pass. (“Need a break working from home? Sick of setting up camp on your couch? Come and work at ours for just $30 for the day — bottomless teas and coffees included.”) There’s also espresso (and pantries with snacks) plus ergonomic chairs outdoor terraces and even daybeds equipped with Apple TVs. A laundry service is also offered — and use of the rooftop pool. Desk-side food delivery is even available from the hotel restaurants.

Last week Travel Weekly spoke to Gaurav Bhushan co-CEO of the chain’s parent company Ennismore who clarifies that the hotel also has an “open house” philosophy welcoming remote workers (and the occasional student) into common spaces to use the free WiFi — even if they’re not staying at the hotel.

“They often become prime candidates for the coworking space” Bhushan explained on the site adding that in general their co-working offering “has been very successful so far” and that it’s now become “definitely a key focus for us as we go forward” with plans to extend it to more hotels soon.

Working in the Countryside

Creative hoteliers are experimenting with many unique luxuries.

In April the Financial Times reported about paying a visit to the Birch (which launched in April of 2020). “Lying on my large bed in a light and tranquil room overlooking storm-strewn daffodil lawns I wondered if I had arrived at the future of work” wrote Emma Jacobs.

Outside Jacobs caught glimpses of roaming pigs as well as a chicken coop herb garden wellness center and swimming pool — as well as freelancers using the shared spaces (who “made me feel that I hadn’t quite escaped work.”). At its co-working facility (called The Hub) “Members seemed happy enough in co-working spaces that were fun and relaxed with the requisite tankards of free juice as well as coffees and sandwiches to buy” Jacobs wrote.

Co-founder Chris King tells the Financial Times that “Post-COVID there’s clearly a bigger audience that is interested in working near home and there’s a raft of new offers coming to market to meet this demand.”

This week the Associated Press shared another new category of remote working writing about summer vacationers who are extending the length of their vacations by working remotely for a few extra days.

Some hotel chains are now even offerings programs that allow remote workers to never check out — like Selina CoLive a “month-to-month CoLiving program” starting at just $450 a month. It’s a subscription package which according to its 2020 blog post offers “continuous month-after-month accommodation in beautiful locations across the globe.” Choose from 13 countries in Central and South America as well as five destinations in the U.S. (in Miami Chicago and Washington D.C.) and several more in the U.K. Greece Portugal and Israel — and one in Austria.

A new press release this month explained the hotel is offering accommodations at more than 60 destinations arguing that they’ve “changed the remote work landscape and enabled digital nomads to travel seamlessly across the globe.”

For higher-end travelers there’s the $2500 a month Inspirato Pass which bills itself as “the world’s first luxury travel subscription” covering all your luxury lodging fees in over 100 destinations around the world.

But is it possible to take the amenities too far? Last week the columnist in The Economist explored the idea with an in-person visit joking that “A colleague’s PowerPoint presentation would go down better by the poolside washed down with a mojito.” The reporter visited Birch a hotel in a Georgian manor on 55 acres of Hertfordshire offering a frou-frou co-working area as well as the Shangri-La hotel in the Shard (offering a special rate for room rentals from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.)

But FT also asked an inconvenient question: “how productive can workers be with all the distractions that are designed to make work not feel like work?

“The spectacular view from the Shard is less conducive to dreaming up a sales pitch (or a column) than it is to daydreaming.”

Usually once a year most major cities will hold a restaurant week showcasing major restaurants throughout the city where you can find great deals to experience the menu. Mastercard has partnered with NYC Restaurant Week to offer a $10 statement credit for every $45 you spend at one of the participating restaurants.

Mastercard’s NYC Restaurant Week Promo

Each restaurant participating in NYC Restaurant week offers a $30 $45 or $60 prix fixe meal. The price of your meal is dependent on the restaurant when you go and what meal you’re eating; be sure to call the restaurant ahead of time to confirm.

Mastercard is offering $10 back on every $45 you spend on an eligible Restaurant Week meal up to 3 separate times. So for example if you spend $45 once and then come back a second time and spend $45 you’d receive a $20 credit however if you spent $90 in 1 meal you’d only receive $10 back. If you’re going to a restaurant offering the $30 meals consider taking another person with you so you can exceed the $45 minimum.

To enroll you need to hold an eligible Mastercard. While the enrollment website doesn’t specify which specific Mastercard credit cards are eligible it’s likely that any major branded Mastercard will be accepted. To enroll your card check out the official enrollment page.

You can redeem the offer for any meal served Monday through Friday however Saturdays are exempt from the program so you won’t receive any statement credit for meals eaten then. Sunday meals may be included but it is up to the restaurant.

It’s worth noting that the prix fixe menu price doesn’t include beverages or tax and tip so you’ll want to account for these on top of the menu price.

This offer expires July 31 2022 so be sure to complete your visit prior to this date.

There are a few other things you should note about NYC Restaurant Week and the Mastercard offer:

While some meals include multiple courses the meals are intended for 1 person so if you come with 2 people you’re expected not to share and will need to order 2 meals.

Some restaurants include a mandatory gratuity in the cost of the meal.

There’s a long list of eligible restaurants and which meals are included so check out the options online.

Roula Khalaf Editor of the FT selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Leading US credit card lenders are signalling their confidence in the American consumer stepping up marketing efforts to attract new borrowers even as the economy slips into a technical recession.

After rising 47 per cent in the first quarter the volume of paper and digital mail solicitations sent by US credit card issuers increased again in the second quarter according to preliminary data from marketing research firm Competiscan putting it on track to reach a record high this year.

The wave of offers follows an 85 per cent surge last year from the depressed levels of 2020 and comes as many big card issuers said during their second-quarter earnings reports this month that they were increasing marketing spending.

JPMorgan Chase the largest US card issuer highlighted the ferocity of the competition for borrowers when it blamed higher customer acquisition costs for a 45 per cent fall in second-quarter card income.* Capital One the second-largest issuer said its quarterly marketing expenses rose 62 per cent from last year’s levels and pledged to remain aggressive.

“We continue to see opportunities to book accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns and we continue to lean into marketing to drive growth” Capital One chief executive Richard Fairbank said calling the competition “more intense than pre-pandemic levels”.

The increase in marketing activity is particularly noteworthy at this stage of the economic cycle. During uncertain times lenders typically send out fewer card offers — targeting potential borrowers with the highest credit scores — and focus on selling premium cards or making other offers to current customers.

However even as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down the highest inflation rate in more than four decades credit card lenders believe they have room to increase the size of their loan books because unemployment is low and consumer balance sheets appear healthy.

Credit card balances held by the seven largest issuers — JPMorgan Capital One Citigroup Bank of America American Express Discover and Synchrony — rose 13 per cent to $739.8bn compared with last year but remain about 9 per cent lower than they were at the end of 2019.

American Express last week raised its already bullish revenue outlook for the year as it reported higher-than-expected earnings and said its annual marketing spending would come in above its prior guidance of $5bn.

“I don’t see [a recession] in my numbers at all” chief executive Stephen Squeri told Yahoo Finance. “It’s really hard for me to get my head around that in quarter three or quarter four we’re going to have a big slowdown.”

To attract new customers issuers are embracing flashy tactics. Last month Amex rolled out a limited-edition card made from the scrap metal of retired planes. Sign-on bonuses tied to travel have become more generous although consumers so far are showing a preference for cashback cards.

Many of the marketing efforts are targeting so-called “revolvers” or borrowers who carry a balance from month to month instead of paying their statements off in full.

During the first quarter there was a 62 per cent increase in the volume of balance transfer offers that would enable consumers to consolidate debt on to a credit card interest-free for a time Competiscan said. The terms are also getting more generous. The interest-free period rose on average to 16 months this year from 14 months in 2021.

Sara Rathner an analyst at NerdWallet a personal finance website said the combination of growing balances and rising interest rates could land consumers in trouble.

“If you have credit card debt currently or you’re taking on debt for a large upcoming purchase interest rates are high they are getting higher” Rathner said. “It can spiral out of control pretty quickly.”

Complicating the task for lenders is the difficulty that they face in gauging the impact of government stimulus and debt forbearance programmes on consumers over the longer term.

“You have seen a dislocation between what had been very correlated metrics” said Brian Doubles chief executive of Synchrony the largest US store credit card issuer which increased its marketing spending by 18 per cent last quarter in line with pre-pandemic levels. “That’s really because of the effects of the stimulus and the forbearance that comes through.”

Lenders argue that new targeting tools and data analytics have made it easier to lend through a downturn without taking outsized losses.

Many lenders now analyse factors such as education employment history and checking account balances in addition to the traditional credit score to determine creditworthiness which increases the pool of potential borrowers said Megan Cipperly senior director of client services at Competiscan.

Incentives such as rate discounts for setting up automatic payments or making several consecutive on-time payments are also becoming more popular for unsecured loans.

“It reduces their chance of having delinquencies and then it creates a positive customer-lender relationship” Cipperly said. “That’s a great strategy if we’re heading into a recession.”

He was very poor. His name was Limerick. He had no wife. His only son was a boy he named Tristram. Tristram had an older sister named Gwendolyn. Gwendolyn was a girl who liked to enjoy this list of interesting facts which she had put together. Tristram was the black sheep of the family but that didn't make him any less lovable. It didn't make him less smart. Tristram was one of those people who always seems to know more than the people around him. It was a gift from God. Tristram's father was not at all happy about that. In fact Limerick hated his son's guts. Tristram was just too smart for his own good. Gwendolyn loved her brother dearly but she also knew how to be patient with her brother because Tristram wasn't always the easiest person to get along with. She knew that one day her brother would be a very famous man. Until then she had her list.

Yet it was there on the 15th floor that Shar Dubey decided on the sentimental and sexual lives of a growing part of the planet.

Romantic people are protesting the transformation of the quest for love into a supermarket where everyone is pitted against thousands of others.

When we met her in mid-January she was the CEO of Match Group which owns Tinder and another dozen dating apps including Meetic OkCupid and Hinge. (She stepped down in May after two years at the helm but continues to be director and adviser.) That Friday Dubey had been hustling on her standing desk since 8am following a video conference at 6.30am with the Korean teams. These early morning slots are necessary for the 52-year-old: her company revolutionises the way couples get together not only in the US but also in Europe and Asia. According to the analytics firm data.ai Match Group is ranked second among mobile app editors whose users spend the biggest amount of money in the world after Google and before Tencent video games aside.

The leader in online dating has grown considerably since the 1995 launch of the Match.com website. These past five years its income rose from $1.3 billion to $3 billion in spite of Facebook’s entry on the dating market in 2018. But the group remains more private than other tech giants. So does Dubey: she has no Twitter or Instagram accounts.

Dubey is also wary of the Californian habit of letting societal debates infiltrate the company. Last fall she nonetheless spoke up to denounce the new Texan law that bans abortion after six weeks by creating a fund to cover the expenses her female employees might have to pay if they abort in a different state. “I am not an activist and I don’t think it is usually the CEO’s job to take political stances. But I was asked what I think of this law and I couldn’t imagine replying ‘no comment’” she says.

Dubey however doesn't hesitate to share her career history and the obstacles she faced because of her gender. Raised in Jamshedpur by her father—an engineering school professor—and her stay-at-home mother she was the only woman to be accepted at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) among a hundred male students. “My father was delighted that I got into the IIT but in my distant family the first reaction was to tell me no one would marry me” says Dubey.

She then flew off to pursue a masters at Ohio State University and she became the first woman engineer and the first foreigner to be hired by a Pennsylvanian aerospace manufacturer. “Many employees had been there for years when suddenly this girl with a thick accent turned up and told them what to do” she recalls. Dubey is working on her accent by watching tons of sitcoms and to fit in she shortens her first name from Sharmistha to Shar.

At that time she was dating a former co-worker from India who had also moved to the US. “It was the first time someone married for love in my family” she says.

When Mandy Ginsberg called her in 2006 looking for someone to manage Chemistry the second brand launched by Match.com to compete with eHarmony Dubey had never laid a finger on a dating website. And yet she decided to apply. She got along well with Ginsberg whom she had met while working for a supply chain software producer. They formed a duo that would last for almost 15 years and transform the company. “It became obvious that Shar had some sort of magical comprehension of monetisation and of its balance with user experience” says Ginsberg. She chose Dubey as president when she became CEO in 2017.

The Texan group transformed itself to address people of every age and demographic category. “The idea is to exploit the users’ earnings for a long time: young people start with Tinder move on to Hinge then Plenty of Fish then Match and OurTime” says Jason Helfstein senior analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. The company also rides on the rise in divorces: “The average relationship lasts eight years in the US and in Europe. If our apps work out the first time the user will come back” says Match Group Americas CEO Amarnath Thombre who also graduated from IIT.

In 1999 Match Group was bought by the holding company IAC. Ten years later Match Group bought People Media and its 27 targeted dating websites. These brands are now outdated but the segmentation strategy still prevails on the US market. In the last four years Match Group created BLK for African Americans Chispa for Latinos and Upward for Christians. Match then bought the French group Meetic which allowed them to extend their markets to Europe and OkCupid a popular startup among hipsters.

“The first generation of apps was closer to the way arranged marriages work that is you think you know what you’re looking for” says Dubey. “But it often turns out to be wrong: on our platforms we have the advantage to see that even if you say you like tall men that is not such an important criteria for you.”

While Match Chemistry and Meetic required payment to send a message OkCupid and Plenty of Fish (bought in 2015) innovate with a freemium model: sending messages is free but users have to pay for certain features. This model boosts these websites notably for young people erasing little by little the “loser” image associated with using them.

“The internet has become the most popular way for heterosexual couples to meet in the US even ranking better than mutual friends for the first time in 2013” says sociologist Michael Rosenfeld. The use of dating apps has increased since. “When I first started at Match.com 3 per cent of marriages in the US were born from an online encounter. Today it’s 40 per cent” says Hesam Hosseini CEO Match and Match Affnity.

The use of dating websites is also developing outside of the west: Japan became Match Group’s second biggest market after the US two years ago after the acquisition of the wedding-focused app Pairs. “Japan has a declining population and a Loneliness Ministry to such an extent that the government is beginning to consider dating apps as a solution” says Match Group Asia CEO Alexandre Lubot.

And the pandemic sped up this process: “In the post-Covid world the places where you’d meet people physically have disappeared. After #MeToo it has also become harder to meet people at university and at the workplace” says Dubey.

Jessica Pidoux a postdoctoral researcher who wrote a thesis about dating apps says that the Tinder mindset is exporting itself beyond smartphones. “People evaluate others in an algorithmic manner saying whether they like someone or not very early on” she says.

Tinder did change it all. The app was created in February 2012 by entrepreneur Sean Rad and the developer Joe Muñoz. It was free and inspired by Grindr the 2009 dating app for LGBTQIA+ men which switched complex questionnaires for a higher focus on pictures. But Tinder added the “double opt-in” the need to mutually swipe right to start a conversation. “Tinder’s big input is that it solves the problem of rejection” says Dubey.

A decade later Tinder has become Match Group’s driving force: the app generates 55 per cent of its sales revenue against 31 per cent five years ago thanks to a threefold increase in the number of users—now more than 10 millions.

Dubey strongly contributed to the transformation of the startup into a cash machine. In 2017 she travelled every week to Los Angeles to launch Tinder Gold a paid feature that allows users to know who swiped right on you inspired by Who Likes You on OkCupid. “This company knows how to take a brand’s best recipes over to another one” says Helfstein. Since 2015 Tinder had already limited free swipes to 50 a day per person offering a paid subscription to those who would want to go beyond that limit and the possibility to buy 30-minute profile “boosters”.

But Tinder Gold takes monetisation to the next level with prices of over 30 euros a month. The company launched an even more expensive formula last year and does not plan on stopping there. “Most of the monetised functionalities that we have created until now aim to render male users’ experience more efficient since they do not want to be restrained by a certain number of swipes” admits Dubey. “One of the things we are working on is finding what we can offer to make women pay like getting a better control of who they see and who can see them.”

Romantic people are protesting against this transformation of the quest for love into a supermarket where everyone is pitted against thousands of others. And many users feel like the algorithm puts them at a disadvantage. In 2019 journalist Judith Duportail found a patent mentioning a “desirability score”: if someone with many likes swipes right on your profile you will get more visibility. Tinder assures it doesn’t use this system anymore but has never explained what it replaced it with.

“Algorithms are not very smart but they improve with the time you spend on the app and what you do on it. On Hinge if you keep liking pictures of people in nature we will deduce that you are more attracted to this kind of people” says Thombre. Hinge is Match Group’s new gem. Dubey says it is “about to become the second biggest dating app in the world in a few years”.

Thombre orchestrated the buyout of Hinge in 2017. Here people who are interested in someone can only contact them by giving short answers to three questions or liking their pictures so they can break the ice more easily. Hinge only exists in English for now but the platform counts 8 lakh users and its sales revenue increased sixfold in three years.

Newcomers in the dating app market are “limited by the more important companies’ possibility to patent popular functionalities” says lawyer Evan Michel Gilbert. Before Match Group tried to buy out Bumble the company had sued its rival for infringing their “swiping” patent. They also sued Muzmatch a dating app for Muslims for the same reason as well as for also using “match” in their name.

“We only sue other companies to preserve our brand and our patents” says Dubey. She prefers talking about her efforts to remain at the forefront of innovation her new mission being to “make sure users do not pick someone merely because of a picture”.

Last October she launched Tinder Explore a tab giving access to interactive experiences. Last year she also bought Hyperconnect a Korean company with a strong interest in the metaverse. “They launched a beta experience in Seoul Single Town in which your avatar can go to clubs or to the beach and make unexpected encounters” says Dubey.

A career-best 4 for 8 - and a near hat-trick - for Australia legspinner Alana King led her side to an emphatic nine-wicket victory over Barbados and into the Commonwealth Games semi-finals.

Meg Lanning  the Australia skipper went a good way towards making up for dropping the catch that would have given King her hat-trick with an unbeaten 36 from 21 balls as she and Alyssa Healy mowed down a paltry target of 65 with 71 balls to spare.

Tahlia McGrath and Ashleigh Gardner added three and two wickets respectively as Barbados' experienced top order crumbled and Australia kept them to a total that was always going to be nigh on impossible to defend against such formidable opposition.

Gold-medal favourites Australia are top of Group A with two wins from as many matches and they face winless Pakistan in their final group game on Wednesday when India and Barbados with one win each so far face off for the other semi-final berth.

Not this time captain

Having scored a half-century and shared a 107-run partnership with Kycia Knight in their opening victory over Pakistan Barbados captain Hayley Matthews cashed in as Darcie Brown struggled with her line and length to begin with. Matthews cut Brown's first ball through backward point for four like a rocket and unfurled a cracking cover drive to find the boundary again three balls later. She steered the first ball of Brown's next over through the covers then swung her over the leg side for consecutive boundaries but Brown responded when she had Matthews out attempting to swat her over the leg side again only to sky the ball to a waiting Grace Harris at mid-on. Matthews was furious with herself falling for a 13-ball 18 which she wasn't to know would make her the top-scorer of a dismal Barbados innings.

Dottin becalmed

When Matthews' opening partner Deandra Dottin clubbed Brown over extra cover for four it was her first shot in anger after facing a maiden from Jess Jonassen in just the third over and she ended the powerplay with just six runs from 20 balls faced.

King entered the attack in the eighth over and struck with her second ball brushing the outside of Dottin's front pad as she knelt down to tuck the ball down to fine leg right in line with middle stump and umpire Sue Redfern's lbw decision was upheld when Dottin reviewed the ball clearly hitting middle stump a third of the way up. Dottin finished with just eight runs from 22 balls with a meagre strike rate of 36.36.

King rules

McGrath struck second ball when she had Kycia Knight Barbados' top-scorer in the first match with an unbeaten 62 easily caught by Megan Schutt at deep backward square. Kyshona Knight then chipped Gardner to Harris at midwicket as Barbados slid deeper into trouble at 49 for 4 and into their inexperienced batters. Gardner was excellent bowling her off-breaks sending down 17 dot balls in her four overs and finishing with 2 for 6 after she removed 18-year-old Trishnan Holder for nought to seal a double-wicket maiden.

McGrath finished with 3 for 13 as she ate into the tail but it was King who ruled on a slow pitch that has now staged six matches in this tournament. King accounted for Aaliyah Alleyne taking a wild swing across the line of one that ripped out leg stump to end her second over. With the third ball of her third over King pinned Shakera Selman lbw and then struck Shamilia Connell on the back leg next ball. King should have had another wicket immediately but 33-year-old international debutant Keila Elliott's edge popped straight out of Lanning's hands at slip. Usually so reliable in the field Lanning lay face down on the turf for some time afterwards as King held her hands to her head a brave smile painted on her face.

Lanning makes amends

Lanning all but made up for her blunder when she led Australia past the target letting loose after a sedate start. Healy was uncharacteristically quiet early - she faced 14 balls for her first four runs after Australia lost Beth Mooney stumped by Kycia Knight off the bowling of Shanika Bruce in the second over of their reply.

But Lanning punished some loose balls from Dottin in the sixth over which went for 25 runs to close out the powerplay with Australia needing just 23 runs more. Back-to-back sixes swung powerfully over the leg side - the second off a high full toss that was called as a no-ball - in Dottin's first over set Australia properly on their way. A wide preceded an unconventional four as Lanning stepped back and stuck her bat out as she toppled forwards along her crease and managed to steer the ball to the boundary through third.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9zcG9ydC9pbmRpYS1iZWF0LWF1c3RyYWxpYS1pbi1maW5hbC1sZWFndWUtbWF0Y2gtb2YtYmFkbWludG9uLW1peGVkLXRlYW0tZXZlbnQvYXJ0aWNsZTY1NzA0ODc1LmVjZdIBgAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vc3BvcnQvaW5kaWEtYmVhdC1hdXN0cmFsaWEtaW4tZmluYWwtbGVhZ3VlLW1hdGNoLW9mLWJhZG1pbnRvbi1taXhlZC10ZWFtLWV2ZW50L2FydGljbGU2NTcwNDg3NS5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India beat Australia in final league match of badminton mixed team event,"July 31 2022 03:15 am | Updated 03:16 am IST - Birmingham

Already through to the quarterfinals defending champions India continued their rampaging run as they beat Australia in their final group A match of mixed team competition at the Commonwealth Games.

The Indians have taken an unassailable 3-0 lead over the Australians on Saturday.

After blanking Pakistan 5-0 on the first day India yet again were by far the better team on display on the second day as they outclassed Sri Lanka 5-0 first and then beat Australia to top the group on way to the quarterfinals.

World championships silver medallist Kidambi Srikanth started the proceedings for India against Australia beating Lin Xiang Ying 21-14 21-13 in a lop-sided contest.

Two-time Olympic medallist P.V. Sindhu then trounced Chen Wendy Hsuan-Yu 21-10 21-12 to hand India a 2-0 lead.

In the first doubles clash of the tie Sumeeth and Chirag defeated Tran Hoang Pham and Jack Yu 21-16 21-19 to give India an unassailable 3-0 lead.

England deployed the youth-and-experience formula they hope will carry them to a home Commonwealth Games medal to good effect against Sri Lanka to open their campaign with a five-wicket victory at Edgbaston.

Between 37-year-old Katherine Brunt taking a wicket with the first ball of the match to Sophie Ecclestone 's three wickets as the mainstay of England's spin department and two wickets apiece for new seamers Issy Wong and Freya Kemp qualifiers Sri Lanka never got going after winning the toss and opting to bat first.

But after losing both openers early and then struggling to stem a steady flow of wickets it fell to another newcomer 17-year-old Alice Capsey  to help overhaul a paltry target of 107 with 17 balls to spare her innings of 44 off 45 balls seeing England home by five wickets.

In with the 'old'

Brunt handed a commemorative cap to mark her 100th T20 international by former England team-mate Isa Guha before the match struck with the first ball when she pinned 16-year-opener Vishmi Gunarathne with a ball that was on target to crash into her middle and leg stumps.

Ecclestone another veteran of this England side at just 23 given her seven years of illustrious service so far was steered away for four through third by Hasini Perera as soon as she entered the attack in the sixth over. But left-arm spinner Ecclestone responded moments later with a calm-as-you-like caught-and-bowled after Perera struck the ball hard back at her to depart for 17 and Sri Lanka ended the powerplay at 35 for 2. Ecclestone roared back in the final over claiming two more wickets to end with 3 for 25 from her four overs.

In with the new

Kemp the 17-year-old left-arm seamer who made her international debut five days earlier struck with her first ball of the Games taking the prize wicket of Sri Lanka captain Chamari Athapaththu for a cautious 10 off 18 with a beauty that straightened slightly off the seam to pluck off stump out of the ground.

Kemp had taken 2 for 18 in Monday's third T20I against South Africa in Derby as England completed their preparations for this event. She had her second wicket of this match when Kavisha Dilhari spooned the ball straight to Capsey at short cover.

Then carrying on the youth theme Wong the 20-year-old Birmingham local returned to the attack with a double-wicket maiden in her second over. Wong had Nilakshi de Silva caught simply by Danni Wyatt at point and dismissed Anushka Sanjeewani with a short ball that found the edge as the batter attempted to pull and keeper Amy Jones grabbed the ball above her head as Sri Lanka slumped further to 74 for 6.

As if to tie the innings off with a bow Brunt sat under a high ball as Ama Kanchana skied Sarah Glenn to mid-off Brunt lying on the ground after completing the catch arms spread in something resembling relief or satisfaction job done - although it wasn't quite for England as Ecclestone returned to seal a commanding effort for the host side with the ball.

Capsey caps off victory

England didn't have it all their own way with the bat. Wyatt fell in the second over of England's pursuit well caught by Kanchana off the bowling of Oshadi Ranasinghe at mid-off but then Dilhari put down a chance off Sophia Dunkley on 15 when having struck Acchini Kulasuriya for two fours the opener chipped straight to cover. But Ranasinghe claimed her second a short time later when she bowled Dunkley attempting to play across the line of a slower ball and England were 26 for 2.

After nine overs England were 59 for 3 compared with Sri Lanka's 52 for 3 at the same stage of their innings after Nat Sciver added 17 runs off 14 balls and her attempt to overturn a plumb lbw decision off the bowling of Inoka Ranaweera failed. That became 63 for 4 when Jones provided Ranaweera's second wicket edging to Kumari at point."
MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,"A super PAC supporting Republican David McCormick's Senate run in Pennsylvania is launching a $4 million TV ad buy today its first in one of the most-watched contests of the 2024 campaign.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why."

McDonald's has 13438 locations in the US as of 2021.

McDonald's pulled its operations out of Russia due to the humanitarian crisis.

It’s hard to go anywhere in the world without stumbling across a neighborhood McDonald’s. Whether you’re in the United States or traveling abroad the golden arches never seem too far away. In fact 49 out of the 50 U.S. state capitals have a McDonald’s with the outlier being Montpelier Vermont according to FinancesOnline.

FinancesOnline also says 1.5 million Big Macs are sold every day in the U.S. adding up to 550 million sold yearly. However one has to wonder how many McDonald’s locations are these burgers being sold at in the United States?

Is McDonald’s still in Russia?

As of May 16 2022 McDonald’s exited “the Russian market” due to the humanitarian crisis “caused by the war in Ukraine” and its inconsistency with the corporation’s values according to the official McDonald’s website.

This came after a March 8 2022 announcement temporarily pausing the firm’s Russian operations and closing its restaurants in Russia.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

On Monday Gossamer and the Italy-based Chiesi Farmaceutici announced a collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and eventually sell the drug which is called seralutinib. Gossamer has been testing seralutinib as a potential treatment for an uncommon disease known in short as PAH and is currently recruiting patients in a late-stage clinical trial meant to serve as the basis for approval applications.

PAH or pulmonary arterial hypertension is a form of high blood pressure in the lungs. The pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood over time causing the organ to weaken or even fail. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several blood vessel-widening medicines that help alleviate the symptoms of PAH and more recently cleared a first-of-its-kind therapy from Merck & Co.

Unlike other treatments Merck’s Winrevair inhibits a protein that thickens the walls of blood vessels. The therapy is injected every three weeks and is seen as a valuable product by both Wall Street and Merck which acquired it through an $11.5 billion buyout of Acceleron Pharma in 2021. Analysts have predicted Winrevair could generate annual sales anywhere between $1 billion to $8 billion at its peak.

Gossamer believes there’s still room in the market for its drug as it also works differently than available treatment options and comes as an inhaled powder. Results from a smaller PAH study encouraged the company to advance seralutinib into that late-stage trial titled “Prosera” which will enroll 350 participants and complete by late 2025.

While Gossamer remains confident in its drug company investors have questioned the strength of those earlier trial results and whether seralutinib can truly compete with Winrevair. Shares of Gossamer lost three-quarters of their value in late 2022 when findings from the smaller study were announced. As of Monday morning they traded at about 75 cents apiece.

Joseph Schwartz an analyst at investment firm Leerink Partners wrote in a note to clients that the new deal with Chiesi “could address many of the concerns investors have” with Gossamer. Chief among those concerns according to Schwartz is the company’s ability to enroll and fund Prosera.

The collaboration “bodes well” for Gossamer “based on the amount of diligence that typically precedes a collaboration” the analyst wrote.

Story continues

Per deal terms Gossamer will continue leading the development of seralutinib in PAH as well as another related indication the companies are interested in: pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease. Though Gossamer and Chiesi will evenly split development costs the former is responsible for financing Prosera.

In the U.S. the partners plan to evenly share commercial profits and losses. Gossamer will helm commercialization efforts for those two diseases while Chiesi will take the lead for any additional indications.

Chiesi will also have the exclusive right to commercialize seralutinib outside of the U.S. Gossamer will get mid-to-high teens royalties on net sales. Chiesi has agreed to pay Gossamer $160 million as a development reimbursement and may shell out up to $326 million more provided certain regulatory and sales milestones are achieved.

Social media conglomerate Meta Platforms (META 0.60%) spends more money on share repurchases than many companies but few people seem to pay much attention to it. The company's struggles in its advertising business post-iOS privacy changes have clouded sentiment for Meta but all of this noise could eventually prove beneficial to shareholders.

You need to know about Meta's massive share repurchase plan and how it could benefit investors.

What do share repurchases mean for you?

Companies can share profits with shareholders in two primary ways. They can pay a cash dividend to shareholders directly sharing profits with them or they can use share repurchases buying their stock from the market.

Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares. Fewer outstanding shares means each remaining share is more valuable because there are fewer shares to spread the company's profits across.

You can see below what Meta's repurchases have looked like over the past five years; management has been aggressive over the past two years. Outstanding shares have fallen almost 7% during the past five years.

Demonstrating the impact of repurchases is simple; Meta's net income was $15.92 billion in 2017 and there were approximately 2.956 billion shares outstanding resulting in earnings per share (EPS) of $5.39.

Meta's net income over the past 12 months is $37.34 billion and there are 2.7 billion shares outstanding resulting in an EPS of $13.83.

The company's total net income grew by 134% but EPS grew by 156%. In other words Meta is turbocharging its EPS growth as it repurchases more of its stock. This might not seem like much but companies that consistently generate cash can repurchase shares for many years -- it adds up over time.

Why Meta's repurchases are so effective

Meta is repurchasing shares on the open market so it pays market price just like you or me. But Meta's not buying shares to sell them later; it retires the shares taking them out of circulation.

It helps investors when Meta gets more bang for its buck. A lower share price means that repurchases buy more shares which helps EPS grow more.

Armed with that perspective you can see why Meta's management has gotten so aggressive at repurchasing stock. Meta's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has fallen to just 12 less than the historical average of the S&P 500.

Meta is struggling with less effective ads due Apple's iPhone privacy changes. However the company is still getting $0.33 of free cash flow from every revenue dollar and analysts still believe Meta will grow EPS by an average of 11% annually over the next three to five years.

Looking at what Meta has planned

So where to go from here? Meta's dark clouds let the company get excellent value from its share repurchases. The company bought back another $5 billion worth of shares in the second quarter and has another $24 billion remaining on its authorized plan.

Considering that Meta's market cap is $445 billion another 5% of shares will disappear over the coming quarters if the share price remains stable.

Meta is working through the challenges posed by Apple's iOS changes and Reality Labs is poised to remain unprofitable for the foreseeable future. But if you believe in Mark Zuckerberg's leadership at the helm and that Meta will figure things out over the long run these share repurchases will look like a gift to shareholders in hindsight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vdGVjaC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21ldGFzLW1hcmstenVja2VyYmVyZy1jb21wYW55cy1wYW5kZW1pYy1lcmEtZm9yZWNhc3Qtd2FzLXRvby1yb3N5L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkzMjI2MzA1LmNtc9IBigFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vdGVjaC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21ldGFzLW1hcmstenVja2VyYmVyZy1jb21wYW55cy1wYW5kZW1pYy1lcmEtZm9yZWNhc3Qtd2FzLXRvby1yb3N5L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MzIyNjMwNS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta's Mark Zuckerberg: Company's pandemic-era forecast was too rosy,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

They serve a purpose as a reception area for guests and tenants to guide people on their way and on their way out. They have always been a part of a building’s functioning but this important component of an office property is getting a lot of attention at the moment as landlords and tenants look to bring tenants back to the office. As remote and hybrid work trends have taken hold it has pushed office owners and developers to supercharge building features and amenities to compete for workers’ attendance. An “onslaught” of renovation work is taking place at buildings across the country including lobby areas according to the American Institute of Architects.

In trophy office buildings lobby areas often have a museum-like quality: cold and beautiful. There’s the hustle and bustle of people moving in and out but also a hushed seriousness to it all with doormen in formal uniforms behind a huge statement desk. Lobbies historically weren’t designed for people to linger for more than a few minutes and many didn’t offer much more than some light seating. But that has been changing as architects and office designers have seen over the last few years. A shift toward warm and inviting rather than cold and austere wasn’t spurred by the pandemic but it has accelerated it. Activating space within lobby and mezzanine areas by adding programming is growing in popularity as owners look to bring a fresh new feel and look to lobby spaces. After all what better way to draw people in than the front door?

Historical reboot

One of Manhattan’s most storied office buildings recently undertook a major renovation to the building’s 50000-square-foot two-story lobby. Built in 1963 200 Park was formerly known as the Pan Am Building and has been known as the MetLife Building since the early 1990s. Owners Tishman Speyer and Irvine Company enlisted architecture firm MdeAS to work with the firm on creating a new vision for the lobby and reception areas at the Midtown trophy tower.

“It was reimagining how to take an existing aging building and really try to breathe new life into it” said MdeAS Principal Mike Zaborski who worked on the project. The building’s ownership wanted to restore a striking modernist mural by Josef Albers that had originally been a centerpiece of the lobby in the early 1960s. The 28-foot piece called Manhattan now sits just above the entryway to Grand Central Terminal which is connected to 200 Park’s lobby. “It’s like a gateway into New York” Zaborkski said of the dramatic artwork.

On the lower level is the public realm where Zaborski and his team worked carefully to create a new space that “didn’t feel like walking into a mall” but that had amenities and retail just adjacent to the main area. New lighting brightened up the visitor reception area and new travertine stone matched the original while a lounge space was added just off the reception area. A new approach to office lobby and reception space was starting to evolve before the pandemic hit and turned the office world upside down but the health crisis was also a catalyst that forced the industry to rethink what a lobby could do and represent for an office property. “The workplace has always been a place to do business but what we’ve come to grips with is it’s also a place where you have a social experience” Zaborski said adding that younger building tenants in particular are demanding more of an experience in these spaces.

In thinking about what a lobby can do for a building looking at it as a component of an overall ecosystem is something that the design world and developers are thinking about right now as offices and more importantly cities have been changing around the world. “We’re looking at office buildings that are no longer office buildings” said Gensler Principal Sheryl Schulze who leads the design firm’s repositioning and landlord services practice. “Everything has a mixed-use element to it.”

Business districts aren’t just business districts anymore either she added and with a glut of office space in the market how do we reimagine areas that need new invigoration and life? Schulze and her firm look at creating an experience that will both intrigue and encourage workers to come back to the office and that starts with a mix. And the first part of that mix that people will see is the lobby. “The first-floor mezzanine needs to be more inviting to the public and community at large” she said. “It’s not just a container for office workers.”

A ‘playful time’ for the office

Some changes already happening are with security desks typically enormous statement pieces getting smaller. Reception workers and doormen are taking a more hospitality-like approach and greeting tenants and guests at the door instead of behind a desk often dressed less formally than has been traditionally done in the past. “Office developers are very much open to that kind of inviting lobby” said Schulze. “They know what they have to compete against.” The major architecture firm SOM suggests clients lighten up lobby spaces in what they call an “anti-anxiety office entry” which involves tweaking the flow of the space to make it easier to navigate and to create less crowding. Self-check-ins another takeaway from hotels are also popping up in office buildings while security lines are being tucked away from the main lobby instead of being placed front and center. Food and beverage uses are an in-demand amenity for lobbies as dedicated space for lounging and getting work done is encouraged.

MdeAS Architects is behind the redesign of the lobby area of Penn 2 in Manhattan. “It exemplifies the new world of hospitality just like 200 Park Avenue” said MdeAS’ Mike Zaborski. (Image credit: DBOX)

Opening up additional entrances that may have been shuttered or unused has been happening in some buildings as well as a softening of security areas said Schulze who thinks about how owners can create a lobby experience that doesn’t feel like a “security fortress” but is nonetheless safe and secure. In office buildings that have transfer floors where tenants have to switch from one elevator bank to another to reach the ground floor some owners are adding coffee kiosks or grab-and-go food carts to give workers a better experience and provide extra revenue for the landlord. But there should also be space for tenants to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life Schulze said. “A building also needs quiet moments” she said.

Designers stress that when planning a lobby for a building or reimagining an existing one it doesn’t have to lock you in for life. It’s important to build in flexibility to a design so you can try some things out and see how they work. Doesn’t work as you thought? Just change it up and try something new. “In the end these things are really an experimentation” Zaborski said. Short-term pop-ups can be easily tested out within a lobby space. At 200 Park the Brooklyn-based woman-founded beer company Talea has a temporary spot in the building’s lobby while restaurant tenants in nearby spaces are turning over. It’s also to create a “fresher new atmosphere” around the building. Grab-and-go coffee carts are also brought in on a regular basis featuring different brands. “It’s a very playful time right now” MdeAS’s Zaborski said. “Ownership groups are willing to take calculated risks of creating these experiences on the ground floor.”

These days upgrading office amenities is almost a requirement in order to stay competitive and lobby redesign is an important part of an overall repositioning plan. Activating unused spaces bringing in fresh food and beverage uses and cultivating more of a hospitality-like vibe to entrance areas are all part of a new wave of renovations happening at the moment. As owners are learning experimentation is the name of the game. Factoring in a certain amount of flexibility to figure out what works and what doesn’t can help office building owners and developers find the right groove.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjc0OTg1L25hZ2FkLXNlbGVjdHMtbWV0bGlmZS1hcy1lbXBsb3llZS1pbnN1cmFuY2XSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaGFrYXRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL2FtcC9idXNpbmVzcy8yNzQ5ODUvbmFnYWQtc2VsZWN0cy1tZXRsaWZlLWFzLWVtcGxveWVlLWluc3VyYW5jZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nagad selects MetLife as employee insurance provider,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dhakatribune.com/business/274985/nagad-selects-metlife-as-employee-insurance on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjc0OTg1L25hZ2FkLXNlbGVjdHMtbWV0bGlmZS1hcy1lbXBsb3llZS1pbnN1cmFuY2XSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaGFrYXRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL2FtcC9idXNpbmVzcy8yNzQ5ODUvbmFnYWQtc2VsZWN0cy1tZXRsaWZlLWFzLWVtcGxveWVlLWluc3VyYW5jZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbmZsL2hpbmVzLXdhcmQtcHVtcGVkLWZvci1oaXMtbmV3LWpvYi1uZmwtd29ybGQtcmVhY3Rz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hines Ward Pumped For His New Job: NFL World Reacts,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://thespun.com/nfl/hines-ward-pumped-for-his-new-job-nfl-world-reacts on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3B1bi5jb20vbmZsL2hpbmVzLXdhcmQtcHVtcGVkLWZvci1oaXMtbmV3LWpvYi1uZmwtd29ybGQtcmVhY3Rz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

I arrived at Los Angeles International Airport late afternoon avoiding my normal visit to the main terminal in favor of experiencing semi-private airline JSX's only route from LAX where a quick one-hour flight into Las Vegas is made even simpler by their streamlined process which allows you to arrive at the JSX hanger just 20 minutes prior to takeoff.

I was on my way to experience a glimpse into the life of an MGM Resorts elite high-roller a side of Las Vegas normally reserved for the rich famous and those considerably more skilled on the tables than I.

When I arrived in Las Vegas I was greeted by my driver who walked me to the stretch limousine that would transport me to Aria Resort & Casino a luxury enjoyed by every guest staying in their over-the-top Sky Suites. A private Sky Suites entrance and reception area gives a rare sense of ""boutique"" to the normally sprawling casino resorts which line the famous Strip.

Walking into my penthouse one-bedroom Sky Suite I was met with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out over the Strip a view which really came to life after the sun set and what seemed like millions of Vegas lights lit up the sky until the following sunrise. The Sky Suites are an entertainer's dream with a comfortable living area which leads into your own private bar and dining room — the perfect place to start every night before moving down to the casino floor and on to explore the Strip.

I was surprised to find out there was even a level of luxury beyond that which I was experiencing one reserved for the highest level of Las Vegas VIPs. On the 50th floor of Aria MGM has created the most exclusive of retreats in the form of their 17 Sky Villas decadently furnished with an exquisite fully loaded bar and personalized services whether it's procuring the hottest ticket in town or a table overlooking the fountains of the Bellagio.

I was invited to indulge in one of MGM's latest (and greatest) additions their first-ever ""cigar cart"" which is reserved exclusively for those select few who are invited to stay (or lucky enough to secure a booking) at the Sky Villas. Whilst the MGM might be known for its immense wine collection a program that began in October now makes it one of the preeminent cigar programs in the U.S. boasting a humidor which holds over 1200 cigars. The program is led by MGM's first-ever cigar sommelier (yes quite possibly the coolest job title in the world) Ricardo Smenner who has been able to source some of the world's finest rarest cigars for their collection in addition to creating a bespoke selection of three cigars exclusively for the Aria.

When it comes to dining high-rollers at the MGM are not short on options. With 13 resorts on the strip alone there is an abundance of restaurants (literally hundreds) to choose from and I was delighted I went with Michael Mina's signature restaurant in the Bellagio. If you decide to indulge in the tasting menu make sure you go the extra mile and also take on the wine pairing which sees caviar-topped appetizers matched with vodka as you await the chef's mouth-watering lobster pot pie.

MGM Resorts is renowned for its extensive wine program which totals over 350000 bottles of wine and spans the entirety of its Vegas property portfolio. Master sommelier Douglas Kim is the man behind it all leading a team of over 50 sommeliers. Kim told Travel + Leisure he prides his team — a close-knit group of experts — on its ability to provide ""something for everyone."" For those VIP guests in particular he is always happy to source any special vintage they may request in advance of their trip.

I rounded off my trip to Las Vegas with a private tour of the MGM Resorts' ever-growing art collection the very large majority of which is on display for all guests to enjoy throughout their resorts and casinos. Led by highly experienced executive director of arts and culture Tarissa Tiberti MGM Resorts is reshaping its impressive public fine art collection to be even more inclusive for artists of color women and the LGBTQIA+ community as part of its mission to provide a platform for diverse and under-represented artists and their communities. This is showcased in the latest exhibition at Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art Caldonia: Concert and Film Posters from The Ralph DeLuca Collection. The collection features 44 vintage posters highlighting American music and film icons with a focus on African American musicians and actors from the 1920s to the 1970s.

After four memorable nights of high-roller luxury it was difficult to pack up and return to normal life so it's no wonder to hear that MGM's select highest level of VIPs often join them for as long as a month — I can only dream.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdGVscy1hbmQtcmVzb3J0cy9uZXctaW1tZXJzaXZlLWRpbmluZy1leHBlcmllbmNlLWRlYnV0cy1pbi1sYXMtdmVnYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Immersive Dining Experience Debuts in Las Vegas,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelpulse.com/news/hotels-and-resorts/new-immersive-dining-experience-debuts-in-las-vegas on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdGVscy1hbmQtcmVzb3J0cy9uZXctaW1tZXJzaXZlLWRpbmluZy1leHBlcmllbmNlLWRlYnV0cy1pbi1sYXMtdmVnYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhc2luby5vcmcvbmV3cy9uZXZhZGEtYmFucy1sb3R0ZXJ5LXRpY2tldC1zYWxlcy1yZXNpZGVudHMtc3RpbGwtZHJlYW0tb2Ytd2lubmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nevada Bans Lottery Sales Residents Still Dream of Winning,"Nevada Bans Lottery Ticket Sales Residents Still Dream of Winning

Last updated on: August 3 2022 11:53h.

Nevada residents had no choice but to travel out of state this week to try their luck at the historic $1.337 billion Mega Millions lottery jackpot. The state continues to forbid the sale of lottery tickets.

That may sound strange given that Nevada is a gambling mecca with major gaming destinations like Las Vegas and Reno.

But lotteries were forbidden in the Nevada state constitution which was ratified in 1864. “No lottery may be authorized by this State nor may lottery tickets be sold” the document clearly states.

Since then the state has allowed only charitable organizations to operate limited lotteries. Nevada is not alone. Alabama Alaska Arkansas Hawaii Mississippi Utah and Wyoming also do not have state lotteries.

So in the past several days many Nevada residents drove to the Lotto Store at Primm officially located in Nipton Calif. to get their tickets. It is about 44 miles from Las Vegas.

Other lottery ticket locations are found in border towns in Arizona. They too had eager customers from Nevada this week.

Some of those who drove to California pointed out the high price of gasoline when driving to out-of-state locations.

“It stinks that Nevada makes us drive all the way to California for lottery tickets since gas costs so much” Ricardo Pasadas told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He has driven to Primm three times in the last two decades to buy lottery tickets.

But neither California nor Arizona lottery customers had much luck this time. Friday’s winning ticket in the Mega Millions was sold in Illinois.

The ticket was sold at the Speedway fuel and convenience store on East Touhy Avenue in Des Plaines Ill. a Chicago suburb Reuters reported.

Odds of Winning

But why would Nevada residents even want to try their luck on the multi-state lottery? The chance of winning was estimated at one in 302.5 million. Much better odds can be found at one of Nevada’s casinos.

Alan M. Feldman a Distinguished Fellow Responsible Gaming at UNLV and former MGM Resorts International executive explained “Clearly people pay no attention to the odds of actually winning.” He too sometimes purchases lottery tickets when in states that sell them.

It’s all about the fantasy of ‘what if I won?’” Feldman told Casino.org. “People regularly go through the dream of planning for an influx of money. As the prize goes up so do sales.”

Lottery executives have revealed to Feldman “These crazy large jackpots are good and bad.” Good because sales invariably go up. Bad because they set a new high bar and people get less interested in smaller jackpots of only “tens of millions of dollars.”

Either Buy a Lottery Ticket or Not

In the 1990s a Federal Gambling Commission toured the US and held meetings with various experts testifying on gambling.

“At the meeting here in Las Vegas one panel featured a mathematician who was there to explain the odds of winning on a variety of games including lottery” Feldman recalled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL2Zvb2QtZHJpbmsvYmVsbGFnaW8tbGFzLXZlZ2FzLWNvbnNlcnZhdG9yeS1ib3RhbmljYWwtZ2FyZGVucy1kaW5uZXItYnJ1bmNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Can Book a Private Dinner Inside This Popular Las Vegas Attraction for the First Time Ever,"Las Vegas is getting a new dining venue and it's just as exclusive as you'd expect (and want) in Sin City.

In addition to the casino operation plans the programme made available to interested parties by the commission in charge of the gaming tender process requires bidders to submit thorough non-gaming plans which will need to include “the nature content amount location and space initial and annual investment and implementation plans estimated economic benefit (especially the proportion of revenue from non-gaming projects in relation to the general income) and the estimate of the extension of the stay in Macau of tourists regarding the investments of each item explaining them in a quantifiable way for each year”.

Tapping into foreign markets

The first investment item regards the place of origin of international visitors a requirement in line with what is spelled out as the second out of seven criteria listed in the executive order launching the public tender published on July 28 by the Chief Executive in the Official Gazette.

Bidders will need to specify their plans in terms of organization of promotional and marketing activities with the aim of raising awareness of international custumers on Macau “increase international visitors’ willingness to visit Macau and optimize their experience of services provided in Macau consolidate existing markets and explore new markets abroad” with the aim of “significantly increasing the proportion of international visitors”.

As expected MICE (conventions and exhibitions) is also featured in the non-gaming investment items chapter. Bidders are required to optimize and improve the scale and quality of MICE infrastructures and to enhance their planning organization and marketing activities to attract more multinational companies to hold their events in Macau on the regular basis. Gaming concession bidders will need to indicate their plans to interact and cooperate with the Greater Bay Area cities in developing the SAR’s MICE industry.

Focus on entertainment arts and culture

World-class films and TV shows should also be held as concessionaires should bring to Macau internationally-renowned artists and music performers. Bidders are also expected to submit plans to hold film festivals cultural shows parades and carnivals while enhancing their ties with local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Sports events should be held on a regular basis by the gaming concessionaires who also need to focus on improving the infrastructure quality to hold these events. This includes international and inter-regional competitions (e-sports included).

The item on arts and culture details requirements to hold exhibitions featuring arts handicraft antiques animation fashion books and luxury goods as well as literary events. Bidders should also put forth plans to develop theme museums art galleries and theatres.

World-renowned masters should be invited to display their art works and give talks. These should be carried out in cooperation with the local cultural and artistic community.

Health and culinary tourism

The sixth item on the non-gaming requirements concerns health and wellbeing. Health tourism is key in this respect as companies will need to develop health tourism products and services. These include medical care traditional Chinese medicine services and beauty and rehabilitation spas among others.

Concessionaires are also expected to develop innovative and high-tech thematic attractions that can be on par with what has been developed in neighbouring regions. This is to attract a diversity of tourists from different age groups.

As Macau earned the title of UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy in 2018 the Government wants concessionaires to tap into it and further promote the diversification of gastronomy elements in cooperation with local SMEs.

Community tourism is another item mentioned in the tender programme. This entails making the most of the city’s cultural and heritage appeal by cooperating with the local community in developing Macau-style tourist products.

Maritime tourism is listed as the 10thitem as bidders shall develop waterfront leisure events and seaside sports and other related products

Finally the tender programme requires bidders to submit plans related to other projects such as support to scientific and technological innovation and S&T industries in general as well as “other non-gaming projects that may create world-class tourism experiences for visitors coming from all over the world and provide new opportunities for the development of local SMEs in a way that is mutually beneficial to the bidder and the SMEs and that promotes economic diversification and sustainable urban development of the SAR”.

Main criteria

In line with the July 28 executive order the tender programme states that in addition to the bidders’ suitability and financial capacity and conditions that are more advantageous for the SAR to develop casino games of chance authorities will take into account seven criteria: 1) the amount of the proposed premium; 2) plans regarding the expansion to costumers from foreign markets; 3) experience in operating casino games of chance or related fields; 4) the SAR’s interest regarding non-gaming projects; 5) the casino management plan; 6) proposal of overseeing and preventing illicit activities in casinos; and 7) social responsibilities.

All interested parties should submit their bids by no later than 5:45 pm on September 14 with a security deposit of at least MOP10 million (US$1.25 million).

The city’s current six gaming concessions and sub-concessions will expire by the end of this year.

All current six concessionaires (SJM Resorts S.A. Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A. and Galaxy Casino S.A. ) and subconcessionaires (MGM Grand Paradise S.A. Melco Resorts (Macau) S.A. and Venetian Macau S.A) have said they will join the public tender.

Secretary for Administration and Justice André Cheong – who heads the eight-strong tender commission – guaranteed on Thursday (July 28) that there will be a level playing field for the city’s existing gaming operators and newcomers who are interested in bidding for a gaming concession in the public tender process.

The six concessions to be granted will have a maximum term of 10 years with an additional three-year extension possible under extraordinary circumstances."

But a significant part of the path to recovery goes through Israel. Investors were angry at the processor giant over the weekend not only because its business performance was particularly weak but also because it came without warning. A miss of monumental proportions by Intel in the quarter that ended in June is not a surprising event that happened at the last minute and the expectation in such a case is to provide a profit warning. Pat Gelsinger the relatively new CEO of Intel has so far enjoyed the confidence of investors and tried to convince the analysts in a conference call after the reports that the deterioration in the global macro environment was surprising and rapid.

This is bad news not only for Intel but a signal for the economic situation in the field when in the background the question is: Is the U.S. entering a recession? But the second aspect of the weakness in Intel's results is the continuous disruption in the supply chains and ths stocking up by consumers which mainly affected the central computing division (CCG). Intel's management should have recognized this trend in the market at an earlier stage and informed the investors about it.

After the publication of the reports Intel's stock fell by nearly 10% but according to market sentiment this is probably not the end of the decline. The reason for this is not only the missed forecasts for the second quarter but also a dramatic reduction in the forecasts for the second half of 2022. Intel reported revenues of $15.3 billion which was $2.7 billion lower than forecasts and reflect a 17% decrease compared to the same period last year. It now expects revenues of $15-16 billion for the third quarter well below the previous forecast of $18.7 billion. In an annual summary Intel should reach revenues of only $65-68 billion compared to a previous expectation of $76 billion. There was also no good news in the field of profitability and against this background Intel officially announced a slowdown in the pace of recruiting new employees and a $4 billion cut in capital expenditures from $27 billion to $23 billion. Even after this cut it should register a negative flow of $1-2 billion in 2022. Fortunately for Intel just as it published the difficult reports congress passed legislation that encourages the establishment of chip factories in its territory (the Chips Act) with a budget of $52 billion and to this end grants a 25% subsidy to companies like Intel that have already started work in Ohio.

The weakness in Intel's performance came in contrast to the optimism that the management conveyed when it implemented Gelsinger's plan to focus only on the core activities: he closed and sold six of the company's activities but in the meantime Intel suffered a blow precisely in its main growth engine with the data center and AI division seeing its revenue plunge by 16%. Sales of the computing division the largest division in Intel fell by 25% and even worse Intel now says that the division's potential market has shrunk by 10%. What sets Gelsinger apart however is taking responsibility: ""The sudden and sharp drop in economic activity is the main driver for the miss but there were also problems with our execution."" Gelsinger promised to make adjustments and speed up the ""implementation of our 'smart capital' strategy.""

Here Israel where Intel is the largest private employer enters the picture. From Gelsinger's words it is implied that the local operation plays an important role in the future growth of Intel. Against this background it is likely that when the cuts come they will not focus specifically on Israel even if they will not completely skip it. The activity in Israel that is most exposed to the negative impact of the Intel crisis is manufacturing. The combination of a cut in the investment budget with the adoption of the Chips Act in the U.S. puts Israel at a disadvantage when it comes to expanding production here. Following the Chips Act whose counterpart was also adopted in Germany these countries will participate in about a third of the costs of setting up new Intel plants compared to about 10% in Israel.





Putting hope in Israel

On the positive side Intel has placed a lot of hope in Israel even if for now these activities are relatively small. The first is of course the chip manufacturing division the establishment of which is based at this stage on the purchase of the Israeli company Tower for $5.8 billion. Last week Intel also reported on an important contract with Mediatek from Taiwan and Gelsinger noted at the end of the week that in addition to this there are already negotiations with six of the 10 largest fabless companies (that do not manufacture their own chips) in the world and in total it is in the process of examining 30 customers. According to Gelsinger these processes can lead to contracts worth $6 billion. He noted that the Tower purchase has already received approvals in four regions of the world including the U.S. and he expects the deal to be closed in early 2023.

Especially surprising certainly in relation to the size of the company was the sentence Gelsinger included in his opening remarks about Israeli company Granulate which was acquired only last March for an estimated sum of $500-600 million and according to Intel's CEO is already yielding results: ""Since we acquired Granulate its customer pipeline has doubled and the revenues have tripled"" he said. Grabulate entered the data center division at the center of which was already the Israeli company Habana Labs which was purchased for $2 billion and recently released the promising chip under the Gaudi brand. The artificial intelligence capabilities provided by Granulate and Habana are supposed to cover Intel's weakness in the data center field which is losing market share to competitors in the last few quarters. The other local brand that is concentrated almost entirely in Israel is Mobileye which was the only activity that showed rapid growth in the second quarter and reached a record revenue of $460 million an increase of 41% compared to the corresponding period. The operating profit also rose by a similar rate to $190 million. These numbers provide an excellent explanation for Intel's desire to issue Mobileye on Wall Street a plan that had to be shelved for the time being due to the state of the markets. Intel was aiming for a $50 billion valuation for the autonomous vehicle division that is run by Amnon Shashua a value that seems disconnected from reality these days. However Gelsinger noted that Intel is determined to bring Mobileye to an IPO near the end of the year subject to market conditions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2J1c2luZXNzLm91dGxvb2tpbmRpYS5jb20vbmV3cy9jZW50cmFsLWJhbmstZGlnaXRhbC1jdXJyZW5jeS1jYmRjLXN0YWJsZWNvaW5zLWNvdWxkLWNvLWV4aXN0LXdpdGgtbGVnYWwtdGVuZGVyLXJlcG9ydC1uZXdzLTIxMzI1ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Stablecoins Could Co-Exist With Legal Tender: Report,Mortensen added that this has “shown that the new digital world can co-exist with existing market infrastructures like Target2-Securities.

Biden—who initially tested positive July 21 after a week of traveling across the Middle East—tested negative for the virus on Tuesday night and again on Wednesday morning of this past week when he ended his isolation.

He additionally tested negative Thursday and Friday mornings before testing positive again Saturday morning according to a letter from presidential physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre obtained and posted to Twitter by a Reuters correspondent.

On Saturday the president said via Twitter that he would return to isolation despite the fact that he’s not experiencing new symptoms.

“Folks today I tested positive for COVID again” he wrote. “I’ve got no symptoms but I am going to isolate for the safety of everyone around me. I’m still at work and will be back on the road soon.”

Folks today I tested positive for COVID again.



This happens with a small minority of folks.



I’ve got no symptoms but I am going to isolate for the safety of everyone around me.



I’m still at work and will be back on the road soon. — President Biden (@POTUS) July 30 2022

‘Rebound COVID’ Paxlovid and otherwise

Biden was treated with the COVID-19 antiviral Paxlovid the day he was diagnosed according to multiple news outlets. It’s a pill approved for treatment of COVID-19 in high-risk adults like the elderly having received emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

But the drug is known for “rebound” cases referred to by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as “a brief return of symptoms.”

Such rebounds however can happen with or without Paxlovid Andy Pekosz virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health told Fortune on Saturday.

“It’s not uncommon for people to have a positive test a few days after a negative test with COVID-19” he said. “What I think people are more focused on these days is if this may be a Paxlovid rebound meaning he’ll have a recurrence of the virus.”

While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that COVID rebounds are rare they could be more common than we know as most individuals with COVID stop testing after they receive a negative result.

“The White House does a very good job of testing people on a daily basis” Pekosz said. “They’re much more likely to catch some of these rare things with that level of frequency.”

The president’s rebound positive test was an antigen or rapid test O’Connor wrote. Antigen tests are superior when it comes to gauging whether or not someone is shedding live virus and therefore infectious he said adding that a positive antigen test is “probably a good reason to go back into isolation.”

Fauci’s Paxlovid rebound

When diagnosed with COVID in June chief presidential medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci was prescribed the antiviral due to his advanced age which put him at greater risk for a severe outcome from COVID despite being fully vaccinated and twice boosted.

Fauci later said he had experienced a Paxlovid rebound.

“After I finished the five days of Paxlovid I reverted to negative on an antigen test for three days in a row” Fauci 81 said during an event at Foreign Policy’s Global Health Forum Bloomberg reported. “And then on the fourth day just to be absolutely certain I tested myself again.”

“I reverted back to positive.”

Fauci later told the New York Times that Paxlovid kept him out of the hospital and stopped his infection from becoming more severe initially saying “Paxlovid did what it was supposed to do.”

Fauci began a second course of Paxlovid when symptoms emerged “much worse than the first go-around” he said. In May the CDC issued a health advisory about such rebounds saying there was no evidence that additional treatment is needed for rebound cases.

In June Pfizer which manufactures Paxlovid announced that it would stop adding new participants to a trial of the drug among COVID patients at low risk of hospitalization and death. The study failed to demonstrate that the drug reduced symptoms or hospitalizations and deaths in a statistically significant way according to Bloomberg.

But Paxlovid may be undeservedly gaining a bad rap Pekosz cautioned.

“I’ll still point to the fact that it’s working in terms of keeping people out of the hospital—that’s the most important thing right now” he said adding that it may need to be retooled to better address Omicron subvariants.

How long to quarantine?

The CDC currently advises COVID-positive individuals to quarantine for five days before returning to normal life (and masking in public for an additional five days). The recommended isolation time was 10 days until December when the federal health agency halved it.

But “there is not data to support five days or anything shorter than 10 days” Amy Barczak a physician at the Massachusetts General Hospital Infectious Disease Division recently told Nature.

Some scientists have questioned the rationale behind the policy since the CDC introduced it late last year. And now critics have more data to back up their claims: Viral shedding can occur beyond 10 days in even healthy vaccinated adults according to a preprint out of London published this month.

Some scientists advise that people stop quarantining only once they test negative using at-home tests rather than relying on the CDC’s five-day rule alone.

Biden did so however testing negative at five and then six days after infection before ending his isolation. The White House had said that Biden would go “above and beyond” the CDC’s five-day guidance and wait until he tested negative before returning to public life.

He apparently wasn’t expecting a rebound.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8va29yZWFqb29uZ2FuZ2RhaWx5LmpvaW5zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzMwL2J1c2luZXNzL3RlY2gva29yZWEtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1jaGlwcy8yMDIyMDczMDA3MDAzNDQ5Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In chips the patent war is hot and Korea isn't winning,"



In chips the patent war is hot and Korea isn't winning

Chipmakers around the world are filing more patent applications hoping to get an upper hand in the industry of the future.The latest technology showing up in patent filings is the Gate All Around (GAA) technique.The GAA architecture is designed to enhance the transistor density of chips and improve energy efficiency. The design allows for more expanded and flexible current flows acrosschannels at transistor gates compared to the widely used finFET technique.TSMC’s global patent applications related to GAA in 2020 numbered 519 while Samsung Electronics filed 217 such applications in 2020 according to the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) on Wednesday.Samsung started mass production of 3-nanometer chips last month becoming the world’s first company to produce a GAA-based 3-nanometer chip.Three-nanometer chips promise a 23-percent performance increase a 45-percent power consumption reduction and a 16-percent decline in the area needed compared to 5-nanometer chips.While Samsung’s achievement may give it an advantage over Taiwan’s TSMC the sharp rise in TSMC's patent applications shows that the company is hardly giving up.Having as many patents as possible is considered a strategic plus in technology industries.TSMC’s share of semiconductor patent applications globally outstrips Samsung Electronics'.From 2007 to 2020 the accumulated number of patent applications by TSMC was 1544 while Samsung Electronics filed 905. Among the 1544 patents by TSMC more than half were filed between 2019 and 2020.During the period from 2007 to 2020 TSMC’s share of the total number of patent applications globally was 31 percent followed by Intel's 24 percent and IBM's 19 percent.Samsung Electronics came in fourth with 18 percent.“TMSC’s patent applications sharply rose after Samsung Electronics applied GAA to the manufacturing of 3-nanometer chips in 2017” said a spokesperson for KIPO.TSMC’s market share in foundries was 53.6 percent in the first quarter while Samsung Electronics' was 16.3 percent.The number of TSMC GAA-related patent applications filed with the KIPO surged recently. The figure increased from nine in 2018 to 89 in 2020. The total number of TSMC patent applications in Korea rose from 24 in 2007 to 588 in 2020.The GAA-related patents recently filed by TSMC include semiconductor manufacturing methods.The semiconductor industry's views on TSMC’s filing of patent applications in recent years are split.Some say this will not affect Samsung Electronics’s mass production of high-spec products at all as technologies are applied differently by each company.But some raise worries about the longer-term threat to Samsung.“Patent registrations of other competing companies may act as an obstacle when Samsung Electronics tries to advance its technology” said a spokesperson for a semiconductor company who asked not to be named.""It is evident that TSMC is keeping an eye on Samsung Electronics as it has been filing more patent applications in Korea even though Korea is not its major market.""“Patents are an index that shows the company’s technological capability” said Lee Chang-han vice president of the Korea Semiconductor Industry Association.“More patents would provide a stronger foundation for the future.”While these chipmakers are eager to file as many patents as possible where they file them is also important. The number of patent applications filed by both Samsung Electronics and TSMC from 2019 to 2020 dropped in China but rose in the United States.TSMC is also actively cooperating with Japanese companies.The company is currently constructing a chip plant in Kumamoto southern Japan with $3.5 billion in subsidies from the Japanese government. It also opened an R&D center in Ibaraki near Tokyo in June.According to the KIPO TSMC became more competitive after collaborating with Japanese companies on chip packaging.Competition over patents is notable in memory chips.Samsung Electronics and SK hynix are two of the major players in memory chips but competition is rising between major global companies when it comes to DRAM alternatives and processing-in-memory (PIM) chips.Samsung Electronics and Micron are the top two leading companies in patents for PIM chips.The DRAM alternatives such as FRAM are led by Micron and MRAM by TSMC.As the patent war continues some say Korea has to beef up its patent approval system. Its experts examining applications are overworked.“As patents are about professional technology examinations should be done by people who have worked in the related industry and technology” said Lee Chang-han.In Korea patent application examiners vetted 206 applications each in 2020 compared to 58 for patent office examiners in Europe. In the U.S. the number is 73 in China 91 and in Japan 164.A Korean examiner spends an average of only 10.8 hours examining a patent application compared to 17.7 hours in Japan 22 hours in China and 27.4 hours in the United States.The number oftechnology types that each examiner is expected to handle is 81.1 for Korea the highest among these five major countries.“More patent applications are coming in but there are delays in the examination process as there are not enough examiners” said a spokesperson for KIPO.“We will hire retirees from the relevant industries as examiners in order to increase the quality of patent examination” said Lee In-sil commissioner of the KIPO during a press conference on July 7.BY CHOI EUN-KYUNG [cho.jungwoo1@joongang.co.kr]",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50Lzc0YzIwY2JhLTFmMTktNDQ0Ny1hYzAxLWE1MmMzMDQ3MGQzN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung seeks to reassure markets over semiconductor competitiveness,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The tech giant said it observed the FakeUpdates (aka SocGholish) malware being delivered via existing Raspberry Robin infections on July 26 2022.

Raspberry Robin also called QNAP Worm is known to spread from a compromised system via infected USB devices containing a malicious .LNK file to other devices in the target network.

The campaign which was first spotted by Red Canary in September 2021 has been elusive in that no later-stage activity has been documented nor has there been any concrete link tying it to a known threat actor or group.

The disclosure therefore marks the first evidence of post-exploitation actions carried out by the threat actor upon leveraging the malware to gain initial access to a Windows machine.

""The DEV-0206-associated FakeUpdates activity on affected systems has since led to follow-on actions resembling DEV-0243 pre-ransomware behavior"" Microsoft noted.

DEV-0206 is Redmond's moniker for an initial access broker that deploys a malicious JavaScript framework called FakeUpdates by enticing targets into downloading fake browser updates in the form of ZIP archives.

The malware at its core acts as a conduit for other campaigns that make use of this access purchased from DEV-0206 to distribute other payloads primarily Cobalt Strike loaders attributed to DEV-0243 which is also known as Evil Corp.

Referred to as Gold Drake and Indrik Spider the financially motivated hacking group has historically operated the Dridex malware and has since switched to deploying a string of ransomware families over the years including most recently LockBit.

""The use of a RaaS payload by the 'Evil Corp' activity group is likely an attempt by DEV-0243 to avoid attribution to their group which could discourage payment due to their sanctioned status"" Microsoft said.

It's not immediately clear what exact connections Evil Corp DEV-0206 and DEV-0243 may have with one another.

Katie Nickels director of intelligence at Red Canary said in a statement shared with The Hacker News that the findings if proven to be correct fill a ""major gap"" with Raspberry Robin's modus operandi.

""We continue to see Raspberry Robin activity but we have not been able to associate it with any specific person company entity or country"" Nickels said.

""Ultimately it's too early to say if Evil Corp is responsible for or associated with Raspberry Robin. The Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) ecosystem is a complex one where different criminal groups partner with one another to achieve a variety of objectives. As a result it can be difficult to untangle the relationships between malware families and observed activity.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL2phcmVkLWJyaWRlZ2FuLW1vcm1vbi1taWNyb3NvZnQtZXhlY3V0aXZlLXdhcy1tdXJkZXJlZC1pbi1teXN0ZXJ5LWluLWZsb3JpZGHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jared Bridegan Mormon Microsoft Executive Was Murdered in Mystery in Florida,"The last time Kirsten Bridegan heard from her husband Jared the 33-year-old Microsoft executive was doing what she said he loved most: being a dad.

After dropping off his twins from a previous marriage at his ex-wife’s house near Jacksonville Beach Florida Jared called Kirsten from the car while driving home with their own 2-year-old daughter Bexley in the backseat. During the brief call in February Bridegan sounded “happy” recounting the “good night” he had with three of his four children for their bi-weekly “date night” Kirsten said.

“I was on the phone with one of my brothers and Jared called in while we were talking” Kirsten Bridegan told The Daily Beast. “So I added him and the three of us were chatting for a minute. And then my brother dropped off so I could just be talking to Jared—and Bexley who told me ‘Mom I got an ice cream.’”

The mother of two who stayed at home that night with their other 7-month-old daughter said her husband ended the short conversation with a promise: “I’m almost home see you soon.”

“Now I know that within a few minutes he was killed” Kirsten said. “The next time somebody answered Jared’s phone it was a police officer… who told me to come to the Jacksonville Beach Police Department.”

Authorities say that as Bridegan was on his way back home to St. Augustine on Feb. 16 he came upon a tire in the middle of the road in a quiet residential neighborhood. As he apparently tried to move the obstacle the senior design manager was shot multiple times in what cops called a “targeted” killing that wrecked a promising young family.

Bridegan’s toddler was still strapped into her car seat in his Volkswagen Atlas when a passerby came upon the grisly scene about three minutes later. Police say the car’s emergency lights were flashing when officers arrived—and the tire remained in the middle of the road near where Bridegan was lying next to his open driver’s door.

“ Bexley has frequently asked about what happened and has even repeatedly said: ‘Boom boom boom Daddy on the ground.’ ”

Thanks in part to Bridegan being the sort of man one friend described to The Daily Beast as “the last person to have any enemies” authorities have yet to make any arrests name any suspects or identify a motive in the case.

A spokesperson for the Jacksonville Beach Police Department declined to comment on details of the “still-active” investigation now stretching into its sixth month. But they did note that investigators were looking for any information they could find about a dark-colored 2004 to 2008 Ford F-150 pickup truck.

Meanwhile the mysterious case has pulled back a curtain on Bridegan a Mormon whose contentious previous marriage—and bitter divorce—with the mother of his two 9-year-old children has served as fodder for tabloid gossip.

The court file in St. Johns County between Bridegan and his ex-wife Shanna Gardner-Fernandez—which eventually moved from a divorce to a custody case—has about 300 entries and motions. The filings range from arguments over where to send their twins to elementary school to accusations of mental and financial manipulation.

“All you want to do is move forward with life and focus on being a family” Kirsten Bridegan said adding that the constant court battles caused “stress it causes you know… stress about going to court.”

“So that was difficult. It was hard to watch Jared deal with that.”

Amid the steady diet of media scrutiny Gardner-Fernandez and her husband Mario Fernandez have hired a criminal defense attorney. Still they have never been identified as persons of interest or suspects in the case. A spokesperson for the couple said they were no longer speaking out of respect for Kirsten Bridegan who they claim specifically asked them not to speak to the media. Gardner-Fernandez previously told local outlet Action News Jax “I wish it weren’t like this.” She said that when she found out about Bridegan’s death she was shocked and “fell to the floor because I was devastated.”

Rather than look to his earlier years Bridegan’s widow is left trying to guide her daughter through the aftermath of witnessing her father’s gruesome murder up close.

Since the killing Kirsten said Bexley has frequently asked about what happened and has even repeatedly said: ‘Boom boom boom Daddy on the ground.”

Every memory Mallary Beaudin has of Bridegan from high school is filled with “laughter and light.”

Beaudin 33 met Bridegan through the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and the pair remained close even though they lived about 45 minutes away from each other in north Florida near St. Augustine. Describing Bridegan as her “first love” Beaudin told The Daily Beast he was a big part of her high-school years.

“He wasn’t like other guys that I knew in high school. He was very respectful. He was a true gentleman” she added.

“ Whoever decided to kill Jared knew what kind of person he was. They knew he was the kind of person who would stop to move a tire out of the street to ensure someone else wouldn’t get hurt. ” — Kirsten Bridegan

After Bridegan graduated from Douglas Anderson School of the Arts in 2007 he went to college in Utah—at one point he was Beaudin’s neighbor when they lived in the same apartment complex. She added that Bridegan was even there the first time she met her own now-husband.

Over the years Beaudin said she and Bridegan would stay in touch over social media and she recalled his noting when he first met Gardner-Fernandez during a visit to Florida around when she was getting married out in Utah. Bridegan and Gardner-Fernandez who grew up in an affluent Mormon community in Utah and is the heiress to a successful paper-craft empire married in April 2010 at a Salt Lake City Temple.

According to the Florida Times-Union the pair initially lived in Utah before moving to Connecticut. Once Gardner-Fernandez gave birth to their twins—Liam and Abigail—the pair decided to move to Florida after their son was diagnosed with a heart condition that required him to live at sea level.

But their marriage crumbled prompting Gardner-Fernandez to file for divorce in St. Johns County in February 2015 after six years together. Citing anonymous sources Fox News Digital reported the relationship ended after Bridegan found emails implying Gardner-Fernandez was having an affair with her Crossfit trainer. (Gardner-Fernandez denied having an affair to the Florida Times-Union and said in a July 2015 court document that she and Bridegan “don’t love each other anymore.”)

“In the past 3 months Shanna has become really distant and got emotionally attached to her personal trainer at the gym and is now divorcing me” Bridegan wrote to Beaudin in a 2015 Facebook message reviewed by The Daily Beast. “But she has her agency so I just need to move on and find someone to be my best friend again ya know.”

Around the same time Fox reported Gardner-Fernandez asked a tattoo parlor employee if he knew anyone that could “shut… up” Bridegan. Gardner-Fernandez admitted to the Florida Times-Union that she made the statement at the tattoo parlor in 2015 while discussing her divorce.

​​ “Our relationship was pretty complicated and remained pretty complicated” she told the outlet describing her split with Bridegan as “bitter.”

Court documents and social-media messages reviewed by The Daily Beast showcase the lengthy legal battle Gardner-Fernandez and Bridegan waged during their divorce proceedings. In one 2015 document filed during their near-constant litigation Gardner-Fernandez accused her ex-husband of “disturbing and abusive behavior” including “regularly interrogating” and recording the twins after “actively coaching” them on what to say.

Bridegan denied the allegations and claimed in his own 2015 motion that Gardner-Fernandez installed “surveillance devices in the children’s bedroom” and his car and treated him in a “disparaging manner in front of the children.” Gardner-Fernandez likewise denied the allegations in court filings.

Beaudin said the last time she connected at length with Bridegan in March 2015 the father-of-two opined about his struggle to move on.

In one message Bridegan suggested to “NEVER get divorced” because “it’s literally the hardest thing I’ll ever do its emotionally and physically the worst thing in the world to hear your eternal companion just be like ‘Yeah I am out… see ya later.’”

Friends and family say that despite the struggle over his first marriage Bridegan’s main priority was being the best parent to his children—even if that meant moving back across the country to support them.

At the end of 2015 Nate Sanders hired Bridegan as a user experience designer for the software company Canopy in Lehi Utah. Sanders told The Daily Beast that the recently divorced Bridegan was an “incredibly positive and incredibly kind” co-worker driven by love for his kids.

“His focus was on his children. He was worried about Liam he was worried about Abby” Sanders told The Daily Beast. “And everything he ever talked about revolved around those two.”

Court documents suggest that Bridegan was quietly battling with his ex-wife to maintain equal custody of the kids despite living in another state. Eventually Sanders said Bridegan was forced to quit the tech start-up because he was not “going to risk losing custody of his kids in any way.”

Back in Florida Sanders said Bridegan expressed a desire to start dating again and took the plunge to sign up for dating apps. One of those dating-app matches in early 2017 was with Kirsten who at the time lived in Charlotte North Carolina and worked at Microsoft.

“He had been doing a lot of dating on Bumble and Tinder and things like that and just felt like he hadn’t found somebody that he could really connect with” Sanders said.

After he began talking to Kirsten the friend continued Bridegan at “one point had told me ‘Yeah I think she’s really special. I think it could go somewhere.’”

Kirsten Bridegan told The Daily Beast that she felt an instant draw to her future husband noting that the two spent a lot of time talking on the phone before he made the six-hour drive to her in North Carolina for their first date. A few months later Kirsten requested that her Microsoft job be fully remote moved to Florida and married Bridegan in October 2017.

“We waited just over a year before having kids” Kirsten explained noting that during that time she and her husband had a nice balance of “newlywed time and family time” with Bridegan’s two previous children.

Describing Bridegan who started working at Microsoft himself last year in user design experience as a “creative dad” Kirsten said she loved watching “all the random stuff” he would come up with for the twins—and eventually their daughter Bexley who was born in August 2019. The pair would eventually welcome their second daughter London in August 2021.

“When it would be raining we would make little toothpick boats and float them down you know the street in the gutter” she said.

As part of the custody agreement with Jared’s ex-wife the Bridegans would get the twins every other week. During the off weeks Kirsten said they would see the twins on Wednesdays for “date night.”

“It usually consisted of a dinner and a quick activity like dinner or dessert and then the parent would drop the kids back off at the other parent’s house” Kirsten explained.

Bridegan was returning home from the bi-weekly “date night” on Feb. 16 when he was fatally shot.

On those nights the father-of-four was usually home around 8:15 p.m after dropping off his children at their mother’s house about half an hour away. Kirsten said that she started feeling something was off at around 8:30 p.m. noting that she had spoken to him on the phone and he had indicated he was close to home.

“I gave it a few more minutes and then I started looking down the road… just to see if there were headlights coming down the road” she said. Worried she began calling and texting her husband but was met with silence. So she got in her car and began looking for her husband while still dialing his cellphone.

Suddenly someone picked up. It was not her husband.

“I kept calling and calling and that’s when a police officer answered the phone” she said. “The only thing they did answer was that Bexley was okay.”

Rushing to the closest police station Kirsten said she had to wait a few minutes before she was greeted at the door by a female officer who took her to a break room. Her daughter was “sitting there wrapped in a blanket and had a coloring book on the table.”

“I ran over and I picked her up and the officer just wouldn’t tell me anything for what seems like forever” Kirsten said.

It would take several more minutes and multiple failed attempts to get answers about what happened to Bridegan before an officer escorted Kirsten to another room in the back. There she said she was told that her husband had been killed.

“Honestly my hearing seemed to go” Kirsten recalled. “I felt like I was going to throw up I remember looking around the room for a trash can like I might throw up and I didn’t see one. I think I put my head in my hands like: This can’t be real.”

Kirsten added that even though she had felt something was terribly wrong by that point hearing the news made her want to say “It’s not him it’s somebody else you made a mistake.”

“And then the rest of the night honestly is kind of a blur” she added. “I know we talked more. They asked me some more questions but it just all started to blur together.”

Over the next several days she said she communicated with the police friends and family—including Bridegan’s ex-wife—about the murder. But she expressed umbrage that just 12 days after the incident as Fox News digital first reported Gardner-Fernandez emailed Kirsten asking her to return some library books. In another email she asked for Bridegan’s death certificate.

Both Kirsten and Gardner-Fernandez have said that Bridegan’s ex-wife was not invited to his funeral.

But while Kirsten said a lot of the media attention has been about her husband’s past relationship and custody battle she is only focused on finding out who killed Bridegan. One major piece of the puzzle she said is the Ford truck that was caught on security cameras around the time of the murder. While the truck is a “vehicle of interest” police have not yet elaborated as to why this car is important to the case.

For Kirsten it seems clear the only way to find out what happened to her husband is to enlist the public’s help. She hopes it will just take one person coming forward to help solve what she believes was a premeditated crime that has given her daughter PTSD.

“He was happy. He was thriving at work. He felt like he was being challenged. He loved his team. We had a great circle of friends” she said. “Whoever decided to kill Jared knew what kind of person he was. They knew he was the kind of person who would stop to move a tire out of the street to ensure someone else wouldn’t get hurt.”

“Someone knows who shot him at close range while our daughter was in the car and we are just asking for answers to find closure.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN0b3JlLWF3YXJkLXdpbm5pbmctYXBwcy1jdXN0b21pemUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Customize Windows With These Innovative Microsoft Store Award-Winning Community Choice Apps,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN0b3JlLWF3YXJkLXdpbm5pbmctYXBwcy1jdXN0b21pemUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZW4uYXMuY29tL2xhdGVzdF9uZXdzL21pY3Jvc29mdC14Ym94LXRoZS1kYXktYmlsbC1nYXRlcy1hbG1vc3QtbG9zdC1hLTE1LWJpbGxpb24tYnVzaW5lc3Mtbi_SAXNodHRwczovL2VuLmFzLmNvbS9sYXRlc3RfbmV3cy9taWNyb3NvZnQteGJveC10aGUtZGF5LWJpbGwtZ2F0ZXMtYWxtb3N0LWxvc3QtYS0xNS1iaWxsaW9uLWJ1c2luZXNzLW4vP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Xbox: the day Bill Gates almost lost a $15 billion business,"Bill Gates is undoubtedly a successful man. One of the great entrepreneurs in history blessed with a vision to start businesses at the right time leading him to become one of the richest people in the world. Without a doubt Microsoft a company of which he is a co-founder is his masterpiece his great legacy. But also like everyone else he has made mistakes in his life. And he almost made one that would have cost him dearly: he considered blocking the launch of the Xbox.

Xbox almost canned at ‘Valentine’s Day Massacre’

Today the Microsoft console is one of the most popular on the market competing with Nintendo and the Sony-built PlayStation. Sales of the Xbox as well as games and subscriptions to Xbox Game Pass are worth about $15 billion a year to the company. A huge sum that Microsoft almost missed out on.

Ed Fries co-creator of the Xbox shared the story of the ‘Valentine’s Day Massacre’ with the specialised video game media outlet IGN. This is the striking name given at Microsoft to an important meeting in which the fate of one of the great consoles in history was decided back in 2000 18 months before being launched onto the market. A meeting that could have witnessed Gates’ “biggest mistake”.

As revealed by Fries there were teams within the company that presented to Gates and Steve Ballmer the leaders of the company at the time the option of creating a video game console. The co-creator wanted to develop a console with a hard drive that was in essence “a PC in disguise” as Fries called it. This would run a version of Windows as is the case today with Xbox One. In the opposite corner were advocates of a traditional console acting as a “continuation of the Sega Dreamcast line” .

Mention of Sony changes course of video game history

Gates sided with the Fries team with the idea of running a version of Windows. The plan went ahead until they realised that the business plan would not be possible. So they were forced to change direction and create a ”closed” system to run the games. This ended in the aforementioned meeting with Gates and Ballmer held on Valentine’s Day.

It was at this meeting that Gates was on the verge of making his big mistake. He even described the launch of Xbox as an “insult” to everything he had done within the company. Those present knew he’d be unhappy about the absence of Windows but they did not expect him to be quite so angry. Ballmer for his part expressed concern at the amount of money they could lose on the project.

Then everything changed when Sony’s potential as a home-entertainment rival to Microsoft was mentioned. The PlayStation creators were “slowly invading the living room” and could be a “future threat” one individual at the meeting said. It was then that Gates and Ballmer gave their go-ahead for the launch of the Xbox.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL25ld3MvNTg5Nzg0NS9sYXN0LXdvcmRzLW11cmRlcmVkLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1leGVjLWphcmVkLWJyaWRnZW4v0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vbmV3cy81ODk3ODQ1L2xhc3Qtd29yZHMtbXVyZGVyZWQtbWljcm9zb2Z0LWV4ZWMtamFyZWQtYnJpZGdlbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Haunting last words of murdered Microsoft exec Jared Bridgen to wife revealed before he was shot in front...,"MYSTERY DEATH Haunting last words of murdered Microsoft exec Jared Bridgen to wife revealed before he was shot in front of toddler

THE haunting last words of murdered Microsoft exec Jared Bridgen said to his wife have been revealed.

The dad-of-four was ambushed and shot in front of his toddler on his way home after stopping his vehicle to move a tire on the road on Florida earlier this year.

3 His toddler was in the car when he died

His killer approached him and then shot him in front of his two-year-old daughter during February's killing.

Earlier Jared had dropped his two older kids off at his ex-wife's house.

His wife Kirsten Bridegan told The Daily Beast the last words her husband said to her.

She had been on the phone with her brother when Jared called so she added him to the call and the three of them chatted for a minute.

She said: ""And then my brother dropped off so I could just be talking to Jared and Bexley who told me ‘Mom I got an ice cream.’”

Her husband told her at the end of the conversation: “I’m almost home see you soon.”

“Now I know that within a few minutes he was killed.

“The next time somebody answered Jared’s phone it was a police officer… who told me to come to the Jacksonville Beach Police Department.”

Jared's wife Kirsten told News 4 Jax outlet how she found out about her husband's death.

Kirsten revealed: ""I took the route we normally take to get to the beach.

""And I kept calling his phone. And then one of the policemen answered it. And that’s when I knew my gut feeling was right and something was really wrong.""

With Jared's perpetrator still at large his widow has pleaded with the public to report any information they might have to the police.

To honor her late husband's memory Kristen is holding a candlelight vigil and tribute to him in Jacksonville Beach Florida on Tuesday April 19.

The late Microsoft manager and father of four's obituary described him as: ""an awesome husband father son and friend to many.""

""More than anything in life he enjoyed spending time with his children.""

Florida police officials are still investigating Jared's death and did not name any suspects.

Jacksonville Beach Police Sergeant Tonya Tator told News 4 Jax: ""As you can imagine everything that we do we have to do it the right way in an investigation.""

""So sometimes we have to get subpoenas to look at people’s private information in reference to cell phones computers you name it.""

Sergeant Tonya disclosed: ""I would hope that money would not be the driving factor for someone to speak up. But if it is I hope that this helps.""

""I hope that this leads to more tips. More eyes out there looking for the truck."""

Combined with 105 million doses the government already agreed to buy from Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE for $3.2 billion the latest deal puts the U.S. booster dose supply at about 171 million shots.

COVID-19 infections in the United States have been on the rise as the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant have spread to account for more than 90% of U.S. infections according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

These subvariants have significant mutations from the earliest versions of Omicron and protection from vaccines wanes over time.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June recommended that vaccine manufacturers target these subvariants for a potential fall season booster dose in a bivalent vaccine that also includes the original strain.

Moderna’s initial 66 million doses are for delivery this year. The government’s deals with Moderna and Pfizer could go up to 300 million doses from each company if it exercises all of its options and secures funding from the Congress.

“As we look to the fall and winter… we are ensuring Americans have the tools they need to stay safe and help keep our nation moving forward” U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement.

The booster candidates need to secure FDA authorization and a recommendation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before they can be made available for wider use.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Amazon Health Services last week moved beyond experimenting with in-person care via provider agreements (Crossover Health TTA 17 May) to being in the provider business with an agreement to acquire One Medical. Earlier this month news leaked that One Medical as 1Life Healthcare was up for sale to the right buyer having spurned CVS and after watching their stock on Nasdaq plummet 75%.

The cash deal for $3.9 billion including assumption of debt is certainly a good one representing $18 per share a premium to their $14 share IPO in January 2020. (The stock closed last Wednesday before the announcement at just above $10 per share then plumped to ~$17 where it remains.)

then plumped to ~$17 where it remains.) The announcement is oddly not on One Medical’s website but is on Amazon’s here .

. The buy is subject to shareholder and the usual regulatory approvals. The IPO was managed by JP Morgan Securities and Morgan Stanley. It is primarily backed by Alphabet (Google).

One Medical’s CEO Amir Dan Rubin will stay on but there is no other executive transition mention.

Also not mentioned: the Iora Health operation that serves primarily Medicare patients in full-risk value-based care models such as Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicare shared savings quite opposite to One Medical’s membership-based concierge model. However Iora’s website is largely cut over to One Medical’s identity and their coverage is limited to seven states.

There is a huge amount of opinion on the buy but for this Editor it is clear that Amazon with One Medical is buying itself into in-person and virtual primary care for the employer market where it had limited success with its present largely virtual offering and entree with commercial plans and MA. One Medical has over 700000 patients 8000 company clients and has 125 physical offices in 12 major US markets including NYC Los Angeles Boston and Atlanta. It has never turned a profit. Looking at their website they welcome primarily commercial plans and MA (but not Medicare supplement plans).

Amazon with both a virtual plus provider network now has a huge advantage over Teladoc and Amwell both of which have previously brushed off Amazon as a threat to their business. There is the potential to run two models: the current Amazon Care pay-as-you-go model and the One Medical corporate/concierge model. This puts Amazon squarely in UHC’s Optum Health territory which owns or has agreements with over 5% of US primary care practices is fully in value-based care models such as Medicare shared savings through its ACOs and is aggressively virtual plus integrating services such as data analytics pharmacy and financial. Becker’s

What doesn’t quite fit is Iora Health and the higher cost/higher care needs Medicare market that is less profitable and requires advanced risk management a skill set that Amazon doesn’t have. This Editor will make a small prediction that Iora will be sold or spun off after the sale.

This Editor continues to believe that the real game for Amazon is monetizing patient data. That has gained traction since we opined that was the real Amazon Game in June and October last year To restate it: Amazon Care’s structure offerings cheap pricing feeds our opinion that Amazon’s real aim is to accumulate and own national healthcare data on the service’s users. Then they will monetize it by selling it to pharmaceutical companies payers developers and other commercial third parties in and ex-US. Patients may want to think twice. This opinion is now shared by those with bigger voices such as the American Economic Liberties Project. In their statement they urged that the government block the buy due to Amazon’s cavalier attitudes towards customer data and far too much internal access unsecured to customer information (Revealnews.org from Wired). Adding PHI to this is like putting gasoline on a raging fire and One Medical customers are apparently concerned. For what it’s worth Senator Bernie Sanders has already tweeted against it. MarketWatch

Whether this current administration and the DOJ will actually care about PHI and patient privacy is anyone’s guess but TTA has noted that Amazon months ago beefed up its DC lobbying presence last year. According to Opensecrets.org they spent $19.3 million last year. In fairness Amazon is a leading Federal service provider via Amazon Web Services. (Did you know that AWS stores the CIA’s information?) One Medical is also relatively small–not a Village MD/Village Medical now majority owned by Walgreens Boots. This is why this Editor believes that HHS DOJ and FTC will give it a pass unlike UHG’s acquisition of Change Healthcare especially if Amazon agrees to divest itself of the Iora Health business.

Treat yourself to the speculation including that it will be added as an Amazon Prime benefit to the 44% of Americans who actually spend for an Amazon Prime membership. It may very well change part of the delivery model for primary care and force other traditional providers to provide more integrated care which is as old as Kaiser and Geisinger. It may demolish telehealth providers like Teladoc and Amwell. But as we’ve also noted Amazon like founder Jeff Bezos deflects and veils its intents very well.

The Chicago-headquartered firm has recorded an improved position boosted by recent acquisitions including the Clif Bar snacks business as well as enhanced demand for its core lines including Oreo – which was a major focus for the company at this year’s Sweets & Snacks Expo (see our exclusive interview with Rick Brindle the company’s vice president of industry development here).

Furthermore the business reported a firm increase across its global operations with Europe leading its results delivering $2.6 billion revenues followed closely by North America producing $2.2 billion with Asia also enjoyed a 5.7% upturn to $1.5 billion in sales.

Net earnings for the second quarter period were $747 million with the company’s CEO Dirk Van de Put expressing confidence for the company’s continued upturn despite the wider industry facing pressures on ingredients prices logistics and geopolitical trading uncertainties.

He said: “Our second quarter and first half results were marked by strong top and bottom-line performance across all regions and categories supporting the raising of our full-year revenue growth outlook.

“Our chocolate and biscuit businesses continue to demonstrate strong volume growth and pricing resilience across both developed and emerging markets. These results combined with ongoing cost discipline simplification and revenue growth management are delivering robust profit dollar growth and strong cash flow enabling us to increase our dividend by 10 percent.

“We also continue to execute against our strategy of accelerating our core business while reshaping our portfolio most recently with our agreement to acquire Clif Bar a leader in high growth well-being snack bars creating a $1 billion-plus snack bar business. Clif Bar has the leading position in the U.S. protein and nutrition segments with clear opportunities to expand domestic and international distribution velocities and profitability to create significant value for our shareholders in the years to come.”

It has certainly changed Apple. In an otherwise bumpy week for technology stocks the world’s most valuable company beat forecasts to report a modest year-on-year increase in revenue. That was in large part thanks to the iPhone which generated sales of more than $40bn in the latest quarter.

Yet as the worldwide smartphone market matures the iPhone’s dominant role in Apple’s fortunes is diminishing. Whereas at its peak the device made up two-thirds of the firm’s revenue in the latest quarter its contribution was just under half (see chart).

It made all the difference.

The couple from Gretna Nebraska a community on the outskirts of Omaha where Dave Harrig now is a volunteer firefighter allowed themselves to buy a new home some vintage automobiles and a few ocean cruises after they both quit their jobs.

But nine years later they still live much as they always did remaining in their community keeping up with church family and friends and teaching their children to work hard to make a living despite any financial windfall that might come their way.

Many other winners haven’t been as lucky suffering personal setbacks and lawsuits or becoming the victims of scams. The latest winner of a big jackpot came Friday when a single ticket sold in Illinois matched the numbers for a $1.337 billion Mega Millions prize. Illinois is among the states where winners of more than $250000 can choose to not reveal their names.

Dave Harrig an Air Force veteran who worked in aircraft maintenance says keeping things simple probably saved him and his family from the kind of hassles and tragedies that have befallen other big winners.

Almost overnight the Harrig family mailbox was filled with letters full of hard luck stories: sick children lost jobs burned out homes.

Dave Harrig said they ignored them all and focused on their own family and charities.

They didn't even touch the principal on their winnings until just a few years ago when they tapped into it to fund a new museum of firefighting in Gretna that will open soon.

“We have nicer things a bigger house and more than we ever had in the past. But we are the same and my wife and I keep each other in check” Dave Harrig said encouraging future lottery winners to invest wisely choose a national investment adviser rather than a local one and to avoid advisers who try to sell financial products.

They've ignored false rumors that have swirled about them suggesting that his wife at one point ran off with a doctor and that he had a lawyer girlfriend. Their four children endured teasing at school.

“We're still learning but it has helped to stay working together as a team” he said of himself and his wife.

He acknowledged the struggles of some past winners saying the experience of winning a jackpot “can really accentuate your character and any addictions.”

The late Andrew Whittaker Jr. of West Virginia suffered lawsuits and personal setbacks after he claimed a record $315 million Powerball jackpot on Christmas night in 2002.

At the time it was the largest U.S. lottery jackpot won by a single ticket. People harassed him so much with requests for money he was quoted several times saying he wished he had torn up the ticket.

Before dying of natural causes in 2020 at age 72 he struggled with alcohol and gambling problems and had a series of personal tragedies including the death of his granddaughter.

Winning the lottery brought other kinds of headaches for Manuel Franco of West Allis Wisconsin who claimed a $768 million lottery jackpot in April 2019.

Then just 24 Franco excitedly held a news conference to discuss his win but later reportedly went into hiding amid harassment by strangers and the news media.

The Better Business Bureau of Wisconsin began warning people in 2021 about messages from scammers who claimed to be the multimillion-dollar winner.

Using Franco’s name the scammers sent text messages social media messages phone calls and emails phishing for personal information telling recipients they had been chosen to receive money.

The BBB said scammers got more than $13000 from people they tricked including people in Alabama and Colorado.

Despite the problems encountered by the winners lottery officials favor publicly identifying winners to instill public trust in the games.

That's in large part because some past drawings have been rigged. Former Multi-State Lottery Association information security director Eddie Tipton pleaded guilty in 2017 to manipulating software so he could predict winning numbers on certain days of the year. He and his brother rigged jackpots in numerous states for a combined payout of some $24 million.",,,,,,,,,

Tesla estimated then that qualified owners should expect an email from the company asking them to submit their selected photo sometime in December 2018.

“Launch Your Photo into Deep Space Orbit – We’ll laser-etch any image onto glass and send it into deep space orbit for millions of years. Refer more friends while you wait for an alien race to discover your payload” Tesla wrote.

Tesla ultimately sent this email at the beginning of June this year. Despite being several years late numerous owners promptly submitted their selected photos to the company. However some members of the r/TeslaMotors subreddit lightly mentioned that they ended up missing Tesla’s notification about the reward partly because it’s been so long since it was announced.

As can be seen on Tesla’s official page for the referral program it will be sending a photo mosaic to space. A close look at the photo mosaic reveals a number of interesting image choices from qualified owners from selfies family pictures artworks photos of beloved pets and even a QR code. Needless to say Tesla’s laser-etched photo mosaic is definitely interesting — possibly even confounding any extraterrestrial that may find it floating around in space sometime in the future.

The laser-etched photo mosaic forms the iconic image of Starman and his Tesla Roadster with the Earth in the background. The historic image was snapped during the maiden flight of SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy spacecraft in 2018 which carried Elon Musk’s personal Tesla Roadster as its mass simulator. Starman and Elon Musk’s spacefaring Tesla Roadster has become part of pop culture inspiring artworks and even a comic book series.

The photo mosaic is set to be launched this August 4 2022. The image will be carried to space in a Falcon 9 rocket that will also be carrying South Korea’s Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO) spacecraft. Clive Neal a lunar scientist at the University of Notre Dame has noted that the KPLO carries a “cadre of instruments that will yield important information about the Moon.”

Born in 1927 in Lakemba New South Wales he wrote poetry and plays before his first novel The Chantic Bird appeared in 1968 the dust-flap proclaiming that Ireland “intends concentrating future efforts on the novel”. It was a good decision for he won his first Miles Franklin Award four years later and commenced writing full-time the following year.

Haunted by the plight of the underclass

Fascinated by sweeping existential issues and their impact on the lives of those oblivious to them Ireland was also compassionately haunted by the plight of society’s underclasses and the great silence about them. Characters in his early novels are factory workers the unemployed the homeless and those lost to alcohol or beset by mental illness.

The Chantic Bird opens with its teenage-delinquent narrator saying “I’m only telling you this to let you know what a silly thing it is to live like I do” and ends with “Don’t forget I’m writing to show you what a silly thing it is to live”. For readers contrarily the book has demonstrated the potential joy of living shown why the narrator lives as he does and exposed wider existential issues.

These themes are fully matured and pressed deeper harder in his second novel The Unknown Industrial Prisoner (1971). It won the 1972 Miles Franklin and is widely (if not unanimously) regarded as his best novel. It would be my personal choice as one of the great Australian novels.

Ireland once worked for an oil company and drew upon this for The Unknown Industrial Prisoner creating Puroil a coastal Sydney oil refinery out near the mangroves. The lives of the employees “human bacteria” known only by nicknames unfold as a mosaic of repetitive work time-killing blokeyness and a deep existential yearning: “Somewhere beyond the refinery’s dome of dust and gas the sun shone splendidly golden.”

Poetic futility and conservative furores

The Glass Canoe (1976) uncovers a quirky microcosm in the tribe of regulars at a Sydney pub. The repellent futility of their drunkenness violence and sexism becomes bleakly poetic in Ireland’s hands again teasing out that inarticulate existential yearning a belief that somehow things are meant to be better than this. The Glass Canoe earned Ireland his second Miles Franklin.

Then came brushes with reactionary conservative authority. In 1978 Film Australia offered funding for a movie based on The Unknown Industrial Prisoner. But then-Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser’s Home Affairs Minister Bob Ellicott intervened to cancel the project on the grounds it was “uncommercial” in a rare example of political interference in the film industry. Proposals to set The Glass Canoe as a NSW high-school text caused a furore in 1982. The book was labelled “unsuitable” and one scene “pornographic”. Doug Swan then-Director-General of Education in NSW confirmed there had been several complaints.

A keynote of Ireland’s style was his use of short sub-headed chapters (29 are nestled in the 35 pages of chapter four of The Unknown Industrial Prisoner). These shatter narrative expectations of chronology or linearity giving an exhilarating sense of scope diversity pluralism. They shout that society teems with individualities – and this is an outright challenge to the worlds the novel focuses on which are typically as narrow mono and blokey as an oil refinery or a pub.

As a young Sydney Uni postgrad in 1976 I met Ireland in his tiny Sydney writing pad and inadvertently opened a door to an empty low-lit room. The floor was carpeted with card-sized slips of paper some of which fluttered up and relocated upon my entry.

“Sorry not that door” said Ireland and proceeded to explain that his novels evolved from scenes and images each jotted onto a card. (The Unknown Industrial Prisoner is composed of 330 of these.) He would arrange and rearrange them on the floor mosaic-style in a process that was allowed to take however long was needed.

Vision compassion and wit

For A Woman of the Future (1979) he adopted the voice of young Sydneysider Alethea Hunt placing her in a world of characters undergoing metamorphosis. (At novel’s end Alethea famously transforms into a leopard.) This won a third Miles Franklin and is now perhaps his best-known novel.

In a review at the time of publication Rosemary Creswell negotiated the issue of appropriation by suggesting we could perhaps “take heart in the fact that a male writer is attempting so directly to come to terms with the female experience”. She concluded that the novel should be “admired for its acute perceptions not of political and social constructs for which Ireland is so often praised but of the nature of the existential condition.” Yes!

By the late 1990s as Peter Craven once observed Ireland’s vision “may well have been displaced in the public consciousness by the novels of Peter Carey and Tim Winton both of them big canvas men”. While Ireland had not abandoned “big canvas” he became more interested in exploring the nature of creativity itself and Bloodfather (1987) and The Chosen (1997) both followed the artistic development of young Davis Blood – creating a sense of narrowed focus.

Both books were more “difficult” reads. Narrower focus did not prevent The Chosen from tackling the lives of the 52 characters living in Little River but it was hard-slog remembering who was who. Ireland’s vision compassion and wit remained intact – it was just a tad less accessible.

The “preface” to The Unknown Industrial Prisoner – placed just six pages before the end of the book – describes the novel as “this mosaic of one kind of human life this galaxy of painted slides my bleak ratio of illuminations”.

Ireland’s legacy is far from a bleak ratio and extends beyond just one kind of human life; he left us an intricate mosaic of Australian existence in his time.",,,,,,

Senior Analyst Research

Can a weakening yen (JPY) continue to bolster Japanese equity markets? If historical relationships remain intact the answer may be yes.

The JPY has steadily depreciated against the dollar (USD) this year losing more than 15% as the worst performing G10 currency.

This isn’t unprecedented however considering the headwinds driving the yen lower versus the greenback. The U.S. much like the rest of the global economy is wrestling with the highest inflation in four decades rapidly forcing the Federal Reserve into monetary tightening. Speculation about where the rate hike cycle may ultimately conclude over the next 12-24 months is driving the USD higher. Despite some of the highest readings in inflation in the last decade the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has remained committed to its accommodative policies of negative short-term interest rates and yield curve control. As a result of ever-widening interest rate differentials between the U.S. and Japan the JPY has weakened dramatically.

Implications for Japanese Equities

The JPY has historically been negatively correlated with Japanese equity markets owing to the orientation of Japan’s economy toward exporters. Among G10 currencies it’s also the most negatively correlated to its domestic equity market over the long term even surpassing the USD on a rolling 10-year basis. Although correlations have increased over the last several months they remain firmly in negative territory on a rolling 60-month basis.

Rolling 60M Correlation between Yen & MSCI Jspan

A weaker JPY in this rate environment also encourages currency hedging. With higher interest rates in the U.S. JPY investors derive positive carry by taking currency risk out of their Japanese investments. As the yen weakens further even more carry is derived.

3-Month Carry

Conclusion: a weakening JPY has yielded higher Japanese equity prices over the long term and may even help diversify U.S. equity risk. Currency hedging may also improve returns via interest rate differentials.

What’s driving this relationship? When analyzing where Japanese companies derive their revenue we note that only six of eleven sectors in the MSCI Japan Index derive more than 50% of their revenue from the domestic market. Contrast this with China and India long considered among the world’s foremost exporters and we see that both countries are even more dependent on their domestic consumers.

No sector in China derives less than 50% of its revenue from outside the country. In India only two sectors are export-dominant by this threshold.

Korea a close competitor of Japan’s is more export-oriented but may suffer over the near term if the yen continues to weaken.

Coupled with a historically weak yen the export orientation of Japan’s economy may be a catalyst for its equity market for a few reasons.

The BoJ’s Conundrum

The BoJ is confronted with low economic growth and rising but relatively unimpactful inflation forcing it to maintain its dovish stance.

From a growth perspective Japan has struggled to reignite its economic engines after the COVID-19 pandemic. GDP growth has been underwhelming during the 2020-2021 recovery cycle that many other nations benefitted from.

Meanwhile year-over-year inflation was recorded at 2.5% at the end of May which is the highest since mid-2014. It still may not be enough to force the BoJ into a hawkish pivot.

Between low growth and benign inflation the BoJ is caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place at a time when developed market peers are turning to monetary tightening. Without interest rate hikes on the horizon many of the headwinds that have already weighed on the yen this year may be exacerbated. Further JPY downside is both plausible and possible.

FX-Hedged Exposure May Be Prudent

The WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund (DXJ) may be suited for prevailing markets. Designed to attain broad exposure to Japanese dividend-payers it also screens for companies that derive 80% or less of their revenue from within Japan to target a global revenue base.

From the tables above it’s evident that DXJ has even greater revenue diversification than the broader Japanese equity market and that of other large international exporters. Nearly 30% of its total revenue exposure is also centered in the U.S. and China two of the world’s largest and globalized consumer bases.

Its static currency hedge may protect against further JPY weakening amid ongoing BoJ dovishness as well.

If the second half of 2022 looks anything like the first then currency-hedged equity exposure in Japan one of the lone markets where there may be a compelling case for equity appreciation may prove beneficial.

Now she's the CEO of Absolut Jameson and Malibu: 'I walked into the fire',"This story is part of the Behind the Desk series where CNBC Make It gets personal with successful business executives to find out everything from how they got to where they are to what makes them get out of bed in the morning to their daily routines. Ann Mukherjee thinks about a simple question every day: If you had a chance to change the world what would you do? Mukherjee 56 is the North American CEO and chairman of Pernod Ricard the world's second-largest seller of wine and spirits — meaning she's in charge of famous top-shelf liquor brands like Absolut Jameson and Malibu. And she understands first-hand how alcohol can change someone's life because it almost ruined hers — twice. She says her earliest memory as a child is of an assault she suffered at the hands of two drunk teenagers. And when she was 14 her mother was killed by a drunk driver. Her job today she says helps turn her pain into ""positive meaningful change."" ""We should never just accept that bad things happen"" Mukherjee tells CNBC Make It. ""As a leader I feel a strong sense to stand up for those who have gone through similar experiences as I have and do everything I can to make sure others never have to go through it."" Mukherjee's first act as CEO in 2019 for example: launching an Absolut Vodka ad campaign about sexual consent. Under its tongue-in-cheek slogan ""Drink responsibly"" the ads promoted a new hashtag: ""#SexResponsibly."" ""Our products are meant to unlock magic not to be used for harm"" Mukherjee who sits on the national board for the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) says. ""If you're going to use these products as a weapon then don't buy them."" Here Mukherjee talks about how trauma affected her ability to lead the person who permanently altered the trajectory of her career and a lesson she's learned as a woman CEO in a male-dominated industry:

On the moment that made Mukherjee a leader: 'I couldn't deal with her death being senseless'

I was five years old when my parents immigrated from Kolkata India to Chicago. I was an only child and my mother was my best friend. My father was always more distant so she ingrained in me the importance of being independent and how to deal with difficulties in life. When she died I went from being a smart-aleck kid to a capable adult within minutes. After the doctor pronounced her dead I saw her body. I hugged her. Then I sat very still in the hospital hallway and immediately started thinking about how I was going to organize the funeral and prepare her body for burial. I couldn't deal with her death being senseless. I had to give it meaning and keep moving. My life has always been that way: When tragedy or a challenge hits me I immediately think ""What am I going to do about it?"" Life isn't about what happens to you. It's about how you respond when things get hard. I learned that lesson very early.

On how falling in love pushed her to take a leap of faith: 'I walked into the fire'

[My husband] Dipu and I met in an online chat room in 1995. The winners for [1994] Miss Universe and Miss World were both from India were announced just months earlier and he was like ""Shouldn't we be proud?"" I called him a moron. I said ""We're supposed to be proud because there's two beautiful women recognized? Did they find the cure for cancer?"" and he asked me on a date. He's a master mixologist. When we moved in together his boxes of barware took over half the house. He's the one who re-introduced me to alcohol and showed me that if it's done right it can be fun. When I was asked to interview at Pernod Ricard it was Dipu who said ""Don't screw this up!"" I was unsure if I could work for a wine and spirits brand after everything I'd gone through. He said ""Don't you get it? The universe is talking to you and telling you that this is your opportunity to right wrongs. How could you say no?"" Part of being a great leader is having people around you that tell you what you need to hear not just what you want to hear. Dipu has shown me that if you can be a lifelong learner vulnerable enough to listen it could lead to really great things. I realized that you can either walk away from fire or you can walk into it. I walked into the fire. If I'm in this role for five or seven years am I going to solve everything before I leave? No. What I hope to leave is a legacy of people who are inspired and believe that they can make a difference.

We have seen large-scale digital transformation across industry sectors over the last two years as well as a dramatic shift in how organisations operate. According to a recent IDC report data has increased at an exponential rate and is on track to reach 175 Zettabytes by 2025. At this rate we will most likely surpass 1 Yottabyte of data created in a single year by 2030. As a result there is a greater reliance on reliable data storage and management options - such as data centers.



Today's data centers have features such as 24x7 availability security scalability and performance. Ensuring that all these requirements are met is a power-intensive endeavor that results in rising CO2 emissions. Data centers currently consume a large amount of energy (about 200 terawatt hours per year) and the resulting emissions are expected to be greater than those produced by the entire aircraft industry.

At a time when environmental impact has become a mission-critical component of business operations data centers have a huge opportunity to incorporate environmentally-friendly practices into their operations.Powering changeData centers must find more efficient ways to use space and power. One way of doing this is by raising racks higher to fit more servers into the same floor space. Because they have a smaller footprint overall taller racks can use more controlled cooling in a more contained space.It is encouraging to see that data centers have become more conscious of their environmental impact in recent years. Some have recently remodeled their facilities to drastically reduce water consumption by implementing new water-cooling systems. New battery technology also ensures that fewer longer-lasting batteries are used.To reduce their environmental impact even further data center s have begun to collaborate with local power utilities to increase the percentage of green energy they use. To offset their carbon footprints many data centers purchase renewable energy credits allowing them to invest in renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. Even if they continue to rely heavily on fossil fuel-generated electricity a data center with enough energy credits can claim carbon neutrality. These credits can be used in conjunction with their larger sustainability efforts which include energy and water conservation waste management and other measures.5 ways data centers can bring about sustainability in operations:Many businesses have storage systems that are underutilized. To save energy and other resources consolidate data where possible and turn off devices that are not in use. Research shows that 68% or more of data is never used once it has been created and that up to 30% of an organisation’s unstructured data is duplicated outmoded or trivial. Enterprises should periodically take stock of their data to understand if there are redundancies and how these can be reduced. IT solutions such as software-defined storage can help streamline and automate data and storage activities. With the use of machine learning and predictive analytics enterprises can make better use of their storage solutions boost efficiency and enjoy optimum resource utilization.While the focus on data centers as a storage method continues to rise businesses are effectively delegating their carbon footprint to public cloud providers. Today the cloud as a storage option has become a vital resource for companies aiming for net zero. By prioritizing sustainability and utilizing Cloud Insights to pinpoint underutilized and wasted resources and identify the most valuable data enterprises can eliminate energy wastage in data centers.Achieving sustainability goals is a shared responsibility between the enterprise and storage solution providers. Within the enterprise it is imperative that workforces understand their impact on the environment as well as steps that can be taken to jointly work towards achieving sustainability goals. Education and awareness are critical in ensuring this and will play an important role in meeting environmental goals.Sustainable technology is that which meets the needs of the current generation without jeopardizing the needs of future generations. Businesses must develop and implement a strategy that combines cloud and physical storage in order to build better more sustainable organisations.The author is the Director Solutions Engineering - India /SAARC NetAppDISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETCIO.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.

The suit further claims that Barlow and Bear misrepresented to the audience that they had permission to use Netflix's Bridgerton trademark despite the streamer's objections.

In addition the lawsuit mentions Barlow and Bear's sales of Bridgerton-branded merchandise at the Kennedy Center and online. As of Saturday morning the merchandise page at BarlowandBear.com featured only items bearing the creators' names.

Netflix has also capitalized on the fame of the show which premiered in 2020 and became the streamer's most-watched show at the time. ""The Queen's Ball: A Bridgerton Experience"" brings an immersive Regency party to fans around the country and Netflix's online and brick-and-mortar stores sell Bridgerton merch.

""There is so much joy in seeing audiences fall in love with Bridgerton and watching the creative ways they express their fandom"" the show's executive producer Shonda Rhimes told EW in a statement. ""What started as a fun celebration by Barlow & Bear on social media has turned into the blatant taking of intellectual property solely for Barlow & Bear's financial benefit. This property was created by Julia Quinn and brought to life on screen through the hard work of countless individuals. Just as Barlow & Bear would not allow others to appropriate their IP for profit Netflix cannot stand by and allow Barlow & Bear to do the same with Bridgerton.""

EW spoke with Barlow and Bear in February 2021 about the unofficial musical's runaway success.

""It truly has every element you'd want for a Broadway show"" Bear said at the time. ""Abigail texted me the night she started 'Ocean Away' and was like 'Oh my God Emily what if Bridgerton was a musical?' and I had the same exact reaction as the rest of the world which was 'Oh my God yes.'""

The musical features songs written for many of the show's beloved characters including Eloise (Claudia Jessie) Penelope (Nicola Coughlan) Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor) and Simon (Regé-Jean Page).

In her conversation with EW Barlow credited the pandemic for giving them the room to build their following online. ""I feel like a few years ago Netflix probably would've sent us a cease-and-desist for what we're doing but I think in a time like this it is so important to have a creative outlet"" she said.

In January 2021 Julia Quinn the author of the books on which the series is based told E! News that she knew all about the musical. ""I can't believe that's actually happening. I'll be sort of humming in the shower and realize I've been humming one of the Bridgerton the Musical songs"" she said.

Quinn's statement to EW today mirrors Netflix and Rhimes' sentiments.

""Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear are wildly talented and I was flattered and delighted when they began composing Bridgerton songs and sharing with other fans on TikTok"" she said in her statement. ""There is a difference however between composing on TikTok and recording and performing for commercial gain. I would hope that Barlow & Bear who share my position as independent creative professionals understand the need to protect other professionals' intellectual property including the characters and stories I created in the Bridgerton novels over 20 years ago.""

This April The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical beat out Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cinderella Les Misérables: The Staged Concert the cast recording of Girl From the North Country and Stephen Schwartz's Snapshots to win a Grammy.

""A year ago when I asked the internet 'What if Bridgerton was a musical?' I could not have imagined we would be holding a Grammy in our hands"" Barlow said in her acceptance speech. ""We want to thank everyone on the internet who has watched us create this album from the ground up. We share this with you.""

Barlow & Bear LLC and Pink & Purple Lady Inc. are also named in the suit.

Representatives for Barlow and Bear did not immediately respond to EW's requests for comment.

Uncharted also now streaming on Netflix India.

Based on the PlayStation video games that have released various entries over the past decade or so the movie saw Tom Holland take up the role of Nathan Drake a legendary fortune hunter.

The movie was a hit for Sony early in the year when it grossed over $400 million at the box office.

Alongside Holland saw Mark Wahlberg play the iconic role of Sully Sophia Taylor Ali as Chloe and Tati Gabrielle as Braddock.

When will Sony release Uncharted in cinemas?

Sony released Uncharted in theaters on February 18th 2022 (although was originally planned for July 2021 and delayed again recently from February 11th to February 18th).

When will Uncharted be on Netflix?

Netflix is getting Uncharted in the United States thanks to the newly struck Sony deal in 2021. All theatrical movies from Sony come to Netflix in the pay-1 window.

Exactly how long this pay-1 window is still unclear. It’s thought to be anywhere between 120 and 200 days following its theatrical release.

In June we got confirmation that the movie would be coming to Netflix exactly 119 days following its theatrical release and it was due to arrive on Netflix on July 15th 2022.

Unfortunately we’ve learned that Netflix won’t be getting Uncharted on July 15th. It turns out it’s now being delayed by over a month.

An updated message on the Uncharted page now states that Uncharted won’t be coming to Netflix until August 19th 2022.

That was until late July 2022 when we got word that Netflix had moved up the date of Uncharted’s release to August 5th 2022.

A Netflix representative responded to our request for a comment saying that release dates often move and are subject to change.

Netflix India is unaffected by this delay with the movie available as of July 12th 2022.

Once Netflix eventually gets the movie they should carry it for 18 months before departing the service for Disney’s various assortment of services (in this instance we suspect it’ll release on Hulu).

That means the movie shouldn’t leave the service early 2024.

Will other Netflix regions get Uncharted?

At the moment we’re not aware of any additional deal for other regions of Netflix outside the United States.

Many regions right now however do have second window rights to Sonys output. That would mean you’d see the movie added in late 2023 or early 2024.

We’ve also released date estimates for a few other Sony movies set to hit Netflix in the US as part of the expansive new deal including Morbius (which will be the second theatrical movie to arrive as part of the deal) and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2. We’ve also seen Honey Girls Never Back Down: Revolt and Who We Are: A Chronicle of Racism in America arrive as part of this deal. You can find more Sony movies coming to Netflix here.

Are you looking forward to Tom Holland’s Uncharted hitting Netflix? Let us know in the comments!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC9ycnItZGlyZWN0b3Itc3VycHJpc2VkLWJ5LW5ldGZsaXgtc3VjY2Vzcy0xMjM0NzQ2ODYzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'RRR' Director Surprised by Indian Film's Netflix Success,"One of Netflix’s most surprising successes in 2022 has been “RRR” S.S. Rajamouli‘s sprawling Tollywood epic about the unlikely friendship between two Indian revolutionaries. From intricately choreographed dance numbers and CGI lions to copious amounts of meme-able bromance moments the film truly has everything an audience could want. And while it was always destined to be a theatrical blockbuster in India it also found a large global audience once it began streaming on Netflix. At this point the film has exceeded everyone’s expectations including Rajamouli’s.

“Yes I was surprised with the reception from the West” Rajamouli said in a new interview with Entertainment Weekly. “A good story is a good story for everyone but I didn’t think I could make films for Western sensibilities. I never believed myself. So when it came out on Netflix and people started watching it and word of mouth started spreading when the critics started giving out good reviews yes I was really really surprised.”

The comments were made as part of a conversation between Rajamouli and Joe and Anthony Russo who recently directed “The Gray Man” for Netflix. The three men are responsible for some of the largest blockbusters of the century so far and they discussed the challenges and rewards of large scale filmmaking.

“I think you’ve seen over the past decade [that] action films have become more popular” Anthony Russo said. “And sort of things like comedy sometimes things that are specific to cultural sensitivities or understandings… they haven’t been as popular as they once were. And I think that speaks to the fact that action is a language that connects the global audience in a strong way.”

The Russo Brothers clearly think that Rajamouli is pretty good at speaking the global language of action as they both had nothing but praise for his work on “RRR.”

“What I think is so amazing about [‘RRR’] is the emotion it evokes combined with the spectacle” Joe Russo said. “And I would say in five years [digital distribution] has probably done more for diversity and access to diverse and international films than Hollywood has done in 50 years.”"

Stand by your man?

“Highly salacious and unsubstantiated gossip about the British royal family” was there for all (or some anyway) to see briefly in the Oz the online “youth section” of Rupert Murdoch’s The Australian. “The article discussed in graphic detail the alleged sex life of a royal based on a single ‘blind’ item of gossip from a notorious Instagram account that did not name the subject” reported The Guardian. “It was followed up by a jokey TikTok video of the Queen ‘reacting’ to the sexual gossip as News Corp Australia pushed the story to its social media accounts.”

Three hours later it was all pulled. (What was so salacious and so unsubstantiated? Sorry this is a family newsletter but googling “William” “pegging” and “open secret” should tell you what you need to know.) The episode inevitably rekindled 2019’s highly salacious and unsubstantiated rumors about an affair between Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge’s erstwhile best friend Rose Hanbury.

In Denby … A little fragile for Red Light Green Light but …

Denby Pottery has been quietly producing colored-glaze ceramics in this Derbyshire village since 1809. Not a bad run. But no one could have predicted what’s happened more recently: the brand has become wildly popular outside the U.K. (where it earns more than 50 percent of its sales) particularly in Asia where its valuation is around $60 million and—serious product placement—its Halo tea/coffee cup was featured in an episode of Squid Game. An Instagram page for South Korean fans has 19000 followers. Fans of Denby Pottery in Derbyshire that is not Squid Game.

“The brand is so desirable abroad that it has expanded its range of bowls to attract the Korean market” reported The Times of London. “Items include nesting pots straight-sided rice and deep ramen noodle bowls small round dishes as well as soju cups in which to serve Korean alcohol.” While Denby has opened a store in Seoul’s swank Gangnam district the ceramics company’s C.E.O. told the newspaper they’ve “resisted the temptation to offshore [our production] and now our ‘Made in England’ label is a key part of our appeal overseas.”

In Rome … All roads lead to well no one?

Wonderful country Italy but would you really want to run it? The far-right Brothers of Italy would—with 23.4 percent of voters it’s currently Italy’s largest party—and an alliance with Matteo Salvini’s anti-immigrant League Party and Forza Italia which is headed by the periodic prime minister/current living waxwork Silvio Berlusconi would give it a parliamentary majority. But there’s a problem: lack of experience. And Giorgia Meloni the leader of Brothers of Italy is reportedly turning to members of Mario Draghi’s just-collapsed government for help.

“They are looking for people with technical competence and trying some of Draghi’s personnel because they have got no one of their own” said the television journalist Corrado Formigli according to The Times of London. “Meloni is an intelligent woman and she’s the first to understand that her party doesn’t have figures like that.”

Oh and there’s one other even bigger problem: Meloni doesn’t want to join that hypothetical coalition. “[Her] decision … led to a jump in support for her party” said the newspaper. “Since the beginning of the campaign she has been at pains to reassure voters and international observers that while Brothers of Italy is rooted in Benito Mussolini’s fascist movement it is nothing to be feared today.” Snap elections are in September.

In Paris … Kind of like Ratatouille. But not

One of the “helpers in the mastery of waste”?

A member of Mayor Anne Hidalgo’s Socialist-Green coalition has asked citizens to be more understanding of Parisian rats casting them as unfairly stigmatized victims of prejudice. “I prefer to call them surmulots which has a less negative sound” said council member Douchka Markovic according to The Times of London. That word continued the newspaper means “oversized field mice … a more cuddly term for the brown Norway common rat. The rodents ‘play an important role in the sewers by evacuating hundreds of tonnes of waste and unblocking the pipes’ Markovic said. ‘They are our helpers in the mastery of waste.’ The city must learn more about their way of life and switch to ‘ethical non-lethal’ ways of controlling them.”

Many residents of the rat-plagued city were not receptive to the notion. “The National Academy of Medicine based in rat-friendly Saint-Germain-des-Prés stepped in with an attack on the councillor” according to the newspaper and reminded people that “the rat remains a threat to human health because of the numerous diseases it spreads through its parasites excrement bites and scratches. You can die from them.”

In al-Hajar al-Aswad … Maybe C.G.I. next time?

Home Operation a Chinese action film from Jackie Chan and “inspired by China’s evacuation of hundreds of its nationals from Yemen in 2015 during the civil conflict there” has according to The Guardian drawn outrage for shooting scenes in this devastated Syrian town. “The New Arab quoted Syrian journalist Fared al-Mahlool saying: ‘It is shameful to film such films on the ruins of Syrian homes that were destroyed by the Assad regime Russia and Iran … the Chinese fascist regime is an ally of Syria and they are trying to whitewash their crimes in actions like this’” said the newspaper.

In Venice … Water water everywhere …

Fountains of Venice? Handling tourism or attempting to seems to take up much of this city’s energy and now a new front has opened up. “Tourism is responsible for between 28 and 40 per cent of the city’s rubbish including piles of dumped plastic water bottles according to local government data” reported The Times of London. So officials are urging visitors to avoid plastic bottles and instead avail themselves of Venice’s 126 fountains. To that end “Veritas a water distribution company has developed the phone app that allows visitors to access a map of all the fountains in Venice.” B.Y.O.B. then and … just fill it up. —George Kalogerakis

He was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis but fearing a negative impact from his Jewish birthright he became Episcopalian.

Krulak graduated in 1934 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps but required an exemption due to his 5’ 4” stature. He wrestled in the academy and earned the nickname “Brute” in jest because of his size but he ultimately embodied the name as a preeminent strategist for the Marine Corps.

While stationed in Shanghai in 1937 Krulak recognized the value and potential of using retractable ramps on U.S. boats. When his idea was not considered he built a model and discussed it with builder Andrew Higgins who implemented aspects of Krulak’s design into World War II “Higgins boats.”

In 1945 Krulak a lieutenant colonel planned the April 1 attack on Okinawa Japan. He also led a battalion in a separate battle that served as a diversion for the invasion of Bougainville. He refused to be evacuated despite being wounded earning him a Navy Cross. After World War II Krulak co-authored the first textbook for helicopter pilots and war planners for the Marine Corps.

In Korea Krulak advised Gen. Douglas MacArthur on the amphibious landing at Inchon that reclaimed Seoul from North Korea. In 1955 Krulak became a general at age 42. He was named President Kennedy’s special assistant for counterinsurgency and special activities in Vietnam and by 1963 was a three-star general. Overall he made 54 trips to Vietnam utilizing what he called the “inkblot strategy” of winning the hearts of the locals to spread counterinsurgency.

Krulak earned numerous decorations in addition to a Navy Cross including a Distinguished Service Medal a Legion of Merit a Bronze Star a Purple Heart an Air Medal and a Presidential Unit Citation.

Krulak retired from military service in 1968 and worked as a columnist and executive for Copley newspapers retiring in 1977. He published his book “First to Fight: An Inside View of the U.S. Marine Corps” in 1984. It remains on the official reading list for Marines. Krulak was named “Citizen of the Year” by San Diego Uplifters a group of professional and business leaders and he served as president and trustee of the Zoological Society of San Diego.

He died on Dec. 29 2008. He is buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego.

We honor his service.

The tech giant said it observed the FakeUpdates (aka SocGholish) malware being delivered via existing Raspberry Robin infections on July 26 2022.

Raspberry Robin also called QNAP Worm is known to spread from a compromised system via infected USB devices containing a malicious .LNK file to other devices in the target network.

The campaign which was first spotted by Red Canary in September 2021 has been elusive in that no later-stage activity has been documented nor has there been any concrete link tying it to a known threat actor or group.

The disclosure therefore marks the first evidence of post-exploitation actions carried out by the threat actor upon leveraging the malware to gain initial access to a Windows machine.

""The DEV-0206-associated FakeUpdates activity on affected systems has since led to follow-on actions resembling DEV-0243 pre-ransomware behavior"" Microsoft noted.

DEV-0206 is Redmond's moniker for an initial access broker that deploys a malicious JavaScript framework called FakeUpdates by enticing targets into downloading fake browser updates in the form of ZIP archives.

The malware at its core acts as a conduit for other campaigns that make use of this access purchased from DEV-0206 to distribute other payloads primarily Cobalt Strike loaders attributed to DEV-0243 which is also known as Evil Corp.

Referred to as Gold Drake and Indrik Spider the financially motivated hacking group has historically operated the Dridex malware and has since switched to deploying a string of ransomware families over the years including most recently LockBit.

""The use of a RaaS payload by the 'Evil Corp' activity group is likely an attempt by DEV-0243 to avoid attribution to their group which could discourage payment due to their sanctioned status"" Microsoft said.

It's not immediately clear what exact connections Evil Corp DEV-0206 and DEV-0243 may have with one another.

Katie Nickels director of intelligence at Red Canary said in a statement shared with The Hacker News that the findings if proven to be correct fill a ""major gap"" with Raspberry Robin's modus operandi.

""We continue to see Raspberry Robin activity but we have not been able to associate it with any specific person company entity or country"" Nickels said.

""Ultimately it's too early to say if Evil Corp is responsible for or associated with Raspberry Robin. The Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) ecosystem is a complex one where different criminal groups partner with one another to achieve a variety of objectives. As a result it can be difficult to untangle the relationships between malware families and observed activity.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hdWluZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMi8wNy9jb21wYW55LWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQtb24tbGFyZ2VzdC1zb2xhci1wcm9qZWN0LWluLXN0YXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Company breaks ground on largest solar project in state,"Developers broke ground in Central Maui on Friday for the largest solar project planned in the state a 60-megawatt solar 240-megawatt-hour battery storage system that will have the capacity to power 27000 homes on Maui.

Kuihelani Solar will be built on 450 acres of old sugar cane lands leased from Mahi Pono between Kuihelani and Maui Veterans highways. It’s expected to come online by October 2023.

“We’re just really excited. It’s taken a tremendous amount of collaboration with our partners and our team has worked really hard to get all the approvals in place really to get us to where we are today” Sandra Larsen Hawaii market business leader for project developer AES said ahead of the groundbreaking Friday.

Bernerd Da Santos executive vice president and chief operating officer for AES Corporation said that as Hawaii transitions to 100 percent renewable sources it needs to keep up a reliable system of supplying energy.

“You achieve that by having projects lined up like this in order to establish the reliability through solar plus in this case battery. Energy storage solutions that actually give you the opportunity to cover not only the day hours that is when the solar is present but also the shoulders” Da Santos said referring to the sunrise and sunset hours when people are home and demand is high.

Kuihelani Solar was one of two Maui projects chosen after Hawaiian Electric Cos. put out a request for proposals in 2018 seeking renewable energy projects.

The state Public Utilities Commission approved Kuihelani Solar in 2019 and the Maui Planning Commission unanimously granted a special use permit for the project in November of last year.

Earlier this year however Kuihelani Solar appeared to be at risk of missing its guaranteed commercial operations date of Oct. 27 2023 according to a status report of projects across the state provided to the Public Utilities Commission. AES said it was monitoring supply chain impacts due to the pandemic and raised concerns about a U.S. Customs and Border Protection order potentially impacting the delivery of solar panels.

However Da Santos said the company was able to address supply issues by directing equipment toward projects that were set to come online in 2022 and 2023. It’s also working to close the gap for projects set to be operational in 2024.

“We have observed some delays but the delays that we have observed are not meaningful to change the strategy or to create a disruption in the delivery of our project” Da Santos said. “I’m talking worldwide but more importantly here in Hawaii.”

He said the project has all its permits and approvals and that “I don’t see any reason to not fulfill that commitment” to be operational by October 2023. From there the project has a 25-year power purchase agreement to feed into the Hawaiian Electric grid on Maui at a cost of 8 cents per kilowatt-hour one of the lowest rates in the state for renewable energy according to project documents.

It will have the capacity to power about 15 percent of the island’s energy needs. While early solar projects on Maui focused primarily on supplying solar more recent projects have also included battery storage as Hawaiian Electric and solar developers look to make the energy supply more reliable when the sun’s not out.

“This project is intended to dispatch every day with emergency or without it” Da Santos said. “It’s designed to have that resiliency.”

The project will also allow for agricultural uses as well. Larsen said they’re looking into having herds of sheep that can graze under the panels as well as maybe beekeeping operations.

As Maui sees more renewable energy developments and solar projects continue to expand some residents have raised concerns about their size and impacts to nearby communities. Kuihelani Solar hasn’t run into the same legal challenges as Paeahu Solar a 15-megawatt solar 60-megawatt-hour battery storage project in South Maui that was chosen around the same time as Kuihelani and has drawn complaints by neighbors. However Larsen said that after AES received community feedback raising concerns over Kuihelani Solar’s footprint the developer redesigned the project to keep the energy capacity but reduce the amount of land by 35 percent.

The print edition of Sing Tao Daily which publishes in Toronto Vancouver and Calgary will end on Aug. 28 putting 83 people out of work.

In a statement Sing Tao Media Group which is jointly owned by Hong Kong-based Sing Tao News Corp. and Torstar Corp. said it will focus on being ""Canada's leading Chinese news information and entertainment digital media platform.""

CEO Calvin Wong says readers including seniors are increasingly comfortable getting their news digitally a trend that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic which saw people spend more time at home.

""We found actually that from the senior group of people that about half of them are already very fluent in using a smartphone and tablet"" he said. ""So in that sense I don't think we will lose that kind of audience.""

The company will continue to publish its magazines eliteGen and Canadian City Post with a weekly traditional Chinese lifestyle publication added to the mix.

Sing Tao will be pivoting to a digital model resulting in 83 job losses. (Sing Tao Media Group)

Carleen Finch president of Unifor Local 87-M the union representing 43 of the 83 laid-off Sing Tao workers says staffers were ""completely blindsided"" by the move.

""I think to them it was a huge culture shock"" she said. ""I think that many of them believed that it would eventually happen but they never thought it happen this early.""

Finch is concerned the end of the print edition will leave some readers behind.

""I realize the company seems to think that the younger generation are using their phones but I think there's still a very large generation out there that like to have that tactile feel of a newspaper and want to find out what's going on in their local communities"" she said.

Finch says the shuttering of the print edition comes during a challenging time for media.

Bill C-18 which would make tech giants such as Facebook and Google pay for reusing news produced by professional Canadian news organizations has stalled.

When it announced Bill C-18 the federal government said the legislation would ensure Canadians have access to quality fact-based news at a time of rising disinformation and public mistrust.

""We have to as Canadians start to support journalism and local media and make sure that we are following through on making our voices heard"" Finch said."

Oh and there’s one other even bigger problem: Meloni doesn’t want to join that hypothetical coalition. “[Her] decision … led to a jump in support for her party” said the newspaper. “Since the beginning of the campaign she has been at pains to reassure voters and international observers that while Brothers of Italy is rooted in Benito Mussolini’s fascist movement it is nothing to be feared today.” Snap elections are in September.

In Paris … Kind of like Ratatouille. But not

One of the “helpers in the mastery of waste”?

A member of Mayor Anne Hidalgo’s Socialist-Green coalition has asked citizens to be more understanding of Parisian rats casting them as unfairly stigmatized victims of prejudice. “I prefer to call them surmulots which has a less negative sound” said council member Douchka Markovic according to The Times of London. That word continued the newspaper means “oversized field mice … a more cuddly term for the brown Norway common rat. The rodents ‘play an important role in the sewers by evacuating hundreds of tonnes of waste and unblocking the pipes’ Markovic said. ‘They are our helpers in the mastery of waste.’ The city must learn more about their way of life and switch to ‘ethical non-lethal’ ways of controlling them.”

Many residents of the rat-plagued city were not receptive to the notion. “The National Academy of Medicine based in rat-friendly Saint-Germain-des-Prés stepped in with an attack on the councillor” according to the newspaper and reminded people that “the rat remains a threat to human health because of the numerous diseases it spreads through its parasites excrement bites and scratches. You can die from them.”

In al-Hajar al-Aswad … Maybe C.G.I. next time?

Home Operation a Chinese action film from Jackie Chan and “inspired by China’s evacuation of hundreds of its nationals from Yemen in 2015 during the civil conflict there” has according to The Guardian drawn outrage for shooting scenes in this devastated Syrian town. “The New Arab quoted Syrian journalist Fared al-Mahlool saying: ‘It is shameful to film such films on the ruins of Syrian homes that were destroyed by the Assad regime Russia and Iran … the Chinese fascist regime is an ally of Syria and they are trying to whitewash their crimes in actions like this’” said the newspaper.

In Venice … Water water everywhere …

Fountains of Venice? Handling tourism or attempting to seems to take up much of this city’s energy and now a new front has opened up. “Tourism is responsible for between 28 and 40 per cent of the city’s rubbish including piles of dumped plastic water bottles according to local government data” reported The Times of London. So officials are urging visitors to avoid plastic bottles and instead avail themselves of Venice’s 126 fountains. To that end “Veritas a water distribution company has developed the phone app that allows visitors to access a map of all the fountains in Venice.” B.Y.O.B. then and … just fill it up. —George Kalogerakis

He was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis but fearing a negative impact from his Jewish birthright he became Episcopalian.

Krulak graduated in 1934 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps but required an exemption due to his 5’ 4” stature. He wrestled in the academy and earned the nickname “Brute” in jest because of his size but he ultimately embodied the name as a preeminent strategist for the Marine Corps.

While stationed in Shanghai in 1937 Krulak recognized the value and potential of using retractable ramps on U.S. boats. When his idea was not considered he built a model and discussed it with builder Andrew Higgins who implemented aspects of Krulak’s design into World War II “Higgins boats.”

In 1945 Krulak a lieutenant colonel planned the April 1 attack on Okinawa Japan. He also led a battalion in a separate battle that served as a diversion for the invasion of Bougainville. He refused to be evacuated despite being wounded earning him a Navy Cross. After World War II Krulak co-authored the first textbook for helicopter pilots and war planners for the Marine Corps.

In Korea Krulak advised Gen. Douglas MacArthur on the amphibious landing at Inchon that reclaimed Seoul from North Korea. In 1955 Krulak became a general at age 42. He was named President Kennedy’s special assistant for counterinsurgency and special activities in Vietnam and by 1963 was a three-star general. Overall he made 54 trips to Vietnam utilizing what he called the “inkblot strategy” of winning the hearts of the locals to spread counterinsurgency.

Krulak earned numerous decorations in addition to a Navy Cross including a Distinguished Service Medal a Legion of Merit a Bronze Star a Purple Heart an Air Medal and a Presidential Unit Citation.

Krulak retired from military service in 1968 and worked as a columnist and executive for Copley newspapers retiring in 1977. He published his book “First to Fight: An Inside View of the U.S. Marine Corps” in 1984. It remains on the official reading list for Marines. Krulak was named “Citizen of the Year” by San Diego Uplifters a group of professional and business leaders and he served as president and trustee of the Zoological Society of San Diego.

He died on Dec. 29 2008. He is buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego.

We honor his service.

The tech giant said it observed the FakeUpdates (aka SocGholish) malware being delivered via existing Raspberry Robin infections on July 26 2022.

Raspberry Robin also called QNAP Worm is known to spread from a compromised system via infected USB devices containing a malicious .LNK file to other devices in the target network.

The campaign which was first spotted by Red Canary in September 2021 has been elusive in that no later-stage activity has been documented nor has there been any concrete link tying it to a known threat actor or group.

The disclosure therefore marks the first evidence of post-exploitation actions carried out by the threat actor upon leveraging the malware to gain initial access to a Windows machine.

""The DEV-0206-associated FakeUpdates activity on affected systems has since led to follow-on actions resembling DEV-0243 pre-ransomware behavior"" Microsoft noted.

DEV-0206 is Redmond's moniker for an initial access broker that deploys a malicious JavaScript framework called FakeUpdates by enticing targets into downloading fake browser updates in the form of ZIP archives.

The malware at its core acts as a conduit for other campaigns that make use of this access purchased from DEV-0206 to distribute other payloads primarily Cobalt Strike loaders attributed to DEV-0243 which is also known as Evil Corp.

Referred to as Gold Drake and Indrik Spider the financially motivated hacking group has historically operated the Dridex malware and has since switched to deploying a string of ransomware families over the years including most recently LockBit.

""The use of a RaaS payload by the 'Evil Corp' activity group is likely an attempt by DEV-0243 to avoid attribution to their group which could discourage payment due to their sanctioned status"" Microsoft said.

It's not immediately clear what exact connections Evil Corp DEV-0206 and DEV-0243 may have with one another.

Katie Nickels director of intelligence at Red Canary said in a statement shared with The Hacker News that the findings if proven to be correct fill a ""major gap"" with Raspberry Robin's modus operandi.

""We continue to see Raspberry Robin activity but we have not been able to associate it with any specific person company entity or country"" Nickels said.

""Ultimately it's too early to say if Evil Corp is responsible for or associated with Raspberry Robin. The Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) ecosystem is a complex one where different criminal groups partner with one another to achieve a variety of objectives. As a result it can be difficult to untangle the relationships between malware families and observed activity.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hdWluZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMi8wNy9jb21wYW55LWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQtb24tbGFyZ2VzdC1zb2xhci1wcm9qZWN0LWluLXN0YXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Company breaks ground on largest solar project in state,"Developers broke ground in Central Maui on Friday for the largest solar project planned in the state a 60-megawatt solar 240-megawatt-hour battery storage system that will have the capacity to power 27000 homes on Maui.

Kuihelani Solar will be built on 450 acres of old sugar cane lands leased from Mahi Pono between Kuihelani and Maui Veterans highways. It’s expected to come online by October 2023.

“We’re just really excited. It’s taken a tremendous amount of collaboration with our partners and our team has worked really hard to get all the approvals in place really to get us to where we are today” Sandra Larsen Hawaii market business leader for project developer AES said ahead of the groundbreaking Friday.

Bernerd Da Santos executive vice president and chief operating officer for AES Corporation said that as Hawaii transitions to 100 percent renewable sources it needs to keep up a reliable system of supplying energy.

“You achieve that by having projects lined up like this in order to establish the reliability through solar plus in this case battery. Energy storage solutions that actually give you the opportunity to cover not only the day hours that is when the solar is present but also the shoulders” Da Santos said referring to the sunrise and sunset hours when people are home and demand is high.

Kuihelani Solar was one of two Maui projects chosen after Hawaiian Electric Cos. put out a request for proposals in 2018 seeking renewable energy projects.

The state Public Utilities Commission approved Kuihelani Solar in 2019 and the Maui Planning Commission unanimously granted a special use permit for the project in November of last year.

Earlier this year however Kuihelani Solar appeared to be at risk of missing its guaranteed commercial operations date of Oct. 27 2023 according to a status report of projects across the state provided to the Public Utilities Commission. AES said it was monitoring supply chain impacts due to the pandemic and raised concerns about a U.S. Customs and Border Protection order potentially impacting the delivery of solar panels.

However Da Santos said the company was able to address supply issues by directing equipment toward projects that were set to come online in 2022 and 2023. It’s also working to close the gap for projects set to be operational in 2024.

“We have observed some delays but the delays that we have observed are not meaningful to change the strategy or to create a disruption in the delivery of our project” Da Santos said. “I’m talking worldwide but more importantly here in Hawaii.”

He said the project has all its permits and approvals and that “I don’t see any reason to not fulfill that commitment” to be operational by October 2023. From there the project has a 25-year power purchase agreement to feed into the Hawaiian Electric grid on Maui at a cost of 8 cents per kilowatt-hour one of the lowest rates in the state for renewable energy according to project documents.

It will have the capacity to power about 15 percent of the island’s energy needs. While early solar projects on Maui focused primarily on supplying solar more recent projects have also included battery storage as Hawaiian Electric and solar developers look to make the energy supply more reliable when the sun’s not out.

“This project is intended to dispatch every day with emergency or without it” Da Santos said. “It’s designed to have that resiliency.”

The project will also allow for agricultural uses as well. Larsen said they’re looking into having herds of sheep that can graze under the panels as well as maybe beekeeping operations.

As Maui sees more renewable energy developments and solar projects continue to expand some residents have raised concerns about their size and impacts to nearby communities. Kuihelani Solar hasn’t run into the same legal challenges as Paeahu Solar a 15-megawatt solar 60-megawatt-hour battery storage project in South Maui that was chosen around the same time as Kuihelani and has drawn complaints by neighbors. However Larsen said that after AES received community feedback raising concerns over Kuihelani Solar’s footprint the developer redesigned the project to keep the energy capacity but reduce the amount of land by 35 percent.

The print edition of Sing Tao Daily which publishes in Toronto Vancouver and Calgary will end on Aug. 28 putting 83 people out of work.

In a statement Sing Tao Media Group which is jointly owned by Hong Kong-based Sing Tao News Corp. and Torstar Corp. said it will focus on being ""Canada's leading Chinese news information and entertainment digital media platform.""

CEO Calvin Wong says readers including seniors are increasingly comfortable getting their news digitally a trend that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic which saw people spend more time at home.

""We found actually that from the senior group of people that about half of them are already very fluent in using a smartphone and tablet"" he said. ""So in that sense I don't think we will lose that kind of audience.""

The company will continue to publish its magazines eliteGen and Canadian City Post with a weekly traditional Chinese lifestyle publication added to the mix.

Sing Tao will be pivoting to a digital model resulting in 83 job losses. (Sing Tao Media Group)

Carleen Finch president of Unifor Local 87-M the union representing 43 of the 83 laid-off Sing Tao workers says staffers were ""completely blindsided"" by the move.

""I think to them it was a huge culture shock"" she said. ""I think that many of them believed that it would eventually happen but they never thought it happen this early.""

Finch is concerned the end of the print edition will leave some readers behind.

""I realize the company seems to think that the younger generation are using their phones but I think there's still a very large generation out there that like to have that tactile feel of a newspaper and want to find out what's going on in their local communities"" she said.

Finch says the shuttering of the print edition comes during a challenging time for media.

Bill C-18 which would make tech giants such as Facebook and Google pay for reusing news produced by professional Canadian news organizations has stalled.

When it announced Bill C-18 the federal government said the legislation would ensure Canadians have access to quality fact-based news at a time of rising disinformation and public mistrust.

""We have to as Canadians start to support journalism and local media and make sure that we are following through on making our voices heard"" Finch said."

Whether aiming to beat a training partner’s time or best your latest P.R. a little bit of gamesmanship is always a nice touch for your fitness journey.

The same can be said when it comes to workout gear — and over the past few years no two brands have gone head-to-head quite like Nike and Reebok. With each iteration of their Nano and Metcon lineups the two athletic brands are constantly compared to one another especially in the eyes of CrossFit enthusiasts.

I’ve been a big fan of both stables since their inceptions with the latest iterations — Reebok’s Nano X2 and Nike’s Metcon 7 — ranking highly in Gear Patrol’s best gym shoe and best CrossFit shoe roundups. But in the spirit of competition as well as the upcoming 2022 CrossFit Games I decided to pit these two gym kicks against one another to finally determine which sneaker stacks up the best.

Per @bubblekoppe a trusted source of early information when it comes to Nike releases the Air Max Penny 1 is set to be retroed in its original “Orlando” colorway in 2022. Although there’s been an abundance of new colorways that dropped in the last few years the “Orlando” makeup has not been released since 2011. As the name suggests the Orlando Magics’ team hues of black white and royal blue inspire the color scheme. The sneaker first launched in 1995.

Due to its far-off launch date no images have yet leaked of the forthcoming reissue but the shoe is expected to be an exact reproduction of the original release.

There’s currently no release date available for the “Orlando” Nike Air Max Penny 1 retro but the shoe is reportedly returning sometime next year but a launch date has not been confirmed by the Swoosh. Keep it locked to Sole Collector for updates in the months ahead.

UPDATE (12/23): Official Nike product images of the “Orlando” Air Max Penny 1 retro have surfaced but so far just in grade school sizing. Grab a closer look below ahead of the shoe’s release.

UPDATE (07/31): Nike’s SNKRS app has confirmed that the “Orlando” Air Max Penny 1 will release on August 11 for $170.

Plenty of them. The collaborations speak for themselves but I'm talking about flying the flag for the Air Max Plus (also known as TNs) like the Aussies and repping Jordans in the States.

Every person every nation has a Swoosh icon that it places on a pedestal above all others.

Tracking the rise of a particular Nike silhouette across nations often lies in subculture; in the bubbling communities that take a sneaker as their uniform or a status symbol that unites them. When it comes to Swoosh icons these movements are often nestled in the '90s treated with rose-tinted nostalgia and lamented as a new generation clamors to take them as their own.

As this game of stylistic cat and mouse unfolds the ebb and flow of trends come to life seeing to it that certain silhouettes don't only maintain their legacy but become cultural touchstones living on forever in notoriety.

If you're from the UK I have no doubts that you've seen a fair few pairs of Air Max 95s in your time.

Whether that's around your small suburban hometown streets across London's boroughs up in Manchester and Liverpool or filling the fields of festivals throughout the summer. More so than any other in the Air Max family the 95 is active loved and adored by a nation whether we'd all like to admit it or not.

Conceived by Sergio Lozano and the AM95 is instantly recognizable from its revolutionary human anatomy-inspired design details: an outsole influenced by the shape of the spine mesh and suede sidewalls representative of muscle fibers a lacing system that owes its curves to the rib cage.

I'd argue that the loudest and proudest supporters of the AM95 in the UK the ones responsible for redubbing them ""110s"" are those enriched in Grime culture.

For those that don't know 95s used to cost £110 in the UK hence the nickname. Despite inflation the price remains the same.

Throughout the last two decades 110 and 95 references have been littered throughout Grime Drill and UK Rap tracks immortalizing the sneaker as a part of our culture.

Like Footsie said ""if you're talking a Air Max trust me it's gotta be a 95.""

But over the years it felt like the AM95's infamy had slowly evaporated. You'd absolutely still see pairs all over the gaff don't get me wrong but excitement surrounding the silhouette had faltered due to among other things a lack of fresh colorways.

For a while it's felt like the 95 has been reserved for the shelves of JD Sports and Footasylum with basic ""Triple Black"" pairs (which in fairness you can never go wrong with) re-seasonal neutral colorways and other lackluster iterations taking prominence.

These aren't the looks that made us fall in love with the silhouette.

While I've got mad love for the above anyone that loves a 95 knows its peak is white mesh bordered by a grey gradient.

The OG ""Neon"" ""Greedy 3.0"" ""Crystal Blue"" ""Solar Red"" ""Tour Yellow"" are admittedly pretty basic all things considered but that's what makes them so perfect.

Those core colorways work so well because they highlight the subtle intricacies of the Air Max 95's design. And make-up that does the same sells just as quickly as the colorways issued during the AM95's heyday.

If you needed proof that these are the type of palettes that fans of the silhouette adore all it takes is one look at StockX or KLEKT to see just how well the recent ""Dark Beetroot"" colorway is doing.

It came it went it resold hard.

Don't call it a comeback though: the Air Max 95 never left.

Earlier this year the transportation company announced that new conductor trainees in priority locations would have the opportunity to earn up to $5000 in starting bonuses. And one of those priority locations happens to be Harrisburg.

And recently it added some more incentives. The company announced that it has increased conductor trainee pay to $25 per hour with a minimum of $200 in earnings per shift. Additionally conductor trainees are eligible for an on-the-job training incentive of $300 per bi-weekly pay period provided they make themselves available to work.

“We are committed to ensuring our newest team members are well-compensated while they work toward qualifying as conductors” Brad Dodd director of talent acquisition at Norfolk Southern said in a news release. “Norfolk Southern is a great fit for those who want responsibility autonomy and take pride in the work they do.

Norfolk Southern conductors are guaranteed minimum annual pay of $52000 which increases over the first four years of service to a minimum of approximately $63500.

However Norfolk Southern says that conductors earn an average of $67000 in their first year and have the potential to earn more each year as they increase in levels of seniority. Conductors also participate in the Railroad Retirement System and have a 401(k) savings option and healthcare coverage.

“One of the clear benefits of our industry is the opportunity for future advancement and the potential for increased earnings” Dodd said. “Through their seniority conductors will be promoted to a locomotive engineer position that has guaranteed minimum annual pay of approximately $94000 along with benefits. Many of our engineers earn more than $100000 with the work opportunities at their locations.”

Potential applicants must be at least 18 years old and successfully complete a standard background check and meet physical requirements. No prior railroad experience is required.

Norfolk Southern conductors are responsible for the safe and efficient movement of freight trains. A conductor’s job can include coupling railcars to build trains delivering railcars to local customers and transporting trains hundreds of miles.

Conductor trainees should expect to complete a training program of approximately 16 weeks before promoting to a conductor position. The first three weeks of training occur at the Norfolk Southern Training Center in McDonough Georgia. The remaining weeks of training take place at or near their hiring location.

U.S. Department of Transportation Deputy Secretary Polly Trottenberg will be on hand for a 2 p.m. event that includes a groundbreaking for the construction activity that will take place to get the station prepared for Amtrak’s return.

The only problem: Amtrak’s return remains uncertain.

The nation’s passenger rail operator is currently in mediation with two freight companies – CSX and Norfolk Southern – over the fate of a twice-daily service connecting Mobile to New Orleans. Bay St. Louis is one of four coastal Mississippi stops along the route.

The mediation was ordered in May by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. The board for the first time in its 26-year history is involved in determining the control of a U.S. rail line pitting Amtrak against freight operators.

The battle is high stakes at a time when Amtrak is angling to make substantial investments to its national network after receiving $66 billion from the federal bipartisan infrastructure law last year.

“Amtrak expects to be able to run the train” said Knox Ross a Mississippi-based member on the Southern Rail Commission who will be at the groundbreaking. “That’s the message being sent.”

Ross said Amtrak’s expectations are for a favorable STB ruling to operate the Gulf Coast service despite intense opposition from CSX and NS and a host of Alabama-based officials headed up by the Alabama State Port Authority.

The STB in June ordered mediation in a case that began in March 2021 when Amtrak sought an order from the governmental agency to allow inter-city passenger trains to operate on the freight lines between Mobile and New Orleans.

Marc Magliari spokesman with Amtrak said the event in Bay St. Louis represents the beginning of a multi-phase project to make the stops along the Gulf Coast route handicap accessible or ADA compliant.

“We’ll do this to all of the stations across Bay St. Louis to Mobile” said Magliari. He estimates the projects costing Amtrak around $2 million. The work in Mobile will take place sometime in August.

“We are doing what we need to do and that is taking every reasonable step to prepare for service whether that is hiring crews or making these stations ADA compliant” he said. “In some ways this is the first step toward reactivating these station locations and beginning service.”

Magliari said that Amtrak is receiving cooperation from CSX who will supply a flagger to ensure construction crews are alerted whenever a freight train passes by “to make sure they do so safely.”

NS and CSX both declined comment about the groundbreaking event in Bay St. Louis.

“CSX is focused on the active litigation before the Surface Transportation Board where the impact of our customers of Amtrak’s proposed new passenger service is under evaluation” said Cindy Schild spokeswoman with CSX.

Also declining comment was the Alabama State Port Authority which is the only non-railroad entity involved in the active mediation.

Ross said Amtrak’s belief is that they will “have a good outcome from the STB.”

But he also admitted there was some risk to sinking money into a project before receiving the authority to go ahead with restarting the passenger rail line.

“They are willing to take that risk because they believe in the service and believe they will run it” he said.

Amtrak in recent days submitted to the STB additional analysis showing the Gulf Coast service will cause “no unreasonable impairment” for the freight operators and that no new infrastructure is needed to accommodate the service.

The STB in May requested additional evidence from Amtrak CSX and NS on whether additional passenger trains will disrupt freight service.

Freight operators along the Alabama Port argued in April that introducing a twice-daily Amtrak route between Mobile and New Orleans – without any improvements to the 120-mile rail line – will create “staggering” delays in Alabama.

Amtrak believes the freight operators are making unreasonable capital improvement demands totaling more than $400 million. A CSX attorney in April argued that that infrastructure demands are hefty near the Port of Mobile and that delays would be likely.

The Alabama port along with most Alabama state officials have long been opposed to Amtrak returning to the Gulf Coast if a rail-traffic control analysis – conducted in collaboration with CSX NS and Amtrak – is not completed and its recommendations followed. A prior study completed by CSX and NS but disputed by Amtrak estimated $405 million to $440 million in capital upgrades were needed before the twice-daily service could be restored without major impacts to the freight trains.

Amtrak in early 2021 pulled out of negotiations with CSX and NS for the completion of a rail-traffic control study out of frustration about the study being stalled during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amtrak officials also noted that previous studies into the rail line had been conducted and that enough analysis was prepared to get the service restarted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvZnVsbC1ob3VzZS1zdGFyLWpvZGllLXN3ZWV0aW4tbWFycmllcy1sb25ndGltZS1ib3lmcmllbmQtbWVzY2FsLXdhc2lsZXdza2kvYXJ0aWNsZV82ZmI0YjJkNC1hNTA5LTVhNGUtYjM2OS1iY2RhMjgzOWRkM2QuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Full House' star Jodie Sweetin marries longtime boyfriend Mescal Wasilewski,"Memphis TN (38111)

A winning feeling so nice he had to do it twice (in two weeks!)

On Sunday in Detroit Tony Finau shot a final-round 67 to clinch victory the Rocket Mortgage Classic his second PGA Tour win in the last seven days. Finau who finished 26-under became the first winner in back-to-back weeks on the PGA Tour since Brendon Todd in 2019.

It was perhaps fitting for Finau whose prolific career has been stunted by his struggles getting over the hump to see his career victory total double in the span of just one week. Those around the sport have long predicted that the victories would come in bunches for the Ryder Cupper once he broke through. Prior to last week’s win at the 3M Open Finau had recorded 50 career top-10 finishes — a gargantuan sum — to only two wins.

Tony Finau: ""It means everything to me that my kids can watch me not only fail but they watch me win as well. That's what it takes to be a champion."" pic.twitter.com/zWN9BkBhgz — Sean Zak (@Sean_Zak) July 31 2022

“It means everything to me that my kids can watch me not only fail but they watch me win as well” Finau told CBS in an emotional interview after the win. “That’s what it takes to be a champion.”

Finau toppled the field on Sunday with his ninth consecutive round in the 60s nabbing six birdies to only a single bogey. Including Sunday’s final round he has now played his last 9 rounds at 49-under with 55 birdies to only six bogeys. Despite entering the day tied with his final-round playing partner Taylor Pendrith atop the leaderboard the Utah native hardly looked bothered. After four pars to start the day a birdie on the par-5 4th hole vaulted him into a two-stroke lead he never looked back from.

After playoff wins in the 2018 Puerto Rico Open and 2021 Northern Trust Finau has won his last two starts by a combined eight strokes finally tapping into the preternatural ballstriking abilities that have made him a fixture atop the Official World Golf Ranking since he turned pro in 2015.

For Finau though how he won is ostensibly less important than the fact he won. After waking up on the morning of July 24 with only two professional wins Finau has doubled that number to four … before August 1.

The contract will see the company design develop test and field the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) for the agency.

As the ground-based midcourse missile defense system NGI is an advanced interceptor designed to protect the nation against intercontinental ballistic missile attack. NGI’s mission will be to protect the homeland against missile threats from rogue nations with a modern weapon system as an evolution of the currently deployed Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system.

The contract that was awarded to Northrop on July 29 comes after MDA chose teams led by Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin for the program in March 2021. The contracts had an estimated maximum value of $1.6 billion through fiscal year 2022 and were structured to carry two designs into the technology development and risk reduction phase.

Boeing who teamed up with General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems and Aerojet Rocketdyne for the program was not selected to proceed to the next phase of the program.

“As the GWS prime contractor we will continue to work closely with MDA to optimize and develop modern missile defense systems to defend against evolving threats and provide advanced capabilities for the warfighter” said Scott Lehr vice president and general manager launch and missile defense systems Northrop Grumman.

“GWS is part of Northrop Grumman’s land and sea-based missile defense systems that are enabled by our advanced missile warning and tracking space satellites. Together we are delivering end-to-end capabilities that will protect the United States and its allies.”

In December Northrop Grumman said it had completed the System Requirements Review (SRR) for the US homeland intercontinental ballistic missile defense system ahead of schedule.

According to the July 29 contract announcement Northrop will be responsible for “the systems engineering design development integration testing and fielding of GWS software and hardware meeting warfighter needs new requirements (e.g. Next Generation Interceptor (NGI)) and evolving threats with greater reliability availability maintainability and testability than the current system.

Work under the contract is expected to be completed by July 2027.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjE5Zm9ydHlmaXZlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3L3JxLTE4MC1pcy10aGUtdS1zLWFpci1mb3JjZS1nb2luZy1hbGwtaW4tb24tc3RlYWx0aC1kcm9uZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RQ-180: Is the U.S. Air Force Going All in on Stealth Drones?,"The RQ-4 Global Hawk strategic reconnaissance drone has been a valuable workhorse since 9/11 while conducting the war on terror. But now the U.S. military has doubts about the survivability of the intercontinental unmanned vehicle if a war with Russia China Iran or North Korea were to take place. The high-altitude and long-range drone is becoming expendable and the Air Force aims to retire the Global Hawks by 2027. But what will take its place? The Air Force is keeping mum about new strategic recon drones but some observers have been examining the planned stealth RQ-180 and whether that unmanned craft could enter the picture and provide even better near real-time intelligence data than the Global Hawk.

More on the Global Hawk

The Global Hawk has been a stalwart and long-serving unmanned aircraft with the modern Block 40 variants having entered service in 2013. It can fly to an altitude of 60000 feet with a 34-hour mission time. The long-endurance Global Hawk has flown over 320000 hours since 2001. The drone has conducted recon missions over Iraq Afghanistan Africa and East Asia. The aircraft gathers imagery and signals intelligence along with moving target indicators. It can conduct search and rescue missions too.

Super-Secret Program

The Air Force has always ensured the Global Hawk remains in a low profile status. I can attest to that from when I worked for the RAND Corporation. I was conducting a manpower and worker efficiency study on the Global Hawk for the Office of the Secretary for the Department of Defence. I was allowed to attend a site visit for the program at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base but the brass would not let me see the aircraft and even parts of the office cubicle sections were no-go areas. I was only allowed to work in a conference room. The Air Force is expected to keep a tight lid on the new RQ-180 stealth drone program too if it is to be the Global Hawk’s replacement.

White Bat Features Stealth Capabilities

The Northrop Grumman RQ-180 “White Bat” is thought to be able to penetrate contested air space with its radar-evading stealth capability. Its “cranked kite” flying wing design and coating create more stealth attributes. Dario Leone writing for Aviation Geek Club had this to say: “It is optimized to provide protection from low- and high-frequency threat emitters from all directions. The design also merges stealth with superior aerodynamic efficiency for increased altitude range and time on station. The clandestine UAS is also able to refuel mid-air.”

Large High-Altitude Recon Bird

The White Bat is more of a technology demonstrator at this time rather than an unmanned system that is fully in service. It has reportedly flown three test flights as of 2021. This is a large twin-engine aircraft with an empty weight of 14000 pounds. It is 131 feet long with a wingspan of 164 feet and a height of 34 feet. Its ceiling is expected to be 70000 feet and its range is over 2400 miles.

Fly Ahead and Offer Intelligence to Modern Aircraft

The RQ-180 is expected to relay communications and intelligence data to other platforms which is a valuable feature for modern warfare. Sending real time imagery to airplanes such as F-35s B-21s and airborne command and control aircraft would make it a force multiplier. The RQ-180 may also be able to jam enemy radar systems with advanced electronic warfare capability.

Waiting to Hear More on the RQ-180

The RQ-180 is an exciting system. Its integration into other aircraft that supplies recon and intel data is probably its most valuable feature aside from radar evasion. It will be an important replacement (if that is what the Air Force intends) for the “steady as she goes” Global Hawk which has been a beneficial asset over the years. We’ll keep an eye on the White Bat to see if it is indeed the unmanned system that will replace the Global Hawk and give the Air Force even more capabilities for stealth recon missions in the future.

Not because it was showcased to the audiences but because it has been part of several Hollywood action movies and military videos. In case you haven’t up ahead is everything you need to know about the world’s most expensive plane.

This is the world’s most expensive plane which costs more than Rs 16000 crore

Designed during the Cold War as a subsonic bomber to deploy conventional and thermonuclear weapons the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit aircraft is the world’s most expensive plane. Designed and built in 1997 its initial cost was $737 million (as per the dollar rates then) per Economic Times. However after its inclusion in the United States Air Force the costs saw a significant rise mainly thanks to all the modifications made to the aircraft. Per ET the total program cost for one unit of the B-2 is now calculated at $2.13 billion roughly aggregated to above Rs 16000 crore.

The aircraft made its combat debut in 1999 two years on from when it was built in the Kosovo War. It was also then used in Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom and then Libya during Operation Odyssey Dawn.

Even though it is the property of the US Military the aircraft is often rented out to production studios for movie shoots. Along with military videos it has been part of footage for films like Captain Marvel Rampage Iron Man 2 Captain Marvel among others. The B-2 is also known as the stealth bomber.

And while it is the world’s most expensive plane the margin is huge. The world’s most expensive jet the Air Force One is three times lesser — at $660 million per ET. The modified version of the Airbus A380 for the Saudi Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal al-Saud is reportedly priced at Rs $600million.

""They wanted to find a way to extend that feeling"" said Diaz who is also and SVP of Charters Meetings & Incentives at Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (Sixthman is a wholly owned subsidiary of NCL.)

The cruise will feature a roster of performers including Tony Award winners and nominees and a range of programming that allows passengers to go beyond the stage doors.

When is The Broadway Cruise?

The cruise will sail round-trip on the Norwegian Gem from New York City to Bermuda from March 31 through April 5 2023.

What can passengers can expect on The Broadway Cruise?

The cruise will feature performances from stars like Alan Cumming Kristin Chenoweth Laura Benanti Joshua Henry and more. Diaz said fans can expect a mix of what they might see on the performers' solo tours ""new content that maybe they can't do in a traditional theater environment"" and Q&A sessions.

He said they try to ""make it part performance part entertainment"" while also peeling back the curtain through behind-the-scenes stories. Diaz said performers will collaborate with one another as well.

There will also be meet-and-greets discussions with industry veterans like scenic designer David Korins of shows like ""Hamilton"" and ""Dear Evan Hansen"" and karaoke where passengers can have their turn in the spotlight.

You never know who might stop by to sing a show tune either.

""We try to curate an environment where the actors or the talent feel really comfortable and oftentimes it's common for that natural interaction to come about across the ship and actors will pop in the casino and sometimes they'll pop on the stage with karaoke.""

How much does The Broadway Cruise cost?

An interior room starts at $2191 for one person or $1195 per person for two guests (a small discount is added for single occupancy rates). There is an additional $395 charge per passenger for taxes and fees according to the cruise's website.

The price of the room includes all performances meals and basic beverages like drip coffee tea and nonpressed juices. Travelers can find more information and book online or by calling 877-379-9172. The ship can accommodate nearly 2400 guests at double occupancy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL25vcndlZ2lhbi1jcnVpc2UtbGluZS10YWtlcy1kZWxpdmVyeS1vZi1uZXctcHJpbWEtY2xhc3MtdmVzc2VsLzc3NTk10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norwegian Cruise Line Takes Delivery of New Prima Class Vessel,"During a ceremony at the Fincantieri shipyard in Marghera Norwegian Cruise Line took delivery of the first of six Prima-class ships Norwegian Prima today July 29.

A lot of buyers are moving to other manufacturers due to this. Half of the buyers do not want to buy the top end they want a VFM mid variant. It's clearly missing in the tiago and this has reflected in sales for a while now. The NRG and CNG being introduced and yet tiago sells only ~4500 per month.



While the height adjust driver seat is great hyper style wheels feels more like a downgrade. Has anyone seen a hyper style wheel after removing the wheel cap. It looks so weak. I wouldn't trust that wheel. A big bump and the wheel would bend.



More than the parcel tray and vanity mirror it needs the rear wiper/defogger. These can be done added to the official accessories list.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080: Thirty Second Review

When the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 was first released it had to significantly improve upon Nvidia's top-tier graphics card from the Turing era so expectations couldn't have been higher.

But just like the rest of the Nvidia Ampere the RTX 3080 hasn't just been more than up to the challenge it absolutely redefines the performance of the elite graphics cards by bringing fast 4K gaming at an accessible if not totally affordable MSRP.

In fact the improvements of the RTX 3080 over the cards it’s replaced seems to be the biggest generation leap in power we’ve seen in a long time. It performs 20-30% better than the card in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti review and more impressively 50-80% better than the one in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 review.

What makes this GPU all the more attractive is that performance bump comes with a much more reasonable retail price. It’s almost half the cost of the previous generation GPU.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 makes high-end gaming much more attainable for the average gamer running the best PC games with faster refresh rates and higher resolutions for less money.

There are cheaper cards with a better value proposition but when it comes to the elite class of graphics cards the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is simply the best value for those who have the money to spend but want the most bang for their buck and so we highly recommend it as the best graphics card to buy for those who can clear the cost of entry.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080: Price and availability

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is available now assuming you can find it. Stock shortages have been an issue. (Image credit: Future)

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is available now starting at $699 (£649 about AU$950) for the Founders Edition. However as with any major graphics card there will be dozens of aftermarket graphics cards from companies like MSI Asus Zotac and more.

Just be aware that some of these aftermarket card designs may see steep price increases over this Founders Edition based on things like exotic cooling solutions and factory-tuned overclocks. But every RTX 3080 should more or less be in the ballpark of performance as the one Nvidia itself has released.

This is cheaper than the Founders Edition card in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 review which debuted at $799 (£749 AU$1199) so that's a good thing. It's still ridiculously expensive especially when you get to aftermarket cards.

It's not as outrageous as the Founders Edition card in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 review which launched at $1499 (£1399 around AU$2030). The Founders Edition card in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review meanwhile is a much more relatively reasonable $499 (£469 AU$809). The reference card in our AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT review and the Gigabyte card in out AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT review have an MSRP of $649 (around £649 AU$960) and $1299 (about £1040 / AU$1820) so the RTX 3080 is somewhere in the middle of the mix here among this generation of cards.

It's not the cheapest graphics card around but there are marginally better cards out there for twice the price. So even though the RTX 3080 is really expensive compared to its peers and the card it is replacing the MSRP price is actually pretty good given the level of performance you get out of it compared to the rest of this generation.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080: Features and chipset

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition drops the USB-C video output which we think is a shame. (Image credit: Future)

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is based on the Ampere graphics architecture which brings huge improvements to both raw performance and power efficiency over its Turing predecessor. The fact that Nvidia has increased the power budget so much over the RTX 2080 while boosting power efficiency means that the overall performance profile is far above what any Nvidia Turing graphics card was capable of.

There have been obvious improvements to the ray tracing (RT) and Tensor cores – which are on the second and third generation respectively – but perhaps the biggest improvement has been to the rasterization engine.

Through some clever optimization Nvidia was able to double the amount of CUDA cores present on each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) by making both data paths on each SM able to handle Floating Point 32 (FP32) workloads – a vast improvement over Turing where one data path was dedicated entirely to integer workloads. This effectively doubles raw FP32 throughput core for core though this won't directly translate into double the frame-rate in your favorite PC games – at least not for many of them.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 key specs GPU: GA102

Stream multiprocessors: 68 (128 CUDA per SM)

CUDA Cores: 8704

Tensor cores: 272

Ray tracing cores: 68

Power Draw (TGP): 320W

Boost clock: 1710MHz

VRAM: 10GB GDDR6X

Memory Speed: 19Gbps

Interface: PCIe 4.0 x16

Outputs: 1 x HDMI 2.1 3 x DisplayPort 1.4

Power connector: 1 x 12-pin

What this means is that while the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 only has 46% more SMs than the RTX 2080 at 68 it nearly triples the CUDA core count from 2944 to 8704. This translates to nearly three times the theoretical FP32 throughput from around 10 TFLOPs to 29.7 TFLOPs – an absolutely massive generational leap.

When you pair the uplift in CUDA cores with massive boosts to cache texture units and memory bandwidth – thanks to the move to faster GDDR6X memory on a 320-bit bus – gaming performance gets one of the biggest generational jumps in years even if it does fall a bit short of that '2x performance' target that we're sure some folks were hoping for. But more on that later.

Nvidia RT cores are also back – that's why Nvidia has the RTX name after all – and they also see massive improvements. Nvidia Ampere graphics cards including the RTX 3080 include second-generation RT cores which will function similarly to the first generation RT cores but will be twice as efficient.

If you've ever asked ""what is ray tracing?"" it is a new way to realistically render a scene by having an SM cast a light ray into a scene that's being rendered and the RT core will take over from there. The RT core will do all the calculations necessary to calculate where that light ray bounces and will report that information back to the SM. This means that the SM is left alone to render the rest of the scene but it can now incorporate that ray tracing data to more realistically light the scene.

Unfortunately we're still not at a point where turning on ray tracing doesn't have an absolutely brutal impact on performance. Maybe some day and the Nvidia RTX 3080 does an admirable job especially with DLSS turned on (more on that later).

Tensor cores are also twice as powerful this time around which has led Nvidia to only include 4 in each SM rather than the 8 you would find in a Turing SM. Coupled with the fact that there are now more SMs in general DLSS performance also gets a massive boost.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 features a 12-pin power connector instead of the normal 8-pin connector so you'll need to use the included adapter. (Image credit: Future)

This generation of graphics cards isn't all about gaming however and Nvidia has brought a couple of new features to the table that will make life better for pretty much everyone with an RTX card.

For instance we were already big fans of RTX Voice and Nvidia has finally brought it out of beta and worked it into a fully-featured broadcasting app. While RTX Voice filtered background noise out of your microphone you can set up Broadcaster to filter backgrounds out of your webcam – or even just apply a blur.

The video section is still in beta and we did see some glitches but it's way better than any other solution out there for blocking out your background without a green screen.

One of the features we're most excited to see implemented however is Nvidia RTX I/O which is an API that will work in tandem with Microsoft's DirectStorage API to route data straight from your SSD to your graphics card. In next-generation games this should not only massively reduce loading times but also mirror the groundbreaking I/O performance that has been teased with next-generation consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X. Far more than high frame rates or pretty graphics this technology is critically important to future gaming tech.

Unfortunately this is a technology that needs to be implemented by game developers in their games and we weren't actually able to see what kind of real-world difference it will make. Though it is something we will be actively testing once the technology is widely implemented – and because the consoles are going to be using similar tech we expect it will have a faster turnaround than ray tracing did.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080: Design

The design of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 puts its all about elegant lines and heat dissipation. (Image credit: Future)

New cooler style effectively manages heat while looking great in a case

The new 12-pin power connector adapter cable is too short

Lack of USB-C output is disappointing

For the actual Founders Edition graphics card Nvidia went with an all-new cooler design which is way more practical than anything it's ever done with a reference design before. The company used a shorter multi-layered PCB in order to have the back end of the card just be all heatsink. By doing this Nvidia was able to mount a fan on the back of the graphics card that will suck cool air through the heatsink and expel it up and out of the case.

We were a bit worried when we first saw this fan design that it would affect CPU and RAM temperatures as it's blowing hot air directly over these components. But even in our personal rig where we have a Noctua NH-12UA air cooler on an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X we didn't observe any difference in performance. We guess it helps that most PC games don't really stress both the GPU and CPU to the same extreme – not yet at least.

As far as power delivery goes that new 12-pin power connector is definitely there and we have some mixed feelings about it. It's clear that the new PCB design of the Founders Edition card needs this smaller connector to make this new cooler work we just wish that the 2 x 8-pin PCIe to 1 x 12-pin dongle Nvidia includes was a bit longer. As it stands it's kind of hard to tie it out of the way to not be immediately visible but at least aftermarket cards won't be using it right away. It's worth noting though that Nvidia is making the 12-pin power connector design available to any manufacturer – even AMD – that wants to use it.

The Founders Edition also has three DisplayPort and one HDMI 2.1 output for displays which is good. However we don't like that Nvidia got rid of the USB-C output here. Creators will definitely still want to use this incredibly powerful card and professional content creators are all about the best USB-C monitors these days.

Despite our little issues with the Founders Edition – and despite thinking it was ugly when it was first shown off – it's an attractive piece of hardware in person. All black with silver accents the RTX 3080 looks like a professional-grade piece of hardware.

The only lighting is the 'GeForce RTX' logo on the side of the graphics card in white which will surely please any anti-RGB users out there. Plus gamers that really want to go all-out with rainbow lighting will have that option with third-party cards.

Just from Nvidia's own (overblown) marketing we were already expecting the RTX 3080 to be a fast graphics card but calling it ""fast"" is a bit of an understatement. From the moment we opened the box it's been in our personal machine running everything from Final Fantasy XIV to Control only coming out of our personal rig to be plugged into our test bench for actual benchmarking.

Before the 3080 we had an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti in that machine and the difference was immediately apparent before we even start measuring performance in a quantifiable way. For instance one of the games we play the most is Final Fantasy XIV – it's a problem – and in that game particularly in the latest expansion there were moments where the RTX 2080 Ti would drop below 60 fps at 4K.

That doesn't happen with the RTX 3080. In fact the game is typically running anywhere from 75-100 fps at 4K with Maximum graphics settings where the RTX 2080 Ti typically chilled around the 60 fps mark – a massive jump in performance at around half the price.

This story just kept repeating itself over and over no matter what game we played. Metro Exodus maxed out with Ray Tracing and DLSS? Smooth locked 60 fps at 4K. Control with the myriad ray tracing effects? Silky smooth. Even Final Fantasy XV with all the weird optional graphics effects sits pretty at a steady 60 fps at 4K. Accessible 4K@60 gameplay is here – even if we are using the term ""accessible"" very loosely here.

While the thermals in our benchmarks aren't too exciting you should keep in mind that those were recorded on an open-air test bench. In our closed tower with two 240mm fans serving as intake temperatures peaked around 60°C – way cooler than the mid-80°C temperatures we would typically see with the RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition.

When looking at the actual benchmark results it's clear that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is in a class of its own standing head and shoulders above the RTX 2080 Ti. Right off the bat in 3DMark Time Spy Extreme the RTX 3080 is a whopping 63% faster than the RTX 2080 and 26% faster than the 2080 Ti – a massive generational leap when you consider that the RTX 2080 was only 40% faster than the GTX 1080 in our Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 review back in 2018.

But Time Spy Extreme isn't even even the best-case scenario for the RTX 3080's gains. In Red Dead Redemption 2 where we basically maxed out every single option that wasn't MSAA – multi-sample anti aliasing is very expensive and not worth it – we saw a massive 87% improvement gen-on-gen.

This falls short of that 2x performance leap that was teased at the RTX 3080 reveal but it's definitely closer than we thought it would actually get. The RTX 3080 all told is between 50-80% faster than the RTX 2080 while only falling below that in Fire Strike Ultra where it only managed a 29% lead – but that's still a meaty advantage.

That wide gap in performance is only really present at 4K however when the graphics card is free of bottlenecks. There are many titles in our testing suite where even the AMD Ryzen 9 3950X paired with 64GB of RAM at 3600MHz held back the RTX 3080. This is why for instance the RTX 2080 Ti and the RTX 3080 are virtually identical at 1080p in Metro Exodus but opens up to a 19% performance advantage at 4K.

For this reason we really don't recommend anyone actually buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 unless they're going to be playing at 4K or possibly 3400 x 1440 if you've got the best ultrawide monitor around that can really take advantage of what the RTX 3080 brings to the table. The gains are just not going to be there at lower resolutions so you're better off just picking up the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070.

The performance on offer with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 even further widens the gap that exists between Nvidia and AMD on the high end though. The AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT is one of the best AMD graphics cards around – especially when it comes to gaming performance – but it simply can't stand up against the RTX 3080 which outscored it on every synthetic banchmark we tested.

Performance: 5 / 5

Should you buy an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080?

Buy it if...

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is only really worth it if you're planning on playing games at 4K otherwise go with the RTX 3070 for 1440p. (Image credit: Future)

You want the best 4K performance

4K gaming is incredibly difficult to run but the RTX 3080 is one of the best graphics cards for handling it especially when you factor in its price. You'll be able to max out every game under the sun at this resolution at or very near 60 fps.

You want next-gen ready performance

With the next generation of games on the horizon performance requirements are about to skyrocket. The RTX 3080 is significantly more powerful (at least on paper) than the GPUs in either the PS5 or Xbox Series X.

You have an older graphics card

Because the generational gains between Nvidia Pascal and Nvidia Turing graphics cards were pretty minor many folks held onto their 10-series cards. If you have one of these older cards however you'll get absolutely massive gains with the RTX 3080.

Don't buy it if...

You play games at a lower resolution

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is a 4K graphics card and as such you really shouldn't pick this graphics card up for gaming at a lower resolution you'll run into bottlenecks with even the most powerful CPUs on the market.

You're on a budget

When Nvidia Turing launched the RTX 2080 saw a significant price increase over the GTX 1080. And while Nvidia didn't raise the price it didn't lower the price back to pre-Turing levels. If you want to get your hands on the RTX 3080 you're going to be paying a high price – even if it is worth it.

Also Consider

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070

If you don't plan on doing much 4K gaming then you should really consider going with the RTX 3070 which is an outstanding 1440p graphics card and it'll save you some money in the process. Read the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090

The RTX 3090 is nearly twice the price of the RTX 3080 so you should strike this card off your list for consideration if you have any concern about the cost of the card. If you're looking for the best 4K graphics card around though the RTX 3090 is pretty much best-in-class for this kind of gaming. Read the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 review

AMD Radeon RX 6800

The AMD Radeon RX 6800 isn't as good as the RTX 3080 there's no getting around that fact but if you're just looking for a gaming graphics card that is a major upgrade over an older GTX 10XX-series card then before you run off and buy Nvidia's best give the RX 6800 a look especially if you're looking for something that's marginally cheaper but still offers great performance.

The NVIDIA SHIELD TV is essentially a 4K@60Hz Dolby Vision capable Google/Android TV 11 dongle. But that does not quite do it justice. It is the Rolls Royce of dongles.

We are reviewing both the NVIDIA SHIELD TV dongle (this review) and the NVIDIA SHIELD TV Pro NVIDIA SHIELD TV Pro – Android/Plex media centre (review) so we expect a lot of similarities with all the relevant information in this review. For now it is about the NVIDIA SHIELD TV and how you can justify its $249.95 price over a $99 Google Chromecast 4K TV both with the latest version of Google TV.

Australian Review NVIDIA SHIELD TV Model P4340

Website SHIELD Product page Price $249.95 but shop around as we have seen it as low as $188. Caution – if buying second-hand ensure it is the 2019 model P4340 or later with Google Android TV 11. The Pro version is $349.95 From Harvey Norman and many CE and Computer stores Country of Origin China Company NVIDIA (Est 1993) is a global leader in GeForce and RTX Graphics Processing Units (GPU) graphics API software and GeForce Now cloud gaming.

What is NVIDIA SHIELD TV?

Whether it is the SHIELD TV’ tube’ or Pro’ console’ its prime function is to take all manner of video and audio content over Wi-Fi 5 AC Gigabit Ethernet (NAS as well) USB (Pro only) or Bluetooth. It runs the latest Google/Android TV 11 which means access to thousands of digital streaming channels like Netflix or digital versions of free-to-air.

It outputs this via HDMI 2.0b 18Gbps to a TV where it displays the best possible image to your panel’s capabilities and sound to your TV speakers soundbar or AC receiver capabilities. That includes Dolby Vision and Atmos HDR10+ and most video and audio formats. To be clear if your TV is 1080p or 4K SDR that is all SHIELD TV outputs – but it will give you the best image/sound.

It has NVIDIA GeForce Now cloud gaming and you can connect a BT games controller or other BT device.

It is a powerful Android digital media player focusing on the best video and audio input to a TV.

Why do you need it?

It adds the latest Google Android TV 11 to any TV with an HDMI port. At $249.95 it is not cheap so you need to use its added features or just get a 4K Google Chromecast TV dongle for $99.

In essence (NVIDIA versus Google)

Powerful NVIDIA Tegra X1+ processor versus Amlogic S905X3

2GB RAM and 8GB plus microSD storage versus 256kb flash

Gigabit Ethernet port and Wi-Fi 5 AC dual band versus Wi-Fi 5 AC only (optional Ethernet Port power adapter)

Mains power (direct plug-in) versus USB-C 5V/1.5A/7.5W

HDMI 2.0b HDCP 2.2 and CEC control versus HDMI 2.0

Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos decode (requires compatible TV) versus the same

DTS-X surround versus no

24-bit/192kHz Hi-Res audio over HDMI versus no

4K video upscale versus no

Stereo 2.0 PCM upscale to 5.1 surround

SBC AAC AAC+ eAAC+ MP3 WAVE AMR OGG Vorbis FLAC PCM WMA WMA-Pro WMA-Lossless Dolby Digital Plus Dolby Atmos Dolby TrueHD (pass-through) DTS-X (pass-through) and DTS-HD (pass-through) versus SBC and AAC and Dolby formats (no DTS-X)

Bluetooth 5.0 + LE versus BT 4.2 BLE

NVIDIA GeForce Now gaming and Stadia versus Google Stadia

SHIELD Remote with IR and BT and find my remote versus similar

While both are excellent they serve different purposes. If all you need is Google TV 4K Chromecast then the $99 dongle is OK. But I can’t go back after using the NVIDIA SHIELD TV for a few weeks – the image and audio quality are way better.

Essential differences between Nvidia SHIELD TV Model P4340 (tube) and Pro Model P2897

Some reviews call this the 2019 model; technically the hardware is the same. The operating system is now Google/Android TV 11 and firmware is now at 9.1 and offers much more functionality.

First impression – Exceed

It is a tube-shaped design 16.5 x 4cm round x 137g. At one end is power in (2-pin 240V mains power) and Gigabit Ethernet. On the other end are HDMI 2.0b and microSD. It is a neat well-made device.

The ‘Toblerone’ shaped remote is almost as long and has a Google Assistant microphone button motion-activated backlit buttons BT and IR connectivity and a programmable button. It takes two AAA batteries and is CEC compatible so it can control volume power and play.

Note: This device only shines if you have a 4K Dolby Vision/Atmos capable TV and soundbar. Otherwise it is a Rolls Royce to do the shopping.

Setup – Exceed

It is all about setting up Google TV; the process is painless if you have an Android smartphone. Or you can enter the Wi-Fi and your Google account details manually. If you have an Android smartphone you will have already signed away your privacy rights.

Once set up you have a clean Google TV (NVIDIA app but no junk or bloatware) and you go to the Google Play store for Android TV apps like digital TV channels etc.

I hasten to add this review has taken several days of use to uncover and discover its many features and options.

Google TV – Android 11 – Exceed

Google TV is smarter faster and able to deliver recommendations based on what you view and what Google knows about you. So when you use Google Assistant to find content (there is a mic button on the remote) the massive AI cloud delivers. It also has some 5000 Apps on Google Play.

Best use

Caveat: NVIDIA SHIELD TV cannot add Dolby Vision/Atmos or HDR10/+ to a TV that is not capable of reproducing that. But it can decode the metadata and give you the best possible image on any TV.

If you have a recent 4K smart TV running an operating system like Samsung Tizen (it has HDR10+ and reproduces Dolby Vision/Atmos in HDR10) LG WebOS Hisense VIDAA Roku TV and other proprietary TV OS this is for you. It adds the ever-ubiquitous Google/Android TV 11 and the wealth of Apps and streaming services. And we note that most TVs never get an OS or security patch updates- the NVIDIA SHIELD TV does. It will generally give a better video and audio than your TV does.

If you have an older 4K Android TV this updates that and adds its processing power to the TV.

If you have an older 1080p TV the video will present to the best of the panel’s capabilities adding all those new Apps and streaming channels.

Note that it uses the Internet and you will need 50Mbps (or more) unlimited download to make the most of this.

NVIDIA video upscaling versus lower-cost TV upscaling (or Google TV dongle) – Exceed

Most low-cost 4K TVs and dongles wrap 9/4 of the same colour pixels around the original 720/1080p frame image (linear scaling). Better TVs like LG use AI (trained on millions of images) to analyse each frame and insert what it thinks the next will be. AI looks for objects like human faces (skin tones) high-detail parts of the screen or areas in focus and fills the blanks for a more natural 4K image.

NVIDIA states

We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the residual (difference) between a regular linear scaled video and a high-resolution 4K ground truth video (reference quality). After training the CNN with tons of video content it gets good at predicting the difference between the two videos. Then when fed only the lower-scaled video content it can apply the prediction and produce near-4K results. It does this in real-time on the device.

The NVIDIA can upscale 720/1080p to 4K@24/30fps using AI upscaling and even does a creditable job on earlier 480p images.

Upscale from 720p to 4K

Dolby Vision content – Exceed

Dolby Vision/Atmos requires

Dolby Vision uses a licensed chip/processor with a maximum brightness of up to 10000 nits (typically 1000) 12-bit colour (68.7 billion but typically maps this back to a 10-bit 1.07 billion screen) and dynamic data processing – on a frame-by-frame basis. It is a superset of HDR (can play it all).

HDMI Premium High-Speed 18Gbps cable or Ultra-High-Speed 48Gbps (Read HDMI cables are not all the same. Which one do you need? (guide)

Dolby Vision/Atmos content (preferably MKV Ripped) passes to the SHIELD over Wi-Fi or Ethernet via apps like Netflix Amazon Prime Plex NAS etc.

Best played at 4K@24/30/50fps (Australian power is 50Hz)

We tested on a range of ripped Dolby Vision MKV content using an LG 2022 G2 OLED evo (1000 nits and infinite contrast – the difference between black and white) and the results were superb. Read LG G2 Evo Gallery Edition – OLED gets even better (review).

Netflix 4K Dolby Atmos – Pass

Netflix 4K HDR/10 – Pass

Prime 4K HDR10+ downmixed to HDR10 on the G2 – Pass

YouTube 4K SDR/HDR – Yes/No

MP4 and MKV video from 480 to 4K – Pass

Note that it supports DTS-X audio decoding as well and passes this to the TV/soundbar

Le

ft – SDR and Right Dolby Vision

SDR and HDR/10/+ content – Exceed

SDR (Standard Dynamic Range is usually 300-400 nits and contrast of 1000:1) will play back on any TV screen. It requires no additional metadata processing.

HDR playback solely depends on the TV’s ability to decode the metadata stream and control the panel to ‘locally’ vary the brightness and contrast in a small screen segment.

HDR (usually around 400 nits and contrast or 1500:1. The SHIELD TV appeared to add extra definition.

HDR10. Maximum brightness of 1000 nits (typically 400-600) and 10-bit colour (1.07 billion). Static metadata sets tone mapping once for the entire show.

HDR10+. Maximum brightness of 4000 nits (typically <1000) 10-bit colour. Metadata does tone-mapping on a scene-by-scene basis. It is a Samsung-developed open-source API and its TVs do not support Dolby Vision but downmix it to HDR for a vastly inferior image.

We tested a range of SDR/HDR/10/+ content on a TCL C835 4K Mini-LED that supports HDR10+ and Dolby Vision. Read TCL C835 Mini-LED TV – bang for buck (review).

Format/Container support: Xvid/ DivX/ASF/AVI/MKV/MOV/M2TS/MPEG-TS/MP4/WEB-M

All were superb using the TCL mini-LED panel’s capabilities.

NVIDIA Audio upscaling – Exceed

It supports 24-bit/192 kHz hi-res audio (over HDMI) and can decode Dolby Atmos and 7.1 surround sound systems. Advanced Sound options allow the Shield to pass all the audio untouched over HDMI.

Spotify users should use the SHIELD App as it will upscale PCM 2.0 to whatever the TV soundbar or AV receiver’s capabilities are.

Plex Server – Only the Pro version

We list this as the Pro version can replace a Windows-based Plex server.

SHIELD Experience 9.1

The latest firmware adds a lot of new features

Night mode to boost voice over louder sounds

Auto low-latency games mode (ALLM)

Network workgroup and better data transfer speeds

AI upscale to 4K@50/60Hz

Better HDMI CEC support

Gamers

We are not gamers so this advice is general. NVIDIA states

With a GeForce RTX or GTX-powered PC you can also effortlessly cast your full catalogue of games to your TV for a bigger more immersive gaming experience with NVIDIA GameStream.

Here is a list of featured games.

Power – Exceed

The TV uses from 5-10W depending on content and under 1W on standby. Negligible.

Privacy – Pass(able)

NVIDIA promises never to sell your data and only collect and use what you approve to do the job. Great!

Google has one privacy policy for all its goods and services. If you live in an Android world you have no choice.

But it is the myriad of Apps that you need to beware of. NVIDIA nor Google can control what information these apps exfiltrate. In short if you use any streaming service then you are subject to its privacy terms.

However Google Android TV 11 can lock down app permissions and you need to spend a little time – some apps automatically access the microphone camera contacts and more but you can turn this off.

CyberShack’s view – NVIDIA SHIELD TV is the ultimate Google/Android TV 11 dongle.

Since I saw the 2015 model with Android TV 5 there has been a steady improvement to the software and one hardware upgrade (2019 model). Interestingly NVIDIA has moved from positioning this as a gaming device to a multi-media device – which is what it really is.

To be clear there are two versions. The fundamental difference: Standard 2/8GB/microSD versus 3/16GB/USBx2/Plex server – I suspect that serious streamers and gamers will want the PRO.

Google/Android TV 11 adds a lot of extra features regardless of what TV you have.

Downsides – you need to be a little tech-savvy to use all its features. You need to connect via Ethernet cable – Wi-Fi AC 5Ghz supports 4K video but can be scatty unless you are in a few metres line-of-sight of a decent AC router. Wi-Fi 2.4Ghz does not support 4K video. That may mean laying cable or using a pair of Ethernet-Over-Power Powerline adaptors.

If your needs are limited to streaming to an older TV then a Google TV dongle is all you need. But if you don’t mind spending more this can do much more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84NzY5My9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtNDA4MC00MDcwLWVhcmx5LTNkbWFyay1lc3RpbWF0ZXMtdGVhc2VkL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 + RTX 4070: early 3DMark estimates teased,"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 and GeForce RTX 4070 benchmark estimates in 3DMark teased: 15000+ for the RTX 4080 10000+ for RTX 4070.

NVIDIA's next-gen Ada Lovelace GPU architecture should be detailed in the coming weeks with the GeForce RTX 4090 expected to launch first and be a powerhouse... but the GeForce RTX 4080 and GeForce RTX 4070 graphics cards will follow and now we have some early 3DMark performance estimates.

The upcoming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 and GeForce RTX 4070 graphics cards have had their 3DMark TimeSpy Extreme graphics scores revealed by leaker ""kopite7kimi"". The leaker says that the GeForce RTX 4080 has 15000+ points in TimeSpy Extreme while the GeForce RTX 4070 will have 10000+ points in TimeSpy Extreme.

These scores are based on the previously known specs of the cards with the GeForce RTX 4080 packing the AD103 GPU and 10240 CUDA cores while the GeForce RTX 4070 is based on the AD104 GPU and 7168 CUDA cores.

Here's how to check your GPU,"If you want to play the best PC games on your rig knowing what graphics card you have is crucial information. After all a GPU released ten years ago will not be able to run modern graphically-demanding titles. Knowing what GPU you have makes it easier to see if your rig meets a game’s minimum requirements. But how can you find out what graphics card you have?

This might seem like a silly question if you're tech-savvy but it can be a real conundrum. Heck there was a time where I had to look this question up myself! There's always new people getting into PC gaming for the first time so a question like this will always be relevant.

Read on for our step-by-step guide to figuring out what graphics card you have.

How to check what GPU you have

Figuring out which graphics card you have isn’t that difficult. There are three common ways to find your PC’s graphics card on Windows all of which we’ll outline below. Note that even though we’re using Windows 11 for this how-to the same methods apply to Windows 10.

How to check what GPU you have in Device Manager

1. Open the Start Menu. If you’re on Windows 11 the Start Menu is in the center of the taskbar. On Windows 10 it’s on the far left. Note that all subsequent methods begin by opening up the Start Menu -- the fastest way to do so is usually just to hit the Windows key on your keyboard.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: Thirty second review

Any other year and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti would be a welcome sight.

Nine months separate the launch of the 3080 Ti and our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review and though that’s the usual time frame for a refresh it’s a strange time to stick to that schedule.

While Nvidia surely has justifications for going ahead with this mid-generation refresh the world of GPUs along with almost everything else tech-related has been turned upside down.

Right now consumers have been struggling to get hold of the best graphics cards  no matter if they’re from AMD vs Nvidia . The global chip shortage has made supply extremely limited and hard to come by and so anyone in the market for a new GPU has to either contend with scalpers charging double the price or store lotteries for the small chance of getting one.

These conditions are not ideal for the release of a new GPU especially one that costs $1199. If by chance you’re able to get your hands on a RTX 3080 TI you won’t be disappointed. It is a powerhouse taking the RTX 3090 and halving the VRAM for a more consumer-oriented card.

Even in more normal times though it’s not the easiest graphics card to recommend since it’s not that much more powerful compared to the RTX 3080 but it is much more expensive.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: Price and availability

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti comes to us at a very weird time. (Image credit: Future)

Much more expensive than the RTX 3080 but not that much more powerful

A great value alternative to the RTX 3090

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is available June 3 starting at $1199 / £1049 / AU$1949. Prices for the RTX 3080 Ti will probably vary wildly from that minimum price and third-party versions of the GPU will probably sell for much higher.

Given that the RTX 3080 launched in September 2020 for just $699 (£649 about AU$950) you’re paying nearly twice as much for the RTX 3080 Ti. Given that this GPU has just 2GB more VRAM and 17% more CUDA cores that 71% price mark-up might be hard to swallow right now.

Although this graphics card does deliver pretty much the same level of performance as the card in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 review for about $300 less (at least going by MSRP) so it might be worth grabbing if you had your eyes on one of the best Nvidia GeForce graphics cards on the market but are put off by their premium price tags.

Value: 3.5 / 5

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: Features and chipset

The RTX 3080 Ti is more of a cut-down RTX 3090 than an improved RTX 3080. (Image credit: Future)

A 17% increase in CUDA cores over RTX 3080

Includes hardware-based hash rate limiter to thwart crypto mining

An additional 2GB VRAM will help with 4K gaming performance

Just like the rest of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3000 series the RTX 3080 Ti is built on the Nvidia Ampere architecture and brings with it the same improvements as the rest of the lineup. There is something new to the table however.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti key specs GPU: GA102

Stream multiprocessors: 80 (128 CUDA per SM)

CUDA Cores: 10240

Tensor cores: 320

Ray tracing cores: 80

Power Draw (TGP): 350W

Boost clock: 1665MHz

VRAM: 12GB GDDR6X

Memory Speed: 19Gbps

Interface: PCIe 4.0 x16

Outputs: 1 x HDMI 2.1 3 x DisplayPort 1.4

Power connector: 1 x 12-pin

As with the card in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 review that launched in March 2021 the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti has a hardware-based hash rate limiter that should limit the appeal to cryptocurrency miners. We don’t test mining performance at TechRadar so we can’t speak to how effective this limit actually is. But given that the hash rate limiter on the RTX 3060 was accidentally bypassed by Nvidia’s own driver update we’ll just have to wait and see how well this actually dissuades miners from buying this graphics card in bulk.

Beyond that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is actually quite a bit beefier than the original RTX 3080 and that largely falls to core count and memory bandwidth.

Because sure the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti does have more VRAM with 12GB of GDDR6X compared to 10GB of the stuff on the original card but it’s also on a faster 384-bit memory bus. That means you get 912 GB/s of memory bandwidth on the RTX 3080 Ti compared to the RTX 3080’s 760 GB/s. With faster VRAM not to mention just more memory the RTX 3080 Ti should be even more adept at 4K gaming in the future.

The RTX 3080 Ti is straight up more powerful as well. The GPU has 10240 CUDA cores across 80 compute units compared to the RTX 3080’s 8704 CUDA cores. That’s a 17% increase in core count but don’t expect a strict 17% performance increase - more on that later.

You’re also going to get access to Nvidia’s whole suite of software features and it’s not just limited to gaming.

The one we are still in love with is Nvidia Broadcast which is ostensibly designed for streamers and content creators but we find that it is incredibly useful in just day-to-day life. We use it a lot when we’re taking meetings or even just hanging out with friends in Discord especially because it filters out most of the New York City street noises outside our street-facing apartment window.

Of course you also get access to Deep Learning Super Sampling or DLSS. This tech uses the Tensor cores – the RTX 3080 Ti has 320 of those – to upscale a lower resolution to your native resolution. The idea is that DLSS will let you turn on more of the shiny graphics options so you don’t have to sacrifice image quality just to hit a decent framerate especially at high resolutions like 4K.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: Design

The RTX 3080 Ti is the same size as the RTX 3080 so it will slot in easily into the same case. (Image credit: Future)

Same size as the RTX 3080 so will fit in the same case easily

Same design as other Founders Edition cards so still looks great in a case

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti we reviewed is Nvidia’s Founders Edition and well it looks like the rest of the RTX 30-series Founders Edition cards. The graphics card has an attractive black and gunmetal gray colorway. You’ll aso see Nvidia and RTX 3080 Ti branding etched into the metal. That’s not something you’ll notice once you actually have the graphics card in your PC but it’s a nice touch.

The RTX 3080 Ti is the exact same size and weight as the original RTX 3080 which means it’s 4.4 inches thick and 11.2 inches long so it should fit in most cases.

There are two fans on the RTX 3080 Ti and just like the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 there’s one on the front and one on the back. This fan configuration pulls air through the front of the card it’ll go through the card and go out through a fan on the back of the card probably shooting the hot air through the top of your case.

It’s an extremely effective method of cooling the RTX 3080 Ti and even with a peak power consumption of 350W the RTX 3080 Ti peaks at just 78.9C. That is a lot higher than the RTX 3090’s 72C peak temperature even though that card has the same level of power consumption.

But it’s actually impressive that Nvidia was able to get that close in thermals considering that it was able to shrink the cooler back down to a dual-slot design rather than the giant triple-slot RTX 3090 Founders Edition.

Finally Nvidia has of course included the 12-pin power connector. It does mean that you’re probably going to have to use an adapter to power the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti but of course Nvidia has included an adapter in the box.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 levels of gaming performance

Beats the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT pretty handily

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is basically as fast as the RTX 3090 in PC games even despite the fact that it has half the VRAM. So the RTX 3080 Ti is what you should buy if you want the best gaming performance you can get right now and don’t really need to be running Blender or Resolve all the time.

Test system specs This is the system we used to test the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition: CPU: Intel Core i9-11900K (8-core up to 5.3GHz)

CPU Cooler: Cooler Master Masterliquid 360P Silver Edition

RAM: 64GB Corsair Dominator Platinum @ 3200MHz

Motherboard: MSI MEG Z590 ACE

SSD: ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro @ 1TB

Power Supply: Phanteks RevoltX 1200

Case: Praxis Wetbench

And when we say that the performance is exactly the same we’re not really exaggerating. Across our entire suite of benchmarks the RTX 3080 Ti is usually within 1-2 fps of the RTX 3090.

The biggest difference between the two is in Dirt 5 at 1440p where the RTX 3080 Ti gets 139 fps to the RTX 3090’s 146 fps. But if you’re playing Dirt 5 you’re probably not going to notice that 5% performance difference.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti also beats the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT in all but two tests: Fire Strike Ultra and Assassins Creed Valhalla.

But even then at 4K the RTX 3080 Ti delivers the same performance as the RTX 3090 so you’re getting extremely good performance either way.

Still no USB-C output which is a damned shame. (Image credit: Future)

In the rest of the games though the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT is between 7-26% slower than the RTX 3080 Ti so Assassins Creed Valhalla is definitely not the norm. This would usually be enough to make us flatly recommend the RTX 3080 Ti over the Radeon RX 6900 XT but if we’re just going off of MSRP Nvidia’s Graphics card is an extra $200. So you’re going to want to make sure that the RTX 3080 Ti is worth that extra cost.

For pretty much any game that you’re looking to play the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is going to be able to max it out at 4K and that’s including all the fancy ray tracing effects you’ve probably been hearing about.

Performance: 5 / 5

Should you buy an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti?

Compared to the RTX 3080 the RTX 3080 Ti is questionable but against the RTX 3090 it's a bargain. (Image credit: Future)

Buy it if…

You want no-compromises gaming performance

Because the RTX 3080 Ti basically brings the same level of performance as the RTX 3090 for a bit less money this is the graphics card to get if you just want a top-notch gaming experience.

You have the budget for it

Even before accounting for aftermarket price increases the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is an expensive graphics card. But it is the best of the best and we think it’s worth the price if you can afford it.

You want DLSS and ray tracing

Next to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is the best graphics card on the market right now if you care about ray tracing and DLSS will help boost that performance even more.

Don’t buy it if...

You’re on a budget

Any graphics card in 2021 is expensive but the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is one of the priciest ones out there.

You have a low-wattage power supply

The RTX 3080 Ti peaks at around 350W of power so we recommend at least an 800W PSU. So you might need an upgrade if you have a lesser power supply.

Also Consider

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080

The RTX 3080 is not as powerful as its Ti variant no doubt but the performance gains are hard to square with the nearly doubling in price. If you're looking for the better value the RTX 3080 is the clear winner here. Read the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090

If you're going to spend this much money on a graphics card you might ask whether it's worth just going all in and getting an RTX 3090. The value proposition isn't as good but if you want the best of the best (within reason) then consider the RTX 3090 especially if you're running creative workloads and not just gaming.

The Union Cabinet has approved the ‘Semicon India’ programme with a total investment of Rs 76000 crore in the growth of the country’s semiconductor and display manufacturing ecosystem.

The main objective of the programme is to provide financial assistance to companies that invest in semiconductors display production and the design environment. This is expected to pave the road for India’s increased participation in global electronics value chains and become a global semiconductor manufacturing hub.

Under this semiconductor initiative four schemes have been introduced – for instance scheme for setting up of Semiconductor Fabs in India Display Fabs in India Compound Semiconductors / Silicon Photonics / Sensors Fab and Semiconductor Assembly Testing Marking and Packaging (ATMP) / OSAT facilities in India and Design Linked Incentive (DLI) Scheme.

Through ‘India Semiconductor Mission’ (ISM) the central government wants to encourage the use of secure microelectronics and the establishment of a reliable semiconductor supply chain including raw materials speciality chemicals gases and production equipment.

It also wants to promote and facilitate indigenous Intellectual Property (IP) generation encourage enable and incentivise the Transfer of Technologies (ToT) and collaborations with national and international organisations to catalyse research commercialisation and skill development.

Therefore for international collaborations reports suggest Indian and Taiwan have been in talks to establish a semi-conductor manufacturing hub in India. Taiwan is globally known for having the world’s largest semiconductor company TSMC or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

What Experts are Saying

Deepak Pahwa Managing Director Bry-Air told News18 that the mission launched by the central government will help the country to emerge as the global semiconductor manufacturing hub. “India is rising to the occasion where with the right talent skill technology and infrastructure it can become the leader in semiconductor manufacturing designing and innovation” Pahwa said.

“But in the mission it is really crucial to focus on the ancillary industries that can render quality end products that remain unrivalled across the globe. Not complying with the precise manufacturing conditions can be responsible for substandard semiconductors that will hurt the country’s position in the global market” Pahwa added.

As components in a semiconductor are hygroscopic in nature humidity can have a corrosive effect and cause chip failure. Therefore the government should establish a “powerful highly resilient manufacturing base” suggested Pahwa.

Another industry expert Sonny Kunnakkat Managing Director Worldwide Operations Applied Materials India Private Ltd said because of the pervasiveness of technology and big advancements such as 5G EV and AI chips are more vital to the globe than ever before.

He believes that all of these demonstrate the critical importance of the India Semiconductor Mission in developing the country’s electronics manufacturing ecosystem.

According to him: “Working closely with the ISM we see the PLI scheme for semiconductor and display manufacturing has encouraged businesses in these segments in India to scale up indigenous electronics manufacturing which is a very positive outcome.”

“These businesses require a strong ecosystem of high-quality materials special processes innovative equipment and world-class research. We are excited to see the ISM looking to identify and support a local supply chain and a skilled talent pool so the ecosystem can sustain itself for years to come” the expert added.

Sanjay Gupta (India Head) Vice President and India Managing Director NXP Semiconductors said: “With ISM taking India’s leadership in the technology space to the next level we are surely moving towards economic independence and giving India a new face on the global manufacturing map.”

He noted that many countries are discussing collaborating with India in making the chips which are needed for electronics items communications devices health care systems and motor vehicles.

Gupta further said: “Due to the efforts of governments companies are filing applications for semiconductors and displaying fab units revealing how India is forging ahead in becoming the semiconductor manufacturing hub.”

India Joins The Race

At this moment Asian players from the mainland of China Taiwan and South Korea have a monopoly in the chip manufacturing market. After a sudden bump faced by these players during the peak of the pandemic all these countries are now scaling up their chip manufacturing capabilities and also investing tens of billions of dollars in the business.

Meanwhile the US approved its most awaited CHIPS Act to increase semiconductor manufacturing in the country by investing more than $52 billion with an aim to combat China’s chip-making power and boost its own economy.

But India is also participating in this race now. During the Digital India Week-2022 which took place in early July Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that India wants to become a “chip maker from a chip taker”.

During his speech Modi stated: “Today India is working on the target of taking electronics manufacturing to more than $300 billion in the next 3-4 years. India wants to become a chip maker from a chip taker. Investment is increasing rapidly in India to increase the production of semiconductors.”

Initiatives Taken by States

It should be noted that in early July Karnataka’s Minister for Electronics IT/BT and Science and Technology Dr C N Ashwath Narayan urged investors to take advantage of the state government’s ‘Open Land Reforms Policy’ to help the semiconductor industry flourish.

At the ‘Semiconductor Industry Connect 2022’ in Karnataka the minister also said to develop the Electronics System Design & Manufacturing Skill Development (ESDM) the state government is considering creating a semiconductor park and a testing lab.

Additionally Karnataka which introduced its semiconductor policy in 2008-2009 and the International Semiconductor Consortium (ISMC) based in Israel signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) earlier this year to invest a total of Rs 22900 crore in the state to build the first and largest semiconductor chip manufacturing facility in the nation.

However the Gujarat government recently announced the ‘Gujarat Semiconductor Policy 2022-2027’ to attract investment in the chip manufacturing sector in Gujarat under ISM.

Gujarat’s minister of Science and Technology Department Jitu Vaghani said the state government will provide an additional assistance at a rate equal to 40% of the capital assistance provided by the centre for the projects approved by ISM under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.

It was also said under the policy Dholera Semicon City will be established in the Dholera Special Investment Region (Dholera SIR) and eligible projects will receive subsidies of up to 50% for additional land needed for fab projects upstream/downstream and other projects authorised under ISM as well as 75% for the first 200 acres of land they purchase.

Even in Maharashtra this week the mining giant Vedanta and Taiwan’s electronics manufacturer Foxconn met with Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and his deputy Devendra Fadnavis to propose an investment of Rs 1742290000000.00 ($22 billion) in a manufacturing facility for semiconductors that would generate around 200000 jobs.

It was reported that Talegaon in Pune has become a popular candidate for the facility due to its high concentration of qualified labour port accessibility and industrial infrastructure among other things.

The initiatives by the states and Centre highlight that India is ready to accomplish its goals and attract more companies to invest in the country.

The ARCA Menards Series kicked off the night with an action-packed race won by Chandler Smith. The NASCAR Camping World Truck Series followed with Grant Enfinger winning a thrilling race that was capped off with a last lap pass.

ARCA returned to the .686-mile Brownsburg short track Friday evening after being left off the 2021 schedule. Chandler Smith 20 entered the Reese's 200 as a two-time defending champion of the event having won the last two races held in 2019 and 2020. Smith now driving full-time for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series made the Reese's 200 his first ARCA start of the year teaming up with Venturini Motorsports. All of Smith's career ARCA victories have come driving for Venturini Motorsports.

It was a race between two Smith's. Sammy Smith (no relation to Chandler) racing for Kyle Busch Motorsports started on the pole ahead of Jesse Love Chandler Smith Taylor Gray and Nick Sanchez. Rajah Caruth the series points leader heading into the race started from the 7th position.

The 18-year-old Sammy Smith appeared to have the advantage from the drop of the green flag. He led the early stages of the race holding off Jesse Love and Taylor Gray. Chandler Smith quickly moved up from his third place starting position and began to challenge the younger Smith. Lapped traffic became a major issue for Chandler Smith. He was held up multiple times while looking to make a pass for the lead. It wasn't until after the first race break that Chandler Smith was able to take the lead and never look back.

Driving double duty Chandler Smith celebrated his ARCA victory with his Venturini team rather quickly before getting ready to drive another 200 miles this time behind the wheel of his Kyle Busch Motorsports race truck.

The ARCA points championship became closer with Rajah Caruth holding just a one-point lead over his teammate and second-place driver Nick Sanchez. Daniel Dye is five points out of the championship lead in third.

Fans continued to pack the grandstands and viewing hill to watch NASCAR make its return at the conclusion of the ARCA race. The first race of the NASCAR Truck Series playoffs did not disappoint. Every fan in attendance was treated to a spectacular show that featured plenty of on-track action.

""I've said for six months that (IRP) should never have been off the schedule. This is a Truck Series track"" said Grant Enfinger after the race. ""Not only do you have strategy you also have multiple lanes.""

Enfinger entered the race at IRP below the cutline. He had not won a race since 2020 and had relatively struggled throughout the season. Enfinger qualified well and started from the fifth position. However it was KBM teammates John Hunter Nemechek and Chandler Smith who held the early advantage.

""IRP itself is not one of my better places. It just doesn't fit my driving style"" said Enfinger post-race. ""I recognized that from years past and I tried to change my mindset coming in here.""

Enfinger never lost sight of the leaders however. He scored stage points in both stages finishing fifth at the end of Stage 1 and second at the end of Stage 2. Those extra points helped Enfinger's points deficit but he needed to win to secure his chances at advancing to the next round.

Late in the race it appeared Ty Majeski was going to run away and score his first career NASCAR Camping World Truck Series victory. However a late race accident involving Carson Hocevar and Colby Howard bunched up the field and gave Enfinger an opportunity at victory. A spin from Taylor Gray off the front bumper of John Hunter Nemechek set up a NASCAR Overtime finish.

As the field sped into Turn 1 with two laps left race leader Nemechek slid up the racetrack and made contact with the wall in Turn 2. That allowed Zane Smith to sneak into the lead before quickly being overtaken by Enfinger as they took the white flag on the frontstretch. The 37-year-old from Fairhope Alabama crossed the line first in front of roaring fans who had waited eleven long years to see NASCAR's IRP return.

""I changed my whole outlook on short track racing to come here tonight"" said Enfinger. ""I'm a guy who likes to get into the throttle really early even if I can't get wide open. This is a place where I feel like you have to dive-bomb in there give up the center then get back in the gas once.""

Despite the odds being against him before the start of the race Grant Enfinger's hard work and great strategy calls by his team allowed him to break a 38-race winless drought dating back to Martinsville in October 2020. It also propelled him from the bottom of the playoff grid to the top.

Enfinger and his GMS Motorsports team will try to continue their momentum when the series heads to Richmond Virginia on August 13th.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS9uZXctamVyc2V5LXRyaWNrLW9yLXRyZWF0ZXJzLW1heS1mYWNlLWEtY2FuZHktc2hvcnRhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Jersey trick-or-treaters may face a candy shortage,"Heads up New Jersey! Your little goblin may be getting bags of pennies from your neighbors when they trick or treat this Oct. 31.

Hershey the big candy maker issued a warning this week that said a possible candy shortage may affect your Halloween pickings. The big concern is the shortage of raw ingredients which will cause a major candy capacity problem.

The shortage is a result of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine where restrictions have been made on Russian gas and oil imports which are specifically hurting the German import of supplies that aren’t going to make it to Pennsylvania and the world’s fifth largest candy maker.

According to an article in the Washington Post candy has seen an 11% gain in share in 2021 with an amazing $37 billion dollars in confectionary sales revenue.

The increase in candy sales across the board coupled with the lack of supplies coming from Europe have put a big stress on shelves now selling candy. Candy makers are at “all hands on deck” mode to keep the shelves stocked three full months before Halloween.

The Halloween scare at Hersey’s and Mars is very real. Not only is there a problem in Europe but here in the states there is a milk shortage that will add to the problems that candy makers are trying to ward off. The milk shortage is a result of one of the Borden Dairies' production facilities permanently closing its doors in Chicago. Borden Dairies has one of the country’s largest milk production plants. This closing in Chicago will affect mostly Illinois and Wisconsin retailers but those retailers are spreading out to get dairy deliveries outside their states to keep up the demand which will put more of a strain on the national market.

All in all we have three months to see how this shakes out. Hopefully it will be a Happy Halloween with lots of candy for your little trick-or-treaters and you too!

Edgar Delgado 31 of Passaic was arrested Friday for the crash in Clifton that prosecutors said happened earlier that day. The Passaic cop faces multiple charges including assault by auto causing serious bodily injury.

Passaic County Prosecutor Camelia Valdes said that Delgado was driving near the intersection of Central and Yereance Avenues early Friday morning. Shortly before 4:30 a.m. he crashed into a parked car according to Valdes.

Valdes said that when Clifton police got to the scene they found Delgado's car but not him.

Instead cops found a 28-year-old woman from Clifton in the passenger seat. She was taken to Saint Joseph’s University Medical Center.

""The investigation revealed that Mr. Delgado had been operating his vehicle recklessly under the influence of alcohol and left the scene following the crash"" Valdes said.

Along with the second-degree assault by auto charge Delgado faces three third-degree charges including leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident resulting in serious bodily injury endangering an injured victim and hindering apprehension. He is also charged with driving while intoxicated.

This is the fifth and final article on papermaking in the Scioto Valley of Ross County Ohio. In the previous four articles I have written about the first recorded history of papermaking in Scioto Valley as well as the history of the paper mill on the south end of Chillicothe Ohio. The mill on the south end of Chillicothe was known in 1847 as the Entrekin Green and Company until acquired by the descendants of the Ingham Brothers in 1852. They operated the mill until 1890 when it was purchased by Colonel Daniel Mead of Dayton Ohio and became Mead Paper.

Article one “Papermaking In Scioto Valley” is a basic history of early papermaking in the Scioto Valley of Ross County Ohio from its earliest known origin on the Kinnikinnick Creek with Quaker brothers Hezekiah and Isaiah Ingham. The latter part of the article is an early history of the mill after it was acquired by Colonel Daniel Mead.

Article two entitled “Life & Death of Mother Mead” is a history of Mead Paper from 1890 until its merger with Westvaco in 2002.

Article three chronicles the 1975 union strike at the Chillicothe mill that shut down the facility from August 12 1975 until October 27 1975. The article is “Mead Paper Strike – 1975.”

Article four of this series details Mead Paper’s successful fight against a hostile takeover in 1978 by Occidental Petroleum led by Chairman Dr. Armand Hammer. CEO and President of Mead James Wilmer McSwiney led the effort to prevent this takeover. This article is entitled “A Big Mac Saves Mead.”

History records that two Quaker brothers from Pennsylvania Hezekiah and Isaiah Ingham began making paper on the Kinnikinnick Creek in Scioto Valley in 1810. Paper for printing was in demand in the area as Chillicothe in 1803 was the first capital of Ohio and there was a need for printing paper to support the state government. Descendants of the Inghams in 1852 acquired a paper mill on Honey Creek in the south end of Chillicothe operating it until 1890 when it was purchased by Colonel Daniel Mead of Dayton Ohio.

The Mead family also had a paper mill in Dayton Ohio but with the purchase of the mill in Chillicothe the Dayton mill was closed circa 1905 and some of its equipment moved to the Chillicothe mill. 1905 is also the year that George Houk Mead the grandson of Colonel Daniel Mead began the revitalization of a paper mill that was in bad shape both mechanically and financially. A testimony to his success is that the Mead Paper Company operated in reality from 1890 until its merger with Westvaco Papers in 2002 a period of 112 years. The Mead Paper Corporation in 1996 was an international company with sales of $4.7 billion and over 21000 employees scattered in many different countries of the world before it merged with Westvaco Papers.

MeadWestvaco - 2002

After struggling financially in the 1980s and early 1990s the mid-sized Mead Corporation became more financially sound in late 1990s and a target of larger corporations for takeover. In order to avoid a hostile takeover of the Mead Corporation they engaged in a three billion dollar stock swap with another mid-sized forest products corporation Westvaco in 2002. Westvaco in 1996 had over 15000 employees and 1.8 billion in sales with its main area of business being printing papers packaging and specialty chemicals.

The new MeadWestvaco Corporation had revenues of eight billion dollars and over 32000 employees with its core businesses being packaging specialty papers consumer and office products and specialty chemicals. Mead President and CEO Jerry Tatar became Chairman of MeadWestvaco with Westvaco President and CEO John Luke Jr. becoming the CEO and President of MeadWestvaco. After one year Chairman Jerry Tatar exercised a “golden parachute” agreement retiring in a deal estimated at over thirteen million dollars leaving top management of the company to John Luke Jr. MeadWestvaco had five printing papers mills including Mead mills in Chillicothe Ohio; Escanaba Michigan and Rumford Maine with Westvaco mills in Luke Maryland and Wickliffe Kentucky. The old Ingham Brothers mill on Honey Creek in Chillicothe Ohio was now a MeadWestvaco mill.

NewPage – 2005

After three years of being a MeadWestvaco mill the five printing paper mills and 900000 acres of forestland was sold to a private investment company Cerebus Capital Management for 2.3 billion dollars with purchase being complete in May of 2005. MeadWestvaco had decided that their main core segments of business would be in packaging consumer and office products and specialty chemicals. The old Ingham Brothers mill on Honey Creek was now a NewPage mill but it did not fit into the plans of NewPage management and it was sold to the Glatfelter Company of York Pennsylvania with sale finalized in April of 2006.

At the end of 2012 NewPage was listed as a leading producer of printing and specialty papers in North America with net sales of 3.1 billion with paper mills in Kentucky Maine Michigan Maryland Minnesota and Wisconsin. Annual production capacity of these mills was 3.5 million tons of paper. In 2014 NewPage was acquired by Verso.

Glatfelter – 2006

A press release in February of 2006 announced the purchase for eighty million in cash of the NewPage paper mill in Chillicothe Ohio by the P. H. Glatfelter Company of York Pennsylvania. Glatfelter was a global manufacturer of specialty papers and engineered products with mills in Spring Grove Pennsylvania and Neenah Wisconsin and operations in Germany France and Philippines. Shortly after the purchase of Chillicothe mill Glatfelter announced the closure of the Neenah Wisconsin mill.

In April of 2006 began the changeover to being a Glatfelter mill when Glatfelter’s Chairman and CEO George H. Glatfelter II stood in the entrance ways to the mill and greeted all of the incoming employees welcoming them to the new company. Later Glatfelter management personnel held employee meetings talking about Glatfelter and answering questions. Glatfelter stated the “Chillicothe mill was not on their radar it was the radar!” As a member of the sales force I had the opportunity to interact with George H. Glatfelter II at sales meetings and found him to be a special charismatic leader with ability to personalize himself with employees. Glatfelter introduced “book paper” to the production mix and after a learning curve it became a standard product for the Chillicothe mill.

Pixelle Specialty Solutions - 2018

On October 31 2018 P.H. Glatfelter Company announced the sale of their paper business to private investment firm Lindsay Goldberg. Lindsay Goldberg rebranded the new company as Pixelle Specialty Solutions with mills in Chillicothe Ohio and Spring Grove Pennsylvania. Pixelle is one of the largest specialty papers companies in North America specializing in food contact papers inkjet release liner carbonless forms envelopes greeting cards book paper and playing cards. Later Pixelle would add the Jay Maine and Stevens Point Wisconsin mills collectively operating eleven paper machines and producing more than one million tons of paper annually.

H.I.G. Capital – 2022

April 4 2022 Lindsay Goldberg announced an agreement to be acquired by H.I.G. Capital but terms not announced. That old Ingham Mead paper mill in south end of Chillicothe on Honey Creek may have a new name unknown as of the time of this writing. May she perform for the new owners as she has so reliably for her previous owners and may smoke continue to come out of the candy-striped smoke stack.

The discovery from a new deeper reservoir indicates between 1–1.5 trillion standard cubic feet (TSCF) of raw gas in place.

This complements the initial finding in February from a shallower target taking the total amount of gas in place from this single well to 2.5 – 3.5 TSCF.

A consortium led by Eni and PTT Exploration and Production Public Company (PTTEP) was awarded the exploration rights for Offshore Block 2 in 2019.

Yaser Saeed Almazrouei ADNOC Upstream ED said: “This discovery further highlights how ADNOC’s accelerated exploration and development program is identifying untapped hydrocarbon resources creating long-term value for the UAE. We are particularly pleased to see Eni and PTTEP pursuing deeper zones which has demonstrated additional potential resources in place. We look forward to continuing to work with all our strategic partners to sustainably identify and further unlock Abu Dhabi’s hydrocarbon resources.”

Both discoveries leveraged insights from ADNOC’s ongoing 3D mega seismic survey.

This latest discovery builds on previously announced exploration concession discoveries. In May ADNOC also announced the discovery of approximately 100 million barrels of oil in place in Abu Dhabi’s Onshore Block 3 operated by Occidental while in December 2021 up to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BBOE) in Onshore Block 4 Exploration Concession which is operated by INPEX/JODCO was confirmed.

Sometimes in the comfort of the living room sometimes in the formality of a long-distance call.

They have talked of football life and all the intersections between. It was never a daily thing but the invitation remained open year upon year.

So what’s changed now?

Everything and nothing. For the first time they are working together in the same building on the same field with the same goal in mind. The protégé is still aspiring the mentor is still guiding.

Except now out of necessity and propriety the greetings have changed:

Uncle Todd has become Coach Bowles.

“That part” Jordan Young says “was a little odd.”

Young is an undrafted rookie linebacker out of Old Dominion with understandably long odds of making the active roster for a team with Super Bowl aspirations. He recognizes his best chance could be to impress on special teams and he knows that a spot on the practice squad would be a victory of sorts.

That’s the kind of perspective you pick up when your father was a UPI All-Rookie selection for the Colts in 1985 and his college roommate went on to become head coach of the Jets and now the Bucs.

Anthony Young and Todd Bowles were in the secondary together at Temple University for head coach Bruce Arians in the 1980s and remained close for decades to come.

Young was the more valued player coming out of college getting taken in the third round in 1985 while Bowles went the undrafted route in 1986. Young’s career ended tragically with a spinal injury in his second preseason while the unheralded Bowles went on to play eight seasons in the NFL.

“I’ve told this to Todd. I’ve said ‘Jordan is you when you were (24).’ They are the spitting images of each other at that age” Anthony Young said. “I see Todd in Jordan in the way he acts the things he says. Personality-wise they are pretty much the same guy. Go to bed early get up and work.

“When Todd was coming out his mentality was that he would give the NFL his best shot but he would not beat his head against the wall. He either made it or he didn’t. He wasn’t going to hang around if it didn’t work out. That’s what I’ve tried to tell all my boys.”

That’s the sort of clear-eyed view of football that Jordan Young has gotten from his father and Bowles — and Arians for that matter — as he’s plotted his life course. He was a starting quarterback in high school and had some minor college offers to play the position but recognized his best chance to play professionally was on defense so he went to Old Dominion to learn to be a linebacker.

He got his undergraduate degree in 3 ½ years and could have left in 2020 when Old Dominion cancelled the season due to the pandemic but opted for a second redshirt season and got his Master’s in sports management. He ended up leaving as the school’s all-time leading tackler.

So is there a whiff of nepotism for an undrafted college player from a smaller school to land on Tampa Bay’s roster in 2022? Who knows and who cares? The assistant coaches jokingly refer to him as “the nephew” when they pass in the hallways and he’s spent time at the Bowles house in Tampa this summer. But Young understands the harshness of this business will eventually prevail.

“You always hear people say this game can be taken away from you in an instant and my dad lived through that” said Young whose two younger brothers play at Rutgers.

“I wouldn’t say he’s lived his dream through us but I think he gets a lot of joy out of seeing the happy and positive results we’ve had. And he’s made sure that we understand the opportunities we’ve gotten and how that can help us in the future. I don’t take any of this for granted.”

It took Anthony Young a while to rediscover his footing after football was no longer an option. He spent 30 days in the hospital with infections after neck surgery then wore a halo and neck braces for months afterward.

After Bowles began to establish himself as a starter at free safety in Washington Young moved in with him in suburban Virginia and enjoyed the NFL life vicariously for a couple of years.

Eventually he took a job with Pfizer Pharmaceuticals to be nearer his future wife in Philadelphia but continued to visit Bowles and Arians annually during training camps. And while he encouraged Jordan to seek advice from his friends it was always with the big picture in mind.

“I refused to let him talk about the NFL as a dream. I didn’t want the boys to pigeonhole themselves in an NFL-or-bust way” Anthony Young said. “Because for me that was the reality. It was the NFL or the Army. I didn’t have a lot of options.

“I didn’t want my kids going to Career Day at school and saying it was their dream to play in the NFL. I wanted them to get degrees and have options.”

So what about now? What about the chances of making the Bucs roster in 2022?

“The deal we made was get your two degrees and then you can do whatever you want” Anthony Young said. “Most guys talk about a degree being Plan B if football doesn’t work out? For Jordan his degrees were Plan A and the NFL was Plan B. So now he’s got his chance at making Plan B work.”

The bill would provide “$52 billion in subsidies and additional tax credits” to companies that manufacture chips in the US reported The New York Times. Another $200 billion is being allocated for scientific research especially in artificial intelligence and other novel technologies.

In a rare show of unity the bill was passed with the help of some Republican lawmakers despite their party’s general position on subsidies. Many republicans opposed the bill on this principle while some democrats like Bernie Sanders opposed the extension of what he called “welfare” to corporations in a time of inflation.

Why has this bill been passed now?

As per a report in The New York Times it was a result of many factors coming together a major one being the push for it by Chuck Schumer the leader of the Democratic Party in the Senate or the upper house of the US parliament or Congress. He had been attempting to persuade a few Republicans about the need for this legislation since at least 2019 he said. There was also lobbying by some chip manufacturers.

Last year a global shortage of semiconductors or chips led to the recognition that the US needed its own substantial manufacturing. And since 2020 the growing use of devices like laptops in homes has further increased demand. At the moment about 75% of the world’s reliance on semiconductors is met by East Asia reported Forbes. In particular Taiwan and South Korea’s Samsung have been at the helm of manufacturing them but China has been upping production as well.

There is also a nationalistic argument here with the US pointing to dependence on China as a cause for worry. The bill’s summary said: “Only 12% of chips are currently manufactured domestically compared to 37% in the 1990s and many foreign competitors including China are investing heavily to dominate the industry.”

US President Joe Biden who will soon sign the bill into law said in a statement: “it will strengthen our national security by making us less dependent on foreign sources of semiconductors” additionally referring to maintaining “US leadership in industries”. The statement further said the bill “will make cars cheaper appliances cheaper and computers cheaper. It will lower the costs of every day goods.”

Why are semiconductors or chips so important?

They are instrumental in running most electronic devices used in our daily lives. Made from materials like silicon that “semi-conduct” electricity the chips are used in the form of data-storing memory chips or logic chips that run programs and act as the “brains” of a device. The manufacturing of chips requires a lot of precision as well as investment. Additionally they need very particular conditions where even small disturbances around or inside the manufacturing unit can interfere with production.

At the time of the shortage last year Samsung had warned of a “serious imbalance” in supply and demand globally leading to a shortfall in the production of electronic goods. A Bloomberg report said that some broadband providers were facing delays of more than a year when ordering internet routers. Apple said that supply constraints were affecting sales of iPads and Macbooks leading to billions of dollars lost in revenue.

What has China’s response been?

One provision in the bill prohibits any semiconductor company that receives financial assistance through the newly passed CHIPS bill from supporting the manufacture of advanced chips in China the AP reported. Before the bill was passed Zhao Lijian a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said that the US “should not put in place obstacles for normal science technology and people-to-people exchanges and cooperation”.

China’s state-run media organisations like the China Daily and Global Times criticised the provision that would punish US companies for dealing with China and accused it of being the “latest representation of Washington’s bid to exclude China from the global supply chains.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY2hpcHMtYWN0LWNvdWxkLWJlLWEtYmlnLXN0ZXAtdG93YXJkLXJlc29sdmluZy1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLWNyaXNpcy1ob2xkaW5nLWJhY2stbmV4dC1nZW4tY29uc29sZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CHIPS Act Could Be a Big Step Toward Resolving Semiconductor Crisis Holding Back Next-Gen Consoles,"The $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act has been passed by Congress and very well may be a big step towards resolving the semiconductor crisis holding back next-gen consoles and other devices.

As reported by The Verge the CHIPS and Science Act passed in a 243-187 vote on Thursday July 28 and it includes $52 billion in subsidies to ""encourage chip manufacturers to build out semiconductor fabrication plants or 'fabs' in the U.S.""

The House and Senate had been debating this issue for months and its passing is great news for companies like Intel who recently delayed its groundbreaking ceremony for its $20 billion chip-making facilities in Ohio because of a lack of government funding.

""I congratulate Congress on voting to approve funding for the CHIPS Act"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said. ""This is a critical step to support the entire U.S. semiconductor industry and to help ensure continued American leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and R&D. Congress has done its part and now we are going to do ours. I'm excited to put shovels in the ground as Intel moves full speed ahead to start building in Ohio.""

Chip shortages have been a huge issue since the COVID-19 pandemic began and it has impacted the availability of next-gen consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X new desktop GPUs and more.

The CHIPS and Science Act also provides the ""Commerce Departement with $10 billion to award states and localities grants to build out 'regional technology hubs' across the country."" The National Science Foundation will also receive billions in funding to help with semiconductor manufacturing research and workforce development programs.

He can't do it without immigration reform.,"But those subsidies as well as new tax credits for the chip industry were finally sent to Biden’s desk in late July. Intel isn’t the only company that’s promised to supercharge U.S. projects once that money comes through — Samsung for example is suggesting it will expand its new $17 billion chip plant outside of Austin Texas to a nearly $200 billion investment. Lawmakers are already touting the subsidies as a key step toward an American renaissance in high-tech manufacturing.

Quietly however many of those same lawmakers — along with industry lobbyists and national security experts — fear all the chip subsidies in the world will fall flat without enough high-skilled STEM workers. And they accuse Congress of failing to seize multiple opportunities to address the problem.

STEM help wanted

In Columbus just miles from the Johnstown field where Intel is breaking ground most officials don’t mince words: The tech workers needed to staff two microchip factories let alone eight don’t exist in the region at the levels needed.

“We’re going to need a STEM workforce” admitted Jon Husted Ohio’s Republican lieutenant governor.

But Husted and others say they’re optimistic the network of higher ed institutions spread across Columbus — including Ohio State University and Columbus State Community College — can beef up the region’s workforce fast.

“I feel like we’re built for this” said David Harrison president of Columbus State Community College. He highlighted the repeated refrain from Intel officials that 70 percent of the 3000 jobs needed to fill the first two factories will be “technician-level” jobs requiring two-year associate degrees. “These are our jobs” Harrison said.

Harrison is anxious however over how quickly he and other leaders in higher ed are expected to convince thousands of students to sign up for the required STEM courses and join Intel after graduation. The first two factories are slated to be fully operational within three years and will need significant numbers of workers well before then. He said his university still lacks the requisite infrastructure for instruction on chip manufacturing — “we’re missing some wafer processing clean rooms those kinds of things” — and explained that funding recently provided by Intel and the National Science Foundation won’t be enough. Columbus State will need more support from Washington.

“I don’t know that there’s a great Plan B right now” said Harrison adding that the new facilities will run into “the tens of millions.”

A lack of native STEM talent isn’t unique to the Columbus area. Across the country particularly in regions where the chip industry is planning to relocate officials are fretting over a perceived lack of skilled technicians. In February the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation cited a shortage of skilled workers when announcing a six-month delay in the move-in date for their new plant in Arizona.

“Whether it’s a licensure program a two-year program or a Ph.D. at all levels there is a shortfall in high-tech STEM talent” said Phillips. The NSB member highlighted the “missing millions of people that are not going into STEM fields — that basically are shut out even beginning in K-12 because they’re not exposed in a way that attracts them to the field.”

Industry groups like the National Association of Manufacturers have long argued a two-pronged approach is necessary when it comes to staffing the high-tech sector: Reevaluating immigration policy while also investing heavily in workforce development

The abandoned House and Senate competitiveness bills both included provisions that would have enhanced federal support for STEM education and training. Among other things the House bill would have expanded Pell Grant eligibility to students pursuing career-training programs.

“We have for decades incentivized degree attainment and not necessarily skills attainment” said Robyn Boerstling NAM’s vice president of infrastructure innovation and human resources policy. “There are manufacturing jobs today that could be filled with six weeks of training or six months or six years; we need all of the above.”

But those provisions were scrapped after Senate leadership decided a conference between the two chambers on the bills was too unwieldy to reach agreement before the August recess.

Katie Spiker managing director of government affairs at National Skills Coalition said the abandoned Pell Grant expansion shows Congress “has not responded to worker needs in the way that we need them to.” Amid criticisms that the existing workforce development system is unwieldy and ineffective the decision to scrap new upgrades is a continuation of a trend of disinvesting in workers who hope to obtain the skills they need to meet employer demand.

“And it becomes an issue that only compounds itself over time” Spiker said. “As technology changes people need to change and evolve their skills.”

“If we’re not getting people skilled up now then we won’t have people that are going to be able to evolve and skill up into the next generation of manufacturing that we’ll do five years from now.”

Congress finally sent the smaller Chips and Science Act — which includes the chip subsidies and tax credits $200 million to develop a microchip workforce and a slate of R&D provisions — to the president’s desk in late July. The bill is expected to enhance the domestic STEM pool (at least on the margins). But it likely falls short of the generational investments many believe are needed.

“You could make some dent in it in six years” said Phillips. “But if you really want to solve the problem it’s closer to a 20-year investment. And the ability of this country to invest in anything for 20 years is not phenomenal.”

Immigration Arms Race

The microchip industry is in the midst of a global reshuffling that’s expected to last a better part of the decade — and the U.S. isn’t the only country rolling out the red carpet. Europe Canada Japan and other regions are also worried about their security and preparing sweeteners for microchip firms to set up shop in their borders. Cobbling together an effective STEM workforce in a short time frame will be key to persuading companies to choose America instead.

That will be challenging at the technician level which represents around 70 percent of workers in most microchip factories. But those jobs require only two-year degrees — and over a six-year period it’s possible a sustained education and recruitment effort can produce enough STEM workers to at least keep the lights on.

It’s a different story entirely for Ph.D.s and master’s degrees which take much longer to earn and which industry reps say make up a smaller but crucial component of a factory’s workforce.

Gabriela Cruz Thompson Intel Labs’ senior director of university research and collaborationsaid about 15 percent of factory workers must have doctorates or master’s degrees in fields such as material and electrical engineering computer science physics and chemistry. Students coming out of American universities with those degrees are largely foreign nationals — and increasingly they’re graduating without an immigration status that lets them work in the U.S. and with no clear pathway to achieving that status."

In this scene Sarah Goldberg’s Sally opens up to the proprietor of Beignets by Mitch about her career frustrations after her TV show falls apart. Emmy-nominated writer Duffy Boudreau breaks down the first scene of the episode’s running joke about the hipster “stoner oracle.”

“Mitch is this kind of oracle dude who runs a super popular hipster venue” Boudreau says. “People line up around the block to eat these desserts — but more importantly to get life advice from him.” While he gives sound guidance to Sally she still ignores everything he has to say. “Oftentimes the right answer is right in front of us and we know it but it’s not what we want to hear” Boudreau adds. “This theme of self-delusion is such an important part of the show and it is perfectly encapsulated [in the scenes with Mitch] where our characters are being real with themselves.”

Barry Courtesy of HBO

Actor Tom Allen plays Mitch the stoner owner of the beignet shop that has taken L.A. by storm. “We got super lucky” says Boudreau. “I think it’s a really hard role because it is so specific.” Mitch is a sounding board for Sally to air her grievances and he takes it all in. “The big note Bill gave him on the day [we shot the scene] was ‘Just don’t show any emotion at all’ ” Boudreau recalls of co-creator/star Hader’s direction. “It was all about the stance and it gave him this weird gravitas that was really funny.”

Barry Courtesy of HBO

Boudreau says that Sally played by Sarah Goldberg is the empathetic heart of the show. “Even when she’s being an asshole she’s right” he says. “She’s clearly the most talented person in [Gene Cousineau’s acting] class. She’s been successful at running her own show. She got into a little bad luck you know but for whatever other personality traits that she has that turn people off Sally is the most serious person in the show.”

Barry Courtesy of HBO

The Los Angeles-set Barry is at times a Hollywood satire but the city’s setting also gives the writers lots of room to explore L.A.’s fringes for its humor. “For us it’s the weird corners of L.A.” says Boudreau of where the writers find their inspiration. Beignets by Mitch was a chance to poke fun at L.A. food culture and the idiosyncratic people who populate the city’s urban sprawl.

Later in the episode Barry and NoHo Hank pay their own visits to Beignets by Mitch — and naturally neither of them takes Mitch’s advice either. “It was fun to have one character that met three of our main characters. That’s just not a normal part of the show” says Boudreau who notes that Sally and NoHo Hank have yet to interact across Barry‘s three seasons.

The 24-year-old man who has not been named by authorities was arrested by Australian Federal Police (AFP) and appeared in a Brisbane court Friday where he was charged with six counts related to computer offenses. He is accused of creating the Imminent Monitor remote access Trojan (RAT) when he was 15 which authorities say was sold to more than 14500 individuals across 128 countries.

According to the AFP Imminent Monitor was a cheap but powerful spyware tool that could be used to log keystrokes and take over a victim’s PC.

“Once the RAT was installed on a victim’s computer users could control a victim’s computer; steal their personal information or spy on them by turning on webcams and microphones on devices – all without their knowledge” the AFP said.

The tool was sold for about $25 and was advertised on hacking forums. It’s estimated that the creator made between $300000 and $400000 from selling the malware between 2013 and 2019 when it was taken down as part of a coordinated law enforcement campaign.

“Operation Cepheus”

According to the AFP Imminent Monitor “sparked a global law enforcement operation” called Operation Cepheus that included more than a dozen European law enforcement agencies and the FBI.

Law enforcement authorities carried out 85 search warrants globally seizing 434 devices and arresting 13 people who used the RAT for criminal means.

Australian police said they were made aware of Imminent Monitor in 2017 by the FBI and researchers at Palo Alto Networks which noticed “a definite preference for Australian hosting” while examining the RAT.

The AFP said it subsequently identified more than 200 individuals in Australia who bought the spyware 14% of whom were issued court orders related to domestic violence. They have also identified 44 victims in the country.

Imminent Monitor could be installed on a victim’s device in a number of ways including phishing.

“We most often observe RATs employed illicitly by financially-motivated actors or for data theft… It’s unlikely a coincidence that such a tool might be employed against Intimate Partner Violence victims” Palo Alto researchers said in a write-up following the arrest.

Although the AFP didn’t identify the arrested individual it said authorities conducted two search warrants in 2019 at the man’s home which at the time was in Brisbane.

“Investigators seized a number of devices including a custom-built computer containing code consistent with the development and use of the RAT” the AFP said.

“These types of malware are so nefarious because [they] can provide an offender virtual access to a victim’s bedroom or home without their knowledge’’ said Chris Goldsmid the head of AFP’s cybercrime operations. “Unfortunately there are criminals who not only use these tools to steal personal information for financial gain but also for very intrusive and despicable crimes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzk1NDc5LWJyaXNiYW5lLW1hbi1hcnJlc3RlZC1kaXN0cmlidXRpbmctc3B5d2FyZS10aG91c2FuZHMtY3liZXItY3JpbWluYWxzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brisbane man arrested for distributing spyware to thousands of cyber criminals since age 15,"What just happened? An Australian man was arrested for allegedly creating and distributing a hacking tool to thousands of cyber criminals worldwide. The 24-year-old hacker is charged with creating and selling a remote access trojan designed to steal personal information and spy on unsuspecting targets. The virus creator made over $300000 selling the tool most of which appears to have been used on take-out and delivery items since age 15.

Jacob Wayne John Keen 24 was arrested for allegedly selling a trojan virus named Imminent Monitor to cyber criminals domestic violence perpetrators among others from as many as 128 different countries. The tool allowed users to target unsuspecting victims to steal their personal data track information entered into documents and spy on them using the target's webcams and microphones.

The arrest was made following a global sting operation that was set in motion in 2017. The worldwide effort named Operation Cephus was started after the Australian Federal Police was provided with suspicious information from the FBI and Palo Alto Networks.

Keen allegedly created and began distributing the tool for $35 per user at age 15 while living in his mother's rental unit. Proceeds from the tool totaled between $300000 and $400000 until it was finally shut down in 2019. The shutdown followed the execution of several AFP-led search warrants that seized hardware and assets found to contain evidence pointing to the RAT's development. Keen's recent arrest was based on additional evidence provided to AFP from participating law enforcement agencies around the world.

According to AFP's reports the tool was used to spy on tens of thousands of victims globally and at least 200 of the tool's buyers came directly from Australia. A high number of those Australian-based suspects were also discovered to have been involved in previous domestic violence calls a correlation that sheds some light on what kind of criminals leveraged the nefarious tool. Investigations into other actors that may have used the tool are still ongoing.

Evidence analyzed by authorities revealed that most of the proceeds from the hacking tool were used to buy takeaway food over the course of Keen's 9+ year involvement. He was met with six charges earlier this month and is scheduled to appear in court sometime in August. It also appears that Keen's mother 42 may have been aware of and benefitted from the criminal activities. She was also charged with dealing in and benefitting from sales of the invasive tool.

Some eighteen months ago the company once known as WarnerMedia announced that it was going to increase its investment in kids and family content tenfold. At the time then-C.E.O. Jason Kilar under the auspices of AT&T and John Stankey was planning to order more than 3000 episodes and films for the family division of HBO Max and the Cartoon Network which was set to become a cornerstone brand for the streaming service. This was part of a broader directional recognition that streaming services needed to provide bundled value to all members of a family unit. In 2019 after all with Disney+’s launch on the horizon Netflix doubled down on its own family and children’s programming which was being watched by about 60 percent of the platform’s global audience. Kilar was determined to fight for market share.

Ever since WarnerMedia and Discovery combined to create Warner Bros. Discovery however C.E.O. David Zaslav has treated many of Kilar’s decisions as mere suggestions or simply irritants as he seeks to manage Wall Street’s expectations by finding $3 billion in synergies across the company simultaneously growing its streaming ambitions while paying down its staggering debt. CNN+ was an early casualty. As my partner Matt Belloni has noted even J.J. Abrams is susceptible to Zaz’s cost-cutting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL25hbmN5LWRyZXctY3ctc3RlcHMtYXdheS1vcmlnaW5hbC1zdG9yeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How CW's Nancy Drew Steps Away from the Original Story,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL25hbmN5LWRyZXctY3ctc3RlcHMtYXdheS1vcmlnaW5hbC1zdG9yeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

When Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt gave his State of the City address on July 14 he wanted to get people talking.

The Thunder needing a new OKC arena in the coming years is certainly a conversation starter on social media. Should the city build a new arena and lease it to the Thunder much like the current Paycom Center? Should the team’s wealthy owners leverage their franchise’s financial success to build a private arena? What would a new OKC arena funded partially by public dollars and partially by private investment look like? Will team owners consider selling to investors in another city if a new arena is not built? And exactly how valuable is a professional sports franchise overall — to a city and to its owners?

Even as very few details are known about the proposed new OKC arena project people are predictably taking hard stances on the matter. The value of having an NBA team in the city can be hard to understate. While the value of an arena will be stated — especially if voters are asked to approve the use of tax dollars — we just don’t know what the new OKC arena proposal will be or how we will get there at this point.

It must be noted too that the Paycom Center will be in use for some years after a decision is made. Projects like these are not funded and built overnight and the more robust conversation this community has about its major public investments the better. So let the shouting continue in the comments below but try to be respectful!

This is what could be next for the payments giant,"Business: PayPal is a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide. The company operates a global two-sided network that connects merchants and consumers with 426 million active accounts (392 million consumer active accounts and 34 million merchant active accounts) across more than 200 markets. They generate revenue primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for their customers and other payment-related services that are typically based on the volume of activity processed on their payments platform.

Activist Commentary: Elliott is a very successful and astute activist investor particularly in the technology sector. The team includes analysts from leading tech private equity firms engineers and operating partners. When evaluating an investment Elliott also hires specialty and general management consultants expert cost analysts and industry specialists. The firm often watches companies for many years before investing and it has an extensive stable of impressive board candidates.

PayPal has a strong business with its core checkout business (representing approximately 80% of its revenue) growing at least in line with peers and expected to continue to grow as e-commerce expands. In 2013 PayPal acquired Braintree a more technologically savvy payment provider allowing customers to customize their shopping carts and integrate them with their existing platforms. This division represents approximately 10% of the company's revenue but it could grow at over 20% per year. PayPal also owns Venmo which represents approximately 5% of its revenue but could also grow at 20% per year.

Elliott has been making big investments in technology growth companies that have been decimated by the markets in the past year and this is no exception. PayPal is down more than 70% from closing as high as $308.53 just over a year ago. While that is primarily due to a sell-off in growth stocks there is an opportunity here to improve margins as the company's sales marketing research and development expense levels are higher compared to those of its peers — even double the levels at some of those companies. However Elliott is more of a strategic activist than an operational activist and has had its best activist successes through encouraging M&A at its portfolio companies. Elliott has had its best returns buying portfolio companies fixing them and selling them. However at a $99 billion market cap PayPal is likely too big for them to do that even with a partner. A more likely scenario is that the firm encourages PayPal to explore strategic alternatives around Venmo or Braintree or acquire other companies that would have synergies with PayPal's core business.

One such possibility would be Pinterest . Last year there were rumors that PayPal was interested in making a bid for Pinterest. Moreover one of the reasons why potential suitors have not historically pursued Pinterest is because of the perception that its founder and longtime CEO Ben Silbermann would not sell. However he recently lightened his grip on the company by handing over the CEO role which could be an indication that he is willing to listen to offers. Even more noteworthy Elliott has an approximately 9% (or $1 billion+) investment in Pinterest. So encouraging PayPal to acquire Pinterest could be a win-win situation for Elliott.

Elliott has not disclosed the size of its position but based on its history we would expect it to be between 1% and 2% primarily in swaps and other derivatives which do not have the same disclosure requirements as common stock.

When it comes to personal finance apps there's debate about whether the app from PayPal Holdings (PYPL 1.00%) is better than Cash App from Block (SQ 2.90%) or vice versa. They both certainly have their supporters.

However personal preferences for PayPal or Cash App are anecdotal and investors should avoid anecdotes relying instead on more general consumer trends. That's why watching overall app downloads is useful. And right now PayPal -- not Cash App -- is leading the way in downloads by a wide margin.

Why PayPal is winning global downloads

Third-party analytics company Apptopia recently released a list of the top finance and banking apps by downloads in the first half of 2022. At the top of the list was PayPal with 49 million downloads. Cash App was a distant fourth place with only 35 million global downloads.

Some investors might be surprised by this data considering PayPal appears to be struggling to gain more users. At the end of the first quarter of 2022 it had 429 million active accounts which is massive. But it only expects to add 10 million net new accounts for 2022 as a whole. This forecast is down from the start of the year when it was expecting to add 15 million to 20 million net new accounts in 2022.

Lowering its active account guidance is one of the reasons PayPal stock has fallen over 70% from its high. Investors fear its growth is hitting the ceiling. However Apptopia's data is encouraging. Owning the most-downloaded fintech app in the world certainly counts for something.

PayPal investors should be encouraged. However Block investors shouldn't be discouraged at all because there's a simple reason why PayPal is trouncing Cash App in the global competition: Cash App isn't a global app. Roughly 99% of Cash App downloads come from U.S. users. And according to the same Apptopia report Cash App is dominating the U.S. market.

Cash App has enjoyed 34 million downloads in the U.S. so far in 2022. This is twice as many as PayPal in second place.

Simply put PayPal is beating Cash App in global downloads because Cash App has barely started to expand internationally. Block management plans to remedy this soon which could greatly narrow the download gap between these two apps.

However even with Block's looming international expansion I still believe PayPal is a great stock to buy now. Here's why.

What the market is forgetting about PayPal

PayPal's growth is admittedly slowing. For perspective it had 9.8 million net new accounts in the fourth quarter of 2021 alone which is about what it expects to add in all of 2022. However the company is still growing accounts and those accounts are increasingly more active.

In Q1 trailing-12-month transactions per active PayPal account hit an all-time high of 47 -- up 11% year over year and up 3.5% from the fourth quarter. In other words people are using PayPal's services more frequently and that's a good sign for the health of the business.

PayPal takes a small percentage of transactions. And as accounts and transactions grow this incremental revenue helps grow the company's free cash flow (FCF). As of Q1 its FCF margin was 16%. In other words for every $100 of revenue PayPal had $16 in FCF.

PayPal expects $5 billion in FCF in 2022 and has already generated over $1 billion of this. Now it's the duty of PayPal's management to responsibly allocate this money.

PayPal's management has historically done two things. First it acquires other companies like when it acquired Honey for $4 billion in January 2020. Second it repurchases shares to increase shareholder value. And this is where things could get interesting for PayPal over the next year in my opinion.

As already mentioned PayPal's stock is down more than 70% from its high. From 2019 through 2021 management used over $6 billion to repurchase shares. The average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio during this time was a sky-high 37.

With a P/S ratio of just 3.7 PayPal now trades at its cheapest valuation ever. In other words management will be able to buy back more shares than it otherwise could if valuations were still high.

For traders PayPal's 70% drop is a problem. However it's a blessing in disguise for buy-and-hold investors. As we've seen metrics like downloads and transactions per user suggest the business is still very healthy. And a healthy business generates tons of cash.

PayPal's repurchasing power will go farther now with the stock trading at a cheaper valuation. I expect PayPal's management will recognize this and accelerate its repurchases in the coming year. And if it does this will deliver a welcome boost to intrinsic shareholder value for those willing to hold through this downturn.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvaW5kb25lc2lhLWJsb2Nrcy15YWhvby1wYXlwYWwtZ2FtaW5nLXdlYnNpdGVzLW92ZXItbGljZW5jZS1icmVhY2hlcy0yMDIyLTA3LTMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indonesia blocks Yahoo Paypal gaming websites over licence breaches,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/technology/indonesia-blocks-yahoo-paypal-gaming-websites-over-licence-breaches-2022-07-30/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvaW5kb25lc2lhLWJsb2Nrcy15YWhvby1wYXlwYWwtZ2FtaW5nLXdlYnNpdGVzLW92ZXItbGljZW5jZS1icmVhY2hlcy0yMDIyLTA3LTMwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzcvMzAvMjMyODUwOTEvaW5kb25lc2lhLWJhbnMtYWNjZXNzLXN0ZWFtLWVwaWMtZ2FtZXMtcGF5cGFsLXlhaG9v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indonesia bans access to Steam Epic Games PayPal and more,"The Indonesian government has blocked access to a range of online services including Steam Epic Games PayPal and Yahoo after the companies failed to comply with a new requirement related to the country’s restrictive content moderation laws as reported earlier by Reuters.

In line with the rules companies deemed “Private Electronic System Providers” must register with the government’s database to operate in the country or otherwise face a nationwide ban. Indonesia gave companies until July 27th to comply and has since banned those that haven’t.

The requirement is part of an overarching law called MR5

The requirement is part of an overarching law called MR5 which was first introduced in 2020. As noted by Reuters the laws give the Indonesian government the ability to obtain data about specific users as well as coerce companies into removing content that “disturbs public order” or is considered illegal. Platforms have four hours to take action on “urgent” removal requests or 24 hours in the case of any other content.

A 2021 report from the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) calls Indonesia’s laws “invasive of human rights” as it puts platforms at the mercy of the Indonesian government which will ban them if not in compliance with local laws. Earlier this month the EFF penned a letter to the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information (Kominfo) urging the government to repeal its “invasive content moderation rules.”

The ban has left users in Indonesia stuck without the ability to process payments or even play certain games. As pointed out by Daniel Ahmad a senior analyst at Niko Partners some other popular games and services affected by the ban include Origin DOTA 2 and Counter-Strike. Meanwhile Apple Microsoft Google Amazon TikTok Twitter Netflix and Spotify registered for a license last week and all remain available.

According to Reuters Kominfo general director Semuel Abrijani Pangerapan says the country will give users access to PayPal for five days starting July 31st. Pangerapan adds that the agency hasn’t heard from PayPal and that he hopes this brief window provides “enough time for users to migrate get their money and find other services.” Valve is reportedly in the process of registering with the Indonesian database which will unblock Steam DOTA 2 and Counter-Strike.

Pangerapan notes that the ban will be lifted once the companies register with the country’s database. It’s unclear when these services will come back online or if they’ll register with the Indonesian database. PayPal Epic Games and Valve didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment."

HARRISON N.Y. — Executives at PepsiCo announced the launch of a new beverage called Pepsi Boneless which they hope will break through the discerning Gen Z consumer demographic confirmed disturbed sources in attendance at a press conference held yesterday by the industry giant.

“Here at PepsiCo we’re always trying to evolve along with our consumers” said PepsiCo Vice President Glenn Anderson moments before product launch. “We’ve listened to thousands of focus groups and they’re all saying the same thing. The message of the American public is loud and clear: no bones! Bones are inedible they’re unnecessary and they remind you of little skeletons. They are spooky and they belong in the graveyard. That’s why we’re delighted to bring you a thrilling new alternative in the soft drink market: Pepsi Boneless!”

Although PepsiCo claims to have spent millions on research and development many have reacted to the news with confusion and unease.

“It’s fucking gross” explained Zach Derwin a 35-year-old electrician who describes himself as a frequent Pepsi drinker. “Boneless chicken wings are one thing but this announcement is just freaking me out. Literally no one was asking for this. Not only will I never try Pepsi Boneless but it has me thinking that I don’t want to drink any Pepsi products anymore. Did the FDA force them to do this or something? I mean are they saying that regular Pepsi has bones in it? This might be just the sign I need to make the switch to Coca-Cola products. Always wanted to try their new limited edition Oven-Roasted Coke.”

Despite these vocal concerns from consumers retail experts expect other companies to make similar announcements in the coming months.

“This is going to be like the Flamin’ Hot trend all over again” noted retail analyst Alana Robinson. “You’re going to see all of the major snack and beverage companies jumping on the boneless bandwagon to try and cash in on this exciting new market craze. For example I’ve already heard that this fall we’ll be seeing the release of Oscar Meyer Boneless Hot Dogs and Boneless Tropical Skittles. Dasani supposedly has something in the works too.”

As of press time PepsiCo announced an expansion to their breakfast offerings with Hairless Quaker Oats which is expected to pair well with their new beverage line called 2% Pepsi.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc21vaW5lc3JlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RtcjEyNDU4ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samuel H.

He underwent a very complicated 12-hour rectal and liver surgery at the Mayo Clinic on February 15 2022. Sam’s surgery was considered a success by his surgeons but unfortunately the cancer returned aggressively to his liver 6 weeks following his surgery. Sam also received counsel from MD Anderson Cancer Hospital in Houston Texas. The family thanks all of doctors nurses and those who prayed for Sam provided meals made visits and/or sent messages and cards. A special thanks to the staff of Every Step Hospice who made Sam’s last days as comfortable as possible. Sam was born December 12 1992 in Overland Park Kansas to his parents John and Susan. Sam grew up in Clive Iowa and graduated from Waukee High School in 2011. He studied agronomy and marketing at Iowa State University and graduated with a B.S. in 2015. Upon graduation Sam began his career at John Deere with stints in Augusta GA Orlando FL Columbus OH and Urbandale IA. In 2017 Sam joined start-up Growers Edge in Johnston IA where he worked until he took his dream job with PepsiCo in 2021. Prior to his passing Sam said “I have no regrets!” Sam’s disposition was welcoming kind and empathetic which explains the large volume of friendships he created. Sam loved all sporting events but the ISU Cyclones KC Chiefs and KC Royals hold a special place in his heart. Sam’s passion for these teams was unsurpassed! Sam was joined in marriage to the love of his life Mackenzie (“Mac”) Leatherman on July 24 2022 at a very small intimate family wedding. Sam is survived by his wife Mackenzie Bunz (Des Moines) father John Bunz (Des Moines) mother Susan Sabin and her husband Brad Sabin (Clear Lake) and sisters Ellen Bunz (Minneapolis) and Emma Bunz (Des Moines). Sam is also survived by grandparents Claus and Judith Bunz and Richard and Kathy Hansen.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Intel SpaceX Dell and Philip Morris are among dozens of US companies listed in a leaked database of companies that have gotten a license to use FindFace a facial recognition tool developed by the Russian company NTech Lab which has been recently financed by Kremlin-backed funds.

The NTech Lab user list which was shared with Insider by an anonymous source includes more than 1100 entries with businesses and government agencies from more than 60 countries.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

When Insider contacted NTech Lab for comment and provided a sample of the user list a spokesperson confirmed that the sample contained ""a few current clients"" as well as ""companies and organizations that have tested our video analytics software for various purposes"" like competitors doing market research business partners and resellers that sell NTech Lab software to other parties. Some of these parties may have gotten a FindFace license but never paid for it.

Although it's been speculated that NTech Lab — which rose to prominence in 2015 when it won the now-shuttered MegaFace Benchmark challenge a facial recognition accuracy test — may have American users it's never been confirmed.

The leaked user list provides the most detailed insight to date on how the secretive facial recognition company — which only recognizes a handful of clients and users publicly — has provided licenses to major US companies. More widely the list shows that NTech Lab has given licenses to companies police and military agencies around the world and powers important nodes of Russia's state surveillance infrastructure.

Although the American companies that responded for comment and confirmed use — Philip Morris CasinoSoft and MutualLink — said that they last used FindFace several years ago the leaked user list also includes almost all of the current clients that NTech Lab names on their website and many more.

An NTech Lab spokesperson told Insider that despite the leak ""There are no potential threats to our customers and biometric data.""

""Our software is functioning normally without any sign of hackers attack"" the spokesperson said. ""Therefore we are investigating the information about a possible leak based on your letter and if it is confirmed we will conduct [a] comprehensive security audit of our infrastructure and take necessary steps immediately.""

The tobacco company Philip Morris International known for selling Marlboro and several other cigarette brands confirmed to Insider that it had used FindFace.

David Fraser a spokesperson for the company said that Philip Morris had considered using FindFace in 2017 and 2018 ""as a potential vendor for our age-verification program."" Fraser added that the company ""tested the software for a month but ultimately we did not proceed and selected an alternate vendor.""

Philip Morris said in a blog that it uses ""age-verification technology"" to verify users who try to buy a IQOS VEEV a vape only available in a few countries. The website for the vape doesn't reference using facial recognition for age verification. (It asks people to upload a government-issued ID so that ""name and date of birth"" can be referenced ""against government provided databases."")

Despite being named on the leaked user list Intel Dell and Nokia denied having used or experimented with FindFace. The NTech Lab spokesperson noted that it's very possible that some companies on the user list received a license but never used it or ran a search.

Many other US companies were included in the user list but did not respond for comment when contacted by Insider. Some of these companies include Starlink a satellite-focused subsidiary of SpaceX as well as Honeywell and Bosch. Several facial recognition vendors — such as Genetec NEC and Dataworks Plus — were also included in the user list.

Related stories

The companies CasinoSoft which sells compliance software to casino and gaming companies and MutualLink which sells technology for surveillance and responding to emergencies also confirmed that they tried FindFace.

""We had looked at using it at one time and even signed up to use it"" Matt Montano a partner at CasinoSoft told Insider. ""We never did actively perform an integration with their product nor deploy any of their code. ""

Mark Hatten CEO of MutualLink told Insider that a now-retired innovation team leader for the company investigated facial recognition technology ""in 2016 and 2017."" But he said that the company ""never pursued any innovation or development in the facial recognition area.""

Many other small US-based companies were also included in the leaked user list such as Tradle Vision Logic S.I. Business Solutions Barter Security and Novotrax.

There are private companies from more than 60 countries in the Ntech Lab leak including the US Canada Mexico the United Kingdom the United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabia China Myanmar India and Australia.

Two of NTech Lab's most recent investors are investment funds that are financed by the Russian government. The Kremlin-funded Russian Foundation for Technological Development gave the company a $1.3 million grant in 2021. In 2020 the company raised a cumulative $15 million from the Russian Direct Investment Fund which is financed by the Russian government and Mubadala a state-run investment fund run in the United Arab Emirates.

In light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine the US and dozens of other countries have imposed sanctions on major Russian banks major state-owned businesses in Russia and top Russian officials. These sanctions seemingly do not apply to NTech Lab which despite benefitting from money from state-owned investment funds is privately run by individuals who don't have positions in the Russian government.

Most of the entries on the leaked NTech Lab user list are police and military agencies in other countries including Interpol the Brazilian Federal Police and the Royal Thai Army. There are also many public institutions in Russia on the user list like the Russian Federal Security Service the Federal Penitentiary System as well as several schools and metro systems. There are also at least 20 entities that are based in Ukraine including businesses in areas like Kyiv Square.

A handful of entries on the user list correspond to individuals. There's also an entry for Russian billionaire Dmitry Itskov which included his email address.

When reached for comment by Insider Itskov said that he was likely on the user list because some of his employees requested a trial license for FindFace a few years ago.

""I recall around 2016 the software engineers from one of my companies looked at their SDK in light of a payments software project but the development never happened due to the privacy concerns of our clients"" Itskov said.

NTech Lab claims that FindFace can do facial recognition object recognition license plate recognition and detection of features (such as ""gender age emotions glasses face mask beard and many others""). The company advertises several use cases on its website including identifying ""intruders in a crowd"" from custom watch lists document verification airport security and regulating access to buildings

There are some limitations to the leaked user list. The user list also does not appear to include all of NTech Lab's customers. A few of the paying clients mentioned on its website like MasterTek and Bitrix24 are not listed in the data.

The NTech Lab spokesperson declined to specify if the leaked data represents a specific subset of companies and agencies that got a FindFace license in the past or currently have one. However the spokesperson noted that it has about 300 active clients in more than 20 countries. (On its website NTech Lab says that it has more than 1000 ""partners and customers."")

The leaked user list also contained encryption keys assigned to specific clients which NTech Lab spokesperson said was a ""key to use your license.""

Here's what he likes for safety

By now quite a few celebrities – including Elon Musk and Suze Orman – have predicted that a recession would hit the U.S. economy.

Peter Schiff CEO and chief global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital is the latest expert to sound the alarm.

“[T]he U.S. economy has been in recession all year” he wrote in a tweet on Thursday.

“With yesterday's rate hike more layoffs and inflation continuing to erode purchasing power the recession will deepen in Q3. In fact Q2 GDP will likely be revised even lower.”

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ advance estimate U.S. GDP fell at an annual rate of 0.9% in Q2.

Schiff also knows a thing or two about preparing for a downturn. In fact we can clearly see that theme in Euro Pacific Asset Management’s latest 13F filing with the Securities Exchange Commission.

There’s a ‘perfect storm’ brewing in the multifamily housing market — here are 3 of the easiest ways to take advantage

Gold

Schiff has long been a fan of the yellow metal.

“The problem with the dollar is it has no intrinsic value” he once said. “Gold will store its value and you'll always be able to buy more food with your gold.""

As always he’s putting his money where his mouth is.

As of Mar. 31 Euro Pacific Asset Management held 1.645 million shares of Barrick Gold (GOLD) 335740 shares of Newmont (NEM) and 409155 shares of Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM).

In fact the three gold mining giants were the firm’s top three holdings representing 8.0% 5.4% and 5.0% of its portfolio respectively.

Gold can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money and its safe-haven status means demand typically increases during times of uncertainty.

If gold prices go up miners like Newmont Barrick and Agnico will likely enjoy bigger profits.

Recession-proof income stocks

Dividend stocks offer investors a great way to earn a passive income stream but some can also be used as a hedge against recessions.

Case in point: The fourth-largest holding at Euro Pacific is cigarette giant British American Tobacco (BTI) accounting for 4.6% of the portfolio.

The maker of Kent and Dunhill cigarettes offers an attractive annual yield of 7%.

Schiff’s fund also owns over 160000 shares of Philip Morris International (PM) another tobacco king with a dividend yield of 5.2%. The Marlboro cigarette producer is Euro Pacific’s ninth-largest holding with a portfolio weighting of 3.1%.

Story continues

The demand for cigarettes is highly inelastic meaning large price changes only induce small changes in demand — and that demand is largely immune to economic shocks.

If you’re comfortable with investing in so-called sin stocks British American and Philip Morris might be worth researching further.

Agriculture

When it comes to playing defense there’s one recession-proof sector that shouldn’t be overlooked: agriculture.

It’s simple. Whatever happens people still need to eat.

Schiff doesn’t talk about agriculture as much as precious metals but Euro Pacific does own 142052 shares of fertilizer producer Nutrien (NTR).

As one of the world’s largest providers of crop inputs and services Nutrien is positioned solidly even if the economy enters a major downturn. In Q1 the company generated record net earnings of $1.4 billion.

Nutrien shares are up about 10% in 2022 in stark contrast to the S&P 500’s double-digit decline year-to-date.

Given the uncertainties facing the U.S. economy investing in agriculture could give risk-averse investors a peace of mind.

But that could be a very big mistake – leading to the type of trade dispute Australia fought for years against Big Tobacco over plain packaging laws.

The gas trigger (officially the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism) was created by the Turnbull government in 2017 when there were fears of a gas shortage in eastern Australia.

It allows the federal resources minister to direct gas exporters to limit their gas exports or find new sources of gas to meet domestic demand instead of exporting gas overseas.

Read more: Why did gas prices go from $10 a gigajoule to $800 a gigajoule? An expert on the energy crisis engulfing Australia

To trigger the mechanism however requires predictions of insufficient supply not just higher prices. It is therefore useless for dealing with the sort of short-term issues besetting eastern Australian gas markets and has never been triggered.

The mechanism had been due to expire at the end of 2022. It was meant to be a temporary measure not a permanent crutch in lieu of more sustainable solutions. But the government is keen to keep it. Resources Minister Madeleine King said it will be extended to 2030.

But should it?

There’s no doubt the trigger gives the government some leverage over the gas industry in much the same way that pointing a gun at someone gets their attention.

Actually pulling the trigger however is a different matter. It may have serious unintended consequences potentially breaching Australia’s commitments under various trade and investment treaties.

How the gas trigger works

An example of the extra regulatory leverage the gas trigger has given the federal government is its 2021 agreement with three major east-coast liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants: Australia Pacific LNG Gladstone LNG and Queensland Curtis LNG.

Under this deal the suppliers promised not to sell uncontracted gas internationally without first offering equivalent volumes to the domestic market.

What would happen if the gas trigger was actually pulled?

Then the mechanism becomes an export control measure compelling gas companies to limit their exports or find new sources of gas to offset the shortfall.

In that circumstance foreign-owned gas companies could use free-trade agreements to take Australia to a notoriously expensive “investor-state dispute settlement” process to claim compensation for what is known as indirect expropriation.

Santos/AAP

What is indirect expropriation?

Simply put expropriation is any interference by governments with the rights and properties of foreign investors.

It can be direct such as outright seizure of investors’ properties or indirect through enactment of laws or regulations that interfere with investors’ capacity to generate revenue or do business.

Australia has signed several investment treaties and free-trade agreements that contain investor-state dispute settlement provisions. If the government pulls the gas trigger a foreign-owned gas company could seek compensation for interference with the company’s right to export gas to its overseas buyers.

That is a concern given Australia’s LNG sector is 95.7% owned by foreign investors according to the Australia Institute.

For example Malaysia’s Petronas and Korea’s KOGAS are major shareholders in Gladstone LNG.

These foreign companies have rights under international trade and investment rules multilateral agreements such as the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade agreement and bilateral free-trade agreements signed with Malaysia and Korea.

The results won’t be pleasant

Disputes involving indirect expropriation are expensive and time-consuming.

The classic example is Australia’s six-year defence of its tobacco plain-packaging laws against the global tobacco giant Philip Morris.

Read more: When even winning is losing. The surprising cost of defeating Philip Morris over plain packaging

Among other things Philip Morris claimed the labelling regulations indirectly expropriated its brand assets intellectual property and goodwill associated with its products. Australia eventually won the dispute but at a reported A$24 million cost along with internal expenditures.

Lukas Coch/AAP

The risk of foreign gas investors making indirect expropriation claims is quite real. They have invested in extracting Australian gas to meet demand in markets such as South Korea and Malaysia.

For example Santos the lead developer of the Gladstone LNG project signed a 20-year agreement with KOGAS in 2010 to supply 3.5 million tonnes a year of LNG. This amounts to 11% of Korea’s domestic LNG supply.

Electricity generators have already lodged claims for compensation over AEMO interventions in the energy market. We shouldn’t expect gas suppliers to do less.

So what now?

We need a better solution to provide affordable gas and electricity prices along with reliable supply.

Some experts have advocated for a Western Australian-style gas reservation model to be implemented nationally. This model requires gas producers to reserve supplies for the local market before other transactions.

It will take time to introduce the model nationally without also inviting expropriation claims. Existing supply contracts will need to be exempt – and these such as the Gladstone LNG contract to supply Korea are often decades long.

But as new contracts are signed the reservation model can eventually provide the benefits it now gives to West Australian consumers.

It’s not the short-term solution we’d all like. But it is a better solution than extending the gas trigger. The work to introduce it should begin now.

In an open letter to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob the group — comprising British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd JT International Bhd and Philip Morris (Malaysia) Bhd — said the illegal tobacco and vape market could ""explode"" if the proposed act comes into force.

""In Malaysia the illegal market for tobacco products is huge with estimates that almost 60% of cigarettes are sold illegally. The scale of the illegal tobacco trade in Malaysia should not be underestimated. There are many criminal syndicates that are sophisticated and can quickly adapt to any changes.

""Industry figures show that an outright ban would cause illicit trade to rise from 57.7% in May 2022 to as high as or more than 63.8% in 2020. This will lead to the government losing over RM5 billion in revenue from the tobacco industry"" it said.

The CMTM also cautioned that the impact of the proposed Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Act 2022 extends beyond those born in 2007 onwards towards the economy as a whole.

""The proposed generational endgame is punitive and punishes all. Businesses will experience difficulty in enforcing some of the provisions of the Act and in some cases compliance costs will also rise.""

As a result of these higher costs businesses will find it difficult to maintain their competitiveness in this challenging economy said the group.

""Some may be forced to close their businesses causing thousands to be retrenched. Meanwhile businesses may also have to cut costs to ensure over costs are under control"" it said adding that Malaysia's lustre among investors may be dimmed because of the Act.

""Tourists will also be affected because the enforcement powers under the Act are wide criminalising individuals including tourists and business owners.

The confederation also called the Bill an attack on personal freedoms.

""Adults are deemed to have the right to control themselves and no authority can revoke this right. The Consumer Protection Act 1999 was promulgated to give greater protection to consumers and the rights given by this Act cannot be terminated"" it said adding that Section 6 of the Act stipulated that its provisions will be in force despite attempts to limit them through contracts.

The CMTM also called the penalties for failing to comply with the proposed Act as ""cruel"".

""Our future generations will be subject to harsh enforcement and face the possibility of their vehicles and homes being searched their phones being checked and forced access to their personal data.

""More worrying is that the Act will provide wide-ranging enforcement powers such as to access personal data that requires users [to] give up their passwords; to open up bags; detaining and searching of vehicles; and forcibly entering homes to search and seize without warrants including body searches.

""Instead of creating a smoke-free generation Malaysia could instead create a new generation filled with criminals who are punished for buying or using a product that is legally allowed to others"" it said.

Finally the CMTM said the Bill would cause individuals born in 2007 onwards to be treated differently from those born before that.

""The future generation will not have a choice but to consent to identification card checks which contradicts the Personal Data Protection Act 2010.

""Working adults will have to hide their habit and use tobacco products heated tobacco products or vapes in dark corners in fear of being caught for using illegal substances. They will be discriminated against and may feel that they are being treated unfairly.

""Smoke-free products are available on the market because of global scientific innovations [as well as] success and progress in research within this field. It is vital that Malaysia strikes a balance between public health and market innovation that has created alternatives for adult smokers with the proposed Act"" said the confederation.

Under the proposed Act no person born on Jan 1 2007 and afterwards shall smoke any tobacco product or substitute tobacco product use any smoking device or possess any tobacco products smoking substances substitute tobacco products or smoking devices.

Any person found in breach commits an offence and shall on conviction be liable to a fine not exceeding RM5000 it reads.",,,

We picked 6,"Vermont might be small but the number of breathtaking hikes in the state certainly isn't. And while you can't go wrong when choosing a trail in the Green Mountain State there are some with vistas you simply can't miss.

Here are six hikes with jaw-dropping views in Vermont including favorites of the Burlington Free Press staff and the Green Mountain Club. And remember: The picture never does it justice.

Camels Hump View Trail Duxbury

This 0.8-mile gravel loop offers breathtaking vistas of Camels Hump the third-tallest mountain in Vermont. The trail is wide and has easy grades making it universally accessible and perfect for all ages and abilities. The access point is located at the parking lot 3.5 miles up Camels Hump Road.

Mount Philo Charlotte

Mount Philo is Vermont’s first state park established in 1924. Its 968-foot summit can be accessed via a steep road or a 1.2-mile newly-refurbished trail. The hike to the summit has moderate ascents and teasing peek-throughs along the way doable for families with small children. At the summit enjoy views of Lake Champlain and the Adirondack Mountains to the west and Camels Hump and Mount Mansfield to the east.

On the water:Lake Champlain is dotted with islands. Here are some you can you visit.

Mount Pisgah Westmore

This 6-mile trail is no walk in the park but the clifftop views of Lake Willoughby and the Northeast Kingdom make the climb worth your time. You can access Mount Pisgah’s two scenic overlooks via the North Trail or South Trail both around 1500-foot ascents. If you’re looking to cool off after the hike take a swim in Lake Willoughby directly below Mount Pisgah.

More hiking inspiration:

Rock Point Burlington

Burlington’s Rock Point has a network of recently-renovated trails friendly to hikers of all abilities. The Rock Point peninsula juts out between the Burlington and Appletree bays featuring spectacular views of Lake Champlain Juniper Island and the mountains. The public trails sit on private land owned by the Episcopal Church in Vermont.

Stowe Pinnacle Stowe

Stowe Pinnacle is one of Vermont’s “most photographed viewpoints” according to the town’s website. And it’s not hard to imagine why. The 1520-foot 3.6-mile climb leads hikers to a 360-degree panoramic view that captures Camels Hump Mount Mansfield the Worcester Range and the Sterling Range. You can access the overlook via the trailhead on Upper Hollow Road or from the Pinnacle Meadows lot if you want a shorter hike.

Sunset Ridge Trail Mount Mansfield Underhill

The Sunset Ridge Trail accessed via Underhill State Park is one of the most popular routes on Mount Mansfield. The 3-mile challenging path winds through low woods mountain evergreens and exposed rock faces before intercepting the Long Trail which brings you to the summit of Vermont’s highest peak (4393 feet). In all the trek to the summit is about 5 to 6 miles.

Will Smith breaks his silence over Oscar slap apologises to Chris,"You Might Also Like: Celebrities extend warm wishes to Dhanush on his 39th birthday

Much has been discussed about the shocking event that took place between actor Will Smith and comedian Chris Rock at the 2022 Oscard Awards. Several people shared their versions and feelings but the 'The Pursuit Of Happiness' actor never did.On Friday the Hollywood star finally broke his silence. He took to Instagram to share a video explaining how he spent the last three months replaying the slap episode in his mind.Remembering his acceptance speech the actor said that he had 'fogged out' by that time. ""It's all fuzzy"" he recalled.His apology video came a couple of days after Rock addressed the infamous altercation during his performance at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel New Jersey. ""Anyone who says words hurt has never been punched in the face...I'm not a victim"" he saidDressed in a white polo shirt and white ball cap Smith said that he spent the last three months understanding the complexities of what had happened at the Oscars stage. ""There is no part of me that thinks that it was the right way to behave or handle a feeling of disrespect or insults in that moment"" he said.In the nearly six-minute-long video Smith said that he had reached out to Rock but the stand-up comedian wasn't ready to talk to him yet. He also said that he was told that Rock will reach out when he is ready to talk.""I apologise to you. My behaviour was unacceptable. I am here whenever you are ready to talk"" he could be heard saying.Smith further extended his apology to the Rock family. He said he saw an interview that Rosalie (Rock's mother) did where was disappointed with Smith's actions. ""I didn't realise and thinking it through how many people got hurt in that moment"" he said in his apology to the Rocks.The 53-year-old said he had a strong bond with Rock's brother Tony which may have been affected by his actions. ""I want to apologise to Chris's family specifically Tony. We had a great relationship. Tony was my man. And this is probably irreparable.""Smith also shared that his wife did nothing to encourage his slap. “Jada had nothing to do with it"" he said. “I made a choice on my own from my experience and history with Chris.” Pinkett Smith had revealed that she is suffering from alopecia areata a hair-loss disorder.He also apologised to his children - Jaden Willow and Trey - for the heat that he brought on all. He extended his apology to fellow Oscar-nominees too to have 'stolen and tarnished' their moment. He mentioned Questlove's name in the video and said he still remembers his eyes. It was musician-director's documentary win for 'Summer of Soul (…Or When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)' that was interrupted by the slap. Rock was on stage to present the award.""I know 'I am sorry' isn't sufficient"" Smith said in the video adding that he is hurting because he hasn't lived up to fans' impressions. “Disappointing people is my central trauma. I hate when I let people down. It hurts me psychologically and emotionally to know I didn't live up to people's image and impression of me.""""I am deeply remorseful. I am trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself. I am human and I made a mistake. I am trying not to think of myself as a piece of s**t. I know it was confusing and shocking. I promise you that I am deeply devoted to putting light love and joy into the world. If you hang on I promise we will be able to be friends again"" he concluded his post.Since the Oscars 2022 incident in which Smith punched presenter and comedian Chris Rock on the Dolby Theatre stage after he made a G.I. Jane joke about Jada Pinkett's baldness Smith has apologised three times in various forms.Following the altercation the Academy banned Smith from attending the Oscars or any other Academy event for 10 years. Smith apologised to Rock in a statement after the Oscars saying he was 'out of line and I was wrong'.",,,,,,,,,

Colin Skellett 77 earns £1 million a year for running a water company that loses 70 million litres of water a day due to faulty infrastructure.

As it struggles to stop the leaks it is telling customers to watch their usage - even with advice on pools.

Colin Skellett the boss of Wessex Water which has warned of a ban on ‘non-essential’ water use has a 40ft swimming pool at his £3million home

In a ‘water saving’ section of the website it says: ‘Did you know? An average sized paddling pool needs around 200 litres to fill it up – that’s more than an average person normally uses in one day.’

It doesn’t say how much a swimming pool like Mr Skellett’s would take to fill. The advice adds: ‘Cover pools when they’re not in use to reduce evaporation ... and reuse paddling pool water on your garden plants or lawn.

Water companies must publish drought plans to show how they will deal with extended dry weather and extreme heat which the UK is now experiencing. Wessex Water recently updated theirs.

It says it will ban hosepikes and sprinklers in extended periods of dry weather saying they must not be used for lawns cars or swimming or paddling pools.

Any development seems to have the perfunctory main clubhouse to serve anything from hosting socials to functioning as a common leisure area. But Vie at Southern Plains the 65-hectare planned development by Victor Consunji Development Corporation (VCDC) is not just planned as a place where residents come home and sleep it is designed for where lifestyles are lived.

Modern function hall of the Vie Clubhouse for events meetings and social gatherings.

One of the manifestations of this philosophy is the idea of having three distinct clubhouses: a main clubhouse with a resort-style pool lounge area and modern function hall; a fitness park with a covered court fully equipped gym and a second-floor area ideal for studio activities like yoga and dance classes; and a dedicated children’s park with colorful playpods a kiddie pool function space and even an al fresco cinema.

The first of the three clubhouses was recently unveiled to select guests at a two-day event called the C’est La Vie Tour of Vie at Southern Plains. The tour was an opportunity to experience what VCDC founder and CEO Victor Consunji envisions as an assuredly different lifestyle that communes with nature and preserves it. Guests enjoyed the flowing food and wine and indulged in entertainment and leisure activities best enjoyed in relaxed spaces.

Pool and lounge area of the Vie Clubhouse.

Centrally located in Calamba Laguna with access to no less than three major thoroughfares Vie at Southern Plains will have only a limited number of units built on the property in order to preserve its community feel. The clubhouses sport the same motif as the rest of the development: brutalist architecture clean lines and generous spaces that let in the light and air. Designer Ria Prieto was brought in to lend her sense of style and elegance to the main clubhouse.

A dedicated area for the kids where they can play and meet new friends.

The villas at Vie at Southern Plains are the best of both worlds. Future homeowners can fully customize their own homes or have everything done for them from design and construction to until furnishing the home. The homeowners’ backyard will be masterplanned streets landscaped gardens and convenient lifestyle shops that provide for their everyday needs.

The prestigious resort-feel ambiance of the Vie at Southern Plains.

“This is the wisest decision in choosing a home because when the buyers want to make big or bigger changes in their homes in a few years from now or even five years later it will not be a problem because buyers can decide however and whenever they want to make the adjustments hassle-free making their homes adapt to their evolving lifestyles” said Consunji.

It is allowed as an exemption from taxable salary under Section 10(13A) of the Income-Tax Act 1961 (the Act) on satisfaction of several conditions. However if a taxpayer does not pay rent or live in a rented accommodation the HRA allowance is treated as fully taxable.

A taxpayer can claim the exemption of HRA if the following conditions are satisfied:

The taxpayer is a salaried employee;

HRA is received as a part of the salary;

The taxpayer resides in a rented accommodation and pays rent;

Proof of rent in form of rent receipts or rental agreement is made available to the employer for claiming exemption purposes;

If the rent paid by the employee is more than INR 100000 per annum it is mandatory for taxpayer to declare the landlord’s PAN to his employer.

The amount of HRA exemption available in a financial year (FY) shall be the least of the following:

How much cash can you legally keep at home in India?

Actual house rent allowance received; or

Rent paid less 10% of the basic salary; or

40% of basic salary (50% for rented accommodation in Delhi/Mumbai/Kolkata/Chennai).

Tax benefit on the Home Loan paid

The home loan (EMI) comprises of two parts i.e. principal repayment and interest component. To encourage the taxpayers to invest in housing loan with a dream to provide a housing to all Indian citizens the government has provided the multiple tax benefits for housing loan.

The interest portion of the EMI paid for a FY can be claimed as a deduction from taxpayers’ total income up to a maximum of INR 2 lakh under section 24(b) of Act. Further the principal portion of the EMI paid for the year is allowed as a deduction under Section 80C up to INR 1.5 lakh.

In order to claim such deduction the taxpayer should submit the interest certificate from the bank or financial institution to the employer specifying the break-up of interest pre-acquisition interest paid (if any) and the principal amount for a financial year.

How can taxpayer claim the benefit of HRA and Home Loan tax benefit together in the same financial year?

As a straightforward mechanism provided under the Indian income tax a taxpayer is not eligible to claim the benefit of HRA exemption if he owns a house property where he is claiming the deduction of interest on home loan paid as well.

However homeowners who are paying their home loan and receiving HRA as part of their salary can avail both the house property-related tax benefits in certain situations.

Possible few scenarios wherein taxpayers can avail the benefit of HRA and deduction for home loan simultaneously:

* Owning a house property and living in another rented house owing to his work or any other eligible reason:

In case the owned premise and rented accommodation are in different cities the taxpayer can claim the benefit of both i.e. exemption of the HRA received from the employer as well as the deduction of interest/principal paid on the on-going home loan for the self-owned property.

However in case the owned premise and rented accommodation are located in the same city he can claim the benefits of HRA exemption and deduction of interest/principal on home loan taken wherein there is a genuine reason for not staying in the owned premise.

* When the taxpayer’s house is under construction and is living in a rented accommodation (same/different city):

The taxpayer is eligible to claim both the benefits of HRA and interest component of home loan pertaining to the under-construction house.

Interest component paid while the residential house is under construction is known as pre-construction interest. The interest paid during the period from the date of borrowing the money to 31st March before end of the financial year in which construction is completed can be claimed as deduction u/s 24(b) in five equal instalments. The instalments can be claimed as deduction starting from the financial year in which construction is completed along with claiming the HRA exemption.

* When the taxpayer is renting his own house and living on rent elsewhere:

Wherein the person has rented out his own house and is living in some other rented property he is still eligible to claim the benefits of HRA and interest/principal paid on home loan. However he should disclose his rental receipts from the let-out property while calculating his taxable income.

To summarize salaried employees receiving HRA as a part of their salary and paying installments towards the home loan are allowed to avail the benefit of both the HRA exemption and interest/principal repayment deduction on the home loan subject to fulfillment of the scenarios mentioned above. In case the return is picked up for scrutiny at a later stage of assessment the taxpayer may have to substantiate both these deductions to the income tax officer (if questioned).

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Pontiac Michigan US – More than two years after ending his second campaign for the Democratic nomination for president Bernie Sanders can still get large crowds to cheer widely and mobilise for his message against income and wealth inequality.

In Pontiac Michigan – a town north of Detroit – on Friday Sanders had a new angle to discuss beyond his usual anger about the cost of healthcare and the growing gap between the poor and the ultra-rich.

As he campaigned for his progressive allies Congress members Andy Levin and Rashida Tlaib the senator raged against the influence of money in politics implicitly hitting out against the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) a lobbying group which has been spending millions of dollars to defeat progressives.

“This election is particularly important. It’s important because Andy based on his work deserves to be reelected; Rashida deserves to be reelected” Sanders said. “But it’s equally important in saying that the people of Michigan have got to tell these billionaires in their corporate PACs [political action committees] they cannot buy our democracy.”

The rally in Pontiac where Levin is running came days before the Michigan Democratic primary on August 2 where pro-Israel groups – spearheaded by AIPAC – have been spending millions on campaign ads to get their favoured candidates elected.

Levin a former labour organiser who hails from a renowned Jewish-American political family has been a primary target of AIPAC this cycle.

“One group has spent $4.2m to try to defeat me because I stand for a simple proposition: The only way to have a secure peaceful homeland for the Jewish people – for my people – is to fully achieve the political and human rights of the Palestinian people. I Will. Not. Back. Down” Levin told the crowd stopping between the words to emphasise that he is undeterred by AIPAC’s attacks.

The pro-Israel lobby has made it a quest to defeat left-wing candidates in Democratic primaries this year through its super PAC United Democracy Project — which uses donor funds to run ads against or in support of candidates without coordinating with their campaigns.

And so far it has succeeded in several contests across the country.

AIPAC has not intervened directly against Tlaib but another newly formed pro-Israel group has pledged to spend $1m to help defeat the Palestinian-American congresswoman. Still with the advantage of incumbency Tlaib is a favourite in the race that includes several opponents.

Levin however is at serious risk of losing his seat; he is running against fellow sitting Congress member Haley Stevens a staunch Israel advocate. Parts of the two lawmakers’ old districts were merged after redistricting following the 2020 Census and they are running against each other in a newly drawn constituency.

AIPAC and Stevens’ campaign have not returned Al Jazeera’s request for comment this week.

On Friday Tlaib said negative ads run by “out-of-town millionaires and billionaires” make her want to “work harder” and double down on her progressive advocacy.

“We are not going to let anyone come into our communities and tell us how to vote and try to pit us against each other” Tlaib said.

For his part Sanders stressed that AIPAC spending against left-wing candidates is about sinking the priorities of progressives on behalf of its billionaire mega-donors.

“It has nothing to do – in my view – with Israel” Sanders said. “It is simply trying to defeat candidates and members of Congress who stand for working families and are prepared to demand that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share of taxes.”

Sanders called Levin’s campaign “historic”.

“The billionaire class is saying ‘We own this country; we own the political system and we will not tolerate dissent. Either you work for us or get out of here.’ And Andy has chosen not to work for them” he added.

In an audience of a few hundred attendees dozens came with shirts and signs featuring Sanders’s image and slogans on Friday.

Lorenzo Sollena a 29-year-old substitute teacher said the senator from Vermont and a few of his progressive allies are the only ones challenging the political status quo in the United States.

“Bernie is the last person fighting … The country has come to a standstill. People say they care about universal healthcare and they care about abortion rights but nobody’s fighting back” said Sollena who was wearing a t-shirt featuring photos of Sanders throughout the decades with the caption: “We will never stop fighting for what is right.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMzEvb3Bpbmlvbi9yaWNoYXJkLW5peG9uLWFtZXJpY2EtdHJ1bXAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | We Are Living in Richard Nixon's America. Escaping It Won't Be Easy. (Published 2022),"It seems so naïve now that moment in 2020 when Democratic insiders started to talk of Joe Biden as a transformational figure. But there were reasons to believe. To hold off a pandemic-induced collapse the federal government had injected $2.2 trillion into the economy much of it in New Deal-style relief. The summer’s protests altered the public’s perception of race’s role in the criminal justice system. And analyses were pointing to Republican losses large enough to clear the way for the biggest burst of progressive legislation since the 1960s.

Two years on the truth is easier to see. We aren’t living in Franklin Roosevelt’s America or Lyndon Johnson’s or Donald Trump’s or even Joe Biden’s. We’re living in Richard Nixon’s.

Not the America of Nixon’s last years though there are dim echoes of it in the Jan. 6 hearings but the nation he built before Watergate brought him down where progressive possibilities would be choked off by law and order’s toxic politics and a Supreme Court he’d helped to shape.

He already had his core message set in the early days of his 1968 campaign. In a February speech in New Hampshire he said: “When a nation with the greatest tradition of the rule of law is torn apart by lawlessness when a nation which has been the symbol of equality of opportunity is torn apart by racial strife … then I say it’s time for new leadership in the United States of America.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzMwL2hvdy1wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS1ncm91cHMtbGlrZS10aGUtYWNsdS1tYWtlLW55Yy1tb3JlLWRhbmdlcm91cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How progressive groups like the ACLU make New York City more dangerous,"On a recent July afternoon in The Bronx 19-year-old Franklin Mesa went up to Nathaniel Rivers 35 who had just parked his car and allegedly stabbed him to death in front of his wife.

Mesa’s family members described him as schizophrenic. Police said he was arrested last year for punching somebody twice in the face. And a neighbor told The Post that he was often the source of “hostile aggressive” situations including preventing a woman from getting on the bus.

And yet it appears that nobody did anything to see if Mesa was taking his psychiatric medicine which his sister said he had been on since he was 15.

Rivers’ horrifying death rekindles a debate over the violent mentally ill in New York. Between 2015 and 2018 911 calls reporting emotionally disturbed people have jumped by nearly 25% in New York City while the number of homeless people with serious mental illness rose by the same percent.

6 Rivers was allegedly stabbed to death by Mesa who’d recently been arrested for assault and was described by neighbors as the center of “aggressive hostile” situations.

At bottom the blame for this trend rests with progressive groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Legal Aid Society which have sought to de-fund psychiatry de-police New York and de-stigmatize untreated mental illness. They are expert at persuading courts to release mentally ill people in the name of freedom. They convince their clients to push for maximal freedom rather than for the care that’s best for them.

Consider the case of Martial Simon a 61 year-old mentally ill homeless man who early this year confessed to pushing 40 year-old Michelle Go onto the subway tracks killing her instantly. Simon who the Legal Aid Society defended in court is now at a psychiatric facility where he will remain until he’s found mentally fit.

The fact is he should never have been released.

Simon had already been under the supervision of New York’s correctional authority until last August for two cases of armed robbery in 2017. His sister wanted him permanently hospitalized.

“I remember begging one of the hospitals ‘Let him stay’” she told The Post “because once he’s out he didn’t want to take medication and it was the medication that kept him going.”

A homeless advocate who saw Simon’s medical records reports that Simon even told a psychiatrist in 2017 that it was only a matter of time before he pushed a woman onto the subway tracks.

6 The Legal Aid Society defended Simon Martial the mentally ill homeless man who killed Michelle Go when he pushed her onto subway tracks. Martial is currently being held at a psychiatric facility after previously being released. J.C. Rice

“People with mental illness who harm other people usually do it because of paranoid delusions in which they fear for their own lives” Stanford psychiatrist Anna Lembke told me. “They become convinced based on psychotic delusions that they need to kill to protect. What looks on the outside like pure aggression is often a deeply disturbed attempt to protect.”

The seriously mentally ill who also often suffer from drug addiction and homelessness are some of the most difficult sick people to treat which is why even many very caring medical professionals and social workers avoid them.

This is partly because the ACLU and other progressive groups have sought to weaken Kendra’s Law claiming it is authoritarian and racist while also seeking to prevent police officers from even responding to 911 calls relating to the mentally ill.

6 Go’s death might have been prevented if Martial had been required to take medication to control his mental illness. The ACLU says such measures deprive people of their civil liberties. LinkedIn

Kendra’s Law passed by New York legislators in 1999 is named after a writer who was killed after being pushed onto the subway tracks by a mentally ill man who had stopped taking his medications. The law allows courts to order medical treatment of the mentally ill without hospitalization which is known as “assisted outpatient treatment” and at a lower standard than the “imminent dangerousness” criteria for in-patient commitment in New York.

Assisted outpatient treatment is aided by injectable antipsychotic medicines which last a full month. They are tailor-made for delusional schizophrenics who convince themselves that they are not sick and stop taking their daily medicines. Most conservatives and liberals agree Kendra’s Law worked to prevent violence by the mentally ill. It allows for action to be taken before a mentally ill person like Mesa or Simon hurts somebody.

And yet there was an 8% decline in the number of individuals treated under Kendra’s Law between 2017 and 2021.

6 Kendra’s Law passed in 1999 was named after Kendra Webdale (above) who was pushed onto subway tracks by a mentally ill man who had stopped taking his medication.

In my reporting for my book “San Fransicko” an attorney for the ACLU told me that her organization believes the mentally ill are too impaired to be held accountable for breaking the law but not impaired enough to justify the same kind of treatment we provide to other people suffering mental disabilities such as dementia.

In short the ACLU effectively believes that it’s better to accept the deaths of people like Nathaniel Rivers and Michelle Go than to deprive the civil liberties of potentially violent mentally ill people like Franklin Mesa and Martial Simon by mandating they take once-a-month injections. In 2018 just 3158 patients were under active Kendra’s Law court orders in New York state even though around 8000 could have qualified according to advocacy group Mental Illness Policy Org.

Mayor Eric Adams has made fighting crime his signature concern and recently hired Kendra’s Law author Brian Stettin to work for him. They will need to increase psychiatric beds by at last 4000 in order to meet demand.

6 Andrew Goldstein who’d suffered from schizophrenia for decades was sentenced to 23 years in prison for Kendra Webdale’s death. The ACLU calls Kendra’s Law “racist and authoritarian.” New York Post

There is federal Medicaid funding for this but New York state must apply for a waiver known as the “IMD Exclusion.” Naturally ACLU and other progressive groups hotly oppose New York state doing so.

But Mayor Adams need not wait for Governor Kathy Hochul to act. He should order New York police and doctors in New York hospitals to interpret existing laws more broadly since the law allows recognizing hospital care as “essential to [the] person’s welfare” and “other conduct demonstrating that the person is dangerous to [self].”

No doubt that the ACLU will sue him but as Stettin notes “It would be a fight well worth having and the city would prevail.”

JD Beach (No. 95 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) solidified his claim as the leading TT rider in all of Progressive American Flat Track by earning a second consecutive victory at the World Famous SC2 Peoria TT presented by Country Saloon on Saturday at the Peoria Motorcycle Club in Peoria Illinois.

JD Beach wins for the second time in a row at the Peoria TT.

While Beach ultimately went wire-to-wire to victory the contest was in fact quite a tense affair with two-time Mission SuperTwins presented by S&S Cycle champion Briar Bauman (No. 3 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) glued to Beach’s rear wheel pretty much throughout.

A five-rider freight train formed at the start with Beach holding the lead ahead of Jarod Vanderkooi (No. 20 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) Bauman Jared Mees (No. 1 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) and Dallas Daniels (No. 32 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT).

Bauman was the first to slip past ‘VDK’ blasting ahead as they exited the race’s opening corner while Mees and Daniels would do the same over the next few minutes.

Bauman only really showed Beach his front wheel on a single occasion. That said he was perfectly positioned at nearly every moment to capitalize on any mistakes that might possibly befall Beach on the dry and notchy track. However the Yamaha ace proved remarkably resilient under fire especially considering he was still riding at less than 100% after hurting his ankle at the Mission Port Royal Half-Mile a couple weeks back.

Beach took the checkered flag 0.492 seconds ahead of Bauman to improve his overall series TT record to five wins in his last six attempts.

He said “When I hurt my ankle at the last race I couldn’t even walk to leave the track. Coming into Peoria there are so many fast guys here and I was sitting on my butt for two weeks. I just have to thank my family who made sure I didn’t do anything because I’m not good at sitting around.

“The whole Estenson team worked so hard. Today was a little hectic but to get this win again here and get two in a row… To imagine Henry (Wiles) got 14 in a row here is just insane. It feels so good. I’m pumped.”

The continuation of Bauman’s midseason surge further tightened the title fight. So too did Daniels’ third-place finish a result that only came following a protracted battle with reigning champion Mees for the position. If not for his continued woes at leaving the starting line the rookie might have had more of a say in the final outcome. Still he had to be satisfied with standing on the box in his first premier-class race at his home track.

Bauman is now just three points behind Mees (188-185) while Daniels is only another 13 points back. Beach too has new life closing to within 30 points of Mees (159) after securing his second win of the season.

The challenge of 14-time Peoria TT winner “King Henry” Wiles (No. 17 Willy Built/Lyndy Roofing Co. Kawasaki Ninja 650) never fully materialized. Wiles showed respectable speed throughout the day but faded back to ninth before making a late climb to an eventual sixth finishing behind Vanderkooi in the Main.

Brandon Robinson (No. 44 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) came home in seventh one spot ahead of Mission Production Twins Challenge entrant Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) who executed a spirited climb up the order early before running out of steam.

Ben Lowe (No. 25 Rackley Racing/Mission Foods Indian FTR750) and Bronson Bauman (No. 37 Latus Motors Racing Harley-Davidson XG750R) rounded out the top ten.

Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines

Before he was a full-fledged Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines title fighter Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) originally made his name as a Peoria TT expert. In fact that reputation actually landed him last year’s opportunity to earn his current ride – a ride that subsequently launched him into championship contention.

While he’s clearly grown beyond the specialist tag Janisch proved yet again he’s one of the very best there is at the legendary venue. He was in full-on imperious form winning the drag race to Turn 1 and promptly building up a sizable gap before even completing a single lap.

Janisch’s fellow Semi winner Johnny Lewis (No. 10 Moto Anatomy X Powered by Royal Enfield 650) was outflanked by Dan Bromley (No. 62 Vinson Construction/Viper Air Yamaha MT-07) in the first corner and then spent the next couple of minutes looking for a way back through. By the time Lewis retook second Janisch already had more than two seconds in hand.

That advantage only continued to stretch even when Lewis had clear air in front of him. Janisch ultimately piled on more than 14 seconds worth of padding before he wheelied his way down the front straight to a 12.192-second margin of victory.

The triumph was Janisch’s fourth professional win at the circuit the first three coming aboard single-cylinder machinery. Afterward he said “That was awesome. I’m so much more comfortable with the bike and team this year. Last year I came here and was just trying to stay quiet and be polite and ride the thing. This year we’re obviously working good with the team and making changes trying to learn me and the bike better. The Vance & Hines guys are amazing.”

The victory also provided Janisch a bit more breathing space in the championship fight. That said defending class champion Cory Texter (No. 1 G&G Racing/Yamaha Racing Yamaha MT-07) did what he does so well minimizing the damage on the days in which he’s at a disadvantage in order to fight back another day.

Texter held Cole Zabala (No. 51 Memphis Shades/Corbin/Vinson Yamaha MT-07) at bay to finish fourth crossing the line just over a second back of podium finishers Lewis and Bromley. As a result Janisch now leads Texter 199-188 with seven races remaining to decide the back-and-forth championship battle.

Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER

The four-race win streak of Kody Kopp (No. 12 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) finally came to an end but even so the Red Bull KTM Factory Racing win streak now stands at five. And that’s because Kopp’s teammate Max Whale (No. 18 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) finally collected his first victory of 2022 after leading the Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER class in Main Event victories with five a season ago.

However both KTM pilots found themselves behind Estenson Racing’s Trevor Brunner (No. 21 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F) off the line. Whale struck first railing up the inside of Brunner as they powered onto the front straight a minute-and-a-half into the contest.

The Australian would then proceed to rip open a couple seconds at the front as Kopp desperately attempted to find a way through himself. Instead he found himself victimized by the charging Morgen Mischler (No. 13 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) and dropped to fourth as Whale continued to break away at the front.

Mischler would eventually exploit a big bobble on Brunner’s part to slide into second with around a minute to go and then close rapidly on the leader. What once seemed to be a certain win became considerably less so but Whale responded to Mischler’s late push to hold on for a 0.831-second win.

While Whale was awarded last year’s win at Peoria it only came due to a DQ ahead of him. So technically this was his second in succession at the famed race even if it felt like a first to him.

He said “It’s been a long seven weeks since (getting hurt at) the Red Mile. And to come back finally with a win… It feels like it’s been years since I won a race. That was so much fun. I found a line that worked early on and just stuck to it. It’s unreal to get a win at Peoria and the crowd here is awesome. I’m stoked.”

Mischer’s runner-up represented his first-ever TT podium and saw him narrow Kopp’s title advantage for the first time in five races (even if it still stands at two full races 220-170). The podium was completed by Brunner who ultimately kept Kopp corralled behind him for full race distance which meant the title leader would equal his worst finish of the season in fourth.

Rookie Chase Saathoff (No. 106 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) pulled off a last-lap pass on Ferran Cardús (No. 377 Roof Systems of Dallas/Bullet Strong Racing Honda CRF450R) to edge the Spanish champion for fifth by 0.008 seconds at the flag.

Bernie Sanders center speaks at a rally on Friday in Pontiac in support of U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib left and Andy Levin right. Pro-Israel groups have spent millions to unseat the progressive lawmakers.

Metro Detroit has many problems that command the attention of elected officials — including poverty reproductive rights gun control education jobs racial inequality health care and the environment.

But no issue has more money flowing into local political campaigns than Israel a country more than 6000 miles from southeast Michigan.

A Metro Times analysis of campaign finance records found that pro-Israel political action committees (PACs) are outspending all other groups pouring millions of dollars into deceptive TV ads and mailers to try to sway the Democratic primary election in three congressional races in metro Detroit. The ads make no mention of Israel and falsely suggest that three progressive congressional candidates aren’t true Democrats.

In all three pro-Israel PACs spent an unprecedented $9.7 million in the past two months on the three congressional campaigns primarily for pricey TV and digital ads just weeks before the primary election on Aug. 2.

By far the PACs have spent more on media buys than the candidates have themselves.

The biggest spender is United Democracy Project a recently formed PAC affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) a hawkish pro-Israel group that has supported more than 100 Republicans who voted to overturn the election.

AIPAC has also been accused of supporting fundamentally undemocratic policies in Israel that deny the rights of Palestinian people.

Since the United Democracy Project formed in October it has supported moderate Democrats over progressives in primary elections in several states but none as much as in Michigan.

Some of the largest contributors to the United Democracy Project are Republican megadonors such as hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer and Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus each of whom donated $1 million. Moderate Democrats have also contributed to the PAC.

11th Congressional District race

United Democracy Project spent at least $3.9 million on ads supporting U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens a moderate Democrat from Waterford who is running in the 11th District against her Democratic colleague U.S. Rep. Andy Levin a Jewish progressive from Bloomfield Township. The PAC spent an additional $343000 on ads attacking Levin who has been endorsed by U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both of whom attended pro-Levin rallies this week in metro Detroit.

The ad buys dwarf Levin’s entire campaign budget of $2.7 million.

To Levin the idea that a “right wing” group is masquerading as pro-Democrat and pumping millions of dollars into the race without mentioning Israel is “truly absurd.”

“They are interfering in the democratic primaries” Levin tells Metro Times. “I don’t think it’s OK to take millions of dollars from a group that is supporting insurrectionist Republicans. They are only going after progressive Democrats. It’s very troubling.”

Levin says he’s focused on issues that most matter to voters such as abortion rights good jobs health care and environmental justice. Levin was among a group of 17 Democratic members of Congress who were arrested earlier this month at an abortion rights demonstration outside the U.S. Supreme Court.

“These issues are all drowned out in this avalanche of money” Levin says fearing that the massive amount of ad spending could tilt the election in favor of his opponent.

In response to United Democracy Project’s money the political action group for J Street a liberal “pro-Israel pro-peace group” that advocates for a two-state solution spent about $700000 on a recent ad buy in support of Levin. The TV and digital ads criticize Stevens for taking donations from the United Democracy Project.

“No campaign cash is worth abandoning our democracy” the narrator in the ad says noting that AIPAC has supported insurrectionist Republicans.

Logan Bayroff a J Street spokesman says the impetus for helping Levin was the deceptive tactics by the United Democracy Project.

“We think voters deserve to know where all this spending in the district is coming from” Bayroff tells Metro Times. “They are being bombarded by ads on their TV screen and other places. It is not coming from a group that cares about the priorities and values of Democratic voters. It is quite disingenuous.”

Bayroff says Levin’s positions are in no way incongruous with a healthy prosperous Israel.

“Andy Levin embodies what it means to be a Jewish progressive who cares about Israel and its future and who recognizes that support for a secure and democratic Israel goes hand-and-hand with Palestinian rights” Bayroff says. “That’s a very mainstream popular sentiment in the American Jewish community and among Democratic voters.”

On Stevens’s campaign website she mentions Israel 19 times and dedicates more space to the issue than most of her other priorities such as health care senior and veteran services immigration gun control and LGBTQ rights.

The website states that Stevens supports a two-state solution “a democratic Jewish State of Israel and a viable democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace” and opposes the “boycott divestment and sanctions” movement.

Stevens has been endorsed by the Democratic Majority for Israel and Pro-Israel America.

Asked about the funding from United Democracy Project Stevens’s campaign spokesman Larkin Parker said in a statement that the congresswoman is “proud of her unequivocal support of the Jewish State.”

“As President Biden said during his visit to Israel this week ‘The connection between the Israeli people and the American people is bone deep ... we invest in each other we dream together’” Power said. “As our only Democratic ally in the Middle East a strong U.S./Israeli partnership is critical for our security innovation and diplomacy. Her support from AIPAC is solely due to that view. She is proud to be supported by AIPAC who also supports; Speaker Nancy Pelosi Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer House Minority Leader Steny Hoyer and the majority of the House Progressive Caucus of which Mr. Levin is himself a member.”

Levin a former president of Congregation T’chiyah a Reconstructionist synagogue in Oak Park chuckles at the idea that he’s anti-Israel.

“I love Israel I always have” Levin says. “I am a Zionist and support all of our aid to Israel. I don’t support the BDS movement. The sin I committed according to this right-wing group is that I act on the idea that the only way to have a secure homeland is to fully realize the human and political rights of the Palestinian people.”

David Green a Jewish doctor who lives in the congressional district says that he and many other Jews are voting for Levin whom he calls “a strong Zionist.”

“The idea that there is a monolithic Jewish vote that’s opposed to a Jewish congressman is ridiculous” Green tells Metro Times. “The majority of us support Andy.”

The 11th Congressional District covers a large section of Oakland County including Farmington Farmington Hills Birmingham West Bloomfield Township Bloomfield Hills Pontiac Oak Park Ferndale Hazel Park Madison Heights Royal Oak Berkley Clawson Waterford Township Walled Lake Wixom and Auburn Hills.

13th Congressional District race

The United Democracy Project has also spent more than $2.7 million on ads in support of state Sen. Adam Hollier a Democrat who is running for Congress in the 13th District which covers much of Detroit Hamtramck Highland Park the Grosse Pointes and northern Downriver communities.

In addition the PAC bought $1.4 million worth of ads attacking one of his 12 opponents first-term state Rep. Shri Thanedar a millionaire scientist and entrepreneur. One of the ads suggests Thanedar who has built a progressive record in the House is a secret Republican.

“Shri Thanedar is posing as a Democrat when he’s really just a wolf in sheep’s clothing” the mailer states. “Shri Thanedar can’t be trusted to stand up for Democratic policies and issues because he votes the Republican line.”

Hollier is arguably the more moderate Democrat. He voted with Republicans to support a controversial bill to reform the auto industry and was the lone state Senate Democrat to back Canadian energy company Enbridge’s plan to build a tunnel in the Straits of Mackinac to transport oil. Both bills were widely criticized by Democrats and applauded by industry giants.

Hollier also championed a bill in 2019 that was aimed at barring local officials from preventing mining companies from setting up potentially hazardous operations. Hollier wanted to give that authority to state officials.

If the measure passed — it didn’t — one of the beneficiaries of that decision would have been the Edward C. Levy Company which has been trying to build a massive gravel mine in a small village in Lapeer County.

The president and executive chairman of the company both donated a combined $275000 to the United Democracy Project according to campaign finance reports.

Hollier says he votes in the best interest of voters and has earned the support of the pro-Israel PAC and sees nothing wrong with the ads especially since Thanedar is self-funding his campaign to the tune of $8.2 million. Without the outside funding Hollier says it would be very difficult to win the primary election.

“I’m grateful for the pro-Israel money” Hollier tells Metro Times. “It has made me more competitive than I would have been.”

Hollier says he’s knocked on more than 40000 doors and his campaign has made 280000 phone calls. About 80% of the nearly $840000 he has raised so far has come from people who contributed less than $250 Hollier says.

“The issue here is we have someone who thought he could buy a race for cheap and now realizes it’s going to be much more expensive because people have coalesced around me” Hollier says.

Hollier says the PAC has a legitimate interest in the race calling Thanedar an “existential threat” to Israel because he sponsored a resolution in the state House that called for ending U.S. funding to Israel’s military.

The resolution which never reached the floor for a vote urges the “Congress of the United States to enact policies that halt taxpayer funded aid to Israel which supports the military detention of Palestinian children; the unlawful seizure appropriation and destruction of Palestinian property; forcible displacement harm and killing of civilians in the West Bank; or any further annexation of Palestinian land in violation of international law.”

Thanedar says he now regrets sponsoring the resolution and has asked the sponsors of the measure to remove his name. He has since added his support of Israel to his campaign website along with a resolution that condemns antisemitism.

“While Israel must respect the human and civil rights of Palestinians Palestinian leadership must condemn the violence perpetrated by Hamas and recognize the state of Israel’s right to exist” the website states. “I believe this is an achievable goal and that with strong leadership from the United States we can achieve a two-state solution with a shared capital in Jerusalem and peace throughout the Middle East.”

Hollier who served in the Army as a captain says Israel is a critical partner to the U.S.

“I think Israel is an incredibly important strategic ally” he says. “They are important to the region. The continued expansion of settlements makes it more difficult for a two-state solution. … Israel’s right to exist should not continue to be up for debate but there are a lot of folks who challenge that.”

Thanedar has urged Hollier to “denounce” the PAC funding saying the ads are misleading and intended to influence Hollier’s position on the Middle East.

“Allowing special interests to buy politicians is one of the most despicable and corrupting influences in our modern political system” Thanedar said in a statement to Metro Times. “Adam invited this corruption into the 13th District. What the people need is a congressperson who will represent them — not another sold-out politician.”

12th Congressional District race

Another pro-Israel PAC Urban Empowerment Action has pledged to spend up to $1 million to unseat U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib a progressive Democrat from Detroit and the first woman of Palestinian descent to be elected to Congress.

Tlaib has been an outspoken critic of Israel for its heavy-handed treatment of Palestinians.

The Atlanta-based PAC which formed in October 2021 is supporting Tlaib’s opponent Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey for the 12th District seat that includes Dearborn Livonia Southfield and western Detroit.

In the final weeks of the primary campaign the PAC aired its first TV ad and it was for Winfrey. The ad which makes no mention of Israel depicts Tlaib as an out-of-touch politician who refused to partner with President Joe Biden’s agenda.

“We need Democrats who will stand together for people like you and me” the narrator says. “Janice Winfrey withstood death threats to defend our democracy. Janice Winfrey will stand up for us.”

In a statement Urban Empowerment Action spokesman Henry Greenidge said “Janice Winfrey has shown for over a decade that her sole focus in public life is serving her community.”

“As City Clerk Winfrey has defended democracy and fiercely protected the voting rights of Detroiters — especially Black voters” he said. “The contrast between her and Representative Tlaib who chooses attention over action at every turn couldn’t be clearer. Michigan needs a champion like Janice Winfrey who will vote for common-sense solutions like investments in infrastructure and education that improve her constituents’ quality of life.”

One of the PAC’s biggest donors is billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb a prominent supporter of charter schools and Jewish and Israel causes.

Loeb came under fire in 2017 for writing a racist insult on Facebook about a Black state senator in New York. He accused Democratic leader Sen. Andrea Stewart-Cousins of having done “more damage to people of color than anyone who has ever donned a hood” a reference to the Ku Klux Klan.

Loeb who has since apologized was angry that Stewart-Cousins didn’t support charter school funding.

Tlaib’s campaign spokesman denounced the ads and Loeb’s involvement saying the intent is to mislead voters and buy an election.

“Voters in the 12th Congressional District are not fooled by this desperate attempt to twist Rep. Tlaib’s record on delivering for families and working people” McCampbell said in a statement. “It is unfortunate that we’ve heard nothing from the opponent who these ads attempt to benefit and who just so happens to be an election official. If our opponent truly cares about democracy and transparency she would have already denounced these ads. This outside spending only seeks to eat at the fabric of honest and open elections.”

On Winfrey’s campaign website she lists Israel as one of her nine priorities.

In an interview with Metro Times Winfrey assailed Tlaib for her criticism of Israel.

""When you're a sitting member of Congress of these United States and you want to do away with the most significant ally in the Middle East that’s appalling” Winfrey says. “I take affront to it as a tax-paying citizen. ... I can’t pay your salary for you to hate.""

She adds “When you want to do that to our largest significant ally it’s problematic. When you want to do away with Israel today it could be Africa next. You can’t let hate be your motivating factor.""

Tlaib declined to respond to Winfrey’s allegations and McCampbell said the campaign wants to stay focused on what’s important to voters.

Tlaib’s campaign has knocked on more than 25000 doors and made 120000 calls to discuss issues that are a priority to voters in her district McCampbell said.

Express delivery business in the country should be properly regulated to ward off predatory pricing and ensure the good quality of services by operators according to Thailand Post a state postal service enterprise.

The call was made as several foreign delivery service platforms are ramping up efforts to boost their market share through below-cost pricing which is heaping pressure on Thailand Post which provides postal services while having to serve the public interest.

Dhanant Subhadrabandhu chief executive of Thailand Post said several foreign express delivery operators are operating in the country by using the below-cost strategy which distorts market competition.

The Thai market is only one of their supply chains in their logistics and e-commerce business he said adding the major shareholders of these global logistics players support accelerated efforts to boost their market share in Thailand regardless of huge losses.

""Without proper regulations governing the express delivery business the domestic market could be at extreme risk of facing monopoly scheme which could adversely affect consumers"" said Mr Dhanant.

If the state allows price-cutting operators to dominate the market with very low delivery fees it would take a toll on the country's logistics ecosystem he said.

He said fierce competition in the segment is hitting the performance of Thailand Post which faced its first net losses in its operations last year of 1.6 billion baht including more than 500 million baht allocated for its early retirement programme in 2021.

In recent years the company has seen its revenue decline 10% on average per year.

More importantly an increase in fuel prices has pushed up the firm's fuel costs by 30%.

""To be fair Thailand Post is the only operator in the country that provides business-to-customer delivery nationwide including traditional mail services as a basic logistics infrastructure"" said Mr Dhanant.

It is also the only courier regulated by the Postal Commission while other operators are running business freely without oversight he said.

Thailand Post also provides basic support for the public such as delivering medical supplies nationwide during the pandemic and distributing fruits and products from local farmers to consumers in line with the government's policies.

It is hard to speculate how long the company's coffers could be used to compete with foreign cost-cutting operators which have strong financial backing from giant companies.

Parcel delivery service contributes 40% of Thailand Post's total revenue followed by mail at 30% international courier services at 20% and financial services at 10%.

Thailand Post said it still retains the biggest market share of overall mail and parcel delivery business at 45% down from more than 50% two years ago.

Meanwhile Kerry is the biggest player in logistics services in the country.

Related government agencies should be aware that courier services are now marred with a distortion of competition while regulations are needed to shape up the ecosystem to support healthy competition said Mr Dhanant.

Regulations can also help ensure operators take care of service quality rather than pricing strategy he noted.

""Healthy competition is not only meant to support Thailand Post but ensure a proper price gap between basic services and express delivery. The gap is now too narrow driven by below-cost pricing"" said Mr Dhanant.

Thailand Post which has been operating for 136 years is now adjusting its services and management as part of its digital transformation with its mission to become Post Digital he added.

According to Mr Dhanant the company which has 40000 staff needs to be more agile and adopt a new service mindset to generate new revenue streams.

The company's logistics solutions arm ThailandPost Distribution aims to be listed on the stock market within the next two years.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven years after Mount Pleasant-based McAlister Development Co. offered $12 million to buy out the owners at 99 St. Philip's Place the developer received a $12.4 million loan from Bay Point Advisors to help pay for the conversion project. The financing which closed in April was announced last week.

The development will create 254 beds in the four-story building at 99 St. Philip St. and an adjoining lot at 106 Coming St. which formerly was the site of the YWCA. McAlister bought the latter property for $8.25 million in 2014.

Many of the units at 99 St. Philip's Place were rentals in 2015 but several were owner-occupied. Some of the owners initially resisted efforts to sell but all but a handful were acquired before 2020 when the last ones changed hands.

McAlister Development has been approved by the college and the state to lease the beds for one year with renewal options for up to four subsequent years for no more than $9.8 million in total.

The converted condo building will be used as ""swing space"" to house students from the nearby McAlister Residence Hall which is to renovated over the next year.

CofC requested approval of the rental agreement from the State Fiscal Accountability Authority in April to meet current demand and future projections for college-provided student housing. The lease terms do not include a purchase option.

The college will pay a base rent of $3500 per bed per semester or $1.778 million for the academic year. Students will be charged $4500 per bed based on double occupancy. The college also is responsible for the operating costs which are to be about $353000 for the year.

The two-acre property is near three existing residence halls at the college.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy9ydXJhbC8yMDIyLTA4LTAxL2Zsb29kcGxhaW4taGFydmVzdGluZy1sZWdpc2xhdGVkLXNvdXRoZXJuLW5zdy8xMDEyODc1NzLSAShodHRwczovL2FtcC5hYmMubmV0LmF1L2FydGljbGUvMTAxMjg3NTcy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southern NSW irrigators plan to challenge flood plain harvesting legislation in court,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2022-08-01/floodplain-harvesting-legislated-southern-nsw/101287572 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy9ydXJhbC8yMDIyLTA4LTAxL2Zsb29kcGxhaW4taGFydmVzdGluZy1sZWdpc2xhdGVkLXNvdXRoZXJuLW5zdy8xMDEyODc1NzLSAShodHRwczovL2FtcC5hYmMubmV0LmF1L2FydGljbGUvMTAxMjg3NTcy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Submitted early ahead of tomorrow's Linux 5.19 stable kernel release are the SoC changes destined for the Linux 5.20 merge window. There are more than one thousand SoC patches for Linux 5.20 cycle adding and updating many SoCs and board/platform coverage. One of several notable additions this cycle is introducing the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen3 support for high-end Arm laptops.The NXP i.MX93 SoC is now supported with Linux 5.20 as the i.MX6/i.MX8 successor. The NXP i.MX93 announced last year features Arm Cortex-A55 cores an Arm Cortex-M33 an Arm Ethos U-65 microNPU and an EdgeLock secure enclave. The NXP i.MX93 is intended for use within industrial automation automotive building control smart homes and related areas. The integrated NPU aims to make this SoC very efficient for machine learning applications.

Another exciting SoC addition is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen3 (SC8280XP) as the company's latest high-end Arm-based laptop SoC. The automotive-geared SA8540P is also supported. With the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen3 support is also adding the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s laptop and reference board support.

The Lenovo ThinkPad X13s is a $2169+ USD laptop featuring this Snapdragon SoC with clock speeds up to 3.0GHz 13.3-inch 1200p display up to 32GB of LPDDR4x-4267 memory and up to a 28 hour battery life. By default the ThinkPad X13s runs Windows 11 Pro Arm but now the Linux support is getting underway.A number of new Broadcom broadband SoCs are now supported along with their reference boards: BCM63178 BCM63158 BCM4912 BCM6858 BCM6878 BCM6846 BCM63146 BCM6856 BCM6855 BCM6756 BCM63148 and BCM6813.Allwinner's H616 SoC is also supported with Linux 5.20 as a newer version of the H6 SoC. The Allwinner H616 features four Arm Cortex-A53 cores a Mali G31 GPU and designed to handle 4K@60FPS decoding with this SoC being focused on OTT and IPTV markets. In addition to enabling the Allwinner H616 Linux 5.20 is bringing support for the Orange Pi Zero2 and X96 Mate.Also new for Linux 5.20 is support for the Marvell Prestera 98DX2530 (AlleyCat5) SoC used by some network switches. New SoC platform support for the Nuvoton NPCM8XX and Sunplus SP7021. Meanwhile the aging DaVinci DM644x/DM646x SoC support has been removed. The Nuvoton NPCM8xx SoCs are used as baseboard management controllers. The Sunplus SP7021 ""Plus1"" SoC is a general purpose SoC using Arm Cortex-A7 cores.The Linux 5.20 ARM defconfig will now enabling the V3D DRM driver that is used by the Raspberry Pi 4 and newer. The older VC4 driver was previously enabled and now V3D is also enabled as part of the default configuration to ensure this driver is built by default. There are also many defconfig updates on the Qualcomm side for enabling their LPG LEDs driver Qualcomm Bandwidth Monitor and other features.Linux 5.20 also deprecates old Arm board files in the Linux kernel. For the past decade the Linux kernel has relied on Device Tree while prior to that were old board files grandfathered in. Many of those older targets have since been converted to Device Tree format while those that haven't are now deprecated. The plan is to remove those old files after the Linux 2022 LTS release at the end of the year. If anyone is still running a modern kernel with these old board files will need to speak up over the coming months otherwise those legacy board files will be removed after the next LTS kernel.

Qualcomm may shake things up with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.

It had been theorized that while this might not be the best approach from an efficiency viewpoint it would help the next generation of Android phones support older apps.





A new tweet from leaker Ice Universe has proven that theory wrong - at least partially. Per the leaker Qualcomm is hard at work on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and it will be a very impressive SoC with great power efficiency.





The tipster also says that Android vendors are already prepping phones with the new chip and it's possible that we will see the first handset with Qualcomm's next flagship chip underneath in November.





The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 was announced on 29 November 2021 but the first phone powered by it was only released in late December that too only in China.





A recent report had said that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 would be announced in a November event which would run from November 14-17.





Most other details - except that the chip may have the Adreno 740 GPU - are still scarce but we are interested in seeing what Qualcomm is cooking up. Apple's A Bionic chip and Google's Tensor chip both don't employ a conventional cluster layout and phones powered by them are among the best out there . Even Samsung is reportedly considering a new approach  but the next Exynos chip is not expected anytime soon.

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 was something of a letdown but that was probably down to Samsung's 4nm manufacturing process. Although a possibility was raised about Arm's design being somewhat responsible the TSMC-made Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 is proof that Qualcomm made the right call by switching to a new foundry. The company is now working on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2  which could arrive much earlier than expected.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vdGVsZWNvbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3Mvc2Ftc3VuZy1yZWZ1dGVzLXJ1bW91ci1vZi1kaXNjb250aW51aW5nLWV4eW5vcy1wcm9qZWN0LzkzMjM0MDg40gF1aHR0cHM6Ly90ZWxlY29tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3Mvc2Ftc3VuZy1yZWZ1dGVzLXJ1bW91ci1vZi1kaXNjb250aW51aW5nLWV4eW5vcy1wcm9qZWN0LzkzMjM0MDg4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung refutes rumour of discontinuing Exynos project,"Advt

Some on social media ‌‌suggested it might already be ‌spreading rapidly in communities in Europe and the ‌United States. These reports should have been a code red for federal infectious disease response.

But it wasn’t until late June that the C‌enters for Disease Control and Prevention expanded testing for monkeypox to large commercial labs like Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp for more capacity and access. The C.D.C. had gone through its standard playbook ticking through its protracted checklist.

Compared with the agency’s botched rollout of a test for the coronavirus the monkeypox test came at warp speed. But the virus spread even faster. If ‌American leaders wanted to quash the outbreak ‌‌the United States should have been testing all people who presented with what was presumed to be atypical cases of diseases like genital herpes and zoster infection; both can cause rashes that sometimes resemble monkeypox. That might have required 15000 tests a week by my rough estimate. From mid-May to the end of June the U‌‌nited States tested only about 2000 samples.

Our country’s response to monkeypox ‌‌has been plagued by the same shortcomings we had with Covid-19. Now if monkeypox ‌gains a permanent foothold in the U‌nited States and becomes an endemic virus that joins our circulating repertoire of pathogens it will be one of the worst public health failures in modern times not only because of the pain and peril of the disease but also because it was so avoidable. Our lapses extend beyond political decision making to the agencies tasked with protecting us from these threats. We don’t have a federal infrastructure capable of dealing with these emergencies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnppbmdhLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2Nhbm5hYmlzLzIwLzA4LzE3MzA5NzExL2RydWctdGVzdGluZy1hdC13b3JrLWlzLWEtdGhpbmctb2YtdGhlLXBhc3Qtc3R1ZHktZmluZHMtMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Drug Testing At Work Is A Thing Of The Past Study Finds - Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX),"According to a study conducted by Quest Diagnostics Inc DGX drug use among American employees as measured by the percentage of employees who tested positive in urine drug tests hit a 14-year high in 2018 reaching 4.4 percent.

Cannabis continues to be the most popular substance with 2.8 percent of all employees tested showing positive results.

The news led addiction experts at the American Addiction Centers to wonder about the impact this might have on pre-employment drug testing in professionals. Seeking for an answer they conducted an analysis of job postings on the popular website Glassdoor. They were trying to find out what types of jobs are most likely to include requirements for drug tests and regular drug screening.

Overall remarkably few jobs disclose that they require drug testing before confirming employment or during employment. On average only 1.47 percent of job postings in the U.S. mention that they require pre-employment drug tests.

Even fewer jobs disclose that they require regular drug screenings during employment. On average only 0.66 percent of job postings mention regular drug testing.

A few of the most likely industries to require pre-employment drug tests were:

Government

Health Care & Hospitals

Manufacturing

Automotive

Transportation & Logistics

Private Security

Aerospace & Defense

Construction

Information Technology

Education & Schools

A few of the most likely industries to require regular drug screenings were:

Health Care & Hospitals

Transportation & Logistics

Government

Automotive

Manufacturing

Information Technology

Insurance

Biotech & Pharmaceuticals

Real Estate

Non-Profit

“Overall we were surprised that more employers were not up front with the sobriety expectations for their employees particularly in some of the more manual fields such as manufacturing or construction. Additionally incredibly few office jobs discuss drug testing in their job postings” American Addiction Centers experts said during an exclusive conversation.

Now while drug testing numbers are surprisingly low on average there’s considerable variation between states.

Jobs That Require Pre Employment Drug Tests - American Addiction Centers

Still only one city in the country boasts a number above 2.4 percent: in Arlington TX almost 7 percent of jobs require pre-employment drug screenings. On the other end of the spectrum was New York City with just 0.46 percent of all jobs requiring screenings.

One very surprising discovery made from the data was that Omaha NE had absolutely no jobs that required regular drug screening according to their job postings. However according to a study from earlier this year residents of the city have the highest substance abuse rate in the country. It seems contradictory that a city experiencing a pronounced issue with substance abuse would have absolutely no job postings addressing the issue.

Cities With The Most Jobs Requiring Drug Tests - American Addiction Centers

But beyond city-specific data one thing is clear: drug testing before or during employment is a thing of the past.

Despite a hot start to his NFL career he has seen some bumps on the road to greatness.

Barkley has played in just 15 games the last two season in the NFL. Lower body injuries may have slowed him down but early glimpses into his 2022 NFL training camp and it appears that he may be back to his rookie self.

As a rookie he finished with over 2000 scrimmage yards for the New York Giants and now with a new staff and front office in the Meadowlands Barkley looks to make a good first impression.

If what he has done in camp so far is any indication Barkley should do just fine this year if he can remain healthy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbGFycnlicm93bnNwb3J0cy5jb20vZm9vdGJhbGwvd2FuZGFsZS1yb2JpbnNvbi1naWFudHMtYnJlYWtvdXQtdHJhaW5pbmctY2FtcC82MDE1NzHSAV9odHRwczovL2xhcnJ5YnJvd25zcG9ydHMuY29tL2Zvb3RiYWxsL3dhbmRhbGUtcm9iaW5zb24tZ2lhbnRzLWJyZWFrb3V0LXRyYWluaW5nLWNhbXAvNjAxNTcxP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rookie WR is breakout star of Giants camp,"Rookie WR is breakout star of Giants camp

The New York Giants may have a rookie to watch in their offense at least according to one reporter.

After visiting Giants camp Peter King of NBC Sports named rookie wide receiver Wan’Dale Robinson as a player to watch in the regular season. According to King Robinson looks like a versatile piece who has impressed defenders that have gone up against him.

“The star I thought of the Giants offense in the practice I saw was Wan’Dale Robinson the second-round pick out of Kentucky” King said. “A smurfy little receiver he plays a lot of different roles. I see him ending up in the slot in this offense. Talking to Xavier McKinney the star safety for the Giants and he said ‘This kid is a problem.'”

Robinson was viewed as a reach when the Giants took him in the second round of April’s draft but perhaps they saw something others didn’t. One issue was Robinson’s height as he was listed at 5-foot-8 during the NFL Combine. The Giants are apparently high enough on him that they tried to convince people that he’s a bit taller than that.

Robinson will face plenty of competition for targets with Kadarius Toney and Kenny Golladay both featuring in the Giants’ receiver corps. He could be a name to watch regardless though.",,,

The Grove on Fillmore has been closed for more than two years.

FILLMORE BEAT | CHRIS BARNETT

Slammed shut and lifeless for well over two years the large space housing the once popular Grove cafe and hangout at 2016 Fillmore is stirring again but the new venture’s backers stubbornly refuse to disclose anything about it. “I can’t say I can’t say I can’t say” insisted a bearded guy in a hoodie who appeared to be a general contractor and claimed he is not the owner. Nor would he name the person in charge. Boom the door slammed shut again. Stay tuned.

UPDATE: The team behind the Snug will open Little Shucker next year at 2016 Fillmore the former Grove space three blocks away from the Snug the Chronicle reports. Adrian Garcia who previously cooked at San Francisco Michelin-starred restaurants Benu and Quince is in charge of the menu.

A couple of blocks north on the corner of Fillmore and Clay Sam Fechheimer a seasoned chef is the new owner of Palmer’s replacing Albert Ranier who launched it in 2014. Sam was his opening chef so he knows the bones of the building and its culinary history. He’s added a new brunch menu and is streamlining the daily menu with new dishes including a serious Caesar salad which replaces the faux Caesar made with kale. “We’re also reinvigorating our cocktail scene” he says.

Meantime the heart of the Post Pandemic Fillmore is coming back to life with more action and somewhat fewer “for lease” signs on empty storefronts.

The new Lululemon store at 2040 Fillmore Street replaces Ralph Lauren.

The biggest retail addition to the boulevard is the uber-hot Lululemon store at 2040 Fillmore which took over the space vacated by Ralph Lauren. Lululemon with its catchy name and logo has created an eye-catching “pilot” store on Fillmore that houses a massive collection of women and men’s workout and sportswear. Vancouver-based with stores worldwide Fillmore is SF’s fourth Lululemon. What makes it different? “We weave silver into all our fabrics and since bacteria doesn’t cling to silver our clothes never smell” says a candid Rebecca Jackson assistant manager. Lululemon will also buy back its old clothes for store credit and recycle them.

Across the street at 2033 Fillmore a new lingerie store called Third Love has moved in. Caroline a sales rep claims it’s the first such shop to create half sizes in bras such as an A½ B½ C ½ all the way up to H½ cup sizes. “We’re new to the industry and we design for all body types” she says.

Naadam at 2029 Fillmore — named after a Mongolian holiday — sells lounge and casual wear for women mostly made out of 100 percent cashmere sourced from sheep herders in Mongolia’s Gobi Desert. “We have no middlemen” says Meghan a store sales rep. Popular are the cashmere hoodies and sweaters. Prices range from $100 to $300.

The August Gallery has moved into 2053 Fillmore where a clothing and CBD company had a long off-and-on run. It’s not an art gallery per se but has a collection of items aimed at “making the home more beautiful” says Cameron the gallery coordinator for owners Lotta Coffey an interior designer and her husband Geoffrey a landscape designer who also has an office in the space. Items? Plants ceramics accessories and furniture by local artists.

Coming this fall to 2028 Fillmore: Sézane is bringing Paris to SF.

FOOD NOTES FROM OLD FAVORITES: John Castanon the suave longtime manager of Florio retired and went home to Texas in February. But he’s already been recalled for a six-week summer stint. • The former Elite Cafe now The Tailor’s Son has fresh additions to its cocktail list plus a 5 to 6:30 p.m. weekday happy hour — but only for patrons sitting at the bar. • A couple of doors away at 2043 Fillmore at low-priced Apizza store manager Pierre Luaga from Paris has added new pizzas including pork carnitas and cacio e pepe — plus $7 wines and beer at $5 per can. • On the corner of California and Fillmore the always affable TacoBar manager Antonio Solano has improved its online ordering and added new menu items and a parking zone for pickup and go. • On the corner of Fillmore and Pine Noosh owner John Litz has added two popular cocktails to his repertoire of California-inspired Mediterranean cuisine. His personable general manager and operations director Diana Ornelas is also a talented mixologist. She created the Rosé and Rose Sangria.

We reported in February that the newly formed joint venture owners (Mutual was previously the sole owner) were seeing a lot of leasing activity that left little space available.

Now sources say three tenant expansions have eaten up over 80000 square feet making the 766000-square-foot tower virtually full. The growth was by Raymond James (which added 38000 square feet) Audax (30000 more square feet) and Permira Advisers (15000 more square feet).

Asking rents are $100-$125 per square foot on lower floors and $130-$160 in the tower portion.

Even at almost 45 the NFL legend is going strong in the most physical group sport. When talking about the National Football League there will never be a better ambassador of the game than Tom Brady.

With the kind of decorated career he has in the NFL it is almost impossible to replicate what he has achieved in the game. Even though the Buccaneers’ quarterback has set his bar on a new high in the NFL American football was not his first career choice. Yes! Not many people are aware of it but the NFL star was a baseball player in his younger days.

After the greatness he has achieved in football it is hard to believe that Tom Brady started his sporting career as a baseball catcher. Currently the most successful player in the history of the NFL Brady was one of the MLB draft picks in the 1995 season. Recently an old photo of Brady playing baseball has been doing rounds on the internet.

What if Tom Brady did not switch his sporting career?

Per an old report of The Sun Tom Brady looks almost unrecognizable in his younger days. In almost over a 20-year-old photo Brady is donning a baseball uniform. The picture is quite clear. But it is enough clear to identify the NFL legend in his younger days.

According to CBS Sports the Montreal Expos selected Brady as the 507th pick in the 18th round of the 1995 MLB draft. At this time Brady was only 17-year-old. Even in his high school days Tom Brady played varsity baseball for almost years as a left-handed catcher.

But destiny had a different idea. Later the then-Expos players convinced Brady to switch his professional career to football from baseball. Because they believed playing football will be a far better career option than baseball.

And as it turned out Tom Brady not only dominated American football but he became the most consistent and successful player in the NFL’s history. Notably he has won seven Super Bowls (the most) in his 22-year-old NFL career.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080: Thirty Second Review

When the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 was first released it had to significantly improve upon Nvidia's top-tier graphics card from the Turing era so expectations couldn't have been higher.

But just like the rest of the Nvidia Ampere the RTX 3080 hasn't just been more than up to the challenge it absolutely redefines the performance of the elite graphics cards by bringing fast 4K gaming at an accessible if not totally affordable MSRP.

In fact the improvements of the RTX 3080 over the cards it’s replaced seems to be the biggest generation leap in power we’ve seen in a long time. It performs 20-30% better than the card in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti review and more impressively 50-80% better than the one in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 review.

What makes this GPU all the more attractive is that performance bump comes with a much more reasonable retail price. It’s almost half the cost of the previous generation GPU.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 makes high-end gaming much more attainable for the average gamer running the best PC games with faster refresh rates and higher resolutions for less money.

There are cheaper cards with a better value proposition but when it comes to the elite class of graphics cards the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is simply the best value for those who have the money to spend but want the most bang for their buck and so we highly recommend it as the best graphics card to buy for those who can clear the cost of entry.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080: Price and availability

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is available now assuming you can find it. Stock shortages have been an issue. (Image credit: Future)

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is available now starting at $699 (£649 about AU$950) for the Founders Edition. However as with any major graphics card there will be dozens of aftermarket graphics cards from companies like MSI Asus Zotac and more.

Just be aware that some of these aftermarket card designs may see steep price increases over this Founders Edition based on things like exotic cooling solutions and factory-tuned overclocks. But every RTX 3080 should more or less be in the ballpark of performance as the one Nvidia itself has released.

This is cheaper than the Founders Edition card in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 review which debuted at $799 (£749 AU$1199) so that's a good thing. It's still ridiculously expensive especially when you get to aftermarket cards.

It's not as outrageous as the Founders Edition card in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 review which launched at $1499 (£1399 around AU$2030). The Founders Edition card in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review meanwhile is a much more relatively reasonable $499 (£469 AU$809). The reference card in our AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT review and the Gigabyte card in out AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT review have an MSRP of $649 (around £649 AU$960) and $1299 (about £1040 / AU$1820) so the RTX 3080 is somewhere in the middle of the mix here among this generation of cards.

It's not the cheapest graphics card around but there are marginally better cards out there for twice the price. So even though the RTX 3080 is really expensive compared to its peers and the card it is replacing the MSRP price is actually pretty good given the level of performance you get out of it compared to the rest of this generation.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080: Features and chipset

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition drops the USB-C video output which we think is a shame. (Image credit: Future)

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is based on the Ampere graphics architecture which brings huge improvements to both raw performance and power efficiency over its Turing predecessor. The fact that Nvidia has increased the power budget so much over the RTX 2080 while boosting power efficiency means that the overall performance profile is far above what any Nvidia Turing graphics card was capable of.

There have been obvious improvements to the ray tracing (RT) and Tensor cores – which are on the second and third generation respectively – but perhaps the biggest improvement has been to the rasterization engine.

Through some clever optimization Nvidia was able to double the amount of CUDA cores present on each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) by making both data paths on each SM able to handle Floating Point 32 (FP32) workloads – a vast improvement over Turing where one data path was dedicated entirely to integer workloads. This effectively doubles raw FP32 throughput core for core though this won't directly translate into double the frame-rate in your favorite PC games – at least not for many of them.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 key specs GPU: GA102

Stream multiprocessors: 68 (128 CUDA per SM)

CUDA Cores: 8704

Tensor cores: 272

Ray tracing cores: 68

Power Draw (TGP): 320W

Boost clock: 1710MHz

VRAM: 10GB GDDR6X

Memory Speed: 19Gbps

Interface: PCIe 4.0 x16

Outputs: 1 x HDMI 2.1 3 x DisplayPort 1.4

Power connector: 1 x 12-pin

What this means is that while the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 only has 46% more SMs than the RTX 2080 at 68 it nearly triples the CUDA core count from 2944 to 8704. This translates to nearly three times the theoretical FP32 throughput from around 10 TFLOPs to 29.7 TFLOPs – an absolutely massive generational leap.

When you pair the uplift in CUDA cores with massive boosts to cache texture units and memory bandwidth – thanks to the move to faster GDDR6X memory on a 320-bit bus – gaming performance gets one of the biggest generational jumps in years even if it does fall a bit short of that '2x performance' target that we're sure some folks were hoping for. But more on that later.

Nvidia RT cores are also back – that's why Nvidia has the RTX name after all – and they also see massive improvements. Nvidia Ampere graphics cards including the RTX 3080 include second-generation RT cores which will function similarly to the first generation RT cores but will be twice as efficient.

If you've ever asked ""what is ray tracing?"" it is a new way to realistically render a scene by having an SM cast a light ray into a scene that's being rendered and the RT core will take over from there. The RT core will do all the calculations necessary to calculate where that light ray bounces and will report that information back to the SM. This means that the SM is left alone to render the rest of the scene but it can now incorporate that ray tracing data to more realistically light the scene.

Unfortunately we're still not at a point where turning on ray tracing doesn't have an absolutely brutal impact on performance. Maybe some day and the Nvidia RTX 3080 does an admirable job especially with DLSS turned on (more on that later).

Tensor cores are also twice as powerful this time around which has led Nvidia to only include 4 in each SM rather than the 8 you would find in a Turing SM. Coupled with the fact that there are now more SMs in general DLSS performance also gets a massive boost.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 features a 12-pin power connector instead of the normal 8-pin connector so you'll need to use the included adapter. (Image credit: Future)

This generation of graphics cards isn't all about gaming however and Nvidia has brought a couple of new features to the table that will make life better for pretty much everyone with an RTX card.

For instance we were already big fans of RTX Voice and Nvidia has finally brought it out of beta and worked it into a fully-featured broadcasting app. While RTX Voice filtered background noise out of your microphone you can set up Broadcaster to filter backgrounds out of your webcam – or even just apply a blur.

The video section is still in beta and we did see some glitches but it's way better than any other solution out there for blocking out your background without a green screen.

One of the features we're most excited to see implemented however is Nvidia RTX I/O which is an API that will work in tandem with Microsoft's DirectStorage API to route data straight from your SSD to your graphics card. In next-generation games this should not only massively reduce loading times but also mirror the groundbreaking I/O performance that has been teased with next-generation consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X. Far more than high frame rates or pretty graphics this technology is critically important to future gaming tech.

Unfortunately this is a technology that needs to be implemented by game developers in their games and we weren't actually able to see what kind of real-world difference it will make. Though it is something we will be actively testing once the technology is widely implemented – and because the consoles are going to be using similar tech we expect it will have a faster turnaround than ray tracing did.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080: Design

The design of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 puts its all about elegant lines and heat dissipation. (Image credit: Future)

New cooler style effectively manages heat while looking great in a case

The new 12-pin power connector adapter cable is too short

Lack of USB-C output is disappointing

For the actual Founders Edition graphics card Nvidia went with an all-new cooler design which is way more practical than anything it's ever done with a reference design before. The company used a shorter multi-layered PCB in order to have the back end of the card just be all heatsink. By doing this Nvidia was able to mount a fan on the back of the graphics card that will suck cool air through the heatsink and expel it up and out of the case.

We were a bit worried when we first saw this fan design that it would affect CPU and RAM temperatures as it's blowing hot air directly over these components. But even in our personal rig where we have a Noctua NH-12UA air cooler on an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X we didn't observe any difference in performance. We guess it helps that most PC games don't really stress both the GPU and CPU to the same extreme – not yet at least.

As far as power delivery goes that new 12-pin power connector is definitely there and we have some mixed feelings about it. It's clear that the new PCB design of the Founders Edition card needs this smaller connector to make this new cooler work we just wish that the 2 x 8-pin PCIe to 1 x 12-pin dongle Nvidia includes was a bit longer. As it stands it's kind of hard to tie it out of the way to not be immediately visible but at least aftermarket cards won't be using it right away. It's worth noting though that Nvidia is making the 12-pin power connector design available to any manufacturer – even AMD – that wants to use it.

The Founders Edition also has three DisplayPort and one HDMI 2.1 output for displays which is good. However we don't like that Nvidia got rid of the USB-C output here. Creators will definitely still want to use this incredibly powerful card and professional content creators are all about the best USB-C monitors these days.

Despite our little issues with the Founders Edition – and despite thinking it was ugly when it was first shown off – it's an attractive piece of hardware in person. All black with silver accents the RTX 3080 looks like a professional-grade piece of hardware.

The only lighting is the 'GeForce RTX' logo on the side of the graphics card in white which will surely please any anti-RGB users out there. Plus gamers that really want to go all-out with rainbow lighting will have that option with third-party cards.

4K @ 60 fps is finally reaching into the mainstream

Ray tracing is finally delivering on its promise (with DLSS on that is)

Absolutely massive generational leap over the RTX 2080

Test system specs This is the system we used to test the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition: CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3950X (16-core up to 4.7GHz)

CPU Cooler: Cooler Master Masterliquid 360P Silver Edition

RAM: 64GB Corsair Dominator Platinum @ 3600MHz

Motherboard: X570 Aorus Master

SSD: ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro @ 1TB

Power Supply: Phanteks RevoltX 1200

Case: Praxis Wetbench

Just from Nvidia's own (overblown) marketing we were already expecting the RTX 3080 to be a fast graphics card but calling it ""fast"" is a bit of an understatement. From the moment we opened the box it's been in our personal machine running everything from Final Fantasy XIV to Control only coming out of our personal rig to be plugged into our test bench for actual benchmarking.

Before the 3080 we had an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti in that machine and the difference was immediately apparent before we even start measuring performance in a quantifiable way. For instance one of the games we play the most is Final Fantasy XIV – it's a problem – and in that game particularly in the latest expansion there were moments where the RTX 2080 Ti would drop below 60 fps at 4K.

That doesn't happen with the RTX 3080. In fact the game is typically running anywhere from 75-100 fps at 4K with Maximum graphics settings where the RTX 2080 Ti typically chilled around the 60 fps mark – a massive jump in performance at around half the price.

This story just kept repeating itself over and over no matter what game we played. Metro Exodus maxed out with Ray Tracing and DLSS? Smooth locked 60 fps at 4K. Control with the myriad ray tracing effects? Silky smooth. Even Final Fantasy XV with all the weird optional graphics effects sits pretty at a steady 60 fps at 4K. Accessible 4K@60 gameplay is here – even if we are using the term ""accessible"" very loosely here.

While the thermals in our benchmarks aren't too exciting you should keep in mind that those were recorded on an open-air test bench. In our closed tower with two 240mm fans serving as intake temperatures peaked around 60°C – way cooler than the mid-80°C temperatures we would typically see with the RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition.

When looking at the actual benchmark results it's clear that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is in a class of its own standing head and shoulders above the RTX 2080 Ti. Right off the bat in 3DMark Time Spy Extreme the RTX 3080 is a whopping 63% faster than the RTX 2080 and 26% faster than the 2080 Ti – a massive generational leap when you consider that the RTX 2080 was only 40% faster than the GTX 1080 in our Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 review back in 2018.

But Time Spy Extreme isn't even even the best-case scenario for the RTX 3080's gains. In Red Dead Redemption 2 where we basically maxed out every single option that wasn't MSAA – multi-sample anti aliasing is very expensive and not worth it – we saw a massive 87% improvement gen-on-gen.

This falls short of that 2x performance leap that was teased at the RTX 3080 reveal but it's definitely closer than we thought it would actually get. The RTX 3080 all told is between 50-80% faster than the RTX 2080 while only falling below that in Fire Strike Ultra where it only managed a 29% lead – but that's still a meaty advantage.

That wide gap in performance is only really present at 4K however when the graphics card is free of bottlenecks. There are many titles in our testing suite where even the AMD Ryzen 9 3950X paired with 64GB of RAM at 3600MHz held back the RTX 3080. This is why for instance the RTX 2080 Ti and the RTX 3080 are virtually identical at 1080p in Metro Exodus but opens up to a 19% performance advantage at 4K.

For this reason we really don't recommend anyone actually buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 unless they're going to be playing at 4K or possibly 3400 x 1440 if you've got the best ultrawide monitor around that can really take advantage of what the RTX 3080 brings to the table. The gains are just not going to be there at lower resolutions so you're better off just picking up the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070.

The performance on offer with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 even further widens the gap that exists between Nvidia and AMD on the high end though. The AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT is one of the best AMD graphics cards around – especially when it comes to gaming performance – but it simply can't stand up against the RTX 3080 which outscored it on every synthetic banchmark we tested.

Performance: 5 / 5

Should you buy an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080?

Buy it if...

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is only really worth it if you're planning on playing games at 4K otherwise go with the RTX 3070 for 1440p. (Image credit: Future)

You want the best 4K performance

4K gaming is incredibly difficult to run but the RTX 3080 is one of the best graphics cards for handling it especially when you factor in its price. You'll be able to max out every game under the sun at this resolution at or very near 60 fps.

You want next-gen ready performance

With the next generation of games on the horizon performance requirements are about to skyrocket. The RTX 3080 is significantly more powerful (at least on paper) than the GPUs in either the PS5 or Xbox Series X.

You have an older graphics card

Because the generational gains between Nvidia Pascal and Nvidia Turing graphics cards were pretty minor many folks held onto their 10-series cards. If you have one of these older cards however you'll get absolutely massive gains with the RTX 3080.

Don't buy it if...

You play games at a lower resolution

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is a 4K graphics card and as such you really shouldn't pick this graphics card up for gaming at a lower resolution you'll run into bottlenecks with even the most powerful CPUs on the market.

You're on a budget

When Nvidia Turing launched the RTX 2080 saw a significant price increase over the GTX 1080. And while Nvidia didn't raise the price it didn't lower the price back to pre-Turing levels. If you want to get your hands on the RTX 3080 you're going to be paying a high price – even if it is worth it.

Also Consider

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070

If you don't plan on doing much 4K gaming then you should really consider going with the RTX 3070 which is an outstanding 1440p graphics card and it'll save you some money in the process. Read the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090

The RTX 3090 is nearly twice the price of the RTX 3080 so you should strike this card off your list for consideration if you have any concern about the cost of the card. If you're looking for the best 4K graphics card around though the RTX 3090 is pretty much best-in-class for this kind of gaming. Read the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 review

AMD Radeon RX 6800

The AMD Radeon RX 6800 isn't as good as the RTX 3080 there's no getting around that fact but if you're just looking for a gaming graphics card that is a major upgrade over an older GTX 10XX-series card then before you run off and buy Nvidia's best give the RX 6800 a look especially if you're looking for something that's marginally cheaper but still offers great performance.

Despite AMD’s best efforts the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 still sits atop the pantheon of most powerful GPUs. Powered by 24GB of GDDR6X RAM and cooled by a gigantic heatsink it can keep up with the most strenuous demands whether it’s 3D rendering or hardcore gaming.

It’s so powerful that it’s taken the place of two of the best graphics cards of the previous generation the Nvidia Titan RTX and the RTX 2080 Ti. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 has filled their shoes admirably.

It can not only provide stunning performance in 4K but can even run the latest AAA games in 8K at 60fps even if it’s not perfect at that extreme resolution. And as capable as it is running the best PC games  this GPU is more suited to those who have to run graphically intense tasks such as video rendering or 3D animation.

One of the reasons this is more suited for more professional workloads is its hefty price. Most mainstream gamers will most likely find the slightly cheaper cards from out Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review or our AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT review much more attractive for this reason.

With that said we've only seen a more powerful graphics card than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti review and that card was so expensive it simple is not worth it under almost any condition.

If you don’t care about price and want the best or have projects that need the most powerful hardware-accelerated rendering then the RTX 3090 Ti is a better bet but if you don't need that marginal increase in performance then the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is very likely the graphics card for you.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090: Price and availability

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is available right now starting at $1499 (£1399 around AU$2030) for Nvidia's own Founders Edition. However this will be the first time Nvidia has opened up a Titan-level card up to third party graphics card manufacturers like MSI Asus and Zotac which means you can expect some versions of the RTX 3090 to be significantly more expensive.

It's hard to pin down whether this is a price increase or a price cut over the previous generation. Compared to the Nvidia Titan RTX it's a massive price cut where that card cost an outrageous $2499 (£2399 AU$3999) for similar albeit last-generation specs. However the card in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti review launched at $1199 (£1099 AU$1899) which isn't that much cheaper than the RTX 3090.

The Gigabyte card in our AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT review meanwhile cost $1299 (about £1040 / AU$1820). And while that card had comparable gaming performance to the RTX 3090 in some games it fell behind in others and got absolutely crushed in creative workloads.

Given the present market and the previous generation of professional-grade graphics cards the RTX 3090 exists in kind of a middle ground. The GeForce name suggests that this graphics card is aimed at gamers but the specs and pricing suggest that it's more geared towards prosumers that need raw rendering power but aren't quite ready to jump into the Nvidia Quadro and Tesla worlds.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090: Features and chipset

Full-fat GA102 GPU

Staggering 24GB GDDR6X VRAM

Enormous power draw

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 key specs GPU: GA102

Stream multiprocessors: 82 (128 CUDA per SM)

CUDA Cores: 10496

Tensor cores: 328

Ray tracing cores: 82

Power Draw (TGP): 350W

Boost clock: 1695MHz

VRAM: 24GB GDDR6X

Memory Speed: 20Gbps

Interface: PCIe 4.0 x16

Outputs: 1 x HDMI 2.1 3 x DisplayPort 1.4

Power connector: 1 x 12-pin

Just like its little sibling the RTX 3080 the RTX 3090 is built on the Nvidia Ampere architecture using the full-fat GA102 GPU. This time around we're getting 82 Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) making for a total of 10496 CUDA cores along with 328 Tensor cores and 82 RT Cores.

At first glance the small bump up from the 72 SMs on the Nvidia Turing-based Titan RTX seems like a minor improvement but one of the most groundbreaking differences with the Ampere architecture is the ability for both datapaths on each SM being able to handle FP32 workloads. This means that CUDA core counts per SM is effectively doubled which is why the RTX 3090 is such a rendering behemoth.

The RTX 3090 is also rocking 24GB of GDDR6X video memory on a 384-bit bus which makes for 936 GB/s of memory bandwidth – that's nearly a terabyte of data every second. Having such a huge allocation of VRAM that is this fast means that anyone that does heavy 3D rendering work in applications like Davinci Resolve and Blender will get a huge benefit. And when your work involves these applications anything that can shave time off of project times saves you money in the long term. Combined with the comparatively low cost – at least compared to the Titan RTX – the RTX 3090 is a straight up bargain.

As we mentioned in our RTX 3080 review both the Tensor cores and RT cores that Nvidia has made such a huge deal of these past couple graphics card generations see big improvements too. Namely throughput of RT cores has doubled with the second-generation ones present on RTX 3000 series cards.

In ray tracing applications the SM will essentially cast a light ray then offload ray tracing workloads to the RT cores where they will calculate where in the scene it bounces reporting that data back to the SM. In the past ray tracing was basically impossible to do in real time as the SM would be responsible for doing that whole calculation on its own on top of any rasterization it had to do at the same time.

You'll need an adapter to get power to the 12-pin connector on the RTX 3090 but fortunately it comes with the card. (Image credit: Future)

But while the RT Core takes on a huge bulk of that workload ray tracing is still a very computationally expensive technology which means that it still has a heavy performance cost which is why DLSS is becoming more and more important both in gaming and in programs like D5 Render.

The third-generation Tensor Cores present in Nvidia Ampere graphics cards have also seen a massive improvement doubling in speed over the Turing Tensor Core. However DLSS performance hasn't seen a 2x performance bump overall as each SM now packs a single Tensor Core whereas Turing had two Tensor Cores per SM.

These Tensor Cores do more than just power DLSS however. They're also the technology that enables Nvidia Broadcast which is by far one of the most underrated features released for this generation.

We have been using Nvidia Broadcast during all of our meetings and late-night Discord hangouts over the last few weeks and it is phenomenal at both filtering unwanted noise out of your microphone and replacing your background when you're in the 50th Zoom call of the week and you have lost all energy and will to clean up.

Now that we've all been working from home for so long and with it looking like that's going to become the new normal anything that makes video conferencing less stressful is a huge benefit. The best part is that this technology is available to anyone with an Nvidia RTX-powered device.

However we have to talk about power consumption. At its peak during our testing the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 consumed a maximum of 357 Watts. That's a lot of juice especially if you're pairing it with a powerful processor. Nvidia recommends a minimum power supply of 750W but we would go further and just recommend a full 1000W PSU with this card just to be sure you don't run into any random shutdowns if your power supply isn't running at peak efficiency.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090: Design

The basic design of the RTX 3090 is similar to other Nvidia Ampere cards only this card is much bigger. (Image credit: Future)

Absolutely massive footprint

Phenomenal cooler design

12-pin connector requires an adapter which ships with the card

Just like the RTX 3080 the Founders Edition of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is hands-down the best cooler design Team Green has ever shipped itself. While this is an absolutely massive graphics card – the thing is 12.3 inches long is a 3-slot card and weighs well a lot. Look we don't have a scale and Nvidia doesn't list the weight but it's easily more than 7 lb.

Aesthetically it looks very similar to the RTX 3080 Founders Edition with a black and gunmetal gray color scheme and fans on either side of the GPU. The same cooling philosophy applies here – suck air up through the graphics card and exhaust it towards the top of the case. The heatsink also has a ton of surface area which lends to more efficient cooling.

In order to facilitate this cooler design the PCB had to be completely redesigned in order for it to even be possible to pass air through the back of the graphics card. Because of this Nvidia implemented a new 12-pin PCIe power connector rather than the dual 8-pin connectors you may have expected.

At the time of writing there aren't really any power supplies that natively support this new power connector though there are some custom cables from the likes of Corsair in the works. Luckily Nvidia includes a 2 x 8-pin to 1 x 12-pin power connector in the box so it's not something you have to worry about right now.

It is a bit unsightly however and it's hard to have the same kind of clean cable setup as you would have otherwise. However third-party graphics card manufacturers are using the same 8-pin power connector as always so you can always just go with one of those if you need to.

Because this is a large triple-slot card you're going to want to double check to make sure your case can actually support it. Some people with trendy micro ATX and mini-ITX cards will sadly be out of luck.

Absolutely chews through creative workloads like nothing

Actually playable 8K gaming. Yes we said 8K gaming.

When it comes to gaming performance we're going to just come out and say it – the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is just 10-20% faster than the RTX 3080 at more than double the price. That increase in performance if all you're looking for is a gaming card is absolutely not worth it and that's ok.

This is a card that is primarily aimed at the beginning of 8K gaming and professional 3D rendering applications. That being said we can't really talk about the RTX 3090 without talking about 8K gaming.

Test system specs This is the system we used to test the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition: CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3950X (16-core up to 4.7GHz)

CPU Cooler: Cooler Master Masterliquid 360P Silver Edition

RAM: 64GB Corsair Dominator Platinum @ 3600MHz

Motherboard: ASRock X570 Taichi

SSD: ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro @ 1TB

Power Supply: Corsair AX1000

Case: Praxis Wetbench

Right now 8K pretty much exclusively exists in the realm of high-end TVs which means the panels aren't exactly widespread. That will almost certainly change in the coming years but right now there isn't a single gaming monitor that supports the resolution.

We don't have an 8K display handy either – the display we use for our 8K performance features is on the opposite side of the Atlantic ocean as our controlled setup for testing computing components. However thanks to Nvidia's Dynamic Super Resolution or DSR we can test games in 8K scaling it back down to the native 4K resolution of the monitor we use for testing.

This comes with a sizable 3-5% performance loss but otherwise provides a good glimpse at what 8K gaming performance looks like. As you may be able to discern from the charts above the RTX 3090 doesn't provide the straight 8K 60 fps experience in the most demanding games on PC. But like most things it's complicated.

The games we selected for testing are there to push the GPU to its limits so we can compare the performance delta between different graphics cards. They provide easily repeatable benchmark scripts so we can be sure the exact same workload is applied to each graphics card.

But you can bet your bottom dollar that we threw this graphics card into our personal machine and tried it across a wide spectrum of PC games both at 4K and 8K DSR to see how it performs.

In games like World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth and Destiny 2 we were able to get a steady 60-70 fps at this extremely high resolution but with quality settings at high rather than having all the eye candy turned on. This isn't as big a loss as it sounds as the 24GB of VRAM is enough so that we didn't have to turn down textures.

However once we start diving into more visually intense single player games like Control and even Dark Souls III we typically see frame rates in the 40s – which is definitely still playable performance. So while we probably wouldn't advise people start playing games in 8K yet this is definitely the first graphics card we've ever tested that provides actual playable gameplay at this resolution – similar to how the Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 Ti and the Titan X broke into 4K gaming back in 2015.

That alone makes the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 appealing; however 8K gaming isn't perfect yet and it's definitely not at the point where you can just crank up the settings and forget about it. For 8K gaming the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is early adopter tech in every single way – you have to take into consideration that this is the first graphics card that can provide playable frame rates at this high resolution so expecting silky smooth gameplay in every game is kind of a pipe dream. It's impressive that the RTX 3090 can handle this resolution at all.

At 4K however the RTX 3090 does provide the level of performance where you can just crank every setting up to max and just forget about it. Every single game we tried to play with this graphics card at 4K ran like a dream. Final Fantasy XV with everything turned up? 70+ fps – with the stutter that game is infamous for almost completely eliminated thanks to the 24GB frame buffer.

Ditto with Metro Exodus and Control which were both games that made us constantly conscious about the limits of 4K gaming with the RTX 2080 Ti just a few months before the RTX 3090 launched but now run like an absolute dream with all the eye candy enabled. Yes the RTX 3090 only provides a 15% improvement over the RTX 3080. But the kind of people that are going to be buying this card for gaming are the type of person that just wants the bleeding edge tech price be damned. And well the experience here is definitely premium even if the price-to-performance ratio won't make sense for a vast majority of people.

Where the RTX 3090 really shines however is in 3D Rendering and encoding making it hugely compelling to creative professionals that need this level of performance without investing thousands of dollars in a Quadro or Tesla card.

It should be noted that the NVENC encoder is the same here as on the RTX 2080 Ti which means performance doesn't change much generation-to-generation. However now that this encoder is supported in Adobe Premiere nearly the entire video production workflow is now accelerated by the GPU which makes a dedicated GPU incredibly beneficial to video editors. Encoding a video using the NVENC encoder rather than through software cuts the time in half – even when we're using the 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 3950X paired with 64GB of RAM running at 3600MHz.

However while there isn't really a difference between RTX GPUs in straight encoding performance – as they're all using the same chip – processing effects do see improvement depending on the GPU you're using. With an RTX 3090 in your video editing PC you should have absolutely no problem playing back video in real time while editing.

But where the RTX 3090 really shines is in 3D Rendering through applications like Blender and Autodesk Maya. In fact while in games the RTX 3090 is around 50% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti the 3090 is nearly twice as fast as the Turing flagship in Blender rendering through the benchmark in just 229 seconds to the RTX 2080 Ti's 438 seconds. That's a 91% improvement thanks in large part to the sheer amount of VRAM and FP32 performance on offer here.

By pricing this graphics card at the $1499 (£1399 around AU$2030) price point rather than just putting it at the same price that the Titan RTX launched at Nvidia may be making strides to democratizing the kind of 3D Rendering performance that will let people try their hands at 3D animation without having to invest in extremely expensive hardware. Maybe with Nvidia Lovelace the RTX 4080 card can deliver this kind of rendering performance to make it even easier for the layperson to do 3D content creation. But hey at least it's more accessible now than ever before and we'll consider that a win.

Should you buy an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090?

The heatsink on the RTX 3090 is simply massive. (Image credit: Future)

Buy it if...

You want to be an 8K gaming pioneer

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is the first graphics card to provide playable gaming performance at 8K. It's not perfect but it's the only card that won't give you a slideshow at that resolution.

You are a creative professional

If a large part of your daily workflow involves 3D Rendering the massive compute performance and copious amount of VRAM on offer here will be a dream come true.

You don't want to ever worry about 4K gaming performance

With the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 we've finally reached the point where you can just max out whatever game you're playing at 4K and forget about it. All the eye candy that's inadvisable for most folks to turn on works like a breeze with the RTX 3090.

Don't buy it if...

You're on any semblance of a budget

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is the fastest graphics card in the world yes but it's also extremely expensive. The gains over the RTX 3080 aren't worth the price increase so only people that want the very best no matter the price need apply here.

You're playing at any resolution under 4K

The RTX 3090 is a massively powerful graphics card and you simply won't get what you're paying for unless you're playing games at 4K.

You don't need the very best

If you're fine with solid gaming performance and you don't want to pay twice the price of the RTX 3080 for 15% added gaming performance you should probably go for the cheaper card – Nvidia itself called it the flagship after all.

Also consider

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti

The RTX 3090 is an expensive graphics card without question so if it is just a little bit too expensive for your wallet to bear this time around give the RTX 3080 Ti a look. It has comparable specs and performance with a more accessible price. Read the full Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti review

AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT

The AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT isn't competitive against the RTX 3090 when it comes to creative performance at all. But there are a number of cases where it's gaming performance was on par with the RTX 3090 and with a starting MSRP of $1099 (about £880 / AU$1420) it's a viable alternative for a gaming rig. Read the full AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT review

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080

If what you're looking to do is dive into the wonderful world of 4K gaming then honestly the RTX 3090 might be overkill especially for the price. The RTX 3080 gets 4K@60fps pretty easily and consistently for about half the price of the RTX 3090 so if you're just looking to game you can save yourself some real money by dropping down just a bit to the next lowest tier.

Alchemist flagship mobile GPU has now been tested with and without Advanced Optimizations enabled.

Rogame reports that Intel Arc A770M is now properly working in 3DMark Time Spy as new scores of devices equipped with this flagship Alchemist discrete GPU have now been spotted. One of the scores features NUC12SNKi72 system the latest Mini-PC from Intel featuring not only Arc graphics but also Alder Lake CPU. The other is a Clevo X270PTA 17.3-inch gaming laptop.

In both instances the GPU scored above 10K points in GPU test which is faster than RTX 3060M.

Clevo and NUC systems reportedly have the similar average clock of 1710-1714 MHz with top frequency reaching as high as 2050 MHz. Furthermore 16GB of GDDR6 memory is clocked at 2000 MHz. The NUC A770M did appear to be running cooler though up to 68°C while Clevo reached 80°C.

As said the NUC system has no APO (driver optimizations) enabled and it scored 10793 points whereas the Clevo system scored 11667 points with APO enabled. The latter score is above RTX 3070M but those results are neither valid according to 3DMark rules nor they mirror gaming performance.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: Thirty second review

Any other year and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti would be a welcome sight.

Nine months separate the launch of the 3080 Ti and our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review and though that’s the usual time frame for a refresh it’s a strange time to stick to that schedule.

While Nvidia surely has justifications for going ahead with this mid-generation refresh the world of GPUs along with almost everything else tech-related has been turned upside down.

Right now consumers have been struggling to get hold of the best graphics cards  no matter if they’re from AMD vs Nvidia . The global chip shortage has made supply extremely limited and hard to come by and so anyone in the market for a new GPU has to either contend with scalpers charging double the price or store lotteries for the small chance of getting one.

These conditions are not ideal for the release of a new GPU especially one that costs $1199. If by chance you’re able to get your hands on a RTX 3080 TI you won’t be disappointed. It is a powerhouse taking the RTX 3090 and halving the VRAM for a more consumer-oriented card.

Even in more normal times though it’s not the easiest graphics card to recommend since it’s not that much more powerful compared to the RTX 3080 but it is much more expensive.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: Price and availability

Much more expensive than the RTX 3080 but not that much more powerful

A great value alternative to the RTX 3090

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is available June 3 starting at $1199 / £1049 / AU$1949. Prices for the RTX 3080 Ti will probably vary wildly from that minimum price and third-party versions of the GPU will probably sell for much higher.

Given that the RTX 3080 launched in September 2020 for just $699 (£649 about AU$950) you’re paying nearly twice as much for the RTX 3080 Ti. Given that this GPU has just 2GB more VRAM and 17% more CUDA cores that 71% price mark-up might be hard to swallow right now.

Although this graphics card does deliver pretty much the same level of performance as the card in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 review for about $300 less (at least going by MSRP) so it might be worth grabbing if you had your eyes on one of the best Nvidia GeForce graphics cards on the market but are put off by their premium price tags.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: Features and chipset

The RTX 3080 Ti is more of a cut-down RTX 3090 than an improved RTX 3080. (Image credit: Future)

A 17% increase in CUDA cores over RTX 3080

Includes hardware-based hash rate limiter to thwart crypto mining

An additional 2GB VRAM will help with 4K gaming performance

Just like the rest of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3000 series the RTX 3080 Ti is built on the Nvidia Ampere architecture and brings with it the same improvements as the rest of the lineup. There is something new to the table however.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti key specs GPU: GA102

Stream multiprocessors: 80 (128 CUDA per SM)

CUDA Cores: 10240

Tensor cores: 320

Ray tracing cores: 80

Power Draw (TGP): 350W

Boost clock: 1665MHz

VRAM: 12GB GDDR6X

Memory Speed: 19Gbps

Interface: PCIe 4.0 x16

Outputs: 1 x HDMI 2.1 3 x DisplayPort 1.4

Power connector: 1 x 12-pin

As with the card in our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 review that launched in March 2021 the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti has a hardware-based hash rate limiter that should limit the appeal to cryptocurrency miners. We don’t test mining performance at TechRadar so we can’t speak to how effective this limit actually is. But given that the hash rate limiter on the RTX 3060 was accidentally bypassed by Nvidia’s own driver update we’ll just have to wait and see how well this actually dissuades miners from buying this graphics card in bulk.

Beyond that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is actually quite a bit beefier than the original RTX 3080 and that largely falls to core count and memory bandwidth.

Because sure the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti does have more VRAM with 12GB of GDDR6X compared to 10GB of the stuff on the original card but it’s also on a faster 384-bit memory bus. That means you get 912 GB/s of memory bandwidth on the RTX 3080 Ti compared to the RTX 3080’s 760 GB/s. With faster VRAM not to mention just more memory the RTX 3080 Ti should be even more adept at 4K gaming in the future.

The RTX 3080 Ti is straight up more powerful as well. The GPU has 10240 CUDA cores across 80 compute units compared to the RTX 3080’s 8704 CUDA cores. That’s a 17% increase in core count but don’t expect a strict 17% performance increase - more on that later.

You’re also going to get access to Nvidia’s whole suite of software features and it’s not just limited to gaming.

The one we are still in love with is Nvidia Broadcast which is ostensibly designed for streamers and content creators but we find that it is incredibly useful in just day-to-day life. We use it a lot when we’re taking meetings or even just hanging out with friends in Discord especially because it filters out most of the New York City street noises outside our street-facing apartment window.

Of course you also get access to Deep Learning Super Sampling or DLSS. This tech uses the Tensor cores – the RTX 3080 Ti has 320 of those – to upscale a lower resolution to your native resolution. The idea is that DLSS will let you turn on more of the shiny graphics options so you don’t have to sacrifice image quality just to hit a decent framerate especially at high resolutions like 4K.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: Design

The RTX 3080 Ti is the same size as the RTX 3080 so it will slot in easily into the same case. (Image credit: Future)

Same size as the RTX 3080 so will fit in the same case easily

Same design as other Founders Edition cards so still looks great in a case

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti we reviewed is Nvidia’s Founders Edition and well it looks like the rest of the RTX 30-series Founders Edition cards. The graphics card has an attractive black and gunmetal gray colorway. You’ll aso see Nvidia and RTX 3080 Ti branding etched into the metal. That’s not something you’ll notice once you actually have the graphics card in your PC but it’s a nice touch.

The RTX 3080 Ti is the exact same size and weight as the original RTX 3080 which means it’s 4.4 inches thick and 11.2 inches long so it should fit in most cases.

There are two fans on the RTX 3080 Ti and just like the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 there’s one on the front and one on the back. This fan configuration pulls air through the front of the card it’ll go through the card and go out through a fan on the back of the card probably shooting the hot air through the top of your case.

It’s an extremely effective method of cooling the RTX 3080 Ti and even with a peak power consumption of 350W the RTX 3080 Ti peaks at just 78.9C. That is a lot higher than the RTX 3090’s 72C peak temperature even though that card has the same level of power consumption.

But it’s actually impressive that Nvidia was able to get that close in thermals considering that it was able to shrink the cooler back down to a dual-slot design rather than the giant triple-slot RTX 3090 Founders Edition.

Finally Nvidia has of course included the 12-pin power connector. It does mean that you’re probably going to have to use an adapter to power the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti but of course Nvidia has included an adapter in the box.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 levels of gaming performance

Beats the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT pretty handily

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is basically as fast as the RTX 3090 in PC games even despite the fact that it has half the VRAM. So the RTX 3080 Ti is what you should buy if you want the best gaming performance you can get right now and don’t really need to be running Blender or Resolve all the time.

Test system specs This is the system we used to test the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition: CPU: Intel Core i9-11900K (8-core up to 5.3GHz)

CPU Cooler: Cooler Master Masterliquid 360P Silver Edition

RAM: 64GB Corsair Dominator Platinum @ 3200MHz

Motherboard: MSI MEG Z590 ACE

SSD: ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro @ 1TB

Power Supply: Phanteks RevoltX 1200

Case: Praxis Wetbench

And when we say that the performance is exactly the same we’re not really exaggerating. Across our entire suite of benchmarks the RTX 3080 Ti is usually within 1-2 fps of the RTX 3090.

The biggest difference between the two is in Dirt 5 at 1440p where the RTX 3080 Ti gets 139 fps to the RTX 3090’s 146 fps. But if you’re playing Dirt 5 you’re probably not going to notice that 5% performance difference.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti also beats the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT in all but two tests: Fire Strike Ultra and Assassins Creed Valhalla.

But even then at 4K the RTX 3080 Ti delivers the same performance as the RTX 3090 so you’re getting extremely good performance either way.

Still no USB-C output which is a damned shame. (Image credit: Future)

In the rest of the games though the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT is between 7-26% slower than the RTX 3080 Ti so Assassins Creed Valhalla is definitely not the norm. This would usually be enough to make us flatly recommend the RTX 3080 Ti over the Radeon RX 6900 XT but if we’re just going off of MSRP Nvidia’s Graphics card is an extra $200. So you’re going to want to make sure that the RTX 3080 Ti is worth that extra cost.

For pretty much any game that you’re looking to play the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is going to be able to max it out at 4K and that’s including all the fancy ray tracing effects you’ve probably been hearing about.

Performance: 5 / 5

Should you buy an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti?

Compared to the RTX 3080 the RTX 3080 Ti is questionable but against the RTX 3090 it's a bargain. (Image credit: Future)

Buy it if…

You want no-compromises gaming performance

Because the RTX 3080 Ti basically brings the same level of performance as the RTX 3090 for a bit less money this is the graphics card to get if you just want a top-notch gaming experience.

You have the budget for it

Even before accounting for aftermarket price increases the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is an expensive graphics card. But it is the best of the best and we think it’s worth the price if you can afford it.

You want DLSS and ray tracing

Next to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is the best graphics card on the market right now if you care about ray tracing and DLSS will help boost that performance even more.

Don’t buy it if...

You’re on a budget

Any graphics card in 2021 is expensive but the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is one of the priciest ones out there.

You have a low-wattage power supply

The RTX 3080 Ti peaks at around 350W of power so we recommend at least an 800W PSU. So you might need an upgrade if you have a lesser power supply.

The performance figures in 3DMark Time Spy according to the leaker are based on the anticipated hardware requirements for these GPUs. The leaker admits he isn’t entirely confident in these performance metrics but doesn’t go into much information. The NVIDIA RTX 4080 and RTX 4070 may end up being more advanced than their predecessors because they released these details.

RTX 4080 TSE >15000

RTX 4070 TSE ~10000.

These scores are based on specs I mentioned before.

Honestly it's not quite sure yet except RTX 4090. Well I don't care. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 29 2022

Need a better spec. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 29 2022

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 will have an AD103-300 GPU setup that is scaled down with 10240 cores or 80 of the total 84 units activated. The GPU will have up to 224 ROPs and 64 MB of L2 cache.

In terms of memory specifications the GeForce RTX 4080 is predicted to use 16 GB of GDDR6X memory clocked at 21 Gbps across a 256-bit bus interface. This will offer bandwidth of up to 672 GB/s. Because the memory clocks aren’t very aggressive it is conceivable that the core clocks might be tweaked for optimal graphics performance. The TBP is reportedly rated at roughly 420W which is close to the RTX 4090.

We have the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 which is anticipated to be a scaled-down version of the AD104-275 GPU with 7168 cores or 56 SMs more than the RTX 3070 TI (6144 cores). The GPU will have up to 160 ROPs and 48 MB of L2 cache.

The GeForce RTX 4070 is anticipated to use 10 GB of GDDR6 memory clocked at 18 Gbps over a 160-bit bus interface. The leaker also claims that the card’s price would not be less than that of the RTX 3070 or 3070 Ti graphics cards. The card may have a TBP of 300W. In other words we can anticipate a price increase in the ’70 class graphics market.

According to the leaker the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 should do better than 15000 in 3DMark Time Spy Extreme which would put it 68 per cent quicker than the RTX 3080 and about 33 per cent faster than the current-generation flagship the RTX 3090 Ti.

However there would be a significant difference between the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 with the flagship providing a boost of 27%. This is a significant improvement over the previous generation in which the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 only had a difference of 13%.

Credit: wccftech

The Time Spy Extreme GPU benchmark test is expected to yield a score of roughly 10000 for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070. Performance is up 50% from the RTX 3070 and is on par with the RTX 3090. If the card ends up costing $499 US this would be an incredible performance for gamers.

But once more we observe a sizable 50 per cent performance gap between the RTX 4080 and RTX 4070. Even if NVIDIA introduces an RTX 4070 Ti that say boosts performance by 10% to 15% there would still be a 35% performance differential between the two categories.

Lewis (26-10 MMA 17-8 UFC) a multi-time UFC title challenger and fan-favorite heavyweight had his night halted in just 55 seconds Saturday when Pavlovich (15-1 MMA 4-1 UFC) rocked him with an early flurry in their main card bout at American Airlines Center in Dallas.

Although Lewis unquestionably was staggered and hit the canvas he immediately protested the stoppage when Miragliotta jumped in to wave it off. The crowd showered the octagon with boos fellow fighters complained on social media and only Pavlovich and his team were left happy.

“I think it was too soon but to be fair – I think Miragliotta’s a great ref – the way that he fell probably nine out of the 10 people in this room would’ve jumped on him and stopped the fight including me” White told reporters including MMA Junkie at the UFC 277 post-fight news conference. “I like the ref but I wouldn’t really debate that was an early stoppage. That was definitely an early stoppage.

“When you jump right back up like that and you’re ready to go – listen he was a little rocked but no more rocked than Julianna (Peña) was three four times in the fight and she fought five rounds. Miragliotta made a mistake and it happens. So I don’t think it diminishes Derrick Lewis at all. I would’ve liked to see that fight go on.”

This is a guest contribution by Rick Orford for SureDividend

Are you looking for the best REIT ETFs in 2022? With interest rates rising REITs are certain to face downward pressure due to mortgage costs. Yet REITs that invest in real property may fare better during high inflation. The question is whether the two will cancel each other out.

REIT ETFs often provide a more attractive dividend than bonds. Moreover REIT ETFs offer further diversification by holding a basket of REITs to reduce portfolio risk. Further dividend income is a key for those wanting to learn how to become financially independent.

For this article we sifted through hundreds of real estate ETFs. Then we sorted the ETFs and chose unique REIT ETFs that contain significant assets.

What Is An ETF?

ETFs are funds that hold stocks and perhaps other ETFs. Indeed it’s understandable if investors think a mutual fund does the same. However unlike a mutual fund ETFs are traded on the secondary market (i.e. instantly traded) rather than directly with the mutual fund company. Further investors who buy and sell ETFs get the advantage of having the trade settled when they buy or sell. Summing it up one could say that an ETF is a fund that trades like a stock.

ETFs can hold assets such as stocks other ETFs foreign currencies and even commodities such as gold. While most ETFs attempt to replicate the performance of an index such as the S&P 500 or Nasdaq many others serve other purposes.

Passive Managed ETFs

Passively managed ETFs are the most common type of ETF. The fund manager automatically chooses a basket of assets such as individual REITs and rebalances once or twice a year. These types of ETFs often seek to replicate an Index’s performance like the Dow Jones U.S. REIT Index which tracks the performance of U.S. REITs.

Also due (in part) to its turnover expense ratios are often low.

Active Managed ETFs

Investors choose Actively Managed ETFs because they seek higher than average returns. But it comes at a cost. Indeed actively managed ETFs have higher expense ratios (they cost more) because a manager spends more time managing the portfolio. However the returns have the potential to beat the index. For this article I focus on actively managed REIT ETFs.

What’s A REIT?

A REIT is also known as a Real Estate Investment Trust. You can see Sure Dividend’s full REIT list here.

A REIT is a publicly-traded company that owns operates or finances income-producing assets involving real estate. The most common REITs involve real estate properties that generate revenue from rents such as apartment buildings.

I’d forgive an investor who thinks a REIT is a dividend stock. REITs trade on the secondary market like stocks do and they pay dividends as many stocks do. However unlike typical publicly-traded companies REITs must distribute at least 90% of their income to investors.

Related: Dividend investing versus real estate investing.

And investors must remember the income is net of expenses to operate the business. As a result investors would receive less money than managing the same properties themselves. But that’s a trade-off REIT investors are happy to make.

REIT Risks

REITs often use leverage to grow. In other words like most Americans who buy homes using mortgages so do REITs when they purchase income-producing properties. Of course REITs will borrow significantly more than the average single-family home. Furthermore REITs will often borrow on a variable interest basis. As a result REITs usually pay less interest when mortgage rates drop. And similarly REITs will pay more interest when mortgage rates increase as they are in 2022.

Historically mortgage rates drop when the Federal Reserve needs to stimulate the economy as in March 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis. On the other hand mortgage rates rise when the economy is doing well – primarily to curb inflation.

When it comes to REITs however one of the biggest risks is: “Does the REIT have enough demand?”. In other words is vacancy going to be a risk? When it comes to REIT ETFs however the answer might not be clear as the fund might invest in hundreds of REITs.

Are REITs A Good Investment?

REITs allow investors to participate in a specific real estate market without directly holding and managing the real estate. Let’s say I wanted to own apartment buildings. I could either buy the apartment buildings and manage them on my own. Or I could buy a REIT or REIT ETF that offers exposure to apartment buildings. There are many excellent resources for Real Estate investing.

I probably won’t make as much money with the REIT or the ETF as owning the assets directly. However REITs are more attractive to investors than those wanting to own the underlying real estate. To be sure while the risks are similar it’s much less work owning the REIT or the REIT ETF!

What’s A REIT ETF?

REIT ETFs offer diversification and reduce portfolio risk by investing assets in many different REITs. This way the portfolio should mitigate a single REIT’s disappointing news should it come.

Furthermore REIT ETFs can come in the “leveraged” form. These leveraged REIT ETFs may offer investors a potential 2x or 3x return on an index and may include a “bull” or “bear” in the name. And they profit when REITs in the portfolio go up or down in value. For example a 3x Bear REIT ETF aims to produce the investor 3x the returns in a falling market. However we intentionally left out these types of leveraged ETFs due to their risks.

REIT Taxation

REIT taxation isn’t as straightforward as owning a stock. REITs avoid paying corporate tax by distributing 90%+ of their income to investors. As a result the tax burden passes to the investor.

Investors who receive income from REITs are getting a combination of income short and long-term capital gains (and losses) and non-qualified dividends. As a result it may be better to hold REITs and REIT ETFs in tax-sheltered accounts to ease the burden.

However those who chose to hold REITs and REIT ETFs in taxable accounts can rest assured they will get a 1099-DIV and 8937 forms that account for all the income.

What Are the Best REIT ETFs?

Now that you’ve read through the background on REITs and REIT ETFs I’ll cover the Best REIT ETFs. In this list I’ll evaluate the following:

Is the dividend safe? How likely will they continue to pay?

Does the dividend grow? A stagnant dividend could mean a stagnant business.

How long has the ETF been in business? Longevity is security.

Total assets within the fund. More assets mean additional market participation.

When does the dividend pay? Annually Semi-Annually Or Monthly?

Is it liquid and can you quickly sell the REIT ETF?

Costs: Are the management fees low?

The Cheat Sheet

Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ) Vanguard Global ex-U.S. Real Estate ETF (VNQI) Global X Data Center REITs & Digital Infrastructure ETF (VPN) Pacer Benchmark Industrial Real Estate SCTR ETF (INDS) SPDR DJ Wilshire Global Real Estate ETF (RWO)

Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ)

The Vanguard Real Estate is an ETF that invests in real estate investment trusts that purchase office buildings hotels and other real estate properties. The goal is to track the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index designed to capture the large mid and small-cap segments of the U.S. equity universe.

With 174 holdings this is the biggest REIT on the list with assets exceeding $82.8 billion and a low expense ratio of just 0.12%. It’s no wonder that VNQ is a popular choice among investors. Some of VNQ’s top holdings include:

Vanguard Real Estate II Index Fund

Prologis Inc.

American Tower Corp.

Crown Castle International Corp.

Equinix Inc.

Notably 0% of the holdings are international.

Why Do We like VNQ?

The Vanguard Real Estate ETF is a highly liquid security that exposes investors to various U.S. real estate classes. With a competitive dividend yield of 2.19% a 1 Year Total return of 1.99% and a 5-year average return of 7.81% annually VNQ is one of the best REIT ETFs investors can choose. Not only that VNQ is one of the few real estate funds that hasn’t lost money in the last 12 months.

Vanguard Global ex-U.S. Real Estate ETF (VNQI)

The Vanguard Global ex-U.S. Estate is an ETF that invests in real estate investment trusts that purchase REITs in 30 countries other than the U.S. The goal is to offer investors exposure to a broad range of international real estate and mimic the S&P Global Ex U.S. Property NR USD performance.

The previous year has been difficult for international real estate. With 702 holdings and assets exceeding $5.1 Billion VNQI returned -13.2% over the past year. Its 5-year return is 1.41% annually and offers investors a low expense ratio of just 0.12% VNQI could be ideal for investors seeking international real estate exposure (at a potentially fair price).

Some of VNQI’s top holdings include:

Vonovia SE

Goodman Group

Mitsui Fudosan Co. Ltd.

Mitsubishi Estate Co. Ltd.

Mitsui Fudosan Co. Ltd.

Notably none of the holdings are U.S.-based.

Global X Data Center REITs & Digital Infrastructure ETF (VPN)

Investors looking to capitalize on the Internet’s growth can look to the newly created Global X Data Center REIT & Digital Infrastructure ETF. Indeed VPN invests in property that houses the servers that power the Internet (Data Centers) and other digital infrastructure. And thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic forcing just about everyone to work from home it’s no surprise that data centers were recently the best performing REIT.

Since its inception VPN has increased its assets to $83.11 Million and it invests in 24 different REITs. Their top holdings include:

American Tower Corp.

Crown Castle Intl Corp.

Equinix Inc.

Digital Realty Trust Inc.

China Tower Corp LTD-H

Why Do We Like It?

Data center space is nearly recession-proof. The current SEC Yield on VPN is 1.39%. We feel VPN could offer investors significant gains over the long term. Since its inception (10/27/2020) VPN has returned 7.75%.

Pacer Benchmark Industrial Real Estate SCTR ETF (INDS)

The Pacer Benchmark Industrial REIT ETF is another newcomer to the ETF world. With an inception date of 5/14/2018 INDS offers investors a rules-based approach that attempts to replicate the Benchmark Industrial Real Estate SCTR Index.

INDS has over $314 Million in 20 assets and charges a competitive 0.6% expense ratio. As of 3/31/2022 this ETF has 86.32% of its assets in industrial REITs and 13.68% in warehouse REITs.

Since its inception INDS has grown 22.65% annually. That said its one-year return is -9.25%. While the dividend yield is just 1.58% we feel there could be room to grow. Indeed the distribution tends to move up and down based on net income for the period and the current yield is based solely on the last distribution.

SPDR DJ Wilshire Global Real Estate ETF (RWO)

The SPDR DJ Wilshire Global Real Estate ETF seeks to replicate the Dow Jones® Global Select Real Estate Securities Index’s total return performance. Indeed this REIT ETF holds a diversified mix of assets in the U.S. and abroad.

RWO currently has more than $1.336 Billion in assets and manages them at a competitive 0.50% fee. Further the top five holdings include:

Prologis Inc.

Public Storage

Final Thoughts

Finding the best REIT ETF for your portfolio comes down to what diversification you’re seeking. Investors who buy a combination of VNQ and VNQI can say “I have real estate in my portfolio” and they’d be right. That combination offers broad international diversification that would be impractical to reproduce. However those looking to pick a sector to outperform the overall real estate sector need only look at a more specialized REIT ETF.

It is estimated that more than 190000 people half of them children have been made to flee since March to the territories of Rutshuru and Nyiragongo.

UNICEF DRC Representative Grant Leaity recently visited Rutshuru and Kalengera to meet displaced people. Their presence in the area has in places more than doubled the population with displaced people and host community families urgently requiring food household items health equipment and water and sanitation assistance.

""Thousands of children are at risk” he said. “They have very limited access to the basic social services they need to survive in this crisis which is likely to continue as families are unable to return to their villages.

""UNICEF has stepped up its activities to strengthen its response to displaced families host populations and people living next to the conflict zone.

“However the magnitude of this crisis means that in general humanitarian assistance is slow to arrive while needs continue to grow alarmingly.

“In the absence of assistance some displaced people are forced to return to their villages of origin located in the highly volatile areas between the positions of the belligerents.”

Mr Leaity said it was “imperative to react now” if a significant increase in the number of children suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition was to be prevented.

UNICEF and its partners in Rutshuru and Kalengera are providing assistance in the areas of child protection nutrition immunization water hygiene and sanitation cholera response essential household items (EHI) and education.

Over the past three months they have:

Installed 272 latrines and 132 emergency showers were in reception areas for displaced families while ensuring that more than 40000 people are made aware of hygiene issues;

Organized rapid interventions against cholera by distributing prevention kits to 3500 families;

Distributed emergency items to nearly 4720 displaced families through the Rapid Response Programme (UniRR) while providing health kits and nutritional inputs to four health facilities;

Arranged for the care of 654 children suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition and raised awareness of good nutritional practices among 1500 people;

Assisted 648 children who were separated from their families 482 of whom were reunited with their guardians and 165 of whom were placed with foster families;

Provided psychosocial support to over 2000 children through Child Friendly Spaces;

Assisted 350 displaced students in Uganda to sit their State Examination in Rutshuru;

Provided recreational kits to 900 students and improved learning conditions in nine schools;

Sensitised more than 3000 people on the prevention of gender-based violence.

Insecurity and access to displaced people remain a major challenge for humanitarian actors in North Kivu province along with insufficient resources available to scale up the response.

UNICEF is calling on its international and domestic all partners to support humanitarian assistance programmes in Rutshuru so that affected populations can regain access to basic but essential services.

The childrens’ agency has also called on all parties to the conflict to protect children at all times and to facilitate access to the services necessary for their survival and well-being.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZG9taW5pY2FuLm5ld3MvbG9jYWwvd2hhdC1pcy10aGUtY29zdC1vZi1zdGFybGluay1pbi10aGUtZG9taW5pY2FuLXJlcHVibGljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is The Cost Of Starlink In The Dominican Republic?,"After the announcement that the satellite internet of Starlink the company of the American tycoon Elon Musk is now available throughout the Dominican Republic the company made public the prices and characteristics of the service.

Catching that imperfection is often reserved for trained personnel on an automobile assembly line.

Such was the situation for Stellantis N.V. at its Brampton Assembly Plant in Ontario Canada until 2018. That year the company (formerly known as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.) implemented an automated gap-and-flush inspection system by Cognex Corp.

The change was made for several reasons. For one manual inspection requires the use of contact gauge tools that often scratch vehicles. Manual inspection is also more time consuming and offers no assurance that measurements are taken at the exact same point from one vehicle to the next.

In addition manual gap-and-flush checks are done by batch instead of by individual vehicle. As a result the potential existed for vehicles to pass through the line with unacceptable door geometries. This ultimately required more resources to identify and correct errors.

The Cognex system in contrast offers simple accurate and noncontact inspection. It consists of four DS1300 laser profilers two In-Sight VC200 machine vision controllers and an encoder connected to a Rockwell Automation PLC.

Stellantis engineers have two specific goals for the system which is positioned directly after the door assembly station on the production line and before painting. One is to ensure that the gap between doors and panels on each Chrysler 300 Dodge Challenger and Dodge Charger is consistently within 0.2 millimeter of their design specification. The other is that their doors are flush or planar to neighboring panels within 0.3 millimeter.

For added flexibility the Cognex system automatically adjusts its operation based on vehicle body style and whether it features two or four doors. System operation begins with the encoder tracking each vehicle frame as it moves down the production line.

When the PLC determines that a particular model is within 1 inch of the target area it triggers the laser profilers—two on either side of the vehicle—via the controllers. Each profiler in turn makes a 2D profile of the door (at the top and near the bottom) after collecting data on its leading and trailing edges.

Because the profiler has a long measurement range there is no risk of any vehicle scratching or a pinch point safety hazard to workers. In addition system design discourages them from trying to pass between the profiler measurement system and automobile body during operation.

Stellantis especially likes that each profiler provides a highly accurate measurement on the Z axis. This capability verifies when both body panels are on the same plane or if there are subtle differences that indicate they are out of tolerance.

The VC200 controller stores the most recent 5000 gap-and-flush measurements enabling engineers to download data as needed for reports and later analysis. These measurements are also recorded against vehicle history in the manufacturer’s Performance Feedback System which allows for easy reference and correlation.

Best of all the Cognex system provides 100 percent door and fender panel position compliance.

With Vince McMahon gone and WWE transitioning to the Triple H era (better name TBD by company and/or fans) never mind the supposed shift to a TV-14 rating SummerSlam sits positioned as the jumping-off point. Especially so given the show's obvious weak point—yet another main event featuring Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar.

It was easy to feel this way even before McMahon's departure from the company. Reigns is clearly sliding into a reduced role and yet still clutches both top men's titles. Lesnar feels like an emergency route after injuries to the likes of Cody Rhodes and a dwindling talent pool of part-time Superstars.

But things took another interesting twist recently with a supposed ""injury"" to Riddle the man originally slated to be Seth Rollins' opponent on the show.

Then...this:

There's also this report from WrestleVotes to raise a Rock-styled eyebrow at:

Feels like something is amiss right? And maybe it should be. WWE has strangely skirted around the history between Rollins and Reigns for a long time now perhaps because he's the only guy legitimately capable of taking down his former ally in The Shield.

And Rollins is after all the guy who pulled off the heist of the century at WrestleMania 31 during yet another Reigns vs. Lesnar making for one of the biggest 'Mania moments ever.

There is no bigger wow-worthy moment than Rollins coming out of literally nowhere to steal titles again. We know Reigns isn't losing to Brock otherwise not with sights on the next 'Mania and perhaps The Rock. We could chat about Austin Theory and his Money in the Bank briefcase but that feels far too obvious far too premature and far too...Vinceish.

The biggest perceived hurdle to this of course is actually getting Rollins in the match. But this is WWE and the company has long done whatever it wants whenever and explain it away.

It could be as simple as Triple H aligning with him again and putting him in the match. Or perhaps he describes it as the dawn of a new era. Maybe WWE could finally acknowledge that Rollins has inexplicably been overlooked time and again when he's really the No. 1 contender in the company.

Through shenanigans only possible in pro wrestling Rollins could steal Theory's briefcase. Who cares? Get him in the match or playing some sort of role and have him steal at least one of Roman's titles.

This isn't just about a shock moment either. Booking for moments instead of long-term storytelling is part of why WWE has had so many problems over the years. But getting a title on Rollins could let him carry the company while Reigns falls into more of a part-timer role. He could feud with the likes of Theory and inevitably have that Shield showdown at something like 'Mania down the road.

With Reigns seemingly already on a lesser workload there's a timer on how many chances WWE will have left to do a good feud between him and Rollins anyway. The long-term story is right there and those two headlining a 'Mania would show the company direction is now about homegrown guys not part-time legends or outsiders.

Reigns' double title reign is stale and has fizzled out. This is the perfect excuse to throw a major wrench in its trajectory and create compelling storytelling opportunities. With Rollins there's no lack of a credible opponent like there is with Reigns right now (who can actually beat him if he goes on to best Rock too?).

Given WWE's past it's easy to feel pessimistic that Rollins just gets another surprise opponent at SummerSlam and Reigns Theory shenanigans or not emerges on top yet again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyZXN0bGluZ2luYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA3L3NldGgtcm9sbGlucy1yZXNwb25kcy10by1yb2FkLWRvZ2ctYmFkLWhhYml0LXJlbWFyay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seth Rollins Responds To Road Dogg 'Bad Habit' Remark,"Seth Rollins Responds To Road Dogg ‘Bad Habit’ Remark

Recently Seth ""Freakin'"" Rollins did an interview with the German news outlet SPORT1. There Rollins was asked about recent comments made about him by former NXT Trainer the ""Road Dogg"" Jesse James.

James said that while in ""NXT"" Rollins would become annoyed with the advice given to him by James and other former wrestlers who helped train superstars in ""NXT.""

When asked about these comments Rollins said ""I used to be pretty stubborn that's true and that was a problem starting in WWE twelve years ago and going through the NXT roster.""

Of course before being known as names such as the Beast Slayer The Messiah and The Architect Rollins was in NXT for the first two years of his WWE career. Appearing on the unaired season of the original ""NXT"" and FCW before the latter was rebranded into the ""NXT"" brand we knew for nearly ten years. There Seth Rollins would become the inaugural ""NXT"" Champion before moving up to the main roster in November 2012 alongside Jon Moxley (then known as Dean Ambrose) and Roman Reigns.

Seth Rollins continued saying ""You need the confidence to make it in the WWE but it was difficult for me. I must have also been because I came from a different world.""

When asked to elaborate on this Rollins said ""In independent wrestling which is where I grew up you're a lot more on your own you've got a lot more to figure out on your own.""It's a completely different world of experience and I wasn't quite prepared for it. As a result there was a lot of friction and strained working relationships and I almost burned my bridges.""

(Published 2022),"I have few stronger opinions about movie characters than my view that Miranda Priestly the demanding fashion-magazine boss in “The Devil Wears Prada” is actually the heroine of the movie. Not an uncomplicated heroine certainly not a nice person. But a figure to be celebrated nonetheless: a demanding uncompromising aesthete whose decisions ripple through the wider culture whose idiosyncratic taste can affect the palette of the world.

In one of the movie’s famous set pieces Miranda explains how her assistant’s cheap blue — sorry cerulean — sweater is actually “a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room” the bargain-basement endpoint of a complex aesthetic-commercial process that starts with a single brilliant idea.

I’m no fashionista (to put it mildly) but I still love that scene. So I was struck by Amanda Mull’s recent essay for The Atlantic suggesting its fundamental obsolescence. The Miranda Priestlys don’t rule fashion anymore Mull argues. The algorithm does.

Her essay starts with a seeming paradox: At a time when we “have more consumer choice than ever at least going by the sheer volume of available products” she writes “much of the clothing that ends up in stores looks uncannily the same.” The explanation she suggests is that fashion is increasingly separated from “the ideas and creative instincts of individuals” and directed instead by a combination of cheaper production models and forecasting systems that takes “the guesswork out of trends.” The production churns out fashions; the algorithm doubles down on whatever sells the fastest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS9uZXctamVyc2V5LXRyaWNrLW9yLXRyZWF0ZXJzLW1heS1mYWNlLWEtY2FuZHktc2hvcnRhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Jersey trick-or-treaters may face a candy shortage,"Heads up New Jersey! Your little goblin may be getting bags of pennies from your neighbors when they trick or treat this Oct. 31.

Hershey the big candy maker issued a warning this week that said a possible candy shortage may affect your Halloween pickings. The big concern is the shortage of raw ingredients which will cause a major candy capacity problem.

The shortage is a result of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine where restrictions have been made on Russian gas and oil imports which are specifically hurting the German import of supplies that aren’t going to make it to Pennsylvania and the world’s fifth largest candy maker.

According to an article in the Washington Post candy has seen an 11% gain in share in 2021 with an amazing $37 billion dollars in confectionary sales revenue.

The increase in candy sales across the board coupled with the lack of supplies coming from Europe have put a big stress on shelves now selling candy. Candy makers are at “all hands on deck” mode to keep the shelves stocked three full months before Halloween.

The Halloween scare at Hersey’s and Mars is very real. Not only is there a problem in Europe but here in the states there is a milk shortage that will add to the problems that candy makers are trying to ward off. The milk shortage is a result of one of the Borden Dairies' production facilities permanently closing its doors in Chicago. Borden Dairies has one of the country’s largest milk production plants. This closing in Chicago will affect mostly Illinois and Wisconsin retailers but those retailers are spreading out to get dairy deliveries outside their states to keep up the demand which will put more of a strain on the national market.

All in all we have three months to see how this shakes out. Hopefully it will be a Happy Halloween with lots of candy for your little trick-or-treaters and you too!

Edgar Delgado 31 of Passaic was arrested Friday for the crash in Clifton that prosecutors said happened earlier that day. The Passaic cop faces multiple charges including assault by auto causing serious bodily injury.

Passaic County Prosecutor Camelia Valdes said that Delgado was driving near the intersection of Central and Yereance Avenues early Friday morning. Shortly before 4:30 a.m. he crashed into a parked car according to Valdes.

Valdes said that when Clifton police got to the scene they found Delgado's car but not him.

Instead cops found a 28-year-old woman from Clifton in the passenger seat. She was taken to Saint Joseph’s University Medical Center.

""The investigation revealed that Mr. Delgado had been operating his vehicle recklessly under the influence of alcohol and left the scene following the crash"" Valdes said.

Along with the second-degree assault by auto charge Delgado faces three third-degree charges including leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident resulting in serious bodily injury endangering an injured victim and hindering apprehension. He is also charged with driving while intoxicated.

Up until now all guests were required to get a Covid-19 test completed prior to their cruise regardless of vaccination status.

Too much capacity followed by COVID-19 in addition to other factors changing the course of the local business all of the vessels are now sailing elsewhere.

Here’s what happened to all of the former China-bound newbuilds:

Ovation of the Seas

Company: Royal Caribbean International

Built: 2016

Capacity: 4100 guests

Tonnage: 158000

Current Sailing Region: North America

The Ovation of the Seas became the first Royal Caribbean International newbuild to debut in China when it arrived in Tianjin in 2016.

With several custom-designed features the Quantum-class ship continued to serve the local market until 2018.

Beginning in 2019 the ship started to alternate summer seasons in North America – where it is currently sailing – and winter seasons in Australia.

Genting Dream

Company: Dream Cruises (Genting Cruise Lines)

Built: 2016

Capacity: 3400 guests

Tonnage: 150000

Current Sailing Region: Southeast Asia

As the first cruise ship to enter service for Dream Cruises the Genting Dream originally served the Chinese market.

With several features to cater to Chinese guests the Genting-owned cruise ship had already been repositioned out of China when the pandemic broke in 2020.

The health crisis however led to the collapse of Genting Cruise Lines and Dream Cruises. After a few months laid up waiting for a new operator the 2016-built vessel was chartered by Resorts World Cruises in mid-2022.

Norwegian Joy

Company: Norwegian Cruise Line

Built: 2017

Capacity: 4200 guests

Tonnage: 163000

Current Sailing Region: North America

Norwegian Cruise Line made a grand entrance into the Chinese market in 2017 with the Norwegian Joy.

Built at the Meyer Werft shipyard the vessel was custom designed to serve the local market with exclusive features that include a virtual reality gaming center a tearoom and more.

The vessel was pulled out of China in early 2019. Following a refit – that removed all of the ship’s original purposely-designed features – the vessel repositioned to the North American market in time for a summer program in Alaska.

Majestic Princess

Company: Princess Cruises

Built: 2017

Capacity: 3600 guests

Tonnage: 141000

Current Sailing Region: North America

Following years of investment into the local market Princess Cruises decided to send a custom-design newbuild to China with the Majestic Princess.

The 2017-built vessel was considered the first built specifically for Chinese guests offering unique features such as a Cantonese restaurant a VIP casino a tea bar and karaoke rooms.

The Chinese venture however proved to be short with the brand dropping plans for a year-round deployment in the country just months after the debut of the 3600-guest ship. Initially redeployed to Taiwan and Australia for most of the year the Majestic Princess arrived in the North American market – where it’s currently sailing – in 2021.

World Dream

Company: Dream Cruises (Genting Cruise Lines)

Built: 2017

Capacity: 3400 guests

Tonnage: 150000

Current Sailing Region: Laid-up

The World Dream entered service for Dream Cruises in 2017. Sporting several features for the local market the vessel originally offered an upscale product in China.

With Genting Cruise Lines collapsing earlier this year the ship continues to wait for a decision regarding its future while laid up in Southeast Asia.

Norwegian Encore

Company: Norwegian Cruise Line

Built: 2019

Capacity: 4200 guests

Tonnage: 163000

Current Sailing Region: North America

Norwegian Cruise Line originally planned to send the fourth Breakaway Plus-Class cruise ship to China.

The vessel which later became the Norwegian Encore would add capacity to the local market which was already being service by the 2017-built Norwegian Joy.

The plans however were scrapped while the ship was still being built at the Meyer Werft shipyard. Instead of China the Norwegian Encore debuted in the North American market where it’s still sailing to this day.

Spectrum of the Seas

Company: Royal Caribbean International

Built: 2019

Capacity: 4200 guests

Tonnage: 168666

Current Sailing Region: Southeast Asia

Royal Caribbean International sent a second newbuild to China in 2019 with the Spectrum of the Seas.

As the first Quantum Ultra-Class vessel the 4200-guest ship was designed with new features to cater to the local market including an expanded VIP suite enclave and a set of new Asian specialty restaurants.

With the COVID-19 hitting Asia first the Spectrum was briefly redeployed to Australia in early 2020 before entering a long lay-up status. Currently the ship is offering short cruises departing from Singapore’s Marina Bay Cruise Terminal.

Costa Venezia

Company: Costa Cruises

Built: 2019

Capacity: 4232 guests

Tonnage: 135500

Current Sailing Region: Mediterranean

The Costa Venezia entered service in 2019 as Costa Cruises’ first designed-for-China newbuild.

Built in Italy the 135500-ton vessel offers custom-designed features including a karaoke entertainment complex and larger casino and shopping areas.

With the pandemic the ship spent most of the last three years laid-up in Asia. Currently in service for Costa Cruises in the Eastern Mediterranean the ship will be positioned in North America starting in 2023 kicking off a series of cruises from New York City for the new Costa by Carnival concept.

Costa Firenze

Company: Costa Cruises

Built: 2020

Capacity: 4232 guests

Tonnage: 135500

Current Sailing Region: Mediterranean

A sister to the Costa Venezia the Costa Firenze was set to debut in China in late 2020. Also custom-designed to serve the local market the 4232-guest cruise ship was equipped with several unique features.

The pandemic however forced Costa Cruises to change plans for the vessel. Unable to sail to Asia the Firenze debuted in Europe in 2021 and has been serving Western markets ever since.

After a winter season in Brazil the vessel is now set to debut in the United States in 2024 offering West Coast cruises under the Costa by Carnival concept.

Wonder of the Seas

Company: Royal Caribbean International

Built: 2022

Capacity: 5448 guests

Tonnage: 227625

Current Sailing Region: Mediterranean

Currently the world’s biggest cruise ship the Wonder of the Seas was originally bound for year-round service in China.

Featuring interior designs and concepts to appeal to the local public the Royal Caribbean International ship was set to debut in the Chinese market in mid-2021 offering a series of cruises departing from Shanghai.

The pandemic however led the company to deploy the Oasis-class vessel in the Western Hemisphere with a series of Mediterranean and Caribbean itineraries.

Global Dream

Company: Dream Cruises (Genting Cruise Lines)

Built: 2022

Capacity: 5000 guests

Tonnage: 208000

Last Updated 2 years ago

Two of the world's largest cruise lines Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruise Line have each made the decision to ease various testing requirements and restrictions for sailings. The cruise industry has been through significant upheaval throughout the course of the pandemic with their entry requirements rules and restrictions changing several times as businesses fought to keep cruises open for business and safe for all travelers. However following the CDC's decision to drop its cruise program earlier this month restrictions have been to ease once more.

The next steps towards normality the two cruise giants' decisions to ease their testing requirements are set to be welcomed by travelers and could help to make cruises more popular than ever in the coming months – particularly as air travel remains a mess at present. Here's everything you need to know about the changes being made by Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruise Line plus a look at recent changes made by other cruise lines.

Royal Caribbean Requirements Changes – Information For Travelers

Royal Caribbean's recently announced changes to its entry requirements are set to make sailing much more inclusive than it has been at any other point during the months of the pandemic. The cruise line giants – home to the world's largest cruise ship Wonder of the Seas are set to change the rules so that unvaccinated guests of any age are allowed to partake in their cruises once more for the first time during the pandemic putting cruise trips back on the map for millions of potential passengers.

Unvaccinated cruise passengers will be permitted to sail on Royal Caribbean cruises once more providing that they take a Covid-19 test within 3 days of the cruise's departure. The change is set to go live from August 8th and will apply to all unvaccinated travelers – not just those under 12 as the previous rules decreed. Whilst exact details such as the type of test and specific destination-related requirements are yet to be confirmed the cruise line announced they will be releasing more details on August 1st.

It's not just good news for unvaccinated cruise guests either – vaccinated travelers have also been given something to celebrate recently too. Until now vaccinated guests were required to take a PCR or rapid antigen test up to 2 days before sailing. However starting from August 8th cruise guests who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer need to take a pre-departure test if their cruise is fewer than six nights long. The policy change is another great leap back towards business as usual as cruise lines across the country take a measured approach to repealing their Covid-19 related restrictions.

Carnival Cruise Changes – What Travelers Should Know

Much like Royal Caribbean Carnival Cruise Lines have also made changes to the testing requirements making sailing a more attractive proposition to the masses. The company announced that from August 4th they will be removing all pre-cruise testing requirements for fully vaccinated guests on short cruises of 5 nights or less. The cruise line also added that they would be introducing further changes in the future giving hope to the idea that all Covid-19 era policies would soon be phased out.

Carnival also changed testing requirements for cruises that are bound to make sailing easier for unvaccinated guests. Previously unvaccinated passengers were required to take a PCR two days prior to embarkation. However this is no longer the case. Now unvaccinated guests can take either a PCR or antigen test up to three days before embarkation – giving them a more comfortable window to get tested in and saving them some money at the same time.

Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruise Line aren't the only cruise lines to make changes recently. Virgin Voyages have also gotten in on the act removing pre-embarkation testing for EU cruises on July 24th and from July 27th on U.S. based trips as well as dropping their vaccinated passengers quota to 90% from 100%. With the CDC no longer controlling the policies of cruise lines we're expecting to see even more changes coming over the next few months.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

""Smoking Joe Biden. Cadaver Joe Biden. I never thought I would say this. I'm not voting for you. You're not getting my vote"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpyLWphY2stc2NobG9zc2JlcmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using Cartoonish Accents J.F.K.'s Grandson Insults and Mocks Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. in a series of mocking meant-to-be-funny videos that were inarguably uncharacteristically un-Kennedyesque escalating a civil war within America’s most storied political dynasty.

In a series of Instagram posts the grandson Jack Schlossberg 31 variously called Mr. Kennedy 70 a “prick” suggested he was using steroids said he was “lying to us” and portrayed him as a Russian stooge and a stalking horse for Donald J. Trump.

But what viewers may be more struck by or even insulted by are the heavily accented caricatures the young scion used to dramatize his points.

Biden’s team however argued in court that this ban violates the Second Amendment. They pointed to a recent Supreme Court decision New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen which constrained the government’s power to regulate gun ownership.

Judge Maryellen Noreika however was unpersuaded. Norieka who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump noted that while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the drug-user ban to be unconstitutional in one situation — specifically as applied to a habitual marijuana user — that court explicitly emphasized that its decision was quite narrow. And she wrote that the “vast majority” of district courts who have reviewed the drug-user ban in the post-Bruen world have upheld it as constitutional.

She added that Biden can still challenge the constitutionality of the statute as it was applied to him once his trial is complete.

In a separate ruling also handed down on Thursday Noreika ruled against a motion Biden had filed seeking documents the Justice Department possesses involving communications between or among Donald Trump former Attorney General William Barr and other Trump-era senior department officials regarding the Biden case.

Earlier Thursday a three-judge panel on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the president’s son on a separate group of motions. Biden had sought to have the charges against him dismissed for several other reasons arguing he was the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution and that a pretrial diversion agreement he and prosecutors both signed last summer bars the government from charging him.

The federal judges ruled that Biden cannot make those arguments until after his trial is completed. Abbe Lowell his lead defense lawyer said in a statement that the team will appeal the panel’s decision.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpbGJlcnRzb25mdW5lcmFsaG9tZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wZXRlci1sYXR1cm51c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter S. Laturnus Obituary 2024,"Peter S. (Pete) Laturnus

December 30 1934 – May 09 2024

Peter S. Laturnus 89 of Munich ND passed away on May 09 2024 at CHI St Alexius Health Devils Lake Hospital.

Mass of Christian Burial for Pete will be held on Tuesday May 14 2024 at 10:30 a.m. at St Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich ND with Father Brian Moen celebrating the Mass. Burial will be at the St Boniface Catholic Cemetery. Visitation will be at the church one hour prior to the funeral Mass.

Peter Sebastian was born on December 30 1934 in Wilkin Saskatchewan Canada one of 13 children of Sylvester and Gunda (Steffan) Laturnus. He was the third youngest of the family. In 1945 the family moved to a farm near Starkweather North Dakota and later to Cando North Dakota where Pete attended Metcalf County school through the 8th grade. Several years later the family moved to a farm near Clyde North Dakota. Pete obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1960.

Pete worked with his brother-in-law Elmer Mueller for many years doing plumbing and heating work. When Elmer retired Pete started his own plumbing and heating business along with farming for many years at Calio N.D. He so loved the farm and could build and fix almost anything. He also enjoyed making his rounds on the farm in his golf cart. He built a go kart for his children and it has gone through all the grandchildren and now great grandchildren. It has been one of the many highlights of the kids going to the farm. Pete enjoyed his annual fishing trips with family and his many buddies over the years as well as spending time with family at the cabin at Red Willow.

Pete and Donna met at a dance in Calio and on November 19th 1956 were married at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Calio. They attended church in Calio and later St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich. Throughout their married years they were on the dance floor often dancing to their treasured waltzes and polkas. In later years they loved listening to the Sayler’s Polka Place music every Sunday afternoon and looked forward to occasional trips to the casino.

Pete was an active member of St. Boniface and St. Mary’s Catholic Church and was a life member of the Knights of Columbus.

Pete is survived by his beloved wife of 67 years Donna their children and spouses Dean (Kim) Laturnus Munich Daryl (Sandy Hendrickson) Laturnus Munich Dennis (Lori) Laturnus Grand Forks Steve (Donna) Laturnus Grand Forks and Bonnie (Alvin) Wald Bismarck along with 11 grandchildren; Deanna (Jeff) Heidi (Troy) Kayla (Brant); Amanda (Tyler); Justin (Jessica) Rebecca (Justin) Matthew (special friend Emily); Mitchel Conner Emma Dominic and 14 great grandchildren sister-in-law Helen Laturnus and many nieces and nephews.

The missing logos for the cloud-based software company Salesforce and the e-scooter rental giant Lime were both mentioned in a report on Friday by Mashable's Matt Binder.

The status of Helium's partnership with Lime was seriously in doubt after Russell Murphy Lime's senior director of communications told Mashable ""Beyond an initial test of its product in 2019 Lime has not had and does not currently have a relationship with Helium."" Lime indicated that as of Friday it was preparing a cease and desist letter addressed to Helium.

In a statement to Mashable Nova Labs Helium's parent company acknowledged Friday that Lime and Helium had grown apart after that 2019 product test. ""Lime has since restructured and the team members we worked with are no longer employed there"" the statement read.

Lime's supposed status as a client was not trivial but part of what appeared to be a core part of Helium's marketing pitch. Helium bills itself as a decentralized network of Internet of things (IoT) devices capable of providing their own connectivity where existing internet service providers can't or won't. Helium's hardware is in a sense only as good as the network of users keeping it functioning — except there's a bonus value proposition: the devices also mine a cryptocurrency $HNT whenever the network is used. And as long as major tech companies are customers there is in theory plenty of crypto to be mined.

In a New York Times story from February the use of the Helium network by Lime is cited as evidence that Helium is ""a real product used by real people and companies every day."" In fairness the Times story also mentions that Helium is used by the Victor mouse trap company as well — apparently for its line of IoT-enabled mouse traps — and the reality of that partnership does not appear to be in dispute at this time.

However as of yesterday Salesforce the other company associated with a logo now missing from Helium.com (and from the site's ""Enterprise"" page as well) had not commented publicly on its relationship with Helium.

UPDATE: August 2 2022 10:25 a.m. ET. A Spokesperson for Helium gave the following statement: ""Since the Network launched in 2019 we’ve worked with a variety of companies on various applications and pilots. In the case of the brands mentioned in recent articles we had approvals to talk about the use cases but we’re going to be much more rigorous now about the logo approval process going forward to avoid any confusion. Both Nova and our partner the Helium Foundation have removed the reference.""

What does the future hold for film studio Pathé? Its powerful boss is 87 and still very much in control of all the company's activities. But his large family is torn apart hurt by deep wounds.

One of the most beautiful private gardens in the world is nestled on the Pays de Caux cliffs in Normandy tucked into a lush green setting: the Bois-des-Moutiers. Located in the village of Varengeville this 12-hectare park was laid out at the end of the 19th century by a couple who loved nature and exceptional landscapes. In this unique place long open to the public appreciative souls can stroll between Chinese azaleas Himalayan rhododendrons Atlas cedars and Japanese maples. Claude Monet Pablo Picasso Marcel Proust André Breton Jean Cocteau Claude Debussy Maurice Ravel and Erik Satie all came here in search of quietude and inspiration.

This is this treasure that 87-year-old Pathé chairman Jérôme Seydoux bought in March 2019. Ever since his wife Sophie fell in love with the place he has embarked on a range of colossal renovations entrusting the building to famous designer Jacques Grange and the gardens' layout to Madison Cox a renowned landscaper and widower of businessman Pierre Bergé a former shareholder of Groupe Le Monde. As though the film tycoon had eternity ahead of him.

Fighting against time

Seydoux cuts a small lean figure. With his piercing blue gaze and fierce determination he is a man who fights against time and decline. He is a secretive Protestant with a cold and brusque manner. And a demanding boss. He is strict on his appearance and with what he eats and he's an accomplished sportsman (in golf skiing and gymnastics). Two years ago he was still skydiving. He makes sure he has renowned doctors around him and like other powerful people of his generation staves off death by working hard. ""At 50 he said he would stop 10 years later. At 60 he swore he would retire at 70. Ever since he's well past 80 he doesn't talk about anything anymore!"" a former Pathé employee joked. The big boss has ended up believing he is immortal.

Jérôme Seydoux Fornier de Clausonne whose company is valued at more than 1 billion euros is a special kind of heir; he refuses to consider his own succession. He goes to his office every day and engages energetically in new productions without telling anyone who will take over when the time comes. In the corridors of Pathé headquarters a stone's throw from the Champs-Elysées his underlings whisper about what will happen ""after"" but no one would dare ask the question out loud. When asked about it by Le Monde in 2013 Seydoux replied: ""I am not an artist but I share their belief that one should not retire and that it is appropriate to die on stage."" His succession is a taboo he never discusses. Needless to say he refused to talk to us about it once again.

Gemma Owen's pricey Jean Schlumberger Tiffany & Co. X's & O's Necklace is said to be worth £20000 - and now viewers are wondering how much the prize money for winning Love Island would actually mean

Love Island fans were all left saying the same thing as Gemma Owen's prank on the boys backfired.

She pretended she lost her extravagant gold necklace during a challenge on Saturday night's Unseen Bits.

The teenager is never seen without her incredible £20000 chain - but viewers weren't impressed that she was drawing attention to the pricey item of jewellery.

The Jean Schlumberger for Tiffany & Co. X's & O's Necklace is often a topic of conversation.

She had to convince the boys her it had gone missing as the girls performed some undercover tasks.

Gemma is then seem stomping around looking for it.

But her acting skills were pretty terrible and she was quickly rumbled as she created a scene.

However those watching at home are now wondering how much the prize money for winning Love Island would matter.

Taking to Twitter one wrote: “Sorry but gemma especially doesn’t deserve to win considering her necklace is literally worth half the prize fund #LoveIsland #loveisland.”

Another said: “Not Ekin asking if Gemma’s necklace is expensive #LoveIsland.”

“’Is it expensive’ mate it’s the f**king cost of the prize money #LoveIsland #Loveislandaftersun.”

Fans of the show were left gutted after discovering the challenge had been axed from the main show.

First up had been Ekin-Su who was told to spill water over herself but blame Andrew for it and proceed to have a meltdown.

Andrew was left baffled and Tasha was forced to interject telling her to let Ekin cool off.

Next was Paige who awkwardly had to ask Luca to wait outside the toilets as she did a number two.

One tweeted: ""Why is the secret mission in the unseen bits episode? Why no parents this season? Why no tweet challenge? Producers are you ok? #LoveIsland.""

While another commented: ""I wondered if they would ever bring back the secret mission! It’s been years #loveisland.""

A third fumed: ""Did they actually do the secret mission...but put in it in Unseen Bits? Ffs man #LoveIsland.""

Another wrote: ""A SECRET MISSION? I LOVE THESE #LoveIsland.""

Update: It’s SSD-based. See +Comment 2 section below; 1 Aug 2022.

Ball Aerospace builds satellites and instruments involved in Earth science and operational environmental missions environmental monitoring weather forecasting emission tracking and water usage observation. It provides environmental intelligence on weather the Earth’s climate system precipitation drought air pollution severe storms vegetation and biodiversity measurements. Seagate is the disk drive market leader and has a small SSD business on the side.

Mike Gazarik VP Engineering at Ball Aerospace said in a statement: “There is a need for on-orbit high-density storage capabilities to meet new mission requirements – in essence space-ready storage that works and acts like terrestrial storage. Therefore we decided to collaborate on a proof-of-concept solution because Ball has the heritage and experience in designing and building space systems while Seagate has extensive data storage expertise.”

Ball Aerospace staff prepping a satellite

This collaboration involves planned lab and on-orbit demonstrations to test the concept which would include Seagate-built technology to support testing of space memory on a Ball-built payload.

Ed Gage VP of Seagate Research said: “We consider space the next frontier for data growth enabled by high-capacity low-cost secure storage devices. As a leader in our industry and with over 40 years of expertise we are uniquely positioned to solve the challenges of space systems that store large amounts of data.”

+Comment

Does this mean what we think it means: hard disk drives in orbiting satellites? They are certainly high-ish capacity at 20TB for Seagate currently and lower-cost than equivalent capacity SSDs. Disk drives in orbiting satellites need to be built in sealed enclosures so their air-driven head suspension works and they also need to withstand launch stresses and the low temperatures in space. A third concern is high levels of radiation in space and their electronics need hardening to withstand that. A fourth might be the drive’s inherent angular momentum from its rotating platters affecting the satellite’s positioning.

We can’t really see Ball collaborating with Seagate over SSDs in space as Seagate has a miniscule share of the SSD market and doesn’t build its own chips or controllers. It would make more sense for Ball to collaborate with a NAND foundry and SSD maker. We’ve asked Seagate to confirm that the collaboration focus is on disk drives.

+Comment 2

Ah we were wrong. A Seagate spokesperson said: “We’re working on a solid state-based SSD-based storage solution concept with Ball Aerospace for LEO (Low Earth Orbit) storage. We went with SSD because these LEO satellites are small lightweight unshielded unpressurized and lacking environmental temperature controls. Low-weight is also paramount in this application.”

A Seagate blog says: “Existing products in the radiation-hardened specialty storage market are typically expensive slow and devoid of the most recent technological advancements…. There are obstacles to hardening a commercial solid-state drive (SSD) for space. Commercial SSDs often use low-density parity codes for error recovery and have complex mapping tables and garbage collection. These lead to controllers with millions of gates which require modern photolithography (i.e. well below 20 nanometers) for suitable performance and power consumption.”

And: “Putting these controllers in a radiation-hardened application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is generally infeasible or very expensive. Most radiation-tolerant FPGAs are in older lithography nodes and are challenged for performance and gates. Radiation-hardened ASICs can cost millions of dollars to develop and with NAND flash chips changing every year or two can quickly become obsolete.”

“The flash used within SSDs poses an additional challenge. Flash chips are designed for high-volume consumer and enterprise applications here on Earth. Flash vendors spend billions of dollars in developing factories (“fabs”) specifically for these components. The designs of these chips change frequently as new innovations arise. Designing a flash chip specifically for space could cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in development.”

So: “We’ve developed a concept for a new secure aerospace data storage device designed with features that make it more robust for LEO and similar environments.

“The essence of the solution is to use radiation-tolerant/radiation-hard components only where critical or inexpensive and to use error detection and mitigation techniques for radiation-induced events—especially on expensive unavoidable soft components to minimize their impact. Care has been made to harden the areas of the design that are most critical for reliability and to use less-expensive commercial components where feasible.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Your little goblin may be getting bags of pennies from your neighbors when they trick or treat this Oct. 31.

Hershey the big candy maker issued a warning this week that said a possible candy shortage may affect your Halloween pickings. The big concern is the shortage of raw ingredients which will cause a major candy capacity problem.

The shortage is a result of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine where restrictions have been made on Russian gas and oil imports which are specifically hurting the German import of supplies that aren’t going to make it to Pennsylvania and the world’s fifth largest candy maker.

According to an article in the Washington Post candy has seen an 11% gain in share in 2021 with an amazing $37 billion dollars in confectionary sales revenue.

The increase in candy sales across the board coupled with the lack of supplies coming from Europe have put a big stress on shelves now selling candy. Candy makers are at “all hands on deck” mode to keep the shelves stocked three full months before Halloween.

The Halloween scare at Hersey’s and Mars is very real. Not only is there a problem in Europe but here in the states there is a milk shortage that will add to the problems that candy makers are trying to ward off. The milk shortage is a result of one of the Borden Dairies' production facilities permanently closing its doors in Chicago. Borden Dairies has one of the country’s largest milk production plants. This closing in Chicago will affect mostly Illinois and Wisconsin retailers but those retailers are spreading out to get dairy deliveries outside their states to keep up the demand which will put more of a strain on the national market.

All in all we have three months to see how this shakes out. Hopefully it will be a Happy Halloween with lots of candy for your little trick-or-treaters and you too!

On July 18 the social media platform (finally) launched a web version of the beloved app that lets you Chat Snap and Call your friends directly from your laptop but the web version isn’t available for everyone — yet. Here’s the rundown on the how use Snapchat for Web with your Snapchat+ subscription.

Get ready to see a major increase in your Snap Score because the long-awaited web version of Snapchat is here which means you’ll finally be able to connect with your besties from just about any device. All your favorite Snapchat messaging features aka Snapping Chatting and Calling are available in the online version of the app and work pretty much exactly the same way as the app does so if you’re a true Snap stan you’ll probably get the hang of the new platform quickly. The web version lets also lets you participate in multiple conversations at once by Chatting and Calling at the same time Chat Reply and Chat React and host group Video Calls just like the app does.

Snapchat for web is available now to users in in select countries and there’s a catch that involves shelling out a little bit of cash. Here’s what you need to know.

How To Get Snapchat For Web

Starting July 18 Snapchat for Web is only available in select regions but it’s not available to everyone — to use Snapchat on your laptop you have to be subscribed to Snapchat’s brand new subscription program Snapchat+ which launched on June 29 2022.

Snapchat+ is a monthly subscription service that allows users exclusive access to experimental and pre-release features including Snapchat for Web. The service costs $3.99 per month and is available in the United States Canada the United Kingdom France Germany Australia New Zealand Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with plans to expand to more countries down the line. That said Snapchat for Web is only available for Snapchat+ users in the United States United Kingdom Canada Australia and New Zealand.

To access the web version of Snapchat just open the Snapchat for Web website on your computer and enter your login information. Like other social media platforms Snapchat for Web lets users log into their already existing accounts to Chat Snap and Call so you’ll have access to all your usual group chats Bitmojis and more. To make sure the person logging into your account is you you’ll be asked to do a quick two-step verification process before you can start Chatting according to a Snapchat spokesperson.

How To Subscribe To Snapchat+

To subscribe to Snapchat+ for your chance to be one of the first to test out the new version of the platform all you have to do is open the Snapchat app navigate to your profile tap the Gear icon in the top right corner then tap Snapchat+. From there you’ll be able to choose between a one month six month or 12 month subscription plan.

If you don’t have the cash to spend on Snapchat+ you’ll still be able to try the web version for yourself but you’ll have to be patient. According to the Snapchat for Web blog post posted to the Snapchat website the feature will be available for all Snapchat users across the globe in the future.

How To Snap On Snapchat For Web

Once you’re logged into your Snapchat account on your laptop you’ll see all the users you’ve recently Snapped and Chatted with. If you want to send a Snap just treat the web platform like you would the app — click the name you want to Snap with or open an unopened Snap take your picture or video add your caption and send.

Unfortunately you won’t be able to add a Lens to your Snap right away but according to a Snapchat spokesperson users can expect to see Lenses for Calls and Snaps roll out soon.

Oh and BTW just because you have Snapchat for Web doesn’t mean your besties have to for a Snap to go through. Users who opt to use the web version of Snapchat can still Chat Snap and Call users who prefer to use the app and vice versa.

How To Chat On Snapchat For Web

To send a new message click the account you want to Chat with and the Chat page will open next to the list of your most recent Chats. Here you can type your message Chat React to another message and Chat Reply. According to a Snapchat spokesperson Chats will delete in 24 hours by default just like the app.

When using Snapchat for Web your icon in the chat will pop-up with a little laptop of its own to signify you’re using the web version.

How To Video Call On Snapchat For Web

You can also start either a regular Call or a Video Call from the Chat page too. To do so just click the Video Call or Telephone icon at the top of the chat and you’re good to go. After you’ve hit the Call button the other user’s icon and name will appear above the video and you’ll notice a timer will begin to keep track of how long you’ve been on the call for. You’ll also be able to mute your microphone turn off your camera whenever you need to and join a group Video Call with up to 10 Snapchatters as well according to a spokesperson.

If you’re in multiple conversations at once you can reposition the Call on your screen so that you can easily Chat with your bestie while remaining on a phone call with your SO. You can also Chat and Call a user at the same time or navigate away from the webpage without interrupting a Call.

As of now the web version doesn’t include any added Snap features like Stories but the company plans to roll out those aspects in the future according to a Snap spokesperson. Yup you won’t be able to see your crush’s Stories from your laptop but hang tight because it won’t be that way forever.

Snapchat For Web Privacy

According to a spokesperson Snapchat for Web includes some serious privacy measures to ensure that your messages are safe and secure. For starters if someone tries to screenshot your conversation the screen will blur out the convo and pop-up will appear that reminds users there are other ways to preserve conversations.

You also don’t have to worry about nosey bystanders getting a glimpse of your screen in public because Snapchat for Web comes equipped with a privacy shield that pops up when you pull up another window. So if you feel some sneaky eyes looking over your shoulder in the library all you have to do is pull up another page in the foreground and your conversation will be protected by a special privacy screen.

Between being able to Call Chat or Snap your friends from your laptop and all the future changes that are sure to come it looks like Snapchat for mobile is about to have some serious competition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTEwNjUwNDMvVmljdG9yaWEtQmVja2hhbS1zaGFyZXMtc3dlZXQtc25hcC1odXNiYW5kLURhdmlkLWRhdWdodGVyLUhhcnBlci0xMS1ob2xpZGF5Lmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTExMDY1MDQzL2FtcC9WaWN0b3JpYS1CZWNraGFtLXNoYXJlcy1zd2VldC1zbmFwLWh1c2JhbmQtRGF2aWQtZGF1Z2h0ZXItSGFycGVyLTExLWhvbGlkYXkuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Victoria Beckham shares a sweet snap of husband David and daughter Harper 11 on holiday,"Their currently enjoying a £1.6million-a-week superyacht trip in St Tropez.

David - who also shares sons Brooklyn 23 Romeo 19 and 17-year-old Cruz with his wife - cut a casual figure in a dark T-shirt and chinos while he wore his hair spiked and sported an unshaven face.

The father-daughter duo beamed for the camera as they laid back enjoyed some downtime from their trip which also took in the sights of Croatia.

Victoria also wrote: 'Love u all so much!!! Xxxx.'

The family have not been joined by eldest Beckham child Brooklyn or his new bride Nicola who were in the US celebrating her grandmother Bunny's 94th birthday on Sunday.

Fans have wondered for weeks if Victoria had a fall-out with her new daughter-in-law after they noticed that the pair - who used to fawn over each other's pictures online - have had virtual silence for quite some time.

The alleged fallout started at their wedding when it was reported that the former Spice Girls member and footballer David were not seated at their table.

An onlooker claimed that the Beckhams 'were not at the forefront' and that the 'wedding was all about the Peltz family'.

Since then Nicola and Victoria have scarcely liked each other's pictures on social media despite the fact that they used to always show support for one another online.

And rumors were intensified when fans noticed that Brooklyn was missing from his family vacation last week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9uZXdzLzE5Mzc4OTM1L2hpcHBvLXBob3RvLWdyaW1hY2luZy1wcm90ZWN0LXlvdW5nL9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9uZXdzLzE5Mzc4OTM1L2hpcHBvLXBob3RvLWdyaW1hY2luZy1wcm90ZWN0LXlvdW5nL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stunning snap of menacing hippo grimacing above water among entries for wildlife photo contest...,"HANGRY HIPPO Stunning snap of menacing hippo grimacing above water among entries for wildlife photo contest

Denise Welch stunned fans as she showed off her ""amazing"" figure while on holiday in Croatia.

The Loose Women regular panellist posed in a pink swimsuit while also wearing a black floral wrap and comfortable sandals as the sun shone on the former Coronation Street star.

Denise had travelled to the Balkan country to visit her youngest son Louis Heal who has followed in his mother's footsteps into the acting industry as he films 1920s drama Hotel Portofino.

She wrote: ""Back in Croatia to see @healytymd who is still filming Hotel Portofino.

""Anyway it’s beautiful here @amadriaparkopatija and we had a fantastic welcome back. My gorgeous wrap is from @tillettsclothing of course.""

Former Coronation Street and Emmerdale star Hayley Tamaddon replied: ""Stunning"" followed by three love heart emojis.

Another person commented: ""Wow your ageing very well. You look amazing.""

A third wrote: ""Omg you are such a gorgeous lady always stunning"" while a fourth person said: ""Looking fab Denise""

Denise added two more photos on her Instagram story with the first being similar to her main post as she posed for the camera.

The second snap saw Denise eventually convince agent Bex Elliff and son Louis for a selfie.

Earlier this month Denise shocked her co-stars on Loose Women when she revealed what her real name was.

Main anchor Charlene White and panellist Frankie Bridge couldn't believe 'Denise' wasn't actually her first name as she dropped the bombshell news.

During a segment about baby names and which parent had the final say when choosing a name for their child Denise confessed her real name has caused her problems her whole life.

She confirmed her real name was Jacqueline Denise Welch but that she'd always been called Denise since she was a child.

Speaking to her co-stars including Jane Moore Denise confessed it's ""annoying"" effectively having two different names.

Despite everyone knowing her as Denise Welch the star explained how this was not the name given to her when she was born despite it being the name she goes by.

She then surprised her co-stars as she said: ""But with me I'm Jacqueline Denise.""

The actress added: ""So my mother according to dad was going through a French phase and loved the idea of Jacqueline Denise.

""She'd been there once on a ferry and she thought Jacqueline Denise flowed better than Denise Jacqueline which is so annoying because I've been brought up with that.""

Victoria Beckham has taken to Instagram share an adorable snap of husband David Beckham and daughter Harper Seven 11 enjoying a beautiful sunset whilst on a family holiday in St Tropez. The ex-Spice Girl's post has amassed more than 61000 likes amid a potentially tense situation as there is rumoured to be a feud between Victoria and her new daughter-in-law Nicola Peltz.

Victoria and David Beckham 47 have been joined on the family holiday by their children Harper Seven Romeo and Cruz whilst eldest son Brooklyn has not joined the family for the £1.6million a week superyacht break. Brooklyn and his new wife Nicola are in the US to celebrate the birthday of Nicola's grandmother Bunny.

Victoria 48 captioned the St Tropez holiday snap: ""Happy summer!!! Kisses from Daddy and Harper Seven"". Fans have gone wild for the picture and shared their love for the Beckham family. One wrote: ""Love a father/daughter moment. Happy holiday memories. Enjoy.""

The singer shared the snap to her more than 30 million followers on Instagram and the snap showed David with spiky hair dark T-shirt and chinos with the sunset and ocean background. The post comes amid rumours of a feud in the family which allegedly began at Brooklyn's wedding to Nicola in April.

The mother and daughter-in-law used to be very close and would regularly comment on and like each other's pictures on social media but fans have noted that communication between the pair appears to have ground to a halt lately. It has been rumoured that the wedding was dominated by Nicola's family which saw the Beckham's hidden from the limelight.

Nicola and Victoria have barely liked any of each other's social media pictures since and Brooklyn's absence from the family holiday have stirred up more rumours of a rift.

The classic black-and-white photos from early decades of the American West often fail to capture the diversity of the people who came here. Chinese migrants helped build the railroads and were big in gold mining. Basque people from Spain became known for sheep herding. The first Filipino cannery workers arrived around the turn of the last century. Now Oregon archaeologists are on the surprising trail of Japanese families who lived in a now-vanished lumber company town.

The project promises to paint a fuller picture of who built the Pacific Northwest which is a favorite research target of archaeologist Chelsea Rose the director of the Southern Oregon University Laboratory of Anthropology. In her team's latest foray into Eastern Oregon they are literally digging into timber history.

""The story of logging is a white man's narrative"" Rose said. ""You not only don't see Japanese Chinese all the other folks that were working on these kinds of operations but you also don't see families. You don't see the women and children.""

Which brings us to the ruins of the former Baker White Pine Mill and the company town that once surrounded it in rural Grant County Oregon roughly a century ago — 1912 to 1930 to be more precise.

A forest of spindly pine trees has regrown on the property northeast of Prairie City. But sharp eyes and metal detectors helped Rose and a team of professional archaeologists and volunteers identify spots to dig where workers' homes might have been.

The scene had all the hallmarks you might associate with archaeology. There were grid markers and shallow square pits in the ground with people wielding trowels brushes buckets and sifting trays.

Working in the hot July sun the researchers needed only to scrape down a few inches before they began to uncover remnants of domestic life. The bounty included a delicate ring with inlaid gemstone and lots of shards of Western-style export Japanese porcelain some with distinctive dragon and cloud motifs.

""We are on an industrial site and we're finding doll arms marbles and tea sets. That really brings home this idea that families were part of these early industries in these remote areas"" Rose said during a lunch break. ""We need to broaden our understanding of what that looks like.""

The sawmill ruin and vanished company town are an unmarked U.S. Forest Service site now. Blue Mountain Ranger District archaeologist Katee Withee said the Forest Service might eventually install interpretive signs or add the site to an auto tour. When Withee was growing up in Eastern Oregon she said she had no idea Japanese workers a century ago built railroad spurs cooked in logging camps and hired on with area mills.

""It makes sense once you look at the Census records right"" Withee said. ""But that definitely wasn't something we were highlighting in eighth grade history.""

Records from the 1910 1920 and 1930 censuses included the names and occupations of dozens of immigrants and Japanese American families who lived in the township around the Baker White Pine Mill. They weren’t farmers that being a common assumption — and often a correct presumption — of what this group did a century ago.

The info coming out of the archaeological dig was sufficiently exciting and novel to entice Japanese American Museum of Oregon interim deputy director Mark Takiguchi and the museum's research coordinator James Rodgers to drive all the way from Portland to observe.

""This is so cooollll!"" Takiguchi burst out after walking around the large site.

""I'm really interested personally in finding out where they went"" Takiguchi said. ""What was the next chapter after this chapter closed? Where in Oregon or Idaho did they travel? What were the stories? I think we have some really exciting leads of living people we can pursue.""

Those would be descendants probably three generations removed from the names on the old census rolls.

""We're going to bring back some really exciting stories to our community"" Takiguchi vowed.

The genealogical sleuthing will happen simultaneously with the examination of thousands of artifacts collected from the lumber mill dig. The physical items were hauled back to the lab at Southern Oregon University in Ashland in late July. So far Rose said the researchers have been unable to link any artifacts or specific home sites to identifiable families but that is a key goal.

NOTE: After this story published a listener asked for more detail on why the company town had vanished in the first place.

The reason? The successive blows came from the closure of the Baker White Pine lumber mill circa 1930 and the shutdown of the rail line that served the mill and community a few years later. Rose said she suspects the lumber company or the former residents deconstructed the worker housing and carted off the salvaged wood to reuse somewhere else. That would explain why there are practically no standing remnants of an old ghost town and why the tools of archaeology are needed to suss out which buildings stood where.

“Without the mill and with the abandonment of the railroad there would be little reason or the ability for anyone to stay on in the associated community” added archaeologist Eric Gleason another member of the research and excavation team.

Earlier this year the transportation company announced that new conductor trainees in priority locations would have the opportunity to earn up to $5000 in starting bonuses. And one of those priority locations happens to be Harrisburg.

And recently it added some more incentives. The company announced that it has increased conductor trainee pay to $25 per hour with a minimum of $200 in earnings per shift. Additionally conductor trainees are eligible for an on-the-job training incentive of $300 per bi-weekly pay period provided they make themselves available to work.

“We are committed to ensuring our newest team members are well-compensated while they work toward qualifying as conductors” Brad Dodd director of talent acquisition at Norfolk Southern said in a news release. “Norfolk Southern is a great fit for those who want responsibility autonomy and take pride in the work they do.

Norfolk Southern conductors are guaranteed minimum annual pay of $52000 which increases over the first four years of service to a minimum of approximately $63500.

However Norfolk Southern says that conductors earn an average of $67000 in their first year and have the potential to earn more each year as they increase in levels of seniority. Conductors also participate in the Railroad Retirement System and have a 401(k) savings option and healthcare coverage.

“One of the clear benefits of our industry is the opportunity for future advancement and the potential for increased earnings” Dodd said. “Through their seniority conductors will be promoted to a locomotive engineer position that has guaranteed minimum annual pay of approximately $94000 along with benefits. Many of our engineers earn more than $100000 with the work opportunities at their locations.”

Potential applicants must be at least 18 years old and successfully complete a standard background check and meet physical requirements. No prior railroad experience is required.

Norfolk Southern conductors are responsible for the safe and efficient movement of freight trains. A conductor’s job can include coupling railcars to build trains delivering railcars to local customers and transporting trains hundreds of miles.

Conductor trainees should expect to complete a training program of approximately 16 weeks before promoting to a conductor position. The first three weeks of training occur at the Norfolk Southern Training Center in McDonough Georgia. The remaining weeks of training take place at or near their hiring location.

Speaking prior to the start of the weekend raceway President Ben May said between 80000 and 100000 people were expected to visit the facility between Friday and Sunday’s 400-mile NASCAR Cup Series race.

Friday’s schedule featured an ARCA race while a NASCAR Camping World Truck Series and NASCAR Xfinity Series doubleheader was held Saturday.

May said the raceway has a full-time staff of 20 to 30 people.

“It’s a small company a small staff” he said. “We balloon up to over 1000 people when it comes to race weekend. That includes ushers ticket scanners safety security everyone who helps park cars.”

May noted that some of those employees work for the raceway while others work for companies contracted by the track to work the NASCAR race weekend.

He also explained that the track has a large staff of firefighters.

“We have the third- or fourth-largest fire department in the state of Pennsylvania… once a year” May said.”We have such a huge staff of firefighters.”

Some of those responders work at the track beyond the NASCAR race weekends.

“The firemen are on our seasonal staff here” May said. “They are Pocono Raceway employees.

“Outside of our NASCAR weekend we have over 180 days of activity car clubs racing schools” he continued. “That’s where our fire department comes in.”

Some firefighters are typically at the facility daily April through October as on-track activities are taking place.

Those who work at the track live within a large radius of the raceway.

“We have our firemen and women they come from Pennsylvania New York New Jersey; same with our contractors” May said.

Those who work at the facility also have longevity in their employment.

May noted that he’s worked at Pocono Raceway for 20 years.

“We have two or three staff members that have been with us less than five years” he said. “Everybody else five to 50 (years).”

May noted that members of the Mattioli/Igdalsky families which own the track have worked there since they were children.

He said the raceway takes “a great bit of pride” in hiring employees who live in North Central Pennsylvania. Local companies are also contracted to handle HVAC repairs and other work at the facility.

“That’s something that’s very important to us our loyalty” May said. “It doesn’t make much sense to have contractors from Texas… We are a community-based company.”

A study conducted in 2014 found Pocono Raceway at that time had a $257 million economic impact on Pennsylvania according to May. However he noted that no study has been conducted since and he expects those numbers may be slightly different today.

Most notably May said at that time the track hosted two NASCAR race weekends each year as well as an IndyCar race. Today just one NASCAR race weekend is held. However the track has added a bi-annual airshow slated to return in 2023.

He indicated the Blue Angels will be featured at the 2023 show slated for Memorial Day weekend.

“As far as our local businesses go we hope when people come to the race we’ve given them an opportunity to stay in our region” May said."

Holly Petitt started her aviation career fresh out of college as a flight attendant working for another carrier. After riding the jumpseat in the flight deck she realized she wanted to learn to fly planes. She then got to work training and obtaining her certifications. Holly welcomed three beautiful kids and took flight lessons while supporting her family as a full-time mom. With the help of her amazing support system (her husband and mother) she was able to pursue her dream of being a pilot.

Naturally Holly's daughter Keely Petitt grew up around the Southwest Family and became an extension of it. At 14 Keely and her siblings received the gift of a discovery flight. In that moment she realized she wanted to follow in her mother's footsteps and become a pilot. Keely began to pursue her passion for flying airplanes earning her pilot's license and even landed an internship at Southwest in fall 2017. Our Campus Reach Internship Program created a runway for Keely to learn more about a career in aviation.

Keely loved everything about Southwest from the Culture to flying to everything in between and made it her goal to come back. ""Southwest was always the end goal for me"" said Keely. ""There was really never any other option."" After working hard and keeping in touch with her Cohearts she was able to find her way back to Southwest as a Pilot making her and her mother Southwest's first mother/daughter Pilot duo!

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon we can now start the Q&A please. Thank you.

Last week three WW correspondents reported what they observed at two Starbucks coffee shops selected for closure by the corporate office: one in downtown the other near Gateway Transit Center deep in Northeast Portland (“Falling Starbucks” July 20). Starbucks said it was closing the shops because they had grown too dangerous. Such a rationale hit a nerve—several actually. Some readers accused us of credulously accepting Starbucks’ narrative and painting over the company’s union-busting attempts. Others took exception to a quote from Jason Renaud saying business owners were scapegoating the mentally ill. Still others scoffed at our assertion that Starbucks operates a kiosk in a nearby Safeway. Readers were right about that one.

Dot Halford via wweek.com: “I own a retail business downtown with a 17-year track record of success. I’ve considered closing the business because of the same issues. It’s incredibly fatiguing and often dangerous to be dealing with mentally unstable and drug-addled individuals day in and day out plus I have the safety of my staff to consider. Making the decision to close has NOTHING to do with the success of my business. Does Jason Renaud actually think that Starbucks is a business failure? HIGHLY DELUDED.”

q (not anon) via Twitter: “This is not responsible journalism and you’re being a corporate mouthpiece for Starbucks. Very disappointed in the fact that WW glosses over the egregious union-busting by instead taking digs at homeless people.”

CH via wweek.com: “The fucking balls to tell some kid running a register who ends up being a de facto social worker making minimum wage that the shit they see every day isn’t the actual issue.”

Dan Keeney via wweek.com: “The faux outrage about a company closing a retail location when there are nine other Starbucks operating within a mile of the downtown location—two just a block or so away—is silly. Nobody will be inconvenienced by this.”

portlandeastside via wweek.com: “My wife and I have been associated with the Gateway area for many years. Unfortunately it has degenerated into a dark and creepy scuzzy area especially at night. We still frequent the Applebee’s at the other end of the parking lot from the Gateway Starbucks and Subway but only in daylight at lunch time.”

Jodi Smith-Howells via Facebook: “Chipotle is doing the same thing. Closing down locations due to ‘safety’ concerns. They also happen to be the locations also unionizing. Weird how that works.”

Mitch Craft via Facebook: “Who cares Starbucks is garbo. Maybe a locally owned coffee shop could open and thrive.”

William Ohle via wweek.com: “My lord who does the fact checking at WW? That’s a Fred Meyer at Gateway not a Safeway. How could anyone who actually knows anything about Portland history get that wrong?” (Editor’s note: A Starbucks grocery kiosk is indeed inside a Fred Meyer near Gateway Transit Center not a Safeway. WW regrets the error which was inserted by WW’s news editor who has lived here 15 years and really ought to know better.)

He went on “People get violent with us. People steal stuff. It’s very aggressive.”

“They spit on us” another said. A common concern among baristas is having drinks thrown at them.

“Better iced tea than hot tea—look on the bright side” Ray Indolos who spends several days each week sitting and drawing in various Starbucks around Los Angeles said. “I’m super bummed out. Some of my favorite Starbucks are the ones closing.” At the location in the Little Tokyo section of downtown Indolos sat at a table with two fountain pens ink brushes and a sketch pad spread out in front of him. “I do my art work. I thrive on the whole vibe here the energy of people” he said.

He looked around the shop. “My first assessment is: Is this guy gonna stab me? And if not more power to him. It only takes one glance.” He gestured toward a man dancing alone. “God bless him whatever he’s going through” he said. “He doesn’t bother me.”

Indolos started hanging out at Starbucks twenty-two years ago. “I’m from Hollywood” he said. “I hitched my horse here.” His regular order is an iced Americano with chocolate foam. He used to work in the animation industry and now works in the office of a mental-health facility. He went on “I mean it’s not like a hotbed for the Mafia or anything like that. It’s not so much crime as disturbance.”

“Starbucks is a window into America” Howard Schultz the Starbucks C.E.O. said last month in remarks to his staff. “We are facing things which the stores were not built for.” At the branch on Hollywood and Western two monitors showed customers live video of themselves: a woman in leopard-print leggings ordering at the register another woman going through the garbage and fishing out a half-smoked cigarette. At a Little Tokyo location an employee was jabbed by a used hypodermic needle while emptying the trash.

Starbucks has plans to offer de-escalation training at those locations which will remain open. Indolos approves: “You’re making coffee and you’re face to face with someone who’s totally out of it and you will have some tools you can rely on” he said. Baristas he added “should all have jujitsu and karate on their résumés.”

“This one’s not that different from Hollywood and Highland where people are coming in half naked yelling at the top of their voice” he said. “I feel cool about it.”

And now? “I guess I’ll have to drink coffee on the street.” Some people speculate that the closures are a response to baristas’ efforts to unionize. A Starbucks representative disputed this: “Look there are plenty of other Starbucks in Los Angeles.”

Starbucks has over the years taken various measures to deter people from lingering such as covering electric outlets and encouraging the use of its mobile app. Indolos doesn’t see the point of a drive-through Starbucks. He usually spends two or three hours at the coffee shop. “As an artist I’m observing people here. I want to know what their deal is” he said. “Some people are standing in this different way—they don’t have this look of ‘I gotta go pick my kids up.’ ”

“Gone are the days of Starbucks being open until 2 A.M.” he went on. “That’s the stuff of legends. Now it’s usually 6 P.M. or 8 P.M. for safety. Total killjoy.”

Outside the Hollywood and Vine Starbucks on the Hollywood Walk of Fame celebrity-bus-tour workers stood around on break. Next to Spike Jonze’s star an unhoused man sat on a blanket with a Starbucks iced tea. A barista said “People come in here they make a lot of noise they bang on the walls they yell at us. People come in with their hands in their pants. There was a fight outside. A guy was completely covered in blood. A guy had an iPad and he was taking a picture of the behinds of the two girls I was taking an order from. I was like ‘What are you doing?’ And he said ‘Give me a water.’ I said ‘Get in line and I’ll give you a water.’ People lock themselves in the bathroom. Once it gets dark we lock the doors we draw the shades and we just use the window. We got the security guards and it didn’t really help.” She went on “People visit Hollywood and they say ‘This is not what I expected.’ ” ♦",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vMDY4ODBkYW53b29nLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzMxL3JvdW5kdXAtY3VydC1zd2Fucy1zdXBlcm1hbi1zdGFyYnVja3Mtc2NhbGRpbmctY29mZmVlL9IBWmh0dHBzOi8vMDY4ODBkYW53b29nLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzMxL3JvdW5kdXAtY3VydC1zd2Fucy1zdXBlcm1hbi1zdGFyYnVja3Mtc2NhbGRpbmctY29mZmVlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roundup: Curt Swan’s Superman Starbucks’ Scalding Coffee …,"It’s a bird!

Sort of.

For many years the legendary superhero comic strip was drawn by Westport illustrator Curt Swan.

This Wednesday (August 3 7 p.m. Westport Library) local comic book art historian Arlen Schumer dives into the artist’s work.

Swan worked full time on Superman from 1957 to 1986. From the scenes of a doomed Krypton to soaring above Metropolis his Superman is the standard against which all succeeding artists are judged.

Schumer is an award-winning comic book-style illustrator and pop culture historian. He writes lectures and teaches on his passions.

An environmentally minded coffee-drinking reader writes: “Starbucks now uses sustainable cups straws and lids. That’s great.

“But the lids suck. Twice this week at the drive-through one they fell off burning my husband and me.

“When I asked for a new lid they told me to call corporate because everyone is complaining about these flimsy sustainable lids and ‘someone is gonna sue soon.’

“I’m all for sustainable Westport — but not at the expense of being burned.

“The good news is: They gave me a $10 gift card the second time. They saw it happen and felt terrible.”

You as a worker have a legal right to join a union but there are many ways big corporations are skirting the law to stop you from getting your fair share. You could be working for a union-buster and not even know it.

Here are four of the biggest union-busting tricks to look out for:

One: Anti-union propaganda

Employers turn workers into a captive audience for false or misleading claims about unions. In 2019 Delta distributed pamphlets to flight attendants and ramp service workers warning that union fees would cost $700 dollars per year. But here’s what they didn’t mention: Unionized workers earn $700 more per month.

Weird how they left that part out isn’t it?

Amazon wallpapered its warehouses with anti-union ads. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz claimed he had no choice but to exclude workers at unionizing stores from new employee benefits.

Apparently when you’re the boss you can just make stuff up.

Two: Your employer hires fancy anti-union firms lawyers and consultants

The company claims it can’t afford to raise workers’ pay but spends millions on anti-union consultants. You might hear your bosses call this “union avoidance” but it basically just means “Union busting in a suit.”

Three: Delay delay delay

It’s illegal for employers to cancel a vote on whether to unionize. But they skirt the law to keep that vote from happening as long as possible.

And while they’re delaying they play dirty tricks to stop a union’s momentum. Before a recent labor election in Buffalo Starbucks flooded stores with managers to pressure workers. One Starbucks employee reported he was told to go to a meeting only to be greeted by six managers pressuring him to reject the union.

So that’s how many managers it takes to screw over an employee.

Four: If none of these union-busting tactics work your employer might just break the law

Starbucks recently fired more than 20 union leaders. Amazon fired a union leader for missing work — even though he was on leave to care for a COVID-stricken family member. U.S. employers are charged with violating federal law in over 40 percent of all union election campaigns.

I’m sorry I just have to pause for a second here. 40 percent of the time? Really? If I broke the law 40 percent of the time I’d be in jail quicker than you can say “Pinkerton!”

Are companies allowed to skirt the law like this? No! But labor laws take a long time to enforce – if they’re enforced at all. And the worst that can happen is a corporation has to rehire a worker who it illegally fired and provide back pay. No wonder some companies decide that breaking the law is cheaper than following it. It’s simply a “cost of doing business” for a giant corporation like Amazon.

But here’s some good news: A bill called “The PRO Act” would strengthen protections for union organizers and make many kinds of “union avoidance” illegal. Call your lawmakers and ask them to support it today.

They won’t just be on the right side of history. They’ll be on the right side of public opinion. A majority of Americans including 77 percent of young people support the right to join a union. Workers at Starbucks and Amazon have refused to be intimidated and have started to unionize. All over the country American workers are growing wise to corporate union-busting tricks.

Big corporations are fighting dirty to keep their workers from organizing – and they’re still losing. Imagine what could happen if they had to fight fair.

The stunning action constituted the first general strike in US history. It was the only time a major US city was ruled by a communist party. And it single-handedly dispelled the myth that workers in the United States are inherently allergic to class politics or contemptuous of radical “Old War” doctrines. In fact the general strike and St Louis Commune of 1877 were launched by class-conscious workers directly influenced by the socialist movements of their European brethren. St Louis’s ruling class saw perfectly clearly the class nature of the strike and its relationship to European socialism — in particular the Paris Commune of 1871 and the First International led by Karl Marx. On July 27 1877 the Missouri Republican screamed “The Internationalists have taken control of the strike same as the communists who took control of Paris.” It is therefore impossible to understand the events of July 1877 without looking across the Atlantic. What occurred in St Louis that explosive month was an outgrowth of the upheavals organizations and revolutions of the international workers’ movement.

The European Roots of the St Louis Commune In 1848 and 1849 German and French workers rebelled against their countries’ monarchies and the wrenching changes brought on by capitalism. They were joined by the rising bourgeoisie — the new middle class of factory owners business leaders and merchants who also sought an to end the power of kings aristocracies and the church and the establishment of more democratic republics with civil rights for ordinary people. This alliance was tenuous however: a fundamental economic conflict existed between the new owners of the means of production and those who worked for them — wage earners who owned nothing and had only their labor to sell. Ultimately the bourgeois leaders decided that they had more to fear from the working class than they did from a reformed monarchy. While the 1848 revolutions produced some liberal reforms the revolutionary democratic dreams of workers were dashed. In the wake of the revolutions scores of radical workers — primarily from Germany France and the Austro-Hungarian Empire — emigrated to the US where many found a new home in St Louis an originally French city with a large German population. They licked their wounds and bided their time. Back in Europe the trade unionists and radical leaders founded the International Workers’ Association in an attempt to unite workers across borders. Associated most with Karl Marx the so-called First International brought the workers’ movement in different countries together allowing workers to communicate with each other share knowledge and experiences and support each other in times of crisis. Then in 1871 a radical cause for hope: workers in Paris took control of the city amid the Franco-Prussian War and established the Paris Commune. They held free elections organized city services seized control of the city’s industries and passed social welfare laws designed to aid the poor and working classes. This Marx proclaimed was the dictatorship of the proletariat. The worker government was continually attacked by Prussian and French forces both of which desired its downfall. When the city finally fell to French forces communards were massacred in the streets of Paris. Those who were able to escape the carnage made their way to other countries including the United States. Many settled in St Louis joining the radical “48ers.” Like their counterparts in Europe workers in the United States were experiencing dramatic economic changes and grinding poverty. The rise of the factory system wiped out much of the artisan class forcing formerly independent workers into conditions they regarded as industrial dungeons. Unions were young and the working class was weak at the mercy of the emerging capitalist class. Economic depressions were common. An 1850 study of housing in New York found instances of twenty people living in one room and up to three hundred living in one house. Conditions were especially bad for railroad workers: they were paid little and their work was extremely dangerous and insecure. In 1877 major railroads slashed wages by up to 50 percent despite earning healthy profits. The reduction in pay sparked an explosion that became known as the Great Railroad Strike. Before it was over the Paris Commune would be invoked stateside.

The Strike Railroad workers first walked off their jobs in Martinsburg West Virginia and Baltimore in mid-July. The strike modest at first quickly moved west from town to town. Soon it encompassed the entire country. In all approximately a million railroad workers across the United States went on strike that month. Tired of starvation wages irate at being maimed and ordered around by the boss workers erupted. In Baltimore after a state militia was called in to put down the strike thousands of workers and unemployed surrounded the troops in a railroad depot and attacked them as they attempted to escape chasing them through the city. In Pittsburgh after twenty onlookers were killed by a Philadelphia militia the crowd reacted with stones and gunfire forcing the militia to retreat into the railroad roundhouse. Over two thousand railroad cars and over a hundred locomotives were burned or destroyed as was other railroad property. In Chicago workers and police engaged in running gun battles throughout the city. The striking workers found favor in their various towns and cities. The railroads were generally unpopular and residents provided strikers with financial and material support. Even local merchants backed the strikers giving them food and other commodities. On July 21 the strike reached East St Louis Illinois and the next day East St Louis railroad workers joined by four hundred workers from St Louis voted to stop all railroad transportation passing through the city with the exception of passenger and mail trains. St Louis’s mayor claimed that thirty thousand socialists were attempting to take over the city and on July 22 federal troops arrived in St Louis even though no violence had occurred there. The same day the St Louis branch of the Workingmen’s Party of the United States (WPUSA the successor to the First International) elected an executive committee to lead the strike. St Louis was well represented in the organization. St Louis workers accounted for 20 percent of the entire membership of the organization and boasted several separate language sections (German French English and Bohemian). Led by the radical party ten thousand workers rallied in downtown St Louis market and demanded public works to create jobs for the unemployed an end to child labor and an eight-hour workday. Demands for reform quickly evolved into calls for the end of capitalism and the nationalization of major industries including railroads and means of communication. And still the strike grew larger. After crowds in St Louis insisted that the rest of the city’s workers join them the working class obliged. It was the first general strike in US history. Virtually all businesses in the city closed down and shortages of coal meant much manufacturing could not operate. The next day no freight trains were allowed to pass through East St Louis or St Louis. Workers operated passenger and mail trains even collecting fares and turning the money over to the railroad companies. Black steamboat and wharf workers joined the strike and cross-racial parades of workers marched through the city calling out those working in other industries. Elevator operators and barbers marched behind a drum and fife parade. No business operated without the consent of the WPUSA’s executive committee. For the powers that be this display of workers democracy was anarchy — St Louis’s sheriff called for a posse comitatus to fight the strikers and drafted all available men under threats of jailing for failure to report. Businessmen ordered their employees to join the posse and ten thousand men were armed by the Committee of Public Safety. Weapons were imported from the state’s militia and federal arsenals and more state and federal troops joined those already in the city. Strike leaders were rounded up and arrested and seven hundred militia troops led by calvary infantry foot police and artillery marched to the headquarters of the WPUSA and arrested everyone on the premises including onlookers and journalists.

If you saw our recent More Cores More Better AMD Arm and Intel Server CPUs in 2022-2023 piece you may have seen this photo. This is a 128 core Ampere Altra Max Arm CPU (lit by a yellow spotlight) next to a Huawei / HiSilicon Kunpeng 920 48-core Arm processor. One cannot buy the Kunpeng 920 in the US nor the dual CPU server it is in (the Huawei TaiShan 200) but we managed to get one. This is in addition to the Ampere Altra 80 core CPUs that are from the family used by Oracle Cloud Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. We could not get the AWS Graviton2/ Graviton3 to test with but if there is a way we will hopefully get one one day.

The other one that many may not have seen on STH previously is that we actually have several IBM Power9 LC921 servers in the lab. We were able to use the PCIe Gen4 slots (albeit not with hot-swap bays) to get connectivity for the drives. On a relative scale Ampere Arm was easy Huawei/ HiSilicon was more challenging (our first tests were ~80% of AMD EPYC performance) but the IBM Power9 servers have taken a lot more time to get working for this. We may do a review of the LC921 just for YouTube later this quarter just for fun.

With that we also had AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” EPYC 7003 “Milan” EPYC 7003X “Milan-X 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable (Ice Lake) and the new Ice Lake-D 2700 using the Supermicro platforms from our Welcome to the Intel Ice Lake D Era with the Xeon D-2700 and D-1700 series. Here are the ten PCIe Gen4-based CPU architectures we could test the drives with using the AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” as the base case. We used our four corners numbers and then averaged the percentage deltas from the Rome results:

Since we now are within a 6% relative performance range here is the non-zero X-axis chart zooming in on the results:

Again a disclaimer the above is zoomed in and a non-zero X-axis version of the chart above. We were fairly close on these results.

Being a bit fair here the Huawei HiSilicon Kunpeng 920 is the newest platform in our lab but we now are getting ballpark results that we would expect from that PCIe Gen4 platform after taking into account the non-standard NUMA architecture that we see on the CPUs. Intel’s PCIe Gen4 controllers are great and we get perhaps very weak scaling with memory and frequency. Still we can see the Ampere parts in an almost even heat with the AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” and the Milan-based parts slightly ahead.

Perhaps the best part is that despite these drives still carrying the “Intel” branding we got them working reasonably well on many non-Intel architectures. Really only the IBM Power9 and the Kunpeng 920 were off by more than a +/- 2% margin that most folks do not care about.

For those wondering where the Cooper Lake 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Xeon D-2700 D-1500/ D-1600 Cascade Lake AMD EPYC 7001 “Naples” results and so forth are since we now have ten PCIe Gen4 platforms we decided to just limit testing to PCIe Gen4 platforms and not include PCIe Gen3 platforms.

Final Words

Overall the Solidigm D7-P5520 is a nice NVMe SSD. This drive really shows a lot of the hallmark features that we had come to expect of Intel’s NVMe line. Namely the focus on low queue depth performance and a lot of the reliability features that made Intel drives the gold standard for generations. We saw great performance both in our synthetic and real-world application testing.

To us perhaps the biggest item we would want to see changed is the swap to the Solidigm label. That branding swap needs to happen and it will. We are rapidly approaching the PCIe Gen5 generation of SSDs as those platforms are launched over the next few quarters. Hopefully that will be the inflection point for Solidigm’s branding.

Still we delayed this review just to get to test with a bunch of different architectures in what may be the first SSD review to utilize ten different PCIe Gen4 CPU platforms. It was great to see compatibility beyond just x86 here.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bloomberg

The last time inflation burned hot consumers could put money in the bank and watch it grow like the prices on store shelves easing much of the pain.

Not this time – and that’s stoking profits for U.S. lenders.

The gap between what banks pay depositors and what they earn from lending money to borrowers hasn’t been so wide in the past half-century with the average savings account paying a skimpy 0.06%. Many banks are telling shareholders that so-called deposit betas measuring how quickly deposit rates rise in the wake of Fed hikes will remain advantageous for banks in the months ahead as they’re not yet feeling much pressure to pay savers more.

Betas are now the buzziest bit of jargon across the financial industry. The phrase was invoked more times during Bank of America Corp.’s analyst briefings in the past two months than in the prior two years combined. This month the lender’s executives predicted interest income may climb by as much as $1 billion in the third quarter from the second as they stay “disciplined” in what they pay customers.

“Our consumer-banking segment continues to see good momentum” Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan told analysts July 18. “We grew loans at the fastest quarterly pace in nearly three years.”

The reasons that savers are getting so little relief are myriad starting with the Federal Reserve which waited until inflation was strong before it began raising interest rates from longtime lows. From there it takes time for deposit rates to rise too. The result is pain: The consumer price index jumped 9.1% in June while banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co. offered deposit rates as low as 0.01% according to their websites.

While deposit rates are widely expected to tick incrementally higher as the Fed’s rate hikes for borrowers take hold there’s ample evidence that the benefits for savers will come slowly. That’s because many banks face little competitive pressure to pay more. Many are flush with cash thanks in part to a surge in deposits that piled up during Covid-era lockdowns and stimulus programs.

Even big clients that aren’t doing a lot of business with a bank aside from parking their money will have little leverage to push for a higher interest rate on their deposits.

“Banks have plenty of room on the funding side” said Erika Najarian a banking analyst at UBS Group AG. That means they can allow “more rate-sensitive deposit-only relationships to walk because they don’t necessarily need that funding.

While deposits have been slipping somewhat at many banks it’s unlikely that enough consumers will switch lenders to ratchet up pressure quickly even as online and community-based institutions burnish rates to attract inflows. Synchrony Financial and American Express Co. for example each offer rates of at least 1.5%.

One reason for that inertia is that only people of a certain age can remember an era when banks routinely paid much more interest on deposits blunting the impact of inflation. Another is that accounts aren’t as portable as they were decades ago. Many customers have their paychecks deposited directly and arrange for bills to be paid automatically making switching to a new bank a hassle.

To be sure the more generous rates banks paid for deposits in the 1980s were a result of longstanding inflation and the Fed’s efforts to tame that with much higher interest rates for borrowing.

This time both interest and deposit rates are coming off ultra-low levels said Greg McBride chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com which tracks the deposit rates banks offer. Banks will want to see the benefit from higher borrowing rates before they start to pass that along to savers he said.

Getting to higher deposit rates will also depend on how long the Fed keeps borrowing rates elevated Najarian said. She suggests deposit rates might reach 1.2% before the Fed starts to ease again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzA4ZGNkYjQzLWVkZDYtNDY2Yi1iNTY4LTdlYzliOWFmMTRkZtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Card lenders show faith in US consumer as they hunt for new borrowers,"Print this page

Roula Khalaf Editor of the FT selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Leading US credit card lenders are signalling their confidence in the American consumer stepping up marketing efforts to attract new borrowers even as the economy slips into a technical recession.

After rising 47 per cent in the first quarter the volume of paper and digital mail solicitations sent by US credit card issuers increased again in the second quarter according to preliminary data from marketing research firm Competiscan putting it on track to reach a record high this year.

The wave of offers follows an 85 per cent surge last year from the depressed levels of 2020 and comes as many big card issuers said during their second-quarter earnings reports this month that they were increasing marketing spending.

JPMorgan Chase the largest US card issuer highlighted the ferocity of the competition for borrowers when it blamed higher customer acquisition costs for a 45 per cent fall in second-quarter card income.* Capital One the second-largest issuer said its quarterly marketing expenses rose 62 per cent from last year’s levels and pledged to remain aggressive.

“We continue to see opportunities to book accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns and we continue to lean into marketing to drive growth” Capital One chief executive Richard Fairbank said calling the competition “more intense than pre-pandemic levels”.

The increase in marketing activity is particularly noteworthy at this stage of the economic cycle. During uncertain times lenders typically send out fewer card offers — targeting potential borrowers with the highest credit scores — and focus on selling premium cards or making other offers to current customers.

However even as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down the highest inflation rate in more than four decades credit card lenders believe they have room to increase the size of their loan books because unemployment is low and consumer balance sheets appear healthy.

Credit card balances held by the seven largest issuers — JPMorgan Capital One Citigroup Bank of America American Express Discover and Synchrony — rose 13 per cent to $739.8bn compared with last year but remain about 9 per cent lower than they were at the end of 2019.

American Express last week raised its already bullish revenue outlook for the year as it reported higher-than-expected earnings and said its annual marketing spending would come in above its prior guidance of $5bn.

“I don’t see [a recession] in my numbers at all” chief executive Stephen Squeri told Yahoo Finance. “It’s really hard for me to get my head around that in quarter three or quarter four we’re going to have a big slowdown.”

To attract new customers issuers are embracing flashy tactics. Last month Amex rolled out a limited-edition card made from the scrap metal of retired planes. Sign-on bonuses tied to travel have become more generous although consumers so far are showing a preference for cashback cards.

Many of the marketing efforts are targeting so-called “revolvers” or borrowers who carry a balance from month to month instead of paying their statements off in full.

During the first quarter there was a 62 per cent increase in the volume of balance transfer offers that would enable consumers to consolidate debt on to a credit card interest-free for a time Competiscan said. The terms are also getting more generous. The interest-free period rose on average to 16 months this year from 14 months in 2021.

Sara Rathner an analyst at NerdWallet a personal finance website said the combination of growing balances and rising interest rates could land consumers in trouble.

“If you have credit card debt currently or you’re taking on debt for a large upcoming purchase interest rates are high they are getting higher” Rathner said. “It can spiral out of control pretty quickly.”

Complicating the task for lenders is the difficulty that they face in gauging the impact of government stimulus and debt forbearance programmes on consumers over the longer term.

“You have seen a dislocation between what had been very correlated metrics” said Brian Doubles chief executive of Synchrony the largest US store credit card issuer which increased its marketing spending by 18 per cent last quarter in line with pre-pandemic levels. “That’s really because of the effects of the stimulus and the forbearance that comes through.”

Lenders argue that new targeting tools and data analytics have made it easier to lend through a downturn without taking outsized losses.

Many lenders now analyse factors such as education employment history and checking account balances in addition to the traditional credit score to determine creditworthiness which increases the pool of potential borrowers said Megan Cipperly senior director of client services at Competiscan.

Incentives such as rate discounts for setting up automatic payments or making several consecutive on-time payments are also becoming more popular for unsecured loans.

“It reduces their chance of having delinquencies and then it creates a positive customer-lender relationship” Cipperly said. “That’s a great strategy if we’re heading into a recession.”

Debbe Dunning who had joined the cast for a week in the second season as the winsome and memorably named Kiki Van Fursterwallenscheinlaw was brought in to audition and soon cast in the role of Heidi Keppert Tim (Tim Allen) and Al's (Richard Karn) new assistant on Tool Time. She went on to play that role from Seasons 3 to 8 becoming a main cast member in the show's final two seasons.

While Dunning has stayed largely out of the spotlight in the decades since the last few years have found her in a surprising new starring role. Read on to find out what happened to Dunning after Home Improvement ended in 1999 and where she is now at age 56.

She portrayed a few more (mostly doomed) characters in television and film.

Dunning did some additional acting while Home Improvement aired and after its finale including guest appearances on shows including Baywatch The Jamie Foxx Show and Sabrina the Teenage Witch. While her character on Tales From the Crypt survived a rare episode in which no one dies (1994's ""The Pit"") few her post-Home Improvement characters were that lucky.

In the 2000 television remake of The Spiral Staircase her character was the victim of a serial killer played by Judd Nelson while in Leprechaun 4: In Space it was the title character who made her fall from a railing finger by finger. In her most recent acting role in 2007 she had an arc on the vengeance-themed telenovela Wicked Wicked Games alongside Tatum O'Neal whose character ultimately took out Dunning's in a violent parking garage fight.

She worked for a construction firm.

Dunning appears to have found some off-screen work not far from the world of Tool Time. According to her LinkedIn profile she spent an indeterminate amount of time as a sales and marketing specialist for J.R. Lennen Construction Inc. a California-based general contracting company.

She's a mother of three.

When Heidi gave birth in a gas station with the help of Tim and Jill (Patricia Richardson)—with Wilson (Earl Hindman) giving directions by phone—in the 1996 Home Improvement episode ""The Tool Man Delivers"" it was Dunning's real-life pregnancy with daughter Spencer being written into the show. The actor married Spencer's father former Olympic volleyball player Steve Timmons in 1997. Two sons Stoney and Sysco followed in 2000 and 2008 respectively. And while the California-based couple divorced in 2018 Dunning documents special moments with her kids on her Instagram page.

She's a regular on the celebrity golf circuit.

Dunning is an avid golfer who has played the game for more than two decades. Over the years she has joined many celebrity golf events benefiting a variety of causes and organizations including the John Starks Foundation the Boys and Girls Club and the Michael Phelps Foundation.

""There's not a lot of women out there that are actresses and professional athletes that do golf"" she said of her presence on the green in an interview with the Michael Artsis Show in 2015.

Tournaments have also given Dunning the opportunity to reunite with her former Home Improvement co-stars. She played alongside Tim Allen at the 7th annual George Lopez Foundation Celebrity Golf Classic Zachery Ty Bryan (Brad Taylor) at the SAG Foundation's 6th Annual Los Angeles Golf Classic and Karn at the George Lopez 14th Annual Celebrity Golf Classic Tournament.

These days she has her own show.

Dunning has said in interviews that she would use the hours she wasn't needed on the set of Home Improvement to ride horses that she kept at the equestrian center across the street. Life would come full circle decades later when she met Patrick Gottsch owner of RFD-TV and The Cowboy Channel during a golf tournament. He invited her to pitch a concept for the networks and she suggested a travel show focused on America's dude ranches.

In 2017 Debbe Dunning's Dude Ranch Roundup was born with Dunning acting as host and executive producer. Now in its fourth season the series features Dunning (sometimes accompanied by her children) as she delves into the background of ranches across the American West and the experience of being their guest.

Why I Decided to Drop Spectrum Internet

But having Spectrum internet isn’t by choice; it has long been the only option I have living in rural Garner NC situated just southeast of Raleigh. While AT&T Fiber and Google Fiber are available within 20 miles of my address neither services my neighborhood. Given the regional internet monopolies around the country Spectrum is still my only choice for high-speed cable/fiber internet.

But why did I decide to give Spectrum the boot? I was sick of having to jump through hoops yearly to keep my current service at a reasonable price. I’ve been paying $69.99 for 400/20 internet but every year Spectrum jacks the rate to $84.99. Then I have to call their customer service line and waste 45 mins of my day to get them to reduce the rate back to $69.99. Sure it’s a once-a-year thing but I’ve been looking for an out.

A friend who also just so happens to be stuck with Spectrum asked me about other ISP options when it dawned on me that T-Mobile offers Home Internet at $50/month. I asked her to see if her address was eligible for service and it was. She decided to take T-Mobile up on their two-week free trial offer and signed up for service.

At that moment I asked myself: Could I also potentially ditch spectrum and go with a 5G wireless service as my primary link for home internet?

What is T-Mobile Home Internet?

T-Mobile Home Internet provides internet service to your home using a 5G gateway using T-Mobile's cellular network. The 5G gateway contains a 4G/5G modem that connects to T-Mobile's cellular network and combines a Wi-Fi 6 router for linking up all your devices. T-Mobile only offers its Home Internet service in areas with excellent coverage (for obvious reasons). And even then not all addresses are serviced based on network capacity.

T-Mobile Home Internet costs $50 per month when you sign up for Autopay ($55/month without Autopay) including all taxes and fees. If you are an existing T-Mobile Magenta Max mobile customer your monthly price drops to just $30/month with Autopay. The 5G gateway is provided free so there is no monthly equipment (modem) fee to pay (as is often the case with fixed-line providers like Spectrum and Comcast) and there are no long-term contracts to sign.

The goodies don't stop there. T-Mobile currently offers home internet customers 50% off YouTube TV for a year Paramount+ free for a year and Philo TV for $15/month (versus the standard rate of $25/month). If that wasn't enough new signups get an Amazon Echo Show 5 (second generation) for free .

According to the company you can expect ""typical"" download speeds of between 33 Mbps to 182 Mbps and upload speeds ranging from 6 Mbps to 23 Mbps. However as you see below actual speeds can be much higher rivaling legacy cable companies. The other big thing that most people would probably want to know is the current situation with data caps given that this service works on T-Mobile's cellular network. Surprisingly the answer is that there are no data caps. While Comcast and Spectrum have implemented data caps on their fixed-line customers in multiple U.S. markets T-Mobile thankfully eschews the practice–at least for now.

As for overall performance T-Mobile provides the following disclaimer:

Speeds can vary depending on location signal strength and availability time of day and other factors. Our speed projections are based on our analysis of internal and third-party data.

T-Mobile says its home internet service is available to 30 million Americans.

Signing up for T-Mobile Home Internet

Getting signed up for service was relatively easy. First I clicked this T-Mobile link to enter my phone number and see if my home address was eligible. Once eligibility was confirmed I was able to chat with a representative who asked me a few questions and sent me several secure links to enter my name address billing information and social security number (to perform a credit check for the new hardware that would be sent to me).

(Image credit: T-Mobile)

After about 10 minutes the signup process was complete and I was informed that the 5G gateway would arrive within two business days. On the second business day the 5G gateway arrived as promised via UPS and I was eager to test it out.

First Impressions and Setup

After removing the 5G gateway from the box I was struck by its size. It measures 8.5 inches tall and is silver in color. It’s shaped like a cylinder reminding me of the first-generation Amazon Echo. On the back of the device you’ll find a power port a power button a reset button a USB-C port (which worked just fine charging my smartphone) a phone jack and two Ethernet ports. Unfortunately compared to modern wireless routers T-Mobile’s 5G gateway is lacking in port selection. So you may want to pick up one of the best network switches we’ve tested.

You’ll find a small circular touch display on the top of the device. You can swipe across the screen to see your current signal strength messages from T-Mobile the number of connected devices and battery status. Yes the 5G gateway has an integrated battery and it will continue to function if the power plug is pulled (this feature should come in handy during power outages).

To set up the gateway you must first download the T-Mobile Internet app and install it on a smartphone. I then plugged the gateway into the wall in my office on the second floor of my house and powered it up. It booted up performed a quick software update then confirmed signal strength of three out of five bars. The app itself is very basic with few controls for the router. You can see network status signal strength connected devices change the SSID/passcode and adjust the frequency bands. That’s about it. There are no parental controls advanced wireless controls access controls MAC filtering or anything like that. This is just a barebones setup that should work fine for most households. Power users will likely want to look elsewhere or simply connect their existing router to the 5G gateway.

At first I was concerned about the signal strength as I had the gateway situated on top of a bookshelf next to my cable modem which isn’t near a window (T-Mobile suggests placing the gateway near a window for the best signal). I then stuck it near a window in my office and was greeted with the same three bars. I next took the 5G gateway downstairs on the opposite side of the house and placed it near a window. I still obtained three bars. At that point I decided to just put it in the original location near the cable modem and proceed with the setup. After the initial setup signal strength has hovered between three bars and four bars.

Upon opening the T-Mobile Internet app I was asked to scan the QR code on the bottom of the gateway to expedite setup. This prepopulated the SSID and passcode then began communicating with the gateway and the T-Mobile network for activation. After about 30 seconds the setup process was complete and I was ready to go.

At any given time we have 40+ Wi-Fi devices connected to our wireless router (a first-generation Netgear Orbi RBR50 Wi-Fi 5 mesh router with two satellites). We're talking multiple laptops smartphones tablets Smart TVs Amazon Echo speakers and about a dozen Kasa smart light switches light bulbs and power outlets. Given the sheer number of Wi-Fi devices in my home I opted to piggyback my Orbi off the 5G gateway to make things simple (granted I could have just changed the SSID and password on the 5G gateway to match my Orbi but I didn’t want to drop coverage that my router and two satellites provide through the whole house and outdoors).

Testing Performance

I first connected just my iPhone to the 5G gateway over Wi-Fi and performed a Speedtest. To my amazement I registered download speeds exceeding 470 Mbps while uploads came in at nearly 72 Mbps.

For reference my Spectrum internet connection gives me 430 Mbps to 450 Mbps and tops out at around 21 Mbps for uploads. Subsequent tests have shown the 5G gateway hitting peak download speeds of 557.37 Mbps from my MacBook Pro (connected directly to the 5G gateway) around 3 p.m. which is unheard of for home internet out here in the sticks.

For a worst-case scenario I tested again around 9:00 p.m. ET and the 5G gateway's speeds dropped to around 400 Mbps for downloads and 40 Mbps for uploads. That's a steep drop-off but still plenty of throughput for our needs.

I next performed the same tests with my Orbi router plugged in via one of the 5G gateway’s two Ethernet ports. The download and upload speeds were unaffected so I stuck with that setup.

I’m not a big gamer so I’m primarily concerned with having a fast and stable internet connection 24-7-365. In the days that I’ve been testing T-Mobile’s Home Internet service it’s been flawless. I haven’t experienced any service interruptions or significant speed shortfalls. The 5G gateway has remained slightly lukewarm to the touch which cooler than the toasty Arris Surfboard SB6183 cable modem I’ve been using for years.

The 5G hotspot can simultaneously handle multiple Smart TVs streaming my daily conference calls my large file downloads and just about anything else I throw at it.

Wrap-up

I went into this test a little skeptical of using a cellular-based internet service for my home internet but those worries never came to fruition. Signing up for T-Mobile Home Internet was easy the setup process with the app was minimalistic with little room for error and the actual internet service has been rock solid. Throw in the fact that I’m saving $20 per month ($240/year) and the switch has been a no-brainer for our family.

About the hardest part of this whole process will likely be the phone call that I will need to make to Spectrum’s customer retention department to tell them that I’m canceling my existing service.

Standing in the Lollapalooza press area mid-Friday afternoon the Jane’s Addiction/Porno for Pyros singer (and Lollapalooza co-founder) has his eyes on one thing: a basketball version of Connect 4. He bested Post Malone in a game of beer pong at a Lollapalooza in South America in 2019. Basketball and Lollapalooza may seem like an odd pairing but Farrell says that legendary rock promoter Bill Graham kept a basketball hoop at Shoreline Amphitheater in Northern California which is why it was a favorite destination during the festival’s touring years.

Firing off mid-range jumpers amid a crowd of curious onlookers including a film crew following him around the now-63-year-old father of alternative rock (who has a drink in one hand and a basketball in the other) is unfazed. He marvels at how Lollapalooza has emerged as a global force. Recent festivals in Stockholm and Paris were earlier this month and the festival announced last week that it will head to India in 2023.

Even with those international events — including the now-standard three dates in South America every March — Farrell is the most excited to reveal that Lollapalooza will remain in the Windy City for the next 10 years. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot made the announcement ahead of BTS’ J-Hope’s headlining set on the Bud Light Seltzer stage. For Farrell it marks a continued love affair with the city which has been Lollapalooza’s flagship home since 2005.

“We love calling Chicago our home away from home” he says of the renewal briefly pausing the basketball action to grab his alcoholic beverage that he set down when the game started.

Since its 1991 start Lollapalooza has emerged as one of the most important festivals in the U.S. It not-so-coincidentally coincided with the rise of alternative rock. Looking back at those early days and the carnival-like atmosphere (one reason why SPIN named it the best concert of the past 35 years not too long ago) Farrell remembers how it swept the nation.

“I loved it because we were able to travel” he says of the early era. “That was what was different from Woodstock as an example. Woodstock was an amazing destination. But we were able to take it and bring it to different cities— a musical caravan. By the time we reimagined it here in Chicago it was wonderful. You have a chance to think all year about one weekend.”

As hard as it is to admit his favorite year two lineups stand out from the pack.

“I always loved the one that had George Clinton Beasties and Smashing Pumpkins” he says as he strategically flings the ball at the big board. “Green Day was even at that and Nick Cave was there. The same with 1992 with all of those bands and that’s when I introduced the second stage because there were too many groups to leave out — and now we have eight stages and 150 bands.”

The festival has evolved from those early years which Farrell describes as “an old trading route for musicians like a Silk Road.” Though not the monster of alternative rock it once was (its two main stages are branded by Bud Light Seltzer and T-Mobile) its return as a Chicago festival reinvigorated the brand. Adding extra stages (including his own stage dedicated to dance music) and the massive Grant Park footprint Lollapalooza remains a launch pad for many artists — even if last year’s fest wasn’t without controversy when it became the first large-scale festival to take place during the pandemic.

“Now that we’ve got it going around the world it’s just a start” he says. “Where we’re needed and where we’re wanted we will show up. That’s what I think the world is coming to culturally. It’s no longer about borders but it is about unity. We use this as our vehicle to come and as like I say ‘share the love spread the love.'”

Despite being halfway through his drink Farrell could be the New York Knicks Hall of Famer Walt “Clyde” Frazier (“I loved those Knicks teams of the ’70s” he says.) of alternative music as he drains a third straight shot blocking his opponent’s path to victory. As the crowd swells it doesn’t distract him from the task at hand. With the sounds of the nearby T-Mobile stage emanating in the background Farrell excitedly brings up his new venture Heaven After Dark Imprint Label. As he sinks another jumper Farrell boasts about its first single Pink Panda’s remix of his wife Etty Lau Farrell’s The Crystals cover “He’s a Rebel.” “Go figure that it’s her song that’s released before mine” he jokes.

Farrell’s biggest move of 2022 has been reforming Porno for Pyros. Earlier this year Jane’s Addiction canceled their Welcome to Rockville set due to what they said was Dave Navarro’s battle with long COVID. Not wanting to disappoint the promoters Farrell got his other band back together offering a slightly different version of the group with bassist Mike Watt that first performed for the 2020 Lollapalooza livestream.

The current lineup features all four original members with guitarist Peter Distefano drummer Stephen Perkins (also in Jane’s Addiction) and bassist Martyn LeNoble backing Farrell.

“Everybody was up for it except for Martyn” Farrell says. “Martyn wasn’t quite there yet but behind the scenes Martyn and I were recording new material. I love Martyn and we had a bad falling out. It happens that when you’re a young man you make stupid mistakes. And then hopefully before you die you can correct some of them or most of them.”

When the band played at Welcome to Rockville Watt was still on bass which rankled LeNoble enough to reach out to his former bandmate.

“Mike did the show and I got a text from Martyn that said ‘I just find it very interesting that you didn’t invite me'” Farrell says. “So I said ‘I’ll tell you what. I got this other gig Lollapalooza and let’s play that.’ And we have been so happy so happy together since.'”

Before the unexpected reunion after two-and-a-half decades away the last festival the band played together was the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert.

“I was running around with Sean Lennon doing interviews” Farrell says of that muggy June afternoon at Randall’s Island in New York. “And our wonderful Adam (Yauch of Beastie Boys) was still around alive and running things. Yeah those are good days. Great event.”

As for this game after a back-and-forth affair that goes 15-16 shots Farrell makes the final one to win Connect 4. The crowd dissipates and with a film crew in tow Farrell heads back to his (by festival standards) large-sized compound behind the main stage where additional business and hosting awaits.

Despite it being one-and-done Farrell says not to fear.

“We’ll do this again next year” he says flashing a smile. “Because we’re not going anywhere.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXpuLmNvbS9lbi1VUy9uZXdzL2JveGluZy9jYW5lbG8tYWx2YXJlei12cy1nZW5uYWRpeS1nb2xvdmtpbi0zLXdoby1lbHNlLWlzLWZpZ2h0aW5nLW9uLXRoZS1jYXJkLzEwdm5vcHpyNnFlbWgxc3g0bGZ5and4cW4y0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canelo Alvarez vs. Gennadiy Golovkin 3: Who else is fighting on the card?,"With 47 days to go until Saúl ""Canelo"" Álvarez and Gennady Golovkin meet for the third time face to face in the ring at the T-Mobile Arena the line-up that will turn up the heat in Las Vegas has been finalised.

Jesse Rodriguez vs. Israel Gonzalez

Melina Pizano/Matchroom

Three months since his last bout Rodriguez will once again don the gloves to put his WBC crown on the line against Mexico's Israel ""Jiga"" Gonzalez. Bam returns with a great pace having dismantled two of the division's leading lights so far this February first taking the vacant belt by defeating former champion Carlos Cuadras and then knocking out - and becoming the first to do so - Thailand's Srinsaket Sor Rungvisai.

""It's an honour to have the opportunity to fight on Mexican Independence Day weekend as the co-main event to Canelo-GGG is truly special and I plan to put on another spectacular performance and continue to build my legacy. Every fight is more important than the last. It's not just about winning it's about how you win"" Rodriguez said in a statement.

Gonzalez is an experienced Mexican with a record of 28-4-1 11 KOs and will be facing his fourth world opportunity after losses to the likes of Jerwin Ancajas Khalid Yafai and Roman Gonzalez.

Another duel that promises plenty of action will be the one between Kazakhstan's Ali Akhmedov who will be looking to turn the page in a big way and put behind him - once and for all - the knockout loss he suffered to Carlos Gongora in 2020.

The fighter who is 18-1 with 14 KOs and who will be on a bill topped by Golovkin for the third time chose as his opponent the dangerous puncher Gabriel Rosado and they will fight over 10 rounds.

""I'm looking forward to being part of one of the biggest shows of the year"" said Rosado. ""This is an opportunity to do what I did against Bektemir and put myself back on track for the world title.""

Diego Pacheco vs. Enrique Collazo

Diego Pacheco will contest his first professional belt when he takes on Enrique Collazo for the WBC silver North American super middleweight title. Pacheco owns a record of 15-0 with 12 KOs and will be looking for his fifth knockout in a row.

I was a nosy kid and I have a lot of happy memories of looking through my brothers' books and whatnot while they weren't around. One day - this is decades back; I can at least remember that it was sunny - I found a paperback that my brother Paul had picked up somewhere. Paul liked science-fiction This was sci-fi. It was by Harry Harrison and it was one of his Stainless Steel Rat novels.

Actually it was a very special one an odd one. But we'll get to that in a second. Harry Harrison was a big deal in 20th century sci-fi a writer who moved from illustrating comics to turning out novels that existed in the raggedy edge-lands between parodying space operas and reveling in their excesses. However he handled things he always brought an anti-war message that was sometimes hidden given the rather conservative genre he worked within. Outside of the Stainless Steel Rat books - the Rat is a charming con-man and occasional hero - he's probably best known for writing the novel that Soylent Green was loosely based upon.

So yes the book of Paul's I'd found was a bit of an oddity amongst Harrison's output. It was a game book. You Can Be The Stainless Steel Rat was published in 1985 according to my lovely eBay copy battered but still with a bit of gloss on the cover. 1985! This means it hit right in the middle of the Choose Your Own Adventure craze and it cleaves tight to many of the genre's standards like numbered sections that come with choices at the end. As a reader you ping back and forth through the book following your instincts and probably keeping a finger or two marking previous choices for the moments in which your instincts fail.

I have no idea why I started to read this book back then - other than I would have been very young and the whole thing struck me as being pleasantly illicit. A book aimed at teenagers at least with a cover that promised easy access to carnage. That would have been enough for me. I can certainly remember why I kept reading though: far from going over my head - although I'm sure some of it did - the book was charming and light and the action narrated by the Rat himself was often funny.

You Can Be the Stainless Steel Rat.

The Rat didn't just describe the scenes and the choices the reader faced he commented on their actions and specifically their many failures. When the reader gets hit on the head for about the thirtieth time the Rat asks whether they are secretly getting something out of it. When the reader makes a risky choice he tells them how stupid they are and sometimes gives them a second chance to make a better decision.

I love Choose Your Own Adventures and for whatever reason a few days back I found myself filled with a desire to return to this formative example. Days later I had the book again looking at that beautifully garish cover for the first time in at least thirty years. I've spent the last few hours re-reading and re-re-reading. And it's fascinating stuff.

Fascinating how? As a Choose Your Own Adventure affair goes the story is hardly a reach. You're dispatched to an awful dangerous planet to track down and capture a scientist who has manufactured a doomsday device. Along the way you meet deadly enemy agents intriguing allies and a couple of monsters - standard stuff for these kinds of books. You have gadgets - smoke and gas bombs an invisibility belt - but it's all tracked within the pages of the narrative with no need to write up a character sheet. You don't need dice either although occasionally you're asked to flip a coin.

But within this traditional genre mount I think you get to see something pretty special - something I hadn't noticed for obvious reasons on my first all but forgotten playthrough back in the 1980s. It's this. Harrison takes his job seriously up to a point. Numbered paragraphs. Choices. An adventure plot. But beyond that point you get to see him - what? Bored? Playful? A combination of the two?

I first noticed this early on when the choice at the end of a section came down to something less commonly seen in these sorts of books than the question of whether I should go left or right at the next intersection. Instead the Rat had remembered a few lines of a poem and he wanted me to tell him: Frost or Service?

To see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings

It was Frost but that's not really the point - the point was that I had to pick an answer and turn to the correct section to continue the story. Bored or playful? Was Harrison simply fulfilling the obligation to make the reader choose or riffing on that in an interesting way? In a book about making choices why shouldn't some of those choices play out in the privileged inner space of memory and thought anyway?

There's lots of stuff like this. Not poetry but bits where you can see Harrison pushing against the boundaries of the form. He tells the reader to learn Esperanto at one point - a bit of a Harrison preoccupation. Elsewhere he becomes enormously fond of the choice that is not a choice: you pick an answer and he sends you back where you came from anyway to pick the other option.

Harry Harrison.

Along the way I think Harrison makes a really interesting discovery. Death in Choose Your Own Adventure books is interesting I would argue only if the book is actually crafting a range of radically different stories - in which case each death is actually an ending to a story and stories with endings are great! Take something like the old Choose Your Own Adventure The Horror of High Ridge and you'll see exactly what I mean.

High Ridge is a story of ghost cowboys and Native Americans fighting over an old mining town. But as you pick through the book the scenario gives way to many plots: in some you get killed by evil cowboys. In another you flee the town or die fleeing in yet another. In one plot - a sort of master plot - you actually put an end to the ghostly curse on the town. There's a lot of reader death in High Ridge - it's something the books used to advertise on the covers. But actually what they advertise is endings rather than deaths. Many endings are deaths but more than anything they bring a story to a satisfying conclusion and allow a single book to contain several largely distinct narratives.

A lot of times in game books this wasn't the case - or at least I don't remember it being the case. You might lose a fight and just die. You might trigger a one-hit trap and that was it. The story would end with no meaningful form no pay-off crafted or accidental. It would be abrupt and a bit pointless.

Harrison gets around this quite simply. I don't think you can even die in this book. I've been playing for a while and I haven't died yet. Instead what happens - and this is sort of brilliant really - is you get lost instead. Harrison loves to create loops - sections that can ping you back and forth between the same handful of numbered paragraphs unless you're careful unless you're attentive.

There is a thrill here: it's the literary equivalent of an optical illusion I think that Harrison could create so many sections that worked regardless of the order that they're read in. There's also something quietly instructive. You get stuck in one of these paragraph mazes when you've ceased to focus. It reminds me very strongly of the Doldrums in The Phantom Tollbooth which is not a game book even though it can feel like one. The Doldrums are grey misty areas of twisting looping roads that you find yourself trapped within whenever you haven't been paying attention.

So: playful or bored? I am tempted to say playful for the most part. Harrison may be experimenting with an odd new form but this is a guy who had started out illustrating comics so you like to think hopping between one form and another would bring out the best in him. On top of that the action sequences here which often involve lightning fast choices short paragraphs and surprisingly tricky decisions really race along with an expert pelt. There is a passion for adventure and fun driving these parts of the book a desire to match the reader's paging back and forth for the next section with a hectic Looney-Tunes kind of action.

Then there's just the fact that Harrison throws some neat stuff into the book - I'm particularly fond of an evil guard who is so hardcore he's stitched his seargent's stripes onto his skin rather than his uniform. I don't think a writer would waste an idea like that on something he wasn't at least somewhat into.

Two final things. Firstly Choose Your Own Adventure type books are brilliant fun to read as an adult because you get to see a literary form evolving at an incredibly fast pace - for a while almost every new book would build on a good idea from elsewhere jettison stuff that had ceased to work and throw in something entirely new just to see what would happen. The readership was shaping the genre one new book to the next and it could be a bit like watching one of those summer storm clouds gather and darken and erupt over the course of a few minutes.

Secondly Harrison died in Brighton back in 2012 and I remember that because I almost got to meet him once. A friend of mine was part of an informal pub gathering of sci-fi writers and fans and Harrison used to come to their meetings - I think he was something of a hero to them all. I went along on a few occasions and found a quietly magical environment largely composed of knackered secondary school English teachers. The kind of place where you could make new friends eat a free packet of crisps and get into a serious argument about Tim Powers if you weren't careful.

I never turned up when Harrison was there though and then one day I read online that he had died. If I had met him with the benefit of this week's re-reading I think I would have said: thank you. Thank you for having fun with a lovely oddball genre and thank you for taking it seriously even as you had fun.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRleGVydG8uY29tL29waW5pb24vZ3RhLTYtZmVtYWxlLXByb3RhZ29uaXN0LWdvb2QtaWYtcm9ja3N0YXItZG9udC1naXZlLWluLWZhbmRvbS0xODg1OTYzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GTA 6 including a female protagonist is good — if Rockstar don’t give in to fandom,"Recent reports suggest GTA 6 will be introducing a female protagonist to the main narrative for the first time.

I would first like to point out how fantastic this is to hear. To know a major gaming company is working hard to atone for its lack of action in the past is a great step in the right direction.

From the sounds of things it appears Rockstar is committing to revamping its culture. According to a report by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier one employee had lauded the progress made by the company saying that it felt like a ‘boys’ club transformed into a real company” while morale is higher across the studio.

As for the game it has also been reported that this character will be Latina again another great win for diversity in the series. This is an especially big inclusion for the GTA franchise given historically the Latina community has been portrayed as the antagonists or rivals to the player.

Schreier has also noted that developers are “being cautious not to ‘punch down’ by making jokes about marginalized groups”.

Sexist and misogynistic GTA fans are already out for blood

On paper this is a fantastic idea. Something that has me intrigued and excited about. Rockstar taking their biggest franchise and seemingly modernising it is great for the gaming industry. To have one of the biggest developers pushing for this change is just about as inspiring and hopeful as it can get.

One problem with the reveal of a female protagonist for GTA 6 is that it is coming off the back of a great push forward to create a safer and better workplace environment and that has led to even more negativity from the more sexist and misogynistic elements of the GTA fanbase who don’t understand why Rockstar’s desire to modernise should be reflected in the game.

The online discourse has been depressingly predictable just like it was when Sam Kerr was revealed as FIFA’s first female cover star. I worry that the disgruntled fan base of GTA might ruin something that to many women is a huge win for diversity in the gaming space.

These examples are just from the first report. I shudder to think about what this line of dialogue will look like in the months to come when gameplay footage and character designs for GTA 6’s female protagonist begin to pop up.

It’s worth mentioning that not all fans are engaging in this negatively and many are even excited about the decision. Unfortunately though these voices feel overpowered by the hate that others are trying to insight.

GTA having a female lead will be a challenging task for Rockstar

I was way too young when I started playing GTA. San Andreas was the first real GTA title I played through and at the time it was just a fun game I could customize cars and wreak havoc in. As someone who grew up on the PlayStation 2 many of the best games on that console were a part of the GTA franchise. Since then I have played almost all the main GTA games.

However I stopped playing GTA Online due to the almost endless amount of sexist comments I would get sent to me through the Xbox 360’s private chat. It’s not hard to predict what the reaction to positive change for the series will be like from many fans but what we don’t know is whether the new character will be an inspiring female lead.

First and foremost almost all Grand Theft Auto protagonists are in some ways villains. They’re criminals and while their personal lives can sometimes be a great way to ground them in reality often they are just characters that want to kill people and move up the ranks of the criminal underbelly.

Take-Two Interactive Most GTA protagonists can be categorized as anti-heroes

Of course some are still beloved by the fan base. Vice City’s Tommy Vercetti and San Andreas’ Carl Johnson are just two examples of previous playable characters fans still adore.

It feels like Rockstar could be setting themselves up for failure now with a female protagonist. I worry about GTA’s potential female protagonist being used as a form of evidence of the transformation of Rockstar’s workplace culture. If she is similar to the others then she will appease the fanbase but likely not be an inspiring representation of a positive shift in workplace culture.

If this potential female lead is a more heroic type protagonist or god forbid an out and proud feminist some members of the GTA community will be up in arms. It’s all well and good that Rockstar wants to make changes but it’s hard to undo the damage the series has done over the last 20 years.

At its core the GTA franchise has never been an inclusive and diverse gaming space. The games themselves have for years been perpetuating negative stereotypes about women as well as the LGBTQ+ community.

Transphobic jokes from GTA V are finally being removed for the games current-gen release after featuring in the game since its initial release. And while one of the protagonist Trevor is presented as bisexual he is also seen acting aggressively towards his romantic partners. This type of representation does more harm than good.

Beyond that Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony was an expansion that provided an outdated and pretty much non-existent representation of the queer community. Many even described the expansion as “the straightest Grand Theft Auto ever“. The character’s sexuality is never even truly explored despite the expansion literally being called “The Ballad of Gay Tony.”

Article continues after ad

Rockstar Games Despite the promise of a more queer-centric GTA experience The Ballad of Gay Tony expansion was simply more of the same.

The only female character that comes to mind when examining strong and complex female characters in the GTA franchise is Catalina who appears in GTA: 3 and San Andreas. However she is depicted as lacking any control of her actions. An unhinged figure who is even described by CJ in San Andreas as “berserk.” Even despite all this she is still able to also be played off as a love interest.

So while this announcement has made me interested in the idea of a female protagonist making their way to the GTA 6 main story execution is so important. Here’s hoping that Rockstar can pull it off and that fans keep an open mind when the game finally releases.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtha3VjaG9wdXJlaS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy9jYWxsLW9mLWR1dHktbGVhZ3VlLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC0yMDIyLXRlYW1zLXNjaGVkdWxlLWFuZC1yZXN1bHRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[Updated] Call Of Duty League Championship 2022 – Teams Schedule & Results,"[Updated] Call Of Duty League Championship 2022 – Teams Schedule & Results

AP – To the naked eye the Mako Compressor Station outside the dusty West Texas crossroads of Lenorah appears unremarkable similar to tens of thousands of oil and gas operations scattered throughout the oil-rich Permian Basin.

What’s not visible through the chain-link fence is the plume of invisible gas primarily methane billowing from the gleaming white storage tanks up into the cloudless blue sky.

The Mako station owned by a subsidiary of West Texas Gas Inc was observed releasing an estimated 870 kilogrammes of methane – an extraordinarily potent greenhouse gas – into the atmosphere each hour. That’s the equivalent of burning seven tanker trucks full of gasoline every day.

But Mako’s outsized emissions aren’t illegal or even regulated. And it was only one of 533 methane “super emitters” detected during a 2021 aerial survey of the Permian conducted by Carbon Mapper a partnership of university researchers and NASA.

The group documented massive amounts of methane venting into the atmosphere from oil and gas operations across the Permian a 250-mile-wide bone-dry expanse along the Texas-New Mexico border. Hundreds of those sites were seen spewing the gas over and over again.

Ongoing leaks gushers going unfixed.

“We see the same sites active from year to year. It’s not just month to month or season to season” said a research scientist at the University of Arizona Riley Duren who leads Carbon Mapper.

Methane’s earth-warming power is some 83 times stronger over 20 years than the carbon dioxide that comes from car tailpipes and power plant smokestacks. Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have largely failed to regulate the invisible gas.

That leaves it up to oil and gas producers – in some cases the very companies who have been fighting regulations – to cut methane emissions on their own.

The Associated Press (AP) took the coordinates of the 533 “super-emitting” sites identified by Carbon Mapper and cross-referenced the locations with public records to piece together the corporations most likely responsible.

Just 10 companies owned at least 164 of those sites according to an AP analysis of Carbon Mapper’s data. West Texas Gas (WTG) owned 11.

The methane released by these companies will be disrupting the climate for decades contributing to more heat waves hurricanes wildfires and floods. There’s now nearly three times as much methane in the air than there was before industrial times. The year 2021 saw the worst single increase ever.

Last October AP journalists visited more than two dozen sites flagged as persistent methane super emitters by Carbon Mapper with a FLIR infrared camera and recorded video of large plumes of hydrocarbon gas containing methane escaping from pipeline compressors tank batteries flare stacks and other production infrastructure.

In addition to West Texas Gas’s Mako site AP observed a large plume of gas escaping from tanks at a WTG compressor station about 15 miles away in the Sale Ranch oil field. Carbon Mapper estimated that emissions from that site averaged about 410 kilogrammes of methane an hour.

In a statement Midland-based WTG said it routinely conducts its own overflights with gas detection equipment and within the last six months had either “repaired or upgraded” nine of the super emitting sites that AP asked about including Mako. The company was “actively addressing” another site though it declined to provide specifics. WTG said it inspected the last site and found no leak.

AP found Targa Resources a Houston-based natural gas storage processing and distribution company was the closest operator to 30 sites that were emitting a combined 3000 kilogrammes of methane per hour. Targa did not respond to a detailed list of questions from the AP.

“Reducing air emissions from the oil and natural gas sector is a top priority for the administration and for EPA” said Tomás Carbonell EPA’s deputy assistant administrator for stationary sources. Methane he added is “helping drive impacts that communities across the country are already seeing every day including heat waves and wildfires and sea level rise”.

But proposed rules to address emissions most oil and gas sites are still under review and if implemented will likely face legal challenges.

To track emissions the United States (US) government keeps an inventory of methane released into the atmosphere. Those figures are used by policymakers and scientists to help calculate how much the planet will warm.

AP found the government database often fails to account for the true rate of emissions observed in the Permian.

For example Devon Energy reported releasing methane equivalent to 42000 metric tonnes of CO2 for a year of operations in the Permian Basin. AP’s analysis using the detected emissions shows they would emit that much in just 46 days.

A spokesperson for Devon said the company is committed to reducing its methane emissions and being transparent about its progress.

The EPA could not provide AP with a single example of a polluter being fined or cited for failing to report or underreporting emissions.

At an international climate summit in November the US and more than 100 other countries signed on to a Global Methane Pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.

To meet that deadline the American oil and gas industry would have to reduce emissions at a rate far beyond anything currently seen.

The industry says it is working toward that goal.

“To be able to capture more methane emissions makes sense from a business perspective” said Frank Macchiarola a senior vice president at the American Petroleum Institute an industry trade group. “It’s the product that we ultimately want to bring to market.”

But climate scientists and environmentalists warn the industry’s incremental efforts are nowhere near enough to avoid dire consequences for humanity.

“Methane is responsible for 25 per cent of today’s global warming and we can’t limit future warming to two degrees Celsius if we don’t drastically cut those emissions” said Ilissa Ocko a senior climate scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund a group that campaigns for climate action.

“We have the tools to cut methane in half and the faster we do that the better off our climate and communities will be.”",,,,,,,,,

Antiviolence activist and ubiquitous protester Jamal Johnson and others staged a rally Saturday at the entrance of Sesame Place after several videos posted to social media showed costumed employees at the amusement park seeming to ignore Black children.

In one video a Sesame Place character can be seen knocking a very small Black child over. The videos led families and activists to call for a boycott of Sesame Place in Langhorne Bucks County.

Parent Jodi Brown posted a video to Instagram that’s now been viewed nearly one million times showing Sesame Place character Rosita seemingly ignoring and waving off her daughter and niece both 6 and Black and embracing children who appear to be white. After Brown’s video many parents began posting their own or sending them to a popular Philadelphia Instagram account called @nogunzone and others.

Johnson was joined on Saturday by several protesters from Philadelphia. The group remained relatively quiet because Johnson said last Saturday two protesters participating in a different rally were arrested for disorderly conduct and blocking the sidewalk at the park.

This weekend protesters held a sign with screenshots from Brown’s video and the words “Sesame Place said themselves that this is not ok!”

“It’s obvious that we still have obvious racial discrimination in 2022” said Johnson. “Our children are being traumatized already back home in our communities with this gun violence. Now they have to come here and be traumatized too.”

Reaction to the rally from the steady stream of park visitors was mixed. Some families cheered clapped and raised their hands and voices in support. Some jeered or muttered that there were more important things to fight against. But most people remained silent.

Adebayoo Arowolo of New Jersey said he won’t consider coming back to Sesame Place. He learned about the viral incidents on television but said he’d purchased tickets to the park for his two children ages 10 and 2 before the news broke.

“There’s nothing much to do than just to make awareness of it” Arowolo said before applauding the protesters. “I believe awareness will help in fighting [Sesame Place].”

Sesame Place had not responded to an email request for comment by late Saturday. The park though has issued three statements explaining and apologizing for the incident that affected Brown and her family.

Protester Yvonne Scott said she’d been to Sesame Place with her nephews but will never return.

“What they did is disgusting and I think it’s sad that there are Black people still coming in here” said Scott who is Black of North Philadelphia. “Even after they fix this I’ll never come back because in this day and age they should know better.”

Philadelphia mother Diane Leader was leaving but said she’d be back with her 7-year-old son who has autism. “He had a good experience” she said of her son in the park.

Still Leader said that she agrees with what the protesters are doing and that the employees caught on video should be fired and affected families should receive a year of free park admission.

“It’s disrespectful walking away from the kids” Leader said.

Grandmother Regina H. who did not provide her full last name came with her family from Connecticut and said she was not aware of racism allegations against Sesame Place. “If I knew that I wouldn’t have came” she said.

Sharlene Mountcastle was gifted Sesame Place tickets and brought her four Black children ages 6 to 1 to the park even after she said they had experienced discrimination. During an earlier visit Mountcastle said while her children were cheering and reaching for Sesame Place characters’ hands they were completely ignored. The employees Mountcastle said just kept walking.

“I just kept it moving I didn’t want to start nothing but I did feel some type of way” Mountcastle said of her own incident “because these are our babies and they love Elmo.”

Mountcastle said she brought her children because admission came at no cost to her but she would not be returning.

Brown whose video went viral held a news conference on July 20 with Tamika Mallory of Until Freedom and her own lawyer B’Ivory LaMarr. In an interview with CNN Brown called for the employee behind the Rosita costume to be fired. Sesame Place has not confirmed whether that has or will happen.

The park initially said the character Rosita’s gesture waving off children was in response to a request to hold a child for a picture which is prohibited. When more videos quickly surfaced the park issued a subsequent more apologetic statement saying it was “committed to making this right.”

Later Sesame Place said it had been in touch with Brown and her attorney. “To be very clear what the two young girls experienced what the family experienced is unacceptable” the most recent statement read. “It happened in our park with our team and we own that. It is our responsibility to make this better for the children and the family and to be better for all families.”

In a separate action Quinton Burns of Baltimore filed a federal lawsuit in Philadelphia on Wednesday against Sesame Place and its parent company SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment for breach of contract. The lawsuit alleges Sesame Place violated its agreement with Burns and his 5-year-old Black daughter Kennedi when characters ignored the girl during a “meet and greet” event. Burns presented a video of Sesame Place characters seeming to ignore his daughter and interact with other children who appear to be white.

In addition to the several apologetic statements leadership at Sesame Place said it will institute antibias training for employees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL25ld3Mva25vdy1hbmFseXN0cy1tdWNoLW1vcmUtYnVsbGlzaC0xMjEwMTM5NjMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Need To Know: Analysts Are Much More Bullish On Sherritt International Corporation (TSE:S) Revenues,"Sherritt International Corporation (TSE:S) shareholders will have a reason to smile today with the analysts making substantial upgrades to this year's forecasts. The consensus estimated revenue numbers rose with their view now clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects. Investors have been pretty optimistic on Sherritt International too with the stock up 12% to CA$0.41 over the past week. We'll be curious to see if these new estimates convince the market to lift the stock price higher still.

Following the upgrade the latest consensus from Sherritt International's three analysts is for revenues of CA$173m in 2022 which would reflect a decent 9.7% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Before the latest update the analysts were foreseeing CA$135m of revenue in 2022. The consensus has definitely become more optimistic showing a great increase in revenue forecasts.

View our latest analysis for Sherritt International

We'd point out that there was no major changes to their price target of CA$0.95 suggesting the latest estimates were not enough to shift their view on the value of the business. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. Currently the most bullish analyst values Sherritt International at CA$1.60 per share while the most bearish prices it at CA$0.50. So we wouldn't be assigning too much credibility to analyst price targets in this case because there are clearly some widely differing views on what kind of performance this business can generate. As a result it might not be possible to derive much meaning from the consensus price target which is after all just an average of this wide range of estimates.

Of course another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. For example we noticed that Sherritt International's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully with revenues forecast to exhibit 20% growth to the end of 2022 on an annualised basis. That is well above its historical decline of 19% a year over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 12% per year. Not only are Sherritt International's revenues expected to improve it seems that the analysts are also expecting it to grow faster than the wider industry.

The Bottom Line

The highlight for us was that analysts increased their revenue forecasts for Sherritt International this year. They're also forecasting more rapid revenue growth than the wider market. Seeing the dramatic upgrade to this year's forecasts it might be time to take another look at Sherritt International.

Let the family know you are thinking of them

July 31 2022

Gloria Duchin passed away peacefully Sunday morning July 31 at her home in Vero Beach Florida surrounded by her loving family.

Born in Yonkers New York on August 12 she was the daughter of Dominic and Mary ( Severino) DeStefano.

A fiercely intelligent accomplished and beautiful woman Gloria's drive and ambition unfolded initially in New York City at Lord & Taylor 5 th Avenue where she worked and rose in the ranks from an office clerical to fashion buyer efficiency expert to merchandizing executive. At the same time she was hand selected by fashion designer Anne Fogarty to be the face and model of her women's collection at Lord & Taylor. Eventually she became one of the youngest recipients to receive a Gold Medal award presented to her by Dorothy Schaver then president of Lord & Taylor for exemplary achievement: a highlight of Gloria's seven year tenure at the retailer.

Her business success continued at Lillian Vernon mail order company as Vice President with responsibility for purchasing and running the manufacturing division. It was there where Gloria's entrepreneurial spirit was nurtured and interest in running her own business took root.

In 1979 she founded Gloria Duchin Inc. a design and manufacturing company located in East Providence Rhode Island. Running her company was a passion and despite endless hard work she equally acknowledged the importance of timing and luck in terms of success. This was clearly exemplified by one of her very first customers Walmart Inc. At the time the giant retailer had approximately 240 stores. As the retailer grew so did her company. Today Walmart remains a customer and Gloria Duchin has over 100 million copyrighted ornaments in circulation.

In later years she would often tell the story of how proud Walmart's founder Sam Walton was that her jewelry and metal engravable Christmas ornaments were made in the USA.

Over the years Gloria and her company received numerous national awards and nominations from the McDonald's Corporation Target Things Remembered and Entrepreneur of the Year New England.

A determined and generous spirit she would offer support when needed and in whatever form it might take personally or financially. She took great pride in working with and developing young people especially her employees which continued throughout her life time. She was enormously proud that her company contributed over a million dollars throughout the years to the Make a Wish Foundation through a collaboration with the retailer Things Remembered. In addition her company also generously supported The 911 Fund after September 11 2001 and also donated Guardian Angel keepsakes that were requested by many of the families from Sandy Hook in December 2014.

Her generosity extended often but not exclusively to the community in where she resided:

The Ronald McDonald House Providence Hasbro Children's Hospital American Heart Association New England as well as the Cleveland Clinic Indian River Hospital in Vero Beach.

In her recently published memoir A Story of Perseverance and Success she notes that despite all of the enjoyment and success she experienced in business nothing was more important to her than her family.

And her family would agree.

She was pre deceased by her beloved husband David M. Duchin brothers Albert Carmine Daniel Edward and Frank DeStefano; sisters Grace Jewels and Jean Merriman.

Gloria is survived by her loving daughter Robyn Smalletz and her son in law Theodore of Providence Rhode Island grandson Jonathan his wife Dania and great grandchildren Shayna and Alexander of North Bethesda Maryland.

A Celebration of Life will be held privately at a later date.

In lieu of flowers donations may be made to St. Jude's Children's Hospital or Wounded Warrior Project.

This is the fifth and final article on papermaking in the Scioto Valley of Ross County Ohio. In the previous four articles I have written about the first recorded history of papermaking in Scioto Valley as well as the history of the paper mill on the south end of Chillicothe Ohio. The mill on the south end of Chillicothe was known in 1847 as the Entrekin Green and Company until acquired by the descendants of the Ingham Brothers in 1852. They operated the mill until 1890 when it was purchased by Colonel Daniel Mead of Dayton Ohio and became Mead Paper.

Article one “Papermaking In Scioto Valley” is a basic history of early papermaking in the Scioto Valley of Ross County Ohio from its earliest known origin on the Kinnikinnick Creek with Quaker brothers Hezekiah and Isaiah Ingham. The latter part of the article is an early history of the mill after it was acquired by Colonel Daniel Mead.

Article two entitled “Life & Death of Mother Mead” is a history of Mead Paper from 1890 until its merger with Westvaco in 2002.

Article three chronicles the 1975 union strike at the Chillicothe mill that shut down the facility from August 12 1975 until October 27 1975. The article is “Mead Paper Strike – 1975.”

Article four of this series details Mead Paper’s successful fight against a hostile takeover in 1978 by Occidental Petroleum led by Chairman Dr. Armand Hammer. CEO and President of Mead James Wilmer McSwiney led the effort to prevent this takeover. This article is entitled “A Big Mac Saves Mead.”

History records that two Quaker brothers from Pennsylvania Hezekiah and Isaiah Ingham began making paper on the Kinnikinnick Creek in Scioto Valley in 1810. Paper for printing was in demand in the area as Chillicothe in 1803 was the first capital of Ohio and there was a need for printing paper to support the state government. Descendants of the Inghams in 1852 acquired a paper mill on Honey Creek in the south end of Chillicothe operating it until 1890 when it was purchased by Colonel Daniel Mead of Dayton Ohio.

The Mead family also had a paper mill in Dayton Ohio but with the purchase of the mill in Chillicothe the Dayton mill was closed circa 1905 and some of its equipment moved to the Chillicothe mill. 1905 is also the year that George Houk Mead the grandson of Colonel Daniel Mead began the revitalization of a paper mill that was in bad shape both mechanically and financially. A testimony to his success is that the Mead Paper Company operated in reality from 1890 until its merger with Westvaco Papers in 2002 a period of 112 years. The Mead Paper Corporation in 1996 was an international company with sales of $4.7 billion and over 21000 employees scattered in many different countries of the world before it merged with Westvaco Papers.

MeadWestvaco - 2002

After struggling financially in the 1980s and early 1990s the mid-sized Mead Corporation became more financially sound in late 1990s and a target of larger corporations for takeover. In order to avoid a hostile takeover of the Mead Corporation they engaged in a three billion dollar stock swap with another mid-sized forest products corporation Westvaco in 2002. Westvaco in 1996 had over 15000 employees and 1.8 billion in sales with its main area of business being printing papers packaging and specialty chemicals.

The new MeadWestvaco Corporation had revenues of eight billion dollars and over 32000 employees with its core businesses being packaging specialty papers consumer and office products and specialty chemicals. Mead President and CEO Jerry Tatar became Chairman of MeadWestvaco with Westvaco President and CEO John Luke Jr. becoming the CEO and President of MeadWestvaco. After one year Chairman Jerry Tatar exercised a “golden parachute” agreement retiring in a deal estimated at over thirteen million dollars leaving top management of the company to John Luke Jr. MeadWestvaco had five printing papers mills including Mead mills in Chillicothe Ohio; Escanaba Michigan and Rumford Maine with Westvaco mills in Luke Maryland and Wickliffe Kentucky. The old Ingham Brothers mill on Honey Creek in Chillicothe Ohio was now a MeadWestvaco mill.

NewPage – 2005

After three years of being a MeadWestvaco mill the five printing paper mills and 900000 acres of forestland was sold to a private investment company Cerebus Capital Management for 2.3 billion dollars with purchase being complete in May of 2005. MeadWestvaco had decided that their main core segments of business would be in packaging consumer and office products and specialty chemicals. The old Ingham Brothers mill on Honey Creek was now a NewPage mill but it did not fit into the plans of NewPage management and it was sold to the Glatfelter Company of York Pennsylvania with sale finalized in April of 2006.

At the end of 2012 NewPage was listed as a leading producer of printing and specialty papers in North America with net sales of 3.1 billion with paper mills in Kentucky Maine Michigan Maryland Minnesota and Wisconsin. Annual production capacity of these mills was 3.5 million tons of paper. In 2014 NewPage was acquired by Verso.

Glatfelter – 2006

A press release in February of 2006 announced the purchase for eighty million in cash of the NewPage paper mill in Chillicothe Ohio by the P. H. Glatfelter Company of York Pennsylvania. Glatfelter was a global manufacturer of specialty papers and engineered products with mills in Spring Grove Pennsylvania and Neenah Wisconsin and operations in Germany France and Philippines. Shortly after the purchase of Chillicothe mill Glatfelter announced the closure of the Neenah Wisconsin mill.

In April of 2006 began the changeover to being a Glatfelter mill when Glatfelter’s Chairman and CEO George H. Glatfelter II stood in the entrance ways to the mill and greeted all of the incoming employees welcoming them to the new company. Later Glatfelter management personnel held employee meetings talking about Glatfelter and answering questions. Glatfelter stated the “Chillicothe mill was not on their radar it was the radar!” As a member of the sales force I had the opportunity to interact with George H. Glatfelter II at sales meetings and found him to be a special charismatic leader with ability to personalize himself with employees. Glatfelter introduced “book paper” to the production mix and after a learning curve it became a standard product for the Chillicothe mill.

Pixelle Specialty Solutions - 2018

On October 31 2018 P.H. Glatfelter Company announced the sale of their paper business to private investment firm Lindsay Goldberg. Lindsay Goldberg rebranded the new company as Pixelle Specialty Solutions with mills in Chillicothe Ohio and Spring Grove Pennsylvania. Pixelle is one of the largest specialty papers companies in North America specializing in food contact papers inkjet release liner carbonless forms envelopes greeting cards book paper and playing cards. Later Pixelle would add the Jay Maine and Stevens Point Wisconsin mills collectively operating eleven paper machines and producing more than one million tons of paper annually.

H.I.G. Capital – 2022

April 4 2022 Lindsay Goldberg announced an agreement to be acquired by H.I.G. Capital but terms not announced. That old Ingham Mead paper mill in south end of Chillicothe on Honey Creek may have a new name unknown as of the time of this writing. May she perform for the new owners as she has so reliably for her previous owners and may smoke continue to come out of the candy-striped smoke stack.

I’ve never been the primary driver of a new car in my life. I’ve been cruising with one hand on the steering wheel and one arm outside the window for more than 25 years but my vehicles were always used by somebody else before they got to me. Those include a 1984 Chevy Cavalier that my grandparents gifted me when I turned 16 a used 1993 Saturn that I bought for a couple grand in college a 2003 Toyota Camry that I purchased in 2005 and then drove for the next 13 years and a 2010 Mazda CX-9 that's still in my driveway.

They weren’t all necessarily beaters (though I might have argued otherwise when I was 18 and the Cavalier’s air conditioning continuously broke during those hot Atlanta summers). But I’ve driven four cars for my entire life. None of them were new.

That’s why the past month has felt a little strange. In June my wife and I bought a Tesla Model Y. No this is not an April Fool’s joke. This is the real thing. It’s got that fantastic new-car smell. It doesn’t have dings and dents (yet). It makes me feel wealthy (and a little bit pretentious at the same time).

I realize that Tesla is a perpetual punching bag on WCI. Dr. Jim Dahle fooled much of the audience when he wrote his infamous My New Tesla joke post on April 1 2021. As he wrote in 2019 in a post titled Why Tesla-Owning Doctors Hate Me “When I need an expensive consumer item or car or individual stock it comes to mind much more readily than a Bentley or a Porsche or a BMW. So I toss it into the post or the podcast and move on. Then Tesla owners take it as a personal assault on their lifestyle and sound off . . . Yes you have to drive something and you have to eat something. But you don't have to drive a Tesla and you don't have to eat at a Michelin 3-star restaurant. There is no financial justification to buy this item. None at all. So admit it is a luxury and let's move on.”

OK OK it’s a luxury just like it was when my wife and I splurged on our anniversary dinner last year at Michelin darling The French Laundry. Just like that extravagant meal we don’t need the Tesla Model Y; we want it. Is it something though we can afford?

Here is our justification for it.

We’re Moving to Electric Vehicles

A few months ago my family took a leisurely walk around the neighborhood and we included our 12-year-old twins in a debate about whether we should keep the car I was driving and had paid off long ago (a 2010 Mazda CX-9 that was in decent shape) instead of purchasing the Tesla. After all buying that new car would add a monthly loan payment for the next few years and I’ve prided myself on driving my cars into the ground so I could defer buying a new car for as long as possible (if you know anybody else that clocked more than 200000 miles in a Saturn SL2 like I did I’d like to hear about it).

I was slightly on the side of keeping the Mazda particularly since we both work from home and could conceivably keep it for another few years. My wife a quadruple-boarded child psychiatrist thought we should get the Tesla.

Here was her reasoning:

#1 Teslas Are Less of an Environmental Burden

We’ve been moving away from gas guzzlers. My Mazda got 18 miles per gallon in the city (where I did most of my driving) and 24 gallons on the highway and in response to that we purchased a Toyota Highlander Hybrid in 2018 for the better gas mileage and its lessened impact on the environment. Even if gas prices continue to drop from their high summer prices it made sense to move fully into the electric vehicle (EV) realm with our next vehicle especially since the cost of charging a Tesla is reportedly nearly four times cheaper per mile than it costs to make your gas car go.

According to my Tesla app I’m already saving significantly on gas.

#2 There Would Not Be a Cheaper Time to Buy This Car

From the time my wife placed an order for the Model Y Performance in October 2021 to when we actually picked it up in June 2022 the price of the car skyrocketed by about $10000. We were locked in to the lower price but if we declined the car what would happen if in 2023 or 2024 the Mazda went kaput? The Model Y could be $20000-$30000 more expensive than it is now.

#3 The Safety Features Are Amazing

My Mazda had a rear-facing camera and blind-spot recognition. But it’s also 12 years old. The Tesla’s safety features (its eight cameras that provide 360 degrees of visibility its dashcam its Sentry mode its collision-avoidance system its automatic emergency braking system) are simply not in the same ballpark as the Mazda.

We Save a Bunch

First a breakdown of how much this Model Y cost us:

When my wife ordered the car in October 2021 it cost $58440. That was our locked-in price. Now it costs $68000. In essence we bought low. Since we didn’t have a high-speed wall charger we needed an electrician to wire up our garage. That cost about $2400 but our city offers a rebate that will cut that price in half.

We also fully fund our 401(k)s and our solo 401(k)s we both take part in the Backdoor Roth IRA we fund our kids’ 529 plans we contribute to my wife’s Health Savings Account and we put money into brokerage accounts. We pay off our credit cards every month and the only debt we have is our mortgage (and um now the Tesla).

Of course the Tesla is a luxury item. And as Jim once wrote “Whether you buy it because it's fun to drive to impress your neighbors to save the environment or some combination of the above you should only do so if you can afford to do it without borrowing money or impacting your important financial goals.”

Yes we’re borrowing money to do so. But we’re comfortable that we’re still on our way to reaching our financial goals.

We Have a History of Paying Off Our Debts Quickly

OK I don’t love the fact that we’re financing $50000. But we got an interest rate of 2.94% for 60 months and we’ll have $864 monthly payments for the next five years (for what it’s worth the average monthly payment for a car in the US has crossed over $700 for the first time as new cars now average more than $47000).

But we paid off the Highlander Hybrid about 19 months early and we’re more than double-paying our mortgage every month ($2200 extra every month) meaning we should own our house several years earlier than our 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is scheduled to end (potentially in 2026 or 2027).

Plus we’re hoping we can sell the 2010 Mazda for somewhere in the $8000 range far above what Tesla offered as a trade-in (about $4000). We’ll use that to take a significant bite out of our car loan note.

Could we have paid cash for the car? Yes. But since we bought I Bonds near the end of 2021 and then bought more in March 2022 and since we front-loaded our Backdoor Roth IRAs for 2022 and since we sent money to our solo 401(k)s a few months ago well we didn’t want to dip into our emergency savings or start liquidating brokerage accounts to buy the car in cash.

Do I love having a large loan on this car? No. Am I comfortable with it because of our history and our likely future earnings? Yes.

It’s So Much Fun to Drive

Man the bursts of speed this Tesla provides are fantastic. The computer screen that sits in between the driver and the passenger is a treasure trove of entertainment to those riding in the car (though I’m a little tired of my kids and wife singing Olivia Rodrigo tunes over and over on the car’s “caraoke” system). And hey not having to spend $50 on gas a couple of times per month is cool.

I wondered what Jim Dahle’s reaction of our new Tesla would be. So I sent him this photo on Slack and a few hours later he responded.

Just because we’re a doctor family of course doesn’t mean we should have bought the Tesla. But we thought it through. We're still meeting our financial goals. We think we made a good purchase. And that’s no joke.

What I’m Reading This Week

The Brokerage Industry vs. the Advice Industry

On a recent Bogleheads on Investing Podcast host Rick Ferri and Michael Kitces talked about the financial advisor industry and the changes that brokerages and other companies are making. This quote from Kitces really struck me when Ferri asked him about the worst part of what’s happening right now when it comes to financial advisors.

Said Kitces who is the head of planning strategy at Buckingham Wealth Partners:

“The worst of the bad stuff is that the whole industry has figured out that the future is advice more holistic advice because I can get a diversified asset allocated portfolio from a platform for 25 or 30 basis points. We ain’t winning on that. We have to find somewhere else to find value. Our regulators are very very behind on this. There is open broad unfettered usage of titles like financial advisor by people who are literally not in the advice business. Their legal job is to represent their company to sell a product. We see it in the insurance channels. We see it in the brokerage channels. This ubiquitous adoption of financial advisor financial consultant and similar-sounding terms from people who are literally a salesperson. . . The brokerage industry figured out the future is advice before the advice industry figured out how to protect their own space. The brokerage industry is so encroached in the advice space . . . that just confuses the bejesus out of the consumer landscape in ways that frankly the brokerage industry benefits from. That’s why they continue to do that.”

As always if you’d rather ditch your financial advisor and create your own written financial plan you should check out WCI’s Fire Your Financial Advisor course.

Beginner's Luck?

Here’s an interesting story from USA Today about how one person’s portfolio is actually making money during a time when the market is teetering on becoming a bear. And it’s the part of her portfolio she started when she was a kid and knew virtually nothing about the financial world.

As Elizabeth Buchwald wrote:

“I graduated from an undergraduate business school and I cover personal finance and investing for a living only to have the portfolio I started in middle school beat my portfolio that I’ll one day live off in retirement. But the more I think about it I’m quite comforted that 12-year-old me is outperforming ‘grown-up' me.”

Is This a Good Idea?

Oh hey speaking of Tesla here’s a new way to invest with the company: buy its single-stock ETF. As reported by CNBC asset management firm AXS Investment is launching a number of single-stock ETFs that include Tesla NVIDIA PayPal and Nike and according to AXS are “designed for active traders traders that are looking to make tactical trading decisions on a daily basis.”

Though single-stock ETFs have become popular in Europe the fact that these ETFs won’t follow any type of index won’t help investors' portfolio diversification and could lead to more instability.

As the SEC said in a statement “Because levered single-stock ETFs in particular amplify the effect of price movements of the underlying individual stocks investors holding these funds will experience even greater volatility and risk than investors who hold the underlying stock itself.”

Money Song of the Week

Jonathan Kolon is a dentist in Utah who also owns a small bicycle business. But one of his true passions is making music. It’s how he paid for dental school in the 1990s and it’s where he learned that one should NOT underestimate the benefits of putting a few dollars into that tip jar.

That’s exactly the subject for his folk/country/bluegrass band Mountain Town when it plays its song Cash Tips.

As Kolon explained to me in a recent email “The premise is simple and I tell young musicians that fans want to support you. Get those dollars right now where you can see 'em! And those couple hundred greenbacks you have in the tip jar (or for Mountain Town we use an empty Old Crow plastic 1/2 gallon) at the end of a night: DO NOT SQUANDER THEM. Put 'em in the ATM the next day and invest in yourself your band and your future. I have to cut our wad of cash out of the plastic jug the morning after a show and many times have thanked my lucky stars because we would have had quite the time at the bar on the Mountain Town dime if the access was easier.”

Check out Mountain Town’s tune and as Kolon sings remember that “Cash Tips are the best tips . . . they've always been!”

I’ve been driving an electric car since early 2021  and have made the decision that I won’t be switching back to gasoline by choice. So when it came to booking a rental car for my upcoming vacation to Orlando the first thing I did was check out what electric cars were available.

Not many which isn’t a huge surprise but I was able to secure a Tesla Model Y for the duration of my two-week trip. Everything is booked paid for and I’m guaranteed that particular car. The only problem is I’ve been getting nervous about the whole thing — even though I know I shouldn’t be.

Renting an EV felt like a no-brainer

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

The decision to rent an EV while I was on vacation wasn’t a very difficult one. When I booked the price difference between a Model Y and a gasoline-powered car wasn’t that great. Around $200 at the time of booking compared to the cheapest car Hertz had to offer and the Model Y was far from the most expensive car I could have considered.

I don’t know what gas prices will be like come November especially now the average cost of fuel is slowly decreasing but not having to worry about how to find cheap gas in a tourist trap is the most appealing thing. Plus I’ll get to enjoy all the things that make a Tesla a Tesla which you wouldn’t get in an ordinary two-door hatchback.

Hertz only asks that you return the car with at least 10% battery remaining.

Autopilot is going to make long driving trips an absolute breeze and the built-in navigation system means I won’t need to use any of my data roaming allowances to get around. On top of that Hertz only asks that you return the car with at least 10% battery remaining .

So no hunting down a gas station on the way to the airport lest you end up with an extortionate bill from the rental company. Gas is expensive enough as it is right now so I shudder to think what you’d end up paying after returning a car with an empty tank.

But in the weeks since I made the booking I’ve started feeling a little anxious about renting an EV. Or more specifically I’ve been anxious about the prospect of recharging — a feeling that I’m a little familiar with. I felt much the same right before buying a Nissan Leaf  on account of the fact I can’t install an EV charger at home.

Irrational fears have come to the surface

In my experience fears over charging and range anxiety are largely unfounded. There are problematic areas and some cars do have extraordinarily low range but I know these aren’t going to be problems on my vacation.

But there’s that little voice hiding in the irrational part of my brain going “yeah but what if everything goes wrong?”

The Tesla Model Y I booked has 303 miles of range according to the website so I’m not going to need to recharge that often. When you’re spending your days inside giant theme parks the last thing you want to be doing is driving around.

I also did my research on Orlando’s charging infrastructure before I paid for the car. How many chargers there are where they’re concentrated and the ratio of slower AC chargers and ultra-fast DC rapid chargers. I even looked at which hotels had their own charging facilities in case any of them were within my price range.

There's no shortage of EV charger in Orlando (Image credit: PlugShare)

Sadly not but from what I can tell Orlando’s EV charging infrastructure isn’t half bad. Significantly better than where I live anyway and there are a few areas where EV chargers and hotels seem to be concentrated. So I wasn’t left having to choose between a nice place to stay and easy access to car-friendly power.

A lot of the big parks have EV chargers of course but only in very limited numbers. The highest number is five by my count at Disney’s Animal Kingdom. Those chargers are available on a first-come basis and odds are whoever gets there first will be plugged in all day. In my mind it’s not even worth considering those chargers as an option as convenient as they might be.

In the end I chose a hotel right in the middle of a big cluster of chargers and pretty close to the parks. It also happens to be half a mile away from a Tesla Supercharger and with easy access to at least two more. It doesn’t matter what you think of Tesla the scale of the Supercharger network is pretty darn impressive.

But to top it all off all of Hertz’s rented Teslas come with an adapter that lets you plug into J1772 chargers. So if you’re willing to charge a little slower you’re not necessarily beholden to Tesla’s network.

Fear of the unknown is the real enemy here

(Image credit: Tesla)

With all that in mind you’d think that all my fears would be extinguished. And yet I still have occasional feelings of anxiety floating through my brain. No amount of logic or rational thinking is stopping those feelings from popping up every now and then.

The bays may be full when I need them equipment may be broken or I might have to spend my precious downtime waiting for the car to recharge.

While not to sound cliche it’s all down to the fear of the unknown. My familiarity with Orlando is fleeting at best and part of my brain is going to wonder about things that may go wrong. The bays may be full when I need them equipment may be broken or I might have to spend my precious downtime waiting for the car to recharge.

And these fears are so incredibly stupid I’m annoyed at myself for feeling them. I didn’t feel like this last time I went to Florida and had to fill my rental car with gas. And I know once I get to Orlando my brain will click everything into place and stop its incessant worrying.

That’s exactly what happened when I bought my Nissan Leaf. I’d done my research figured out where the local chargers were how much they cost and still I felt anxious. As soon as I took the car to recharge those feelings disappeared in an instant. Now the only thing I have to worry about is maneuvering around my neighbor’s atrocious parking.

But the run-up to my vacation is giving me some new-found sympathy for people who have concerns about making the switch to an electric car .

I own an EV and I write about them on a daily basis so I know I don’t need to worry about recharging my rental car — especially since it’s a Tesla. But I’m getting anxious in spite of this so you can’t blame people with zero electric car experience for having concerns. No matter how much you can try to educate people it’s no substitute for those people experiencing electric cars for themselves.

Bottom line

I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that renting a Tesla for the duration of my vacation will go pretty smoothly. I’m getting a nice car with an impressive range estimate; there’s no shortage of charging points; and I’m not going to be doing a great deal of driving anyway.

But no matter what I know and what I tell myself that little voice at the back of my mind is pretty persistent. It may disappear for a few days but it’ll always pop back up and hang around like an annoying song.

Unfortunately that’s just the way things are and the only thing I can do between now and November is wait. But hey at least I know I’ll be able to enjoy myself once I actually get off the plane.

Back in 2018 Tesla had a referral program to help sell vehicles – owners could share a referral code with new buyers who would receive Supercharging credits. In exchange referrers would get prizes based on how many people they referred.

One of the prizes was launching a picture into deep space.

Launch Your Photo into Deep Space Orbit We’ll laser-etch any image onto glass and send it into deep space orbit for millions of years. Refer more friends while you wait for an alien race to discover your payload.

Last month we reported that Tesla had yet to deliver on the prize – four years after the program ended. A week later Tesla finally launched a system for referral program prize winners to send their pictures in space but we didn’t know when Tesla was actually going to launch the pictures or how.

Now Tesla has confirmed that they will launch on the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter mission to be launched by SpaceX next week.

Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy — thank you for your support in making it a reality. Your photo will be launched into space on the KPLO mission on August 4 2022.

With the confirmation Tesla also released this mosaic of the pictures it will be sending being assembled to recreate an image of the Tesla Roadster in space.

In February 2018 SpaceX launched its first Falcon Heavy rocket and it needed a “dummy load” to send into space in order to demonstrate the capability.

Musk who is the CEO of both SpaceX and Tesla decided to launch his own Tesla Roadster.

Due to the higher risk of failure with a brand-new rocket SpaceX didn’t want to put something too valuable out there like a satellite but at the same time Musk didn’t want to just launch a weight into space.

He figured that launching a Tesla Roadster would be more interesting and inspiring – and that it was. The video of the launch became extremely popular and it created stunning images of the Tesla Roadster in space.

I had Canvaspop make printouts of one of those pictures (using high-res images that SpaceX released on Flickr) and I display it in my house.

Now the vehicle is believed to be over 180 million miles from Earth traveling at 8100 mph.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vbXktZnJpZW5kLWhhcy1oYWQtMzQtY2Fycy1oZXMtb25seS1rZXB0LWhpcy10ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC0zL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vbXktZnJpZW5kLWhhcy1oYWQtMzQtY2Fycy1oZXMtb25seS1rZXB0LWhpcy10ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC0zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My Friend has had 34 Cars. He’s only kept his Tesla Model 3.,"By

My friend Travis has had 34 cars in 11 years of having a license. A Tesla Model 3 is the only one he has kept in his driveway for more than a few months. He’s now going on his fifth year of Tesla ownership.

In 2018 we were playing Xbox together when told me he was buying a Tesla Model 3. In the four years since he has had numerous vehicles from Jeeps to pickup trucks to performance vehicles to muscle cars.

“I have owned 34 vehicles. There have only been two vehicles I have kept for a decent amount of time” he told me. “My first car was a Nissan Sentra and my 2018 Tesla Model 3. I kept the Nissan for 2 years and the Tesla I had for four years. There have been many vehicles that I have purchased and sold in a short period of time. I have sold 3 vehicles before even getting them registered and getting a new title so they were bought by me and sold by me within 4 days to 15 days.”

Our friendship has spanned many years. We grew up playing Little League together and we eventually went from teammates to rivals competing for different high schools on the soccer field. Now that we’re both out of the military for him and college for me we have transitioned to golf and we spend many weekends on the course together with other friends.

The Tesla always comes up in conversation.

It only occurred to me recently that Trav gets rid of cars like I do socks. In fact just four weekends ago I met up with him for an early round of golf on a beautiful Sunday morning. He shows up in this red Corvette I’ve never seen and tells me he just picked it up from a man in Annapolis the previous day.

Fast-forward to last weekend: Travis sends me a Snapchat of the Corvette driving down the street. He had just sold it to someone else. He just loves driving different cars.

But the Tesla is a different story. Only getting a new Tesla because of the used car market right now Travis has kept a Model 3 in his driveway for four years; a significantly longer period of time than any other car previously.

“One reason is the cost of ownership alone” he said. “You save so much money in the Tesla. After four years of ownership I never visited a service center and the only maintenance I did was windshield washer fluid and two sets of tires in 92000 miles. The App is super convenient for so many reasons. Being able to see where the car is parked in the middle of a city or a busy parking lot makes it very easy to find. Also being able to heat the car or cool the car with the touch of one button on your phone is super nice as well as venting the windows on a hot day.”

Travis traded in the 2018 LR AWD Model 3 earlier this year and picked up a 2022 Midnight Silver Metallic version in the same configuration.

“The only reason I traded my old Model 3 was just that the used car market is high right now” he said. “If the market for used cars wasn’t so high I would have kept it. I bought a 2022 Tesla Model 3 and picked a different color just to have some change. I always said I would never sell my Tesla unless it was for a newer one that was either faster had more range or someone was willing to pay a lot for it and that’s what I did.”

As a realtor selling houses in our home state of Pennsylvania and in nearby Maryland one of the biggest advantages of having the car is not having to spend money on gas. Prices in the U.S. are incredibly high and in PA they reached $5 a gallon for the first time in our lifetime. Even back in 2018 he was spending considerably less than others.

When Travis got out of the Air Force a few years ago and moved back to PA he drove the Tesla here. “I drove my Model 3 from Colorado to Pennsylvania and spent $47 at Superchargers along the way. My friend making the same trip spent $527 on gas.”

Now that he’s a relator and is driving around for open houses or to close a deal the savings alone are making his job even easier and less financially stressful.

As for other drivers Trav says an EV is absolutely the best option for those who are in the market for a new car. “I ABSOLUTELY would encourage others to purchase an EV. The best part about all the trips I have taken: to Maine to Tennessee and to the beach is I do not even plan the trip out. I just get in my Model 3 and put the address in and start driving. The screen tells me where to stop to charge which normally is no more than a half mile out of the way.”

As for those who are skeptical of whether the Model 3 will stick around in Trav’s repertoire I wouldn’t count on it going anywhere anytime soon. “I will always have one” he said.

The Cupertino giant's intentions were revealed after recruiter Elad Wertheimer posted on LinkedIn that Apple is planning to open a new development site in Jerusalem and is looking for chip engineers. They will participate in Israel-based flagship projects specifically the development of Mac processors.





Apple opened its first site in Israel in Herzliya in 2015 a few years after taking over the Israeli flash-memory startup Anobit . The company also acquired 3D sensing Israeli company PrimeSense in 2013 . There is also an R&D center in Haifa’s Matam high-tech park which welcomed 100 employees who were laid off by Texas Instruments.





Apple's senior vice president of hardware technologies Johny Srouji who is from Haifa played a key part in setting up R&D centers in Israel which employ around 2000 people. Srouji had previously worked at Intel and IBM. He joined Apple in 2008 and was initially tasked with the development of iPhone chips. In 2015 he was given a leadership role and now leads the team that makes chips for Apple products. Some of those team members reside in Israel.





The Israel teams contributed greatly to the development of Apple's first M series processor the M1. The company is currently looking to fill more than 100 positions in Israel.









Apple announced last month that it was expanding its engineering R&D hub in Rawabi Palestine where it currently employs more than 60 engineers. The Palestinian team works with Israeli centers in Herzliya and Haifa.

How do you build a steelpan programme at a college in Texas?

If you’re percussionist Michael Mizma you come up with unique strategies to build up steelbands at local intermediate and secondary schools in the area which you nurture and support bring in leading pannists to work with your students and get grants for new commissions of music for pan. Prof Mizma has been teaching at San Jacinto College near Houston Texas since 1990 and while pan is just one of the many aspects of his work in the music department – where he teaches a broad range of percussion classes as well as classes on music technology audio engineering and music business – no one can doubt that Trinidad and Tobago’s national instrument has had a major role in his professional life. He is very much a pan jumbie.

Mizma first heard pan when auditioning for graduate school and soon after heard the sound again while biking the streets of Toronto where he met Earl La Pierre. He was hooked and joined La Pierre’s Aftopan Steel Orchestra and participated in the Caribana steelband competition that summer. The next fall semester he began his master’s degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The steelband with instruments made by Cliff Alexis was always a favourite activity and ensemble.

As with many pan pioneers in the university system in the US Mizma started introducing pans in other ensembles in his college before he had bought enough instruments to form the first steelband at San Jacinto College in 1997. Since then he has come to Trinidad to play with Birdsong brought in visiting artists and is constantly exploring new ways to expand his programme. In developing the steelband programme at San Jacinto he has had strong support from the administration and the heads of the music department.

Early on Mizma understood that getting first-year students interested in joining a steelband wasn’t easy when they had had little to no exposure to pan or in some cases no musical experience. He knew he needed a way to help start steelbands in the music programmes of the local schools whose students entered San Jacinto.

To jumpstart them he took the older pans he had replaced with newer instruments for his students and created a starter set that could be loaned to different schools. As these programmes developed and bought their own instruments Mizma then passed on this starter set to other schools.

The first time he tried this it didn’t work. But he didn’t give up and five bands in three school districts have benefited from the pan loan programme.

Mizma has also made new affiliations with three more high school bands in the region. The result is that steelband is a respected part of the local music curriculum. Now to get these programmes better exposure Mizma has started to have joint concerts showcasing both his college ensemble and those of the other schools in the area.

“Over the years our steelband has increased the size of its audience tenfold” he said. “As the popularity of the ensemble grew we had to perform in the largest hall on campus. Concert attendance has gone from about 80 to over 800 and into the thousands with the addition of live streaming.”

Mizma and the San Jacinto College Steelband have focused on another initiative. Over the past 13 years he and the band have commissioned a number of new pieces for pan that have often involved other music ensembles at his college and more recently secondary-school bands. These new pieces for pan have been the results of ongoing grants from the San Jacinto College Foundation and he has been very appreciative of their ongoing faith in helping create new music for steelpan.

The first piece was a suite on Trinidad folklore by Gary Gibson in 2010 for choir and steelband. Mizma has commissioned five pieces for choir and steelband. He also commissioned Gibson a few years later to write a piece that involved all the music ensembles at San Jacinto. Gibson is a strong fan of Mizma’s role in commissioning new compositions for pan.

In his view “Mike has done the steelpan world a great service in regularly challenging contemporary composers with commissions for works that demonstrate the capabilities of the modern steel orchestra. The body of work created continues to grow and the various combinations of pan with other musical ensemble types exposes the flexibility and usefulness of the steelpan ensemble to a broader audience.

“This is an important step in the maturation and acceptance of the steelpan in the modern musical world.”

Mizma and his band have commissioned other leading US-based pannists including Dave Longfellow Phil Hawkins Emily Lemmerman Victor Provost and Jonathan Scales

Northern Illinois University’s Prof Liam Teague was delighted to be commissioned for last fall’s concert.

“I have been for many years a passionate advocate of original steelpan music” said Teague.

“In addition to my original steelpan compositions I have commissioned several prominent composers to write for the steelpan and I was elated when approached by Prof Mizma to create a concerto for steelpan especially given that it was something I always wanted to do.""

Dream is indeed a concerto in that it offers significant opportunity for the soloist to highlight their musical and technical prowess – it even requires the soloist to improvise.

“However unlike most traditional concerti performed by symphony orchestras the piece is primarily a calypso.

“I have dedicated Dream to the legacy of Dr Clifford Alexis my mentor and friend and much of the piece references his compositions Summer Song Song to the Chiricahua and Confusion Reggae.”

Recently Mizma has asked for the suites to be composed in six movements with the final two having parts for beginning players so that his steelband can be joined by the intermediate and high school players.

He commissioned CJ Menge who runs a pan education programme in the Austin Texas area and has recently travelled to train steelbands as far north as Alaska.

“River to the Sea is a multi-movement work reflecting on the central role that water plays in connecting diverse cultures and communities.

“It was a great pleasure collaborating with Michael Mizma and his students to bring this new work for steelband to life” Menge added.

“Prof Mizma is an excellent educator and master motivator for his students who come to each rehearsal well-prepared and receptive to the workshop process that is involved with premiering new works. The greater steelpan community is fortunate to have such a dedicated advocate for new music in Michael Mizma.”

Its world premiere was at a concert on May 7 at the Miller Outdoor Theatre in Houston enjoyed by over 1700 people.

Trini Josanne Francis who got her masters in steelpan performance at Northern Illinois and is now working on her PhD in music education at the University of Maryland – while running her own steelpan educational company Steel on Wheels – is to compose a suite for the fall 2022 concert inspired by traditional Carnival characters like sailors midnight robbers and moko jumbies.

She said “I love traditional mas and used to be a midnight robber on Carnival Mondays.

“Our traditional mas is so rich and vibrant. Whether it be the playfulness of the devil the lyricism of the robber or the giant steps of the moko jumbie each character brings its own personality vibe and other characteristics that can be expressed musically.”

At a time when arts education and music programmes are under attack in schools across the US it is the work of professors like Mizma that helps keep school steelbands alive and thriving.

The U.S. Marine Corps Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle (ARV) a new platform in prototype form waiting for additional service testing and evaluations will likely include a range of laser weapons systems.

The ARV program which could enter production sometime next year is a key part of the U.S. Marine Corps strategy for future amphibious warfare particularly in the Pacific theater. The service is now evaluating two industry prototype offerings and vehicles from both Textron and General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) will soon be delivered to the service.

While there is some chance the new reconnaissance mission might be fulfilled by a modified version of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) a new ship-to-shore attack platform the U.S. Marine Corps has remained committed to developing a lighter expeditionary ARV to perform scout surveillance and reconnaissance missions. As a deployable light-weight vehicle as many as four ARVs could fit on a Landing Craft Air Cushion or Ship-to-Shore connector.

At the moment there is no formal U.S. Marine Corps requirement for lasers on the ARV. However industry builders such as GDLS are planning for the possibility that the service might want to add lasers to the vehicle. GDLS engineers have designed special accommodations for the vehicle to operate with enough power to support weapons such as lasers.

“We are anticipating in the future that the power demands for things like directed energy will be part of the Marine Corps future” Phil Skuta the director of strategy and business development US Marine Corps and Navy General Dynamics Land Systems told The National Interest in an interview.

High-tech weapons and rapid modernization for systems such as lasers are a point of emphasis in the U.S. Marine Corps Force Design 2030 document which anticipates multi-domain maritime warfare circumstances requiring advanced precision weaponry. Modern weapons for example will need to operate in what the U.S. Marine Corps calls a “stand in” capacity able to operate inside of an enemy’s engagement zone.

The Force Design document intends to prepare U.S. Marine Corps platforms for future weapons advanced tactics and warfare scenarios so it makes sense that GDLS and Pentagon developers would be considering lasers. Force Design 2030 does stress the importance of operating effectively within what it refers to as a “Weapons Engagement Zone.”

“Forces that can continue to operate inside an adversary’s long-range precision fire weapons engagement zone (WEZ) are more operationally relevant than forces which must rapidly maneuver to positions outside the WEZ in order to remain survivable” Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger wrote in the Marine Corps Force Design 2030 Document.

Operating from a highly-dangerous yet strategically advantageous position these so-called WEZ “stand-in” forces can “attrite adversary forces enable joint force access requirements complicate targeting and consume adversary ISR resources and prevent fait accompli scenarios” General Berger explained.

The service is now evaluating ARV prototypes from Textron and General Dynamics Land Systems to determine which is best suited to meet future Marine Corps warfare requirements. General Dynamics’ offering attempts to align with future Marine Corps needs by providing the capability to launch reconnaissance and attack drones from the vehicle itself. This will prepare the platform for manned-unmanned teaming which will allow the Marine Corps to extend its surveillance reach even deeper into highly contested enemy territory.

In fact General Dynamics has already launched drones from its ARV prototype with the ultimate goal being to connect drones to other drones manned vehicles and even aircraft and surface ships General Dynamics developers say. General Dynamics developers say they aim to ensure that both the ARV vehicle and its forward-launched drones can connect with manned and unmanned combat nodes through a multi-domain sphere.

The manned-unmanned teaming concept of operation now being pursued tested and implemented across the military services is fundamental to the vision outlined in the Marine Corps’ Force Design 2030 strategy. The document calls for the elimination of tanks and other heavy platforms in favor of faster more deployable amphibious systems and weapons. Part of the rationale is in some ways based on the fighting in Ukraine where dispersed fast-moving fighters armed with anti-armor weapons have been able to prevail in ambushes and hit-and-run attacks against heavy armor. These tactics have often been enabled by small vehicles or hand-launched surveillance drones capable of identifying approaching enemy forces.

“As a ‘stand-in’ force of the future the Marine Corps requires a family of UAS [Unmanned Aerial Systems] capabilities. We need to transition from our current UAS platforms to capabilities that can operate from ship from shore and be able to employ both collection and lethal payloads. These future capabilities must be expeditionary and fully compatible with Navy platforms and command and control networks” Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger wrote in the Force Design 2030 strategy.

General Dynamics’ ARV offering may be able to do just that. “UAS being launched from the ARV can go out to a distance to target or collect enemy information. We use sensors both on and off the vehicle as we underwent testing for some of the networking and cyber functions. The vehicle performed well” said Phil Skuta General Dynamics Land Systems’ director of strategy and business development for the U.S. Marine Corps and Navy.

Specimens of Thai Daboia siamensis were retrieved from the snake farm of Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (QSMI) the Thai Red Cross Society Thailand. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethic Committee of the Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute Animal Care and Use (Approval no. QSMI-ACUC-03-2016) in accordance with the guidelines of the National Research Council of Thailand. This study is reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines (https://arriveguidelines.org). Tissue samples were harvested from an adult female snake weighted 0.495 kg with a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of 96 cm and a total length (TOL) of 108.5 cm. Venom gland and crude venom were harvested from an adult male snake weighted 0.375 kg with SVL of 83 cm and TOL of 97 cm. All specimens were captured from Sakaew province Thailand. Snakes were housed individually in a secure locked plastic cage equipped with a hiding box and water bowl. They were fed mice once weekly until being experimented. Prior to venom glands and other organs removal snakes were fully euthanized by a high dose of isoflurane inhalation and were monitored for at least 20 min to the point of loss of reflex. The euthanized snakes were disposed of according to the QSMI guideline.

Genomic DNA library preparation

Whole genomic library preparation was carried out using the 10x Genomics linked-read technology. High Molecular Weight (HMW) genomic DNA (gDNA) is required for the preparation process. In this study HMW gDNA was extracted from fresh Daboia siamensis liver tissue. First 500 mg of tissue was harvested and subsequently snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissue was stored at − 80 °C before proceeding to gDNA library preparation by Novogene Co. Ltd. (China). Prior to the gDNA extraction process the frozen tissue was kept in a tube and then thawed by placing a tube on ice. The tissue was cut into pieces (~ 25 mg per piece) and placed in 1.5 ml Kimble Kontes Pellet Pestle tubes. These tubes were maintained on ice. The nuclei isolation-digestion and DNA purification processes were achieved as described in the 10x Genomics Technical Note: Sample Preparation Demonstrated Protocol-Rev B (CG000072). The purified gDNA was stored at − 20 °C and quantified using the Qubit dsDNA BR Kit as described in the 10x Genomics Technical Note: Chromium Genome Reagent Kits User Guide-Rev C (CG00022). The acceptable concentration of the diluted DNA is in the range of 0.8–1.2 ng/µl.

Snake genome sequencing

Purified gDNA was partitioned across Gel Bead-in-Emulsions (GEMs) using GemCode technology. The processes related to GEM generation and incubation DNA barcoding and genome library construction are described in the 10x Genomics Technical Note: Chromium Genome Reagent Kits User Guide-Rev C (CG00022). Illumina-ready sequencing libraries were generated using Chromium Genome Chip and Chromium Controller. The resulting libraries were composed of P5 and P7 adaptors Read 1 16 bp 10x Barcode gDNA insert Read 2 and sample index ready for sequencing process. Read 1 sequence and the 10x Barcode were included during the GEM incubation whereas P5 and P7 primers Read 2 and sample index were added during the library construction. Genome sequencing was carried out using the Illumina HiseqX system to generate paired-end libraries with 150 bp read length. The final results of the sequencing process were outputted as FASTQ files. A conventional short-read sequencing was performed by using the Qiagen Blood and tissue DNeasy to isolate genomic DNA from liver tissues according to the manufacturer’s description (Qiagen GmbH). The Paired-End Sequencing Sample Prep kit was used to prepare libraries from 5 µg of isolated gDNA according to the manufacturer’s description (Illumina). Either a 200 bp band or a 500 bp band was cut from the gel (libraries PE200 and PE500 respectively). After amplification the resulting libraries were analyzed with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 DNA 1000 series II chip according to the manufacturer’s description (Agilent). Illumina Hiseq 2500 system will be used to perform short-read genome sequencing. Genomic libraries are paired-end sequenced with a read length of 150 nucleotides (150 bp). The results are genomic sequences in the form of FASTQ files. All-low quality reads (Q score < 30) were eliminated using Sickle22.

De novo genome assembly

The de novo assembly of the 10x Genomics linked-read sequencing was performed using Supernova version 2.1.123. FASTQ files were used as input when executing the software and parameters were configured as recommended by the software guidelines. The assembly process was done using a computer workstation with 32 CPU cores and 512 GB RAM. The assembly of conventional short reads was carried out using SOAPdenovo2 (version 2.04) executing on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Biowulf cluster (https://hpc.nih.gov/).

Venom gland transcriptome data generation

Fresh tissue samples of the venom gland were harvested from a female D. siamensis. Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kits were used for the RNA library preparation from these samples. The sequencing of the venom gland transcriptome was achieved using Illumina Hiseq 2500 system. Rcorrector24 and Cutadapt25 were used to correct sequencing errors and remove low-quality bases.

Genome annotation

Annotations for the assembled Daboia siamensis scaffolds were achieved using the automated genome annotation pipeline MAKER26. This software performs ab initio gene prediction protein and transcript alignment repeat identification and 5’ and 3’ UTR inference. The final gene models along with quality control statistics are provided by MAKER. Inputs for MAKER included the assembled Daboia siamensis genome repeats identified by RepeatModeler (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/) and Repclass27 proteins corresponding to Serpentes suborder (taxon identifier 8570) downloaded from UniProt database28 and transcriptome data of the venom gland. Ab initio genes and coding DNA sequences (CDSs) were predicted by MAKER.

Scaffold quality assessment

The quality of scaffolds was assessed using BUSCO29 to estimate the genome completeness score. In this study the Vertebrate near-universal single-copy orthologs (SCOs) database was selected as a search database for quality assessment.

Venom protein identification using in-gel and in-solution digestion techniques

Venom proteins were separated by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D SDS-PAGE). Briefly 40 µg of crude venom was loaded onto bis–tris 12.5% acrylamide gels (Life Technologies). Gels were run at 200 V for 50 min stained overnight with 0.1% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 destained with water. Destained gels were scanned with the Odyssey infrared imaging system. Molecular weights were estimated based on protein standards. The gel was cut into 13 fractions from top to bottom. Each gel fraction was destained with 50% ACN/25 mM ammonium bicarbonate reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 56 °C for 30 min and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. For trypsinization 12.5 ng/µl trypsin solution was added to each sample and incubated for 60 min on ice. Excess trypsin was removed an additional 50 µl of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added to gel pieces and samples were digested overnight at 37 °C. Following the overnight digestion the samples were vortexed for 1 h at room temperature and sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 3 min and the tryptic peptides were extracted in 50 µl of 50% ACN/0.1% FA. The tryptic peptides were desalted with C18 StageTips. The samples were dried and stored at -80 °C for mass spectrometry analysis.

For in-solution digestion 100 µg of crude venom was reconstituted in 8 M urea and added 10 mM DTT for reduction at 56 °C for 30 min. The sample was alkylated by adding 40 mM of IAA at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Subsequently 2 µg of trypsin was added and incubated overnight. On the following day 10 µl of 100% FA was added centrifuged at room temperature for 10 min and then placed in a SpeedVac concentrator. The sample was reconstituted with 0.1% FA and fractionated by using Pierce high pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation kit (Thermo scientific). Peptides eluted from each fraction were dried and stored at − 80 °C for mass spectrometry analysis.

Nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and database searches

Peptides were separated by nano-liquid chromatography (EASY-nLC 1000 Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Thermo Fisher Scientific) through an EASY-Spray nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The MS methods included a full MS scan at a resolution of 70000 followed by 10 data dependent MS2 scans at a resolution of 17500. The full MS scan range of 200–2000 m/z was selected and precursor ions with the charge states of + 1 or greater than + 8 were excluded. Normalized collision energy of HCD fragmentation was set at 28%. Raw LC–MS/MS files were searched using PEAKS Studio version 8.5 against UniProt proteins corresponding to suborder Serpentes and the CDS database predicted by MAKER. A target-decoy approach was used to limit a false discovery rate (FDR) of the identified peptides to less than 1%. Parent and fragment monoisotopic mass errors were set at 10 ppm. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine (C) was used as a fixed modification. Oxidation (M) acetylation (protein N-term) phosphorylation (STY) and deamidation (NQ) were set as variable modifications. A maximum of 1 missed cleavage was allowed.

De novo sequencing-based MS/MS spectra search

Additionally raw LC–MS/MS files were searched by SMSNet30 using the venom gland transcriptome UniProt proteins corresponding to suborder Serpentes concatenated with the CDS database as the reference database. This software is implemented based on deep learning models incorporated with de novo sequencing processes for the MS/MS spectra interpretation. The SMSNet-M model which recognizes variable oxidation of methionine was used. Precursor mass tolerance was set at 30 ppm. The false discovery rate was set at 5% at amino acid level. Low confidence amino acid positions were transformed into mass tags. Partially identified peptides and peptides containing isoleucine/leucine were searched against the reference databases. For example a partially identified peptides HG(196.1203)TSACK will be matched to all reference sequences that start with HG end with TSACK and contain a combination of amino acids whose total weight is 196.1203 in the middle. Only those with unique hits were retained as the final identified peptides. For example since 196.1203 is roughly equal to the combined mass of a valine and a proline if both HGVPTSACK and HGPVTSACK are present in the reference database the partially identified peptide HG(196.1203)TSACK would be discarded because we could not distinguish between the two possibilities. All CDSs with at least one mapped peptide were compared with search results provided by PEAKS Studio.

All animal experiments conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Research Center for Animal Life Science at Asahikawa Medical University. The animal experiments conformed to the protocols including ethical treatment reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Asahikawa Medical University (IACUC Approval No. R3-108). The sample sizes for the animal studies were guided by a previous publication that studied the effects of maternal HFD consumption on NASH in offspring72. All mice were housed with free access to chow and water on a 12-h light/dark cycle. For timed mating females that were breeding were checked for vaginal plugs every morning and if present the time point was set to day post-coitum (dpc) 0.5. Then the female C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into two groups fed either a control diet (CD; 4.3% kcal fat 19.2% kcal protein and 67.3% kcal carbohydrate D12450J Research Diets Inc. New Brunswick NJ) or a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat 20% kcal protein and 20% kcal carbohydrate; D12492 Research Diets Inc.) during gestation. During lactation all dams were fed the control diet. Because of the lack of significantly different phenotypes of liver pathology between male and female offspring and the usage of MPHs from male mice most of the data are presented from experiments using male offspring. We used littermates born to some dams from each CD and HFD group that gave birth to 6 or more offspring to exclude the effect of the number of offspring on growth. After weaning the male offspring were fed the control diet generating two groups: CD and HFD. At 15 weeks of age male offspring were assessed for body weight and FBS HbA1c NEFA and ALT levels as well as systolic blood pressure (SBP). We performed two series of studies. First we performed histological and biochemical studies including the detection of hypoxia immunohistochemical staining and western blots for HIF-1α and HODMAD1 levels in mouse tissue sections (CD; n = 16 offspring from 4 dams HFD; n = 15 offspring from 4 dams). Second we measured the liver volume diameter of the umbilical vein and tissue density of fetal livers (CD; n = 4 offspring from one dam HFD; n = 6 offspring from two dams) and the tissue density of the livers of offspring at 7 days (CD; n = 7 offspring from 4 dams HFD; n = 9 offspring from 4 dams) 4 weeks (CD; n = 6 offspring from 3 dams HFD; n = 9 offspring from 4 dams) and 15 weeks (CD; n = 17 offspring from 7 dams HFD; n = 11 offspring from 5 dams) of age using synchrotron-based phase-contrast micro-CT imaging at SPring-8. We performed the histological examination and micro-CT imaging using synchrotron radiation of 33-week-old offspring of HFD-fed dams to explore the malignant potential of this mouse model.

Histological analysis

Three-micrometer-thick paraffin-embedded liver tissues and fetuses were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson’s trichrome (blue = collagens; red = erythrocytes and cytoplasm; dark purple/black = nuclei). The stained sections or fetuses were observed and visualized using a light microscope system (BZ-8100; Keyence Osaka Japan. https://www.keyence.com).

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemical staining was performed as previously described5273. Briefly formalin-fixed sections were deparaffinized and then microwaved at 100 °C for 30 min to retrieve antigens. Sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxidase for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Then the specimens were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies rinsed with PBS and subsequently incubated with ENVISION + (Dako Carpinteria CA) for 30 min. The reactions were visualized with 33′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride after 1–3 min revealing brown staining. The cell nuclei were then counterstained with hematoxylin. Immunohistochemistry was performed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (1:400) (NB100-479 Novus Biologicals Centennial CO USA) a rabbit polyclonal anti-HORMAD1 antibody (1:400) (28719-1-AP Proteintech Group Inc. Rosemont IL USA) and an anti-cytokeratin 19 (CK19) antibody (provided by Dr. Atsushi Miyajima Institute for Quantitative Biosciences The University of Tokyo Tokyo Japan). The stained sections were observed and visualized using a light microscope system (BZ-8100; Keyence). Quantification of immunohistochemical images was performed with Fiji Image J (US National Institutes of Health Bethesda MD USA imagej.net/Fiji v.1.52) as described in the previous study52.

Detection of liver hypoxia

After pimonidazole a 2-nitro-imidazole is delivered in vivo it binds to thiol groups of proteins in tissue with oxygen tensions less than 10 mmHg which can be detected using commercially available anti-pimonidazole antibodies74. For the detection of hypoxic conditions in mice pimonidazole (60 mg/kg CAS# 70132-50-2 Cayman Chemical Company Ann Arbor MI USA) was injected intraperitoneally 1 h before the animals were euthanized74. Staining was performed using Hydroxyprobe (Pharmacia International Belmont MA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions75. The stained sections were observed and visualized using a light microscope system (BZ-8100; Keyence).

Microarray

The microarray was performed as described in a previously published study76. Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Hilden Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cyanine-3 (Cy3)-labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.2 µg of RNA using the Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions followed by RNAeasy column purification (Qiagen). Dye incorporation and the cRNA yield were assessed with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. Cy3-labeled cRNA (0.6 µg specific activity > 25.0 pmol Cy3/µg cRNA) was fragmented at 60 °C for 30 min in a reaction volume of 25 µl containing 1 × fragmentation buffer (Agilent) and 2 × blocking agent (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Upon completion of the fragmentation reaction 25 µl of 2 × GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM (Agilent) were added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to a SurePrint G3 Mouse GE microarray 8 × 60 K Ver. 2.0 (G4858A #74809 Agilent Technologies) for 17 h at 65 °C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization microarrays were washed for 1 min at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and for 1 min with 37 °C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent) and then dried immediately. Microarray slides were scanned immediately after washing using the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2539A) with the one color scan setting for 1 × 60 K array slides (scan area 61 × 21.6 mm scan resolution 3 µm dye channel set to green and green PMT set to 100%). The scanned images were analyzed with Feature Extraction Software 11.0.1.1 (Agilent) using the default parameters (protocol AgilentG3_GX_1Color and grid: 074809_D_F_20150624) to obtain background-subtracted and spatially detrended processed signal intensities. Data were normalized and filtered with three filters using GeneSpring software 12.1 (Agilent Technologies. https://www.agilent.com). Briefly the raw data were normalized to their 75th percentile values. In the first filter when the value of a probe was lower than the 20th percentile value in any sample the probe was excluded. In the second filter when the flag of a probe was compromised in any sample the probe was excluded. In the last filter when the value (log scale) of CV was greater than 50% under both conditions the probe was excluded. After filtering control probes were excluded and log scale values were transformed into normal scales. The microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under number GSE183360.

Data are presented using GeneSpring software 12.1 (Agilent Technologies. https://www.agilent.com).

Western blotting

Total cellular extracts from mouse liver tissues and mouse primary hepatocytes were prepared as described previously75. Western blotting was conducted using 4–12% Novex NuPAGE Tris–glycine gels (Invitrogen) for HIF-1α and HORMAD1 (Proteintech Group Inc.) under reducing conditions. After the proteins were transferred onto Hybond-P PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences Co. Piscataway NJ USA) the membranes were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody at a dilution of 1:500 (NB100-479 Novus Biologicals USA) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-HORMAD1 antibody (28719-1-AP Proteintech Group Inc. Rosemont IL USA) at a dilution of 1:1000 at 4 °C overnight followed by an incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:50000) (Amersham) and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham ECL Prime). For loading controls the same membranes were stripped and reprobed with a β-actin antibody at a dilution of 1:5000 (A5316 Sigma–Aldrich St. Louis MO USA). As the levels of β-actin were affected by hypoxia exposure PVDF membranes were stained with a Coomassie brilliant blue solution (CBB 0.1% R250 25% isopropanol 10% acetic acid) solution for 5 min and washed with double-distilled water to confirm equal protein loading77. The protein intensities of the HIF-1α and HORMAD1 bands were processed using ImageJ software for densitometry analysis.

Isolation and culture of MPHs

MPHs were isolated from 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice using previously described methods78. The viable hepatocyte population was further purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation. Freshly isolated primary hepatocytes were plated in collagen-coated 6-well plates (IWAKI Tokyo Japan) at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well and cultured with high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco 11965092 Carlsbad CA USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum insulin-transferrin-selenium supplement (Gibco) 10–7 M dexamethasone (Sigma–Aldrich Inc. St. Louis MO) and antibiotics. Cells were allowed to adhere overnight before switching to fresh medium and were exposed to reagents under normoxic (21% O 2 ) or hypoxic (1% O 2 ) conditions for 24 h before being harvested for experiments as previously described75.

Quantitative RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from mouse livers and primary hepatocytes from each group using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed with a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with RNase Inhibitor (Applied Biosystems Carlsbad CA). Each cDNA sample was analyzed for gene expression using quantitative real-time PCR with a fluorescent TaqMan 57-nuclease assay and a sequence detection system (Prism 7300 Applied Biosystems CA). TaqMan real-time PCR was performed using 2 × TaqMan Master Mix and 20 × assay-on-demand TaqMan primers and probes (Applied Biosystems Thermo Fisher Scientific Foster City CA). The analysis was performed with ABI Prism 7300 SDS software (version 1.4.1 Applied Biosystems https://www.thermofisher.com/jp/ja/home/technical-resources/software-downloads/applied-biosystems-7300-real-time-pcr-system.html). Unlabeled specific primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems to detect the mouse Hif1α gene (assay ID: Mm00468869) mouse Hif2α (assay ID: Mm01236112_m1) mouse Hormad1 gene (assay ID: Mm00471448) and mouse ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P0 (Rplp0) gene (assay ID: Mm 00725448). After an initial incubation for 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C the samples were cycled 55 times at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. For the quantitative analysis the cDNA content of each sample was normalized to the levels of the housekeeping gene Rplp0 using the comparative CT method.

Immunocytochemistry

Primary hepatocytes were cultured on collagen type 1-coated four-chamber glass slides (BD Biocoat Collagen I BD Biosciences Bedford MA USA). After an overnight incubation under normoxic or hypoxic conditions the cells were fixed with 100% ethanol for 10 min and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (1:400) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-HORMAD1 antibody (1:400) at 4 °C overnight. Then the cells were rinsed with PBS and subsequently incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled polymer-conjugated secondary antibody (Envision Dako Carpinteria CA) for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were visualized with 33′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride after 2–3 min revealing brown staining. The stained sections were observed and visualized using a light microscope system (BZ-8100; Keyence).

siRNA transfection

Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific) was mixed with siRNAs (Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus siRNA Horizon Discovery a PerkinElmer company Cambridge GB Supplementary Table 2) in Opti-MEM reduced serum medium (Gibco) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and cells were used in experiments 24 h later.

Liver sample preparation for the synchrotron radiation micro-CT analysis

The contrast medium was prepared using a previously published protocol79. Briefly the contrast medium consisted of 40% wt/vol (in distilled water) BaSO 4 and 8% wt/vol gelatin. The abdomen and thorax were cut by creating a midline incision extending from the pubic symphysis to the jugulum under anesthesia. Three hundred units of heparin were injected into the beating left ventricle of the heart using a 24-gauge catheter. The right atrium was then cut and the mouse was perfused first with 42 °C prewarmed heparinized saline (100 IU/ml heparin in 0.9% NaCl) and then with contrast medium (42 °C). Immediately after perfusion cold saline (< 4 °C) was gently poured into the abdominal cavity. The mouse was carefully placed in an ice bucket for 10 min to solidify the contrast medium. Thereafter the liver which was filled with contrast medium was removed and stored in a freezer. The sample exclusion criteria were determined before the CT scan for technical failures such as misinjection of the contrast medium in the left ventricle or insufficient perfusion.

Imaging of liver samples

Samples were visualized using the synchrotron micro-CT system in BL20B2 at SPring-879 (Supplementary Fig. 5A). The synchrotron radiation beam is produced by deflecting the electron beam with a bending magnet and the flux is much higher than that of laboratory X-ray sources. The X-ray was monochromatized with a Si (111) double crystal monochromator and the beam then irradiated the samples. As the X-ray beam was approximately parallel each horizontal line corresponded to a slice position along the rotation axis and images of multiple slices (the slice pitch was equal to the pixel size namely the “cubic voxel”) were easily obtained in one rotation (3D-CT).

A high-resolution image detector (Beam monitor 5 and ORCA-Flash4.0; Hamamatsu Photonics Hamamatsu Japan) was used for radiographic imaging80. The format of the 3D image was 2048 × 2048 × 1320 pixels with cubic voxels of 15.53 μm3 (3.72 × 10−6 mm3). The scintillator which converts the X-ray beam to visible light was a 25-μm layer of GADOX (Gd 2 O 2 S: Tb± P43). The X-ray energy was 37.6 keV and the exposure time per projection was 100 ms.

For each sample 1800 radiographic images were acquired over an angular range of 0°–180° within 3 min. In this study the liver sample was placed on the rotating stage in an insulated chamber with double Kapton and Styrofoam walls and then scanned while the cryogenic temperatures were maintained using dry ice. After scanning we reconstructed the CT images from the radiographic images using a conventional tomography algorithm and convolution back projection.

X-ray phase tomography using a grating interferometer

X-ray phase tomographic measurements were performed at bending magnet beamline BL20B2 in SPring-8 Hyogo Japan. An X-ray grating interferometer composed of a phase grating G1 and an absorption grating G2 was used to retrieve phase information (Supplementary Fig. 5B). The principle of the grating interferometer is described elsewhere81. The X-ray grating interferometer was set between a sample and an X-ray imaging detector as shown in Supplementary Fig. 5B. G1 was composed of nickel with a pattern thickness of 3.53 μm which was designed to generate a π/2 phase shift at an X-ray energy of 20 keV. G2 was composed of gold and its pattern thickness was greater than 20 μm. The grating pitch in both gratings was 2.4 μm. The distance between G1 and G2 was defined by the fractional Talbot distance. The 5th-order fractional Talbot distance (p = 5/2) was chosen as an interferometric condition. The fractional Talbot distance depended on the Talbot order p the grating pitch and the X-ray energy. In this experimental setup the fractional Talbot distance was calculated to be 232 mm. In preparation for the tomographic measurement a sample was placed in a designated cylindrical container made of polypropylene with inner and outer diameters of 12 mm and 13 mm respectively. When placing the sample in the container an agarose gel with a concentration of 2% was used to fix the sample in the container. The sample in the container was measured within a specially designed water cell filled with pure water to avoid strong artifacts due to the drastic phase shift at the outer wall of the container. A visible light conversion-type X-ray imaging detector was used to detect projection images. It was composed of an AA60 beam monitor with a P43 scintillator (Hamamatsu Photonics) and a C13949-50U high-definition CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics). In this case the effective pixel size and the effective field of view were 3.47 μm and 14.2 mm in width respectively. In the X-ray phase tomographic measurement the number of projections was set to 1200 during a sample rotation of 180°. At each projection a 5-step fringe scan method was used to calculate a differential phase image. Then the differential phase image was integrated along the horizontal direction to generate a phase image. A phase tomogram was reconstructed from 1200 phase images using the conventional filtered back projection method.

Estimation of the mass (tissue) density

The mass density ρ (g/cm3) is proportional to the phase factor δ in the X-ray refractive index as shown in the following equation:

$$\delta =\frac{{\lambda }^{2}{r}_{e}{N}_{A}}{2\pi }\frac{Z}{M}\rho $$ (1)

where λ is the X-ray wavelength r e is the classical electron radius N A is Avogadro’s constant and Z/M is the ratio of the number of electrons to the molecular weight of the sample. In most soft tissues Z/M is assumed to be 0.55 (NIST: X-ray mass attenuation coefficients—Table 2. https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/XrayMassCoef/tab2.html). The difference in the X-ray refractive index Δδ between the sample and water can be obtained from X-ray phase tomography82. Therefore the difference in the density Δρ between the sample and water can also be estimated using Eq. (1). Finally the mass density ρ of the sample is estimated from Δρ + ρ water (= 1.0 g/cm3).

3D modeling of the liver and intrahepatic vessels and quantitative data processing

The computed tomography data from each mouse fetus were uploaded to advanced 3D image processing and quantification software (Amira version 5.4.3 Thermo Fisher Scientific MA. https://www.thermofisher.com) and extraction was performed using color contrast. The sample sizes were guided by a previous publication using synchrotron X-ray83. Liver and hepatic vessels were extracted from all mouse fetuses. The volume of the extracted liver was derived by forming multiple tetrahedrons with the center point as the apex in Amira. Intrahepatic blood vessels were extracted from the umbilical vein just before they entered the liver and branched. The blood flow rate was determined by deriving the vessel diameter which is proportional to the multiplier of the vessel diameter according to Murray’s law4784. For this purpose we used an open-source toolkit (Vascular Modelling Toolkit version 1.4.0 VMTK www.vmtk.org) to derive the vessel diameter semiautomatically. The liver vessel tree geometries were clipped at the side branches such that the main vessel remained to reduce the computational cost (Supplementary Fig. 5C). The images were created using 3D image software (Amira).

Statistics

The sample sizes for the animal studies were guided by a previous publication85. Values obtained from MPHs are presented as the means ± standard deviations (SD) and they are representative of at least three independent experiments. All measured variables from the synchrotron radiation micro-CT imaging were log(e) transformed for all statistical analyses. The significance of the differences between groups was determined using unpaired Student’s t tests and one-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc tests for multiple comparisons as needed. Welch’s corrections were used when the variances between groups were unequal. Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical data. Nonparametric analyses of histological scores were conducted using a Kruskal–Wallis test with the unpaired nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test as a post hoc analysis. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed to analyze the association between two variables using GraphPad Prism ver. 6.0 software (GraphPad San Diego CA. https://www.graphpad.com). The other statistical analyses described above were performed using SPSS ver. 24 (SPSS Chicago IL. https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics).",,,,,,

Your little goblin may be getting bags of pennies from your neighbors when they trick or treat this Oct. 31.

Hershey the big candy maker issued a warning this week that said a possible candy shortage may affect your Halloween pickings. The big concern is the shortage of raw ingredients which will cause a major candy capacity problem.

The shortage is a result of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine where restrictions have been made on Russian gas and oil imports which are specifically hurting the German import of supplies that aren’t going to make it to Pennsylvania and the world’s fifth largest candy maker.

According to an article in the Washington Post candy has seen an 11% gain in share in 2021 with an amazing $37 billion dollars in confectionary sales revenue.

The increase in candy sales across the board coupled with the lack of supplies coming from Europe have put a big stress on shelves now selling candy. Candy makers are at “all hands on deck” mode to keep the shelves stocked three full months before Halloween.

The Halloween scare at Hersey’s and Mars is very real. Not only is there a problem in Europe but here in the states there is a milk shortage that will add to the problems that candy makers are trying to ward off. The milk shortage is a result of one of the Borden Dairies' production facilities permanently closing its doors in Chicago. Borden Dairies has one of the country’s largest milk production plants. This closing in Chicago will affect mostly Illinois and Wisconsin retailers but those retailers are spreading out to get dairy deliveries outside their states to keep up the demand which will put more of a strain on the national market.

All in all we have three months to see how this shakes out. Hopefully it will be a Happy Halloween with lots of candy for your little trick-or-treaters and you too!

Edgar Delgado 31 of Passaic was arrested Friday for the crash in Clifton that prosecutors said happened earlier that day. The Passaic cop faces multiple charges including assault by auto causing serious bodily injury.

Passaic County Prosecutor Camelia Valdes said that Delgado was driving near the intersection of Central and Yereance Avenues early Friday morning. Shortly before 4:30 a.m. he crashed into a parked car according to Valdes.

Valdes said that when Clifton police got to the scene they found Delgado's car but not him.

Instead cops found a 28-year-old woman from Clifton in the passenger seat. She was taken to Saint Joseph’s University Medical Center.

""The investigation revealed that Mr. Delgado had been operating his vehicle recklessly under the influence of alcohol and left the scene following the crash"" Valdes said.

Along with the second-degree assault by auto charge Delgado faces three third-degree charges including leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident resulting in serious bodily injury endangering an injured victim and hindering apprehension. He is also charged with driving while intoxicated.

Your little goblin may be getting bags of pennies from your neighbors when they trick or treat this Oct. 31.

Hershey the big candy maker issued a warning this week that said a possible candy shortage may affect your Halloween pickings. The big concern is the shortage of raw ingredients which will cause a major candy capacity problem.

The shortage is a result of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine where restrictions have been made on Russian gas and oil imports which are specifically hurting the German import of supplies that aren’t going to make it to Pennsylvania and the world’s fifth largest candy maker.

According to an article in the Washington Post candy has seen an 11% gain in share in 2021 with an amazing $37 billion dollars in confectionary sales revenue.

The increase in candy sales across the board coupled with the lack of supplies coming from Europe have put a big stress on shelves now selling candy. Candy makers are at “all hands on deck” mode to keep the shelves stocked three full months before Halloween.

The Halloween scare at Hersey’s and Mars is very real. Not only is there a problem in Europe but here in the states there is a milk shortage that will add to the problems that candy makers are trying to ward off. The milk shortage is a result of one of the Borden Dairies' production facilities permanently closing its doors in Chicago. Borden Dairies has one of the country’s largest milk production plants. This closing in Chicago will affect mostly Illinois and Wisconsin retailers but those retailers are spreading out to get dairy deliveries outside their states to keep up the demand which will put more of a strain on the national market.

All in all we have three months to see how this shakes out. Hopefully it will be a Happy Halloween with lots of candy for your little trick-or-treaters and you too!

Edgar Delgado 31 of Passaic was arrested Friday for the crash in Clifton that prosecutors said happened earlier that day. The Passaic cop faces multiple charges including assault by auto causing serious bodily injury.

Passaic County Prosecutor Camelia Valdes said that Delgado was driving near the intersection of Central and Yereance Avenues early Friday morning. Shortly before 4:30 a.m. he crashed into a parked car according to Valdes.

Valdes said that when Clifton police got to the scene they found Delgado's car but not him.

Instead cops found a 28-year-old woman from Clifton in the passenger seat. She was taken to Saint Joseph’s University Medical Center.

""The investigation revealed that Mr. Delgado had been operating his vehicle recklessly under the influence of alcohol and left the scene following the crash"" Valdes said.

Along with the second-degree assault by auto charge Delgado faces three third-degree charges including leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident resulting in serious bodily injury endangering an injured victim and hindering apprehension. He is also charged with driving while intoxicated.

The Spaceship Neptune capsule design which Space Perspective unveiled this week will be carbon neutral and include a ""proprietary splash cone"" for a gentle water landing according to the company. The spherical shape optimal for pressure resistance will translate to more headroom. The capsule also includes reflective coated windows to limit solar gain which according to a release sent to Travel + Leisure are similar to an astronaut's helmet.

The capsule is patent-pending and currently in production near Space Perspective's Operations Center at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

""Our proprietary flight system means that the capsule and SpaceBalloon always remain connected and take-off and landing conditions are always within our control"" Taber MacCallum the founder co-CEO and chief technology officer of Space Perspective said in a statement. ""The team has come together to create an amazingly robust safe and incredibly elegant and luxurious system for Spaceship Neptune. Simplicity and automation are the keys to safety.""

Travelers who venture to space in these capsules will experience a six-hour round-trip journey including a two-hour descent to Earth.

The company which calls itself ""the world's first luxury spaceflight experience company"" will sell tickets to space for $125000 per passenger. Travelers will sit in plush reclining seats and sail 20 miles above the Earth. The capsule will even have Wi-Fi so passengers can capture every detail about the experience and beam it back to Earth.

He has been praised as a peacemaker visionary and a titan of the peace process.

There is truth in the accolades but a full assessment requires a more balanced analysis than we have had so far. Trimble’s political life can be divided into two distinct phases. In his first phase Trimble was typical of a Unionism that was reactionary sectarian and confrontational. He viewed political equality for Catholics as a mortal threat to the status quo. Any Unionist who dared suggest sharing power with Catholics in the 1970s and 1980s was labelled a traitor by the young Trimble. In his second later phase Trimble became a pragmatist. He recognised that it was no longer possible to defend the failing status quo of one-party Unionist rule and accepted the necessity of power-sharing with nationalists. The result was the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. By pushing Unionism out of that negative sectarian loop Trimble opened up a space for political progress. And for that history will surely judge him kindly.

The Good Friday Agreement was a compromise and as such it is far from perfect. But there is little doubt that it put an end to violence and drew a line under the Troubles. During and after the peace process Trimble showed bravery leadership and tenacity. He faced down Unionist opponents such as Ian Paisley Jeffrey Donaldson and Arlene Foster. The latter two subsequently left the Ulster Unionist Party in opposition to the agreement. They may later have accepted it but at the time they lacked Trimble’s foresight and generosity. Nevertheless Trimble’s early political life was not pretty. He was a member of the Vanguard a hardline group which split from the crumbling Ulster Unionist Party in 1972. The Vanguard which held quasi-fascist rallies was closely affiliated with several loyalist paramilitary groups responsible for murdering scores of Catholics. Trimble tried to give the Vanguard an intellectual gloss without much success. Though the Vanguard itself sunk into oblivion in 1976 Trimble’s politics remained hardline anti-Catholic. He persisted with the rhetoric of ‘Not an Inch’ and ‘No Surrender’ and refused to countenance any form of power-sharing.

After becoming an Ulster Unionist Party MP for Upper Bann in 1990 Trimble burnished his hardline image during the Drumcree conflict in Portadown. Orangemen wanted to march down the Catholic Garvaghy Road in the town but local residents opposed it. This led to the Drumcree stand-off of 1995. Following a wave of loyalist violence and threats to kill Catholics if the march was stopped the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British soldiers locked down the area and forced the march through. The RUC crushed any local opposition with truncheons and rubber bullets. TV cameras caught David Trimble triumphantly grabbing the hand of Ian Paisley and doing a victory jig at the end of the march. This went down well with loyalists and Orangemen and it no doubt helped Trimble become leader of the UUP in September 1995. But it also cemented his pariah status among nationalists who largely viewed him as a sectarian bigot.

Yet by 1998 a new David Trimble emerged during the peace process. It was a remarkable transformation. This one-time hardliner had become a moderate and pro-power-sharing first minister of Northern Ireland. Trimble’s metamorphosis was driven by his central concern – securing the Union. It forced him to recognise the need for a conciliatory approach towards nationalists and ultimately power-sharing.

During the late 1990s he was under constant attack from hawks in his own party for ‘surrendering loyalist principles’. And yet he persevered and defended the Good Friday Agreement. Many Unionists around him did not. Some jumped ship. And others were actively hostile to power-sharing. Trimble’s political fortitude earned him the quiet respect of many nationalists and middle-ground Unionists. Trimble possessed a huge amount of political foresight. He realised that ‘No Surrender’-style Unionism was a dead end and that in the not-too-distant future Unionism would cease to be a majority position as nationalists grew in number and confidence. He knew he had to act decisively and he did. The days of Unionist hegemony were gone forever and he told his people they needed to change and evolve to survive.

There is a piece of grainy TV footage doing the rounds on Twitter this week. It is of Trimble in 1998 arriving in the village of Tyrone to address a hall full of solemn Unionists. He is there to explain why they should support the Good Friday Agreement in the referendum. Before he can get into the hall he has to run the gauntlet of a hostile Unionist crowd outside. Several men tell him they will never vote yes to the Good Friday Agreement or talk to Sinn Féin. Trimble rises to his feet to address these men. Looking them straight in the eye he tells them the game is up that the days of one-party Unionist rule are gone forever and are not coming back. ‘Anyone who thinks in 1998 Unionist people can impose their will on the people of Northern Ireland and the British government and world opinion is deluded’ he tells them. ‘We’re not going to get majority rule. We have to take nationalists with us.’ Trimble knew then what many Unionists have since come to accept. That Unionism needed to change and adapt to new realities if Northern Ireland had any chance of peace and progress. He had the courage to tell his people what they did not want to hear at a time when few other Unionist leaders did. In 1998 this was a revolutionary act of courage for which we should all be thankful.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY290c21hbi5jb20vbmV3cy9vcGluaW9uL2RhdmlkLW1vbnRnb21lcnktaS1ob3BlLWRhdmlkLXRyaW1ibGUtdG9vay1xdWlldC1wcmlkZS1pbi10aGUtd2F5LW5vcnRoZXJuLWlyZWxhbmQtaGFzLWRldmVsb3BlZC0zNzg4MTk00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Montgomery: I hope David Trimble took quiet pride in the way Northern Ireland has developed,"As school boys he was older so he never noticed me but I can still see that distinctive red-headed and invariably solitary figure striding up the hill to Bangor Grammar.

The shared background allowed me to reconnect years later and the occasion was the party traditionally thrown by the Daily Mirror at the Labour Conference not that David would have had much taste for either of those institutions.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair (right) and Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble on the platform during the Labour Party Conference at Blackpool in 1998. Picture: Press Association

Like many other obstacles he overcame his natural instincts and became the first Unionist Party leader to attend a Labour conference. To avoid embarrassment on either side an introduction between Trimble and Tony Blair was orchestrated when they accidentally on purpose encountered each other at the Mirror party.

There was suspicion if not downright hostility between Labour and Unionists the former with an entrenched view of Ulster Prods.

David with his soft voice and soaring intellect did enough that evening to counter Labour’s treasured image of one dimensional rabble rousing politics of unionism.

Within a year Labour was in power and in two years Trimble leadership and collaboration with Blair brought the Good Friday agreement.

David Montgomery

That night in Blackpool in October 1996 said much about David. As the Mirror party broke up all the hugely impressed Labour stars - John Prescott David Blunkett Alasdair Darling Margaret Beckett - jostled for the privilege of taking David on to dinner. He would have none of it. Unlike many politicians he had no desire to be feted.

In the opulent dining room of the Imperial Hotel the various groups of soon to be Cabinet ministers were seated along with editors press barons and the increasing number of business backers of Labour.

At a certain point I was urged to seek out David and renew the dinner invitation. I found him at a single table behind a pillar which he had used to prop up the historical biography he was consuming along with his solitary meal. Needless to say he preferred his own company and declined.

The title of his own biography Himself Alone summed up David Trimble.

It was alone that he came to his momentous decision to sign up to the Good Friday deal that hung in the balance up to the final hour.

On Maundy Thursday 1998 I received a call from a somewhat panicking Downing Street official asking me to speak to David who was not budging on some final point.

I tried David’s mobile and it was John Taylor now Lord Kilcooney who answered. John’s exact words are lost to my memory but the message was clear - only David could decide and nothing more said could influence him either way.

In subsequent years speaking with David he never adopted any grandeur about that decision or his achievement. I hope that he took quiet pride in the way Northern Ireland has developed over the last quarter century. Like many of us who live elsewhere and visit from time to time it is a stunning transformation. Not all may be perfect but increasingly all cultures are sharing the unique heritage good and bad and look forward confidently and it is the Good Friday Agreement that seeded this.

David was not only the bravest of men politically. He was also physically courageous. As First Minister attracting threats from both sides he would go without protection officers when in London preferring to walk or go by Tube maintaining his freedom as an ordinary citizen.

Perhaps that demonstrates the values that guided his life: freedom of expression the right to enjoy a private existence sometimes taken as Northern protestant reticence but actually manifesting a deep respect for his fellows; and finally the quiet contribution of public service that David continued in the House of Lords.

Many of the protagonists in the peace talks of the 1990s are no longer with us.

There were many fallings out in the process none more apparent at the time as between David and Mo Mowlam the Labour Secretary of State for Northern Ireland who resigned in part because the relationship with David and mainstream unionism broke down in bitterness.

Who is to say which of them was most to blame for that. However it is a measure of David’s nobility that long after they had both left office the two of them met at my home in London and they made it up.

A measure of David’s humanity is his relationship with Blair a deep friendship sharing personal as well as political problems.

David Trimble was Protestant and Unionist to the core. But he changed the perception of that culture. He did not bear grudges and he did not seek personal aggrandisement nor did he tolerate flattery instead radiating humility and equality.

His formidable intellect challenged the past cherishing its heritage but rejecting what stood in the way of progress.

It was intended to end the 35 years of terrorist violence that had cost thousands of lives in Northern Ireland and beyond and to deal with the sectarian community divisions that had allowed terrorism to fester.

The front cover to The Idea of the Union: Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Dr William Beattie Smith edited the book with John Wilson Foster.

For the Ulster Unionist Party of which I was then the leader there were unpalatable compromises to swallow.

Terrorists were released from prison under a very generous release scheme. Those who had taken part in terrorist activities were encouraged to participate in democracy and indeed some leaders of such terrorist groups became members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and even ministers in the Executive.

Political structures were set up for North/South cooperation — a development of which many unionists were suspicious believing with some merit that they could be used to lever Northern Ireland away from the United Kingdom.

Such structures had led to the collapse of the Sunningdale agreement in 1973 between the British and Irish governments. But this time we got the wholly transparent bottom-up structures including all the major Northern Ireland parties right.

Massive changes were embedded into the police which had borne the brunt of the terrorist campaign - changes which have proved difficult to absorb. Despite all these compromises the majority of people in Northern Ireland endorsed the agreement.

They did so on the basis that Northern Ireland’s constitutional position within the UK could not be changed - a commitment I had secured at great political and personal cost from the British government the Irish government nationalist leader John Hume and the leadership of Sinn Féin.

All the parties agreed that any such change would require the consent of the people of NI in a referendum. The declaration at the very top of the agreement stated clearly that it would “be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save with the consent of the majority of its people”.

Despite strong opposition within my own community who resented the concessions to those engaged in indiscriminate killing I campaigned for a Yes vote in the referendum on the agreement arguing that it made the Union safe and that the future of Northern Ireland was totally in the hands of its people through the ballot box.

They put their trust in my assurances and gave me and the agreement their backing.

That is why I feel betrayed personally by the Northern Ireland Protocol and it is also why the unionist population is so incensed at its imposition.

The protocol rips the very heart out of the agreement which I and they believed safeguarded Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom and ensured that democracy not violence threat of violence or outside interference would or could ever change that.

Make no mistake about it the protocol does not safeguard the Good Friday Agreement. It demolishes its central premise by removing the assurance that democratic consent is needed to make any change to the status of Northern Ireland. It embodies a number of constitutional changes that relate to Northern Ireland.

Firstly every EU law regulation and directive made in respect of agriculture manufacturing environment work practices and other matters will continue to apply to NI even though the rest of the UK is now free of them. The list of EU laws with which NI will have to comply runs to 70 pages and contains hundreds of thousands of regulations.

Secondly any future laws made by the EU in respect of these areas (covering nearly 70% of our economic activity) will also apply to NI. No Northern Ireland input into these laws will be allowed so even if the content of EU laws is damaging to us we will not be able to make representations or to have them changed.

Thirdly regardless of how damaging future EU enforced laws might be they will have to be obeyed - otherwise the European Court of Justice will be able to enforce sanctions on the United Kingdom.

In other words a court based in a foreign jurisdiction will supersede courts in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.

Fourthly as the UK decides how it wishes to exercise its new freedom from the EU in order to make its economy more competitive in global trade any new laws it makes to achieve that competitiveness will not apply to Northern Ireland because of the requirement to abide by EU law.

This massive change in the constitutional position of NI is already manifesting itself in economic disruption through physical checks on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland extensive bureaucratic requirements a serious escalation in the cost of doing business between GB and NI and time delays in receiving goods to the point where many GB firms have simply stopped supplying goods to NI.

This political betrayal and these economic costs have already raised tensions in Northern Ireland. So far from keeping the peace the protocol risks a return to violence despite claims from its supporters that it is all about protecting the Agreement.

To those who make such claims I respectfully say Read the agreement and then tell me what part of the agreement is protected by the protocol’.

The sad fact is that the threat to peace and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland as a result of the protocol is totally unnecessary. The EU has nothing to fear from the minuscule level of trade that crosses into its territory from NI and even that trade could be regulated without any need for checks on the border between NI and the Republic.

Through the Centre for Brexit Policy I have already put forward an arrangement that would require the UK and the EU to put in place a system for the mutual enforcement of each other’s regulations that would apply to the small number of firms currently involved in cross-border trade.

This would mean that firms selling into the Republic from Northern Ireland or vice versa would have to declare on their export documentation that they had adhered to the regulations in the other jurisdiction. If spot checks when the goods arrive or subsequent inspections at the point of sale discovered that the declaration was false the business would be pursued by the authorities in the country in which it was based and stiff mandatory penalties would deter any incentive to act unlawfully.

There are these and other mechanisms for dealing with cross-border trade.

The question is does the political will exist to introduce them or is the European Union intent on playing fast and loose with peace in Northern Ireland damaging its economy and undermining the very basis of democratic decision-making in order to punish the United Kingdom for voting for its independence from the European Union?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWxmYXN0dGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvLnVrL3N1bmRheS1saWZlL25ld3MvZGF2aWQtdHJpbWJsZS13YW50ZWQtYmV0dGVyLWZ1dHVyZS1mb3ItaGlzLWNoaWxkcmVuLXNheXMtY2xvc2VzdC1haWRlLzQxODc5Mzg4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Trimble wanted better future for his children says closest aide,"David Trimble wanted better future for his children says closest aide

The Presbyterian cleric who ministered to David Trimble through the most pressured years of his political career has described him as “a serious Christian” who never failed to attend church on Sunday – no matter where he was in the world.

Rev David Knox was minister of Harmony Hill Presbyterian Church in Lisburn from 1992-2017 which the Trimble family still attends and which is the venue for Lord Trimble’s funeral on Monday at 12.30pm.

Asked about the peer’s faith Rev Knox told the News Letter: “He was very dedicated he never missed a Sunday. He might have been all over the world but he would still try and make it on Sunday.

“He would bring me orders of service from all over the world. And he would send me things that he thought I would be interested in. So he was a serious Christian man.”

Rev David Knox Minister.

As he travelled so much he was not involved in midweek life of the church Rev Knox said however his wife Daphne “was very involved and still is”. All four of their children – Richard Victoria Nicholas and Sarah – became communicant members of the church completing formal classes on the meaning of taking communion.

Asked if Lord Trimble’s faith went further than his exceptional intellect Rev Knox said: “I think very much he was a serious Christian. He believed in reconciliation I mean there was a growth in his politics and his understanding and so on so he grew.”

When in London on Sundays he attended the Crown Court Church of Scotland and when in Washington DC he attended the National Presbyterian Church he said.

Rev Knox recalled how David was an enthusiastic participant in annual joint services with the neighbouring St Coleman’s Catholic Church in Lisburn.

“He would have been supportive of all that. He was regarded slightly askance by the more conservative people [within the wider church] of which there were quite a few. But his faith was a reconciling faith most definitely.”

Rev Knox noted that David was also a member of the Orange Order but suggested that he had not taken an active role for some 20-30 years.

When David and John Hume were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for securing the Good Friday Agreement Rev Knox decided they had to mark the occasion. “David came in about 10 minutes early as he usually did on Sunday and everybody clapped for him. He was clearly embarrassed but you had to do something.”

He noted that David had a very egalitarian approach to church and actively mixed with people from all walks of life every week in church. The cleric saw him at Harmony Hill as recently as six weeks ago. “He was still a very regular attender.”

He also noted that while David had voted against LGBT legislation as an MP he then amended his views and publicly supported his daughter Vicky when she entered a same-sex marriage in 2017. “If you love your family that is what you do I think. I respect his decision.”

Just before Covid he recalled a special worship service at Harmony Hill attended by Catholics and Protestants. “And David chose a modern version of Psalm 1 ‘Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly’."

He broke a franchise record Sunday for most extra-base hits in any month a mark that stood for 61 years and belonged to the all-time MLB extra-base hits leader and one of the greatest players who ever lived Hank Aaron.

Riley not only broke it but also did so with a walk-off double on the first pitch he saw from Arizona reliever Mark Melancon. It was a well-located fastball down and in that Riley somehow lined to right-center scoring Matt Olson from first base for a 1-0 win and series sweep at Truist Park where fans chanted “MVP! MVP!” when Riley strode to the plate.

“It’s just ridiculous” Braves shortstop Dansby Swanson said of what Riley is doing. “It’s just flat-out ridiculous. He’s just so good man. Just unbelievable. And just continues to get better.

“I don’t think people realize it’s not like he’s just getting hot. He’s just that good.”

.@austinriley1308's game-winning hit sets a new record for most extra-base hits in a month in #Braves history (26) passing Hank Aaron (25). pic.twitter.com/hj05oGy1ta — Atlanta Braves (@Braves) July 31 2022

After hitting two doubles and his 29th homer in Friday’s series opener to get within one of Aaron’s July 1961 record of 25 extra-base hits in 32 games Riley had two doubles Sunday in the final game of the month.

Riley was asked what it felt like to walk to the plate while hearing “MVP” chants with the game on the line. His answer provided some idea of how he has moved into a realm of elite athletes who separate themselves from most peers not just through physical prowess but also with an unusual capacity to concentrate.

“In those situations it kind of goes quiet a little bit when you’re in the box” Riley said. “I don’t know if it’s just a focus-type thing but you don’t really hear. It’s almost like it’s just a blur of noise. In those moments you try to go to a place where you can focus on the pitcher.”

Melancon threw a good pitch and Riley destroyed it. He broke Aaron’s record with one more extra-base hit than Aaron in six fewer games played (26) becoming just the sixth major leaguer since 1951 to have at least 26 extra-base hits in a month and the first since 2000.

“That’s a pretty stellar man you just passed there” said Braves manager Brian Snitker a friend of Aaron’s who got his start as a minor-league manager when Aaron the Braves’ farm director at the time hired him after Snitker’s minor-league playing days ended.

“That’s pretty special” Riley said of breaking an Aaron record. “The type of player that he is on and off the field — I think I’ll hold on to that (feeling) for a long time.”

Riley had 11 home runs and 15 doubles in July and led the majors in batting average (.423) slugging percentage (.885) and OPS (1.344) for the month.

“I don’t even think ‘hot’ is giving enough credit to what he’s been able to do” said Max Fried who pitched seven innings of four-hit ball Sunday in a pitchers’ duel with Arizona’s Merrill Kelly who also went seven and allowed three hits. “I mean you see guys go through stretches where they’re seeing the ball well and hitting the ball hard for a series a week. But for (Riley) to do it for a whole month that’s extremely special.

“To be able to see the work that he puts in every single day and the preparation it doesn’t completely surprise me. But to be able to go out there and actually do it it’s special.”

Braves catcher Travis d’Arnaud was asked what Riley’s mindset must be like during such a torrid stretch.

“I wish I knew” d’Arnaud said smiling. “I would definitely love to be there as well and I’m sure everybody else would. He just feels really good and he’s just being himself not trying to do too much and good things are happening.”

Riley’s .423 average in July is the highest for any player in a double-digit homer month since Randy Winn hit .447 with 11 homers in September 2005 and it’s only the second .400-average 10-homer month by a Brave in modern franchise history. The other was by Chipper Jones who hit .412 with 11 homers in July 1999 a month that got the momentum rolling toward his winning that season’s NL MVP Award.

Now Riley is being mentioned with increasing frequency in MVP discussions and he’ll have a strong case if he maintains anything close to his current pace. He leads the majors with 61 extra-base hits ranks second in the NL with 29 home runs and is batting .301 with a league-leading .604 slugging percentage. His .964 OPS ranks second in the NL to Paul Goldschmidt’s 1.012.

“I mean he’s got to be in the (MVP) conversation” Fried said. “What he’s been able to do what he’s meant to this team. We’ve had a lot of guys play really well for this team but for him to be able to put it together and have the month that he’s having he’s for sure in the conversation I would say.”

Riley is the seventh major leaguer since 1901 to hit at least .420 and have 26 or more extra-base hits in a calendar month and he’s only the second to do it in the past 85 years. Houston’s Richard Hidalgo did it in September 2000 and the previous to do it was Joe DiMaggio in 1937. One of the others was Babe Ruth in 1924.

For Snitker the accolades and achievements couldn’t be happening for a more deserving player than Riley a 25-year-old Mississippian who debuted in May 2019 and is playing just his second season of more than 80 games.

“He’s been incredible” Snitker said. “I mean there’s no doubt about that. It’s been fun to watch and really neat to see a kid that handles all that and takes it a day at a time and how he plays the game the consistency with which he does everything. It’s just unbelievable how professional he is and how he carries himself how he respects the game.

“He does everything right. He checks all the boxes to be that guy. He’s one of them guys you want on buses and vans and all that kind of stuff going around representing your organization.”

To the Braves what Riley is doing feels like next-level stuff.

“It’s rare” d’Arnaud said. “I mean he just beat Hank Aaron for the most extra-base hits in Braves history. For an organization to be here for so long and for him to have a record like that is pretty incredible. Especially the name and the person that he beat Hank Aaron.

“And seeing it from my point of view I’ve been on deck sometimes I’ve been in the dugout sometimes and everything he’s hitting is hard. He’s not expanding (the strike zone). It’s incredible.”

Snitker said “It’s kind of surreal a little bit. He’s either hitting balls through the wall or over the wall. I mean the at-bats are just incredible.”

Snitker said last week that he couldn’t recall a major-league hitter improving as much as Riley in so short a time. In Riley’s first 146 major-league games from May 15 2019 through April 17 2021 he hit .227 with 46 extra-base hits (26 homers) 77 RBIs 170 strikeouts and a .712 OPS in 506 at-bats.

In 246 regular-season games since April 18 2021 Riley has hit .308 with 128 extra-base hits (62 homers) 174 RBIs 263 strikeouts and a .946 OPS in 942 at-bats.

“He’s always been hitter-ish” Swanson said using a term baseball people apply to particularly talented or instinctive hitters. “And then he’s just pieced it together with learning the league and learning himself even more. I think so many times when people come up we just assume that players are what they are. And he’s only 25. He’s going to continue to get better in different ways.”

For Riley the record was all the more special because of its timing and importance. The win moved the Braves to a season-high 21 games over .500 (62-41) and kept them within three games of the NL East-leading New York Mets as they enter a week featuring a two-game series against the third-place Phillies on Tuesday and Wednesday followed by a four-day five-game series against the Mets at Citi Field that begins Thursday.

The win Sunday also snapped a three-game losing streak in day games for the Braves and was just their second win in their past 10 series finales and the second win in their past seven chances to complete a sweep.

“It’s pretty sweet” Riley said. “Anything to do to help the team win and in that fashion is awesome. It’s hot out there so I was ready to get in the AC.”

AI researchers and technology executives like Elon Musk are openly concerned about human extinction caused by machines.

2 The next stage of artificial intelligence could be the last humans develop

2 The tiers of artificial intelligence

Smart computers make smarter computers

The Law of Accelerating Returns is a concept popularized by futurist Ray Kurzweil that states the rate of technological improvement is on a very steep curve.

As technology gets more advanced society and industry are better equipped to improve technology faster and more drastically.

""With more powerful computers and related technology we have the tools and the knowledge to design yet more powerful computers and to do so more quickly"" Kurzweil wrote in his famous 2001 essay.

This is visible when checked against the past: the first United States patent was issued in 1836 and the millionth patent was issued 75 years later in 1911.

The US had two million patents by 1936 - it took just 25 years to match the production ingenuity and creativity of the previous 75.

At today's pace one million patents are issued every three years and it's only getting faster.

Apply this improvement principle to the artificial intelligence revolution and you can see why scientists think AI could become very capable and possibly threatening in our lifetimes.

Present and future threats

According to Dr. Lewis Liu CEO of an AI-driven company called Eigen Technologies some artificial has already ""gone dark"".

""Even the 'dumb non-conscious' models we have today may have ethical issues around inclusion"" Dr Liu told The US Sun. ""That kind of stuff is already happening today.""

Research from Johns Hopkins University shows that artificial intelligence algorithms tend to show biases that could unfairly target people of color and women while executing their operations.

The American Civil Liberties Union also warns that AI could ""deepen racial inequality"" as more selective processes like hiring and housing become automated.

""General AI or AI Superintelligence is just going to be a much broader larger propagation of these problems"" Dr Liu said.

The all-out Terminator-style war of man versus machine is not said to be an impossibility either.

A poll in futurist Nick Bostrom's book Superintelligence says that almost 10% of experts believe a computer with human-level intelligence would be a life-threatening crisis for humanity.

One of the misconceptions about AI is that it's restricted to its black box that can just be unplugged if it intends to hurt us.

""It's much more likely that AGI is going to emerge in the Web itself and not from some human constructed box just because of the requirement of complexity"" Dr Liu said. ""And if that is the case then you can't unplug the Web.""

Relatedly several military programs are intertwined with AI and ""killer robots"" that are capable of taking a life without human input have been developed.

Some experts believe the threat landscape should be taking sentient AI into account because we can't know for sure when it will come online or how it will react to humans.

Preventing Judgement Day

Dr Liu sadly conceded ""it's going to be a pretty s***y world"" if we achieve artificial superintelligence with today's lax style of technology regulation.

He advises the development of oversight where the data that powers AI models is scoured for bias.

If the data training a model is sourced from the public then programmers should have to gain users' consent to apply it.

Regulation in the US is short of emphasizing ""a human check on the outputs"" but recent developments in China have begun to highlight keeping artificial intelligence under human control.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Inflation and crime have gotten so bad in Gotham that even cheap meat like Spam has to be locked up.

At Duane Reade’s store in the Port Authority bus depot the shelf-stable product — only $3.99 a can — is now being stocked in plastic anti-theft cases.

“I’ve never seen that before!” one cashier laughed while using a magnet to remove a can of Spam from its cage.

The cashier was among the employees tourists and store regulars stunned that the iconic blue-and-yellow cans are now being kept under lock-and-key — some even poking fun at the sight as “a sort of Jeff Koons homage” per one viral tweet.

Jenny Kenny 43 who was visiting from Louisville KY was aware of the ongoing crime waves hitting cities like New York and San Francisco but still couldn’t believe the sight of “so many things in boxes.”

“Some of these things are pretty ridiculous” she said.

As prices and crime skyrocket New York City stores have taken to locking up staples like toothpaste and soap to prevent crooks from stealing and then hawking the products on the sidewalk or online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay.

Yet some shoppers were confused why Spam along with $1.89 cans of StarKist tuna was enclosed under plastic while pricier foodstuffs like $5.49 cans of Amy’s soup sat unencumbered.

“To put Spam in a cage is stupid — and kind of insulting to the customers that would buy it” said shopper Dennis Snow 46.

Snow said he doesn’t think Spam is being stolen to “sell it for crack” but rather because the homeless in the area are looking for a quick and easy meal.

“Someone is stealing this because they need it” agreed Delia Kemph a 28-year-old teacher.

Employees at the store said thefts have been surging over the past two-plus years with one estimating a minimum of four shoplifters every evening shift.

“I don’t think they stop anything” Iggy 21 a store clerk said of the anti-theft cases. “It’s security theater. If you really needed it you would stomp on it.”

The employee’s complaints were prescient: At around 7 p.m. on Thursday a man in a black tank top and gray sweatpants had an employee unlock the glass case for a $38 electric razor and then bolted with the appliance past a yellow-shirted security guard and out the door.

With inflation out of control — the consumer price index spiked 9.1 percent in June compared to a year ago even as President Biden this week refused to acknowledge the nation is in a recession despite the economy contracting two quarters in a row — emboldened thieves have found a ready market for discounted stolen goods among recession-weary consumers.

Petit larceny complaints for the NYPD Midtown South Precinct which includes the Port Authority bus terminal have shot up 52 percent — to 1771 through July 24 — compared to the same period last year.

Hormel CEO Jim Snee told analysts last month that prices for their legacy product were set to increase in late July to cover increased transportation packaging and meat costs.

A spokeswoman for Walgreens which owns Duane Reade refused to say why Spam was locked down at this particular location and that installing anti-theft devices is done “in response to theft data.”

Liz Tawfik 57 a home health attendant complained that the added security measures are hampering the once-smooth shopping experience — and annoying customers like herself.

“If you’re gonna catch a train you wanna grab something quick it’s not quick anymore” she said. “You might as well have someone take your order at the door and get you what you want.”

Not all drug stores have put Spam under lockdown.

Two other Duane Reades and a CVS in the Times Square area along with a Rite Aid and CVS in Central Harlem sold their cans of Spam cage-free.

Dariel Cepin 23 an employee at a West 44th Street Duane Reade said “Here we lock up ice cream.”"

The fifth-largest commercial bank in the US was fined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for illegally accessing consumer credit reports and opening accounts without their permission.

U.S. Bank which is based in Minneapolis and has over $559 billion in assets pressured its employees to meet sales goals as part of their job requirements offering them incentives for selling bank products the regulator said. In order to meet those goals the bank’s employees illegally accessed customer credit reports and personal data to open accounts without permission the investigation found.

The CFBP announced Thursday that it fined U.S. Bank $37.5 million after a five-year investigation.

“For over a decade U.S. Bank knew its employees were taking advantage of its customers by misappropriating consumer data to create fictitious accounts” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra in a press release.

In a statement to CNN Business U.S. Bank said it has “made process and oversight improvements” since 2016 regarding sales practice concerns. Employees now receive incentives only for accounts where the customer uses the service.

The settlement is “related to legacy sales practices involving a small percentage of accounts dating back to 2010” U.S. Bank said in a statement Saturday. “We are pleased to put this matter behind us.”

U.S. Bank has over 2800 branches throughout the United States.

The CFBP said its investigation found evidence that the bank was aware that its employees were opening accounts without customers’ authorization and did not have measures in place to prevent and detect them. The bank’s sales campaigns and compensation programs rewarded employees for selling bank products the agency added

Regulators found that the employees opened deposit accounts credit cards and lines of credit that carried high interest rates and expensive fees that were passed on to the customer.

“U.S. Bank’s conduct harmed its customers in the form of unwanted accounts negative effects on their credit profiles and the loss of control over personally identifiable information” the CFBP said in its release saying customers were forced to close the unauthorized accounts in their names and seek refunds themselves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZ2h0bmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZ292dC11cy1iYW5rLXdvcmtlcnMtb3BlbmVkLWZha2UtYWNjb3VudHMtZm9yLXNhbGVzLWdvYWxzL2FydGljbGVfNjNmNTkxOGEtMTAwNC0xMWVkLWJhZTEtMzMzZDk2ZjU4NWI5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gov't: US Bank workers opened fake accounts for sales goals,The CFPB alleged that US Bank accessed consumers credit reports to open checking and savings accounts credit cards and lines of credit without their permission.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbGV2aXR0b3dubm93LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzMwL2Jhbmstb2YtYW1lcmljYS1jbG9zaW5nLWZhaXJsZXNzLWhpbGxzLWJyYW5jaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank Of America Closing Fairless Hills Branch,"The Bank of America in Fairless Hills in November 2021.

Bank of America has filed paperwork with federal regulators to close an area branch.

The North Carolina-based bank chain filed paperwork with U.S. Department of the Treasury independent bureau Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that they will be closing their location along South Oxford Valley Road in the Queen Anne Plaza shopping center in Bristol Township’s Fairless Hills section.

Bank of America said the location will close for good on October 25. It advises residents to close safe deposit boxes during branch business hours.

The Philadelphia Business Journal reported Bank of America has 78 locations in the Philadelphia area. It recently closed locations in Montgomery County Philadelphia and Ocean City New Jersey.

Bank of America has spend time over the past decade closing branches in the region.

The bank is the fourth largest deposit taker in the region the Philadelphia Business Journal reported.

The pandemic forced consumers to become more involved with virtual and mobile banking options which has sped up a trend of major banks consolidating locations.

Bank of America operates an existing branch at the Marketplace at Oxford Valley on East Lincoln Highway and several area ATMs. Outside of the Levittown area the bank has nearby branches in Bensalem Township Lower Southampton Township Newtown Township and Trenton.

Now they profit big,"Shubham Saharan

Bloomberg

The last time inflation burned hot consumers could put money in the bank and watch it grow like the prices on store shelves easing much of the pain.

Not this time – and that’s stoking profits for U.S. lenders.

The gap between what banks pay depositors and what they earn from lending money to borrowers hasn’t been so wide in the past half-century with the average savings account paying a skimpy 0.06%. Many banks are telling shareholders that so-called deposit betas measuring how quickly deposit rates rise in the wake of Fed hikes will remain advantageous for banks in the months ahead as they’re not yet feeling much pressure to pay savers more.

Betas are now the buzziest bit of jargon across the financial industry. The phrase was invoked more times during Bank of America Corp.’s analyst briefings in the past two months than in the prior two years combined. This month the lender’s executives predicted interest income may climb by as much as $1 billion in the third quarter from the second as they stay “disciplined” in what they pay customers.

“Our consumer-banking segment continues to see good momentum” Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan told analysts July 18. “We grew loans at the fastest quarterly pace in nearly three years.”

The reasons that savers are getting so little relief are myriad starting with the Federal Reserve which waited until inflation was strong before it began raising interest rates from longtime lows. From there it takes time for deposit rates to rise too. The result is pain: The consumer price index jumped 9.1% in June while banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co. offered deposit rates as low as 0.01% according to their websites.

While deposit rates are widely expected to tick incrementally higher as the Fed’s rate hikes for borrowers take hold there’s ample evidence that the benefits for savers will come slowly. That’s because many banks face little competitive pressure to pay more. Many are flush with cash thanks in part to a surge in deposits that piled up during Covid-era lockdowns and stimulus programs.

Even big clients that aren’t doing a lot of business with a bank aside from parking their money will have little leverage to push for a higher interest rate on their deposits.

“Banks have plenty of room on the funding side” said Erika Najarian a banking analyst at UBS Group AG. That means they can allow “more rate-sensitive deposit-only relationships to walk because they don’t necessarily need that funding.

While deposits have been slipping somewhat at many banks it’s unlikely that enough consumers will switch lenders to ratchet up pressure quickly even as online and community-based institutions burnish rates to attract inflows. Synchrony Financial and American Express Co. for example each offer rates of at least 1.5%.

One reason for that inertia is that only people of a certain age can remember an era when banks routinely paid much more interest on deposits blunting the impact of inflation. Another is that accounts aren’t as portable as they were decades ago. Many customers have their paychecks deposited directly and arrange for bills to be paid automatically making switching to a new bank a hassle.

To be sure the more generous rates banks paid for deposits in the 1980s were a result of longstanding inflation and the Fed’s efforts to tame that with much higher interest rates for borrowing.

This time both interest and deposit rates are coming off ultra-low levels said Greg McBride chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com which tracks the deposit rates banks offer. Banks will want to see the benefit from higher borrowing rates before they start to pass that along to savers he said.

Getting to higher deposit rates will also depend on how long the Fed keeps borrowing rates elevated Najarian said. She suggests deposit rates might reach 1.2% before the Fed starts to ease again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1wcm5ld3Mub3JnL3N0b3J5LzIwMjIvMDcvMzAvdmlraW5ncy1vd25lcnNoaXAtc2Vlcy1wb3NpdGl2aXR5LWZyb20tbmV3LWxlYWRlcnNoaXDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vikings' ownership sees positivity from new leadership,"Taking a day of regular training camp away from their team facilities the Minnesota Vikings traveled for an afternoon practice at U.S. Bank Stadium as a way for the new coaching staff and players to become more comfortable with their gameday surroundings.

Like many things under new general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and coach Kevin O’Connell the trip offered a fresh outlook for a team needing one after missing the playoffs three of the past four seasons.

Three days into camp Vikings ownership is enjoying what it sees from its new leadership.

“The energy the positivity the communication the collaboration between the two of them and across the whole team and organization has been excellent” Vikings owner and president Mark Wilf said after practice. “We couldn’t be more happy to have them on board. We’re really excited about the season and seasons because they work well together and I think the players especially veterans who have said ‘You know what this is good energy and we are looking forward to playing with these guys and the leadership.’ It’s been positive from that standpoint. Can’t wait to get this thing going.”

With only one home preseason game this year the team took the opportunity to practice at its sun-splashed downtown stadium. Former Vikings All-Pro defensive end Jared Allen spoke to the team after practice and the team surprised Allen by announcing he’ll be inducted into the team’s ring of honor this fall.

The Wilf family who approved the trade for Allen in 2008 after three playoff-less seasons hope their most recent acquisitions pay off in the same manner.

Allen had 85.5 sacks in six years in Minnesota and helped break the playoff drought in his first season with the Vikings. Minnesota made it to the NFC Championship in Allen’s second season.

“I remember like any trade there’s nerves and anxiousness” Wilf said. “We gave up some picks for him and it was a lot of discussion about it but it turned out to be one of the best things we did as ownership and in this franchise history is to get a player of his level here. Our first two seasons out of the block we won the division. So he made a big impact right away and we’re fortunate it worked out.”

Moving on from the disappointment of the final years of Mike Zimmer’s tenure as coach the Vikings chose not to make dramatic sweeping personnel changes. Instead the Wilf’s believe a coaching change will be enough to get the team back in the postseason.

All of the main offensive pieces including quarterback Kirk Cousins running back Dalvin Cook and receivers Justin Jefferson and Adam Thielen return in O’Connell’s new system.

“I do believe we have a great roster and I give Kwesi and Kevin a lot of credit” Wilf said. “They did a great job of balancing a lot of factors to get us to be really competitive and I know our fans when they seem them starting tomorrow practicing we have a lot of great talent here and more importantly it’s starting to gel together in terms of a new system and new leadership and they’re really taking well to it.”

Like the move for Allen ownership made the leadership change hoping for immediate returns.

“It burns all of us to get back to winning ways and competitiveness to be where we want to be winning divisions and championships and competing” Wilf said. “We feel we made a lot of great strides on that front and I can tell you the players are super energized and motivated as well. They don’t like losing. A lot of them have come from winning college programs or they are winners in their own right and they don’t like that taste either.

“So like I said before there’s a lot of good energy and good positivity working toward these goals and I believe we’ll get there.”"

Uber will let drivers see how much they can earn from a trip upfront Reuters reported.

It is offering drivers 7% cashback on fuel costs and will let them choose what areas they work in.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said Uber has been too focused on self-driving cars rather than its drivers.

Uber is expanding a program across the US to let drivers see how much they can earn from a trip and routes before they choose to accept or reject a ride request Reuters reported.

The ride hailing company is expanding its ""Upfront Fares"" feature to about 30 areas in August after it started trialing it in February. The feature could give drivers more control in choosing what trips they reject or incentivizing them to accept those with good payments.

""It's got to make it worth your time so the upfront pricing is key information"" Matt Hughes an Uber driver told Reuters.

Uber's bid to recruit more drivers comes after its CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said its drivers are ""not replaceable"" at an event on Thursday. He previously said it paid more attention to developing its own self-driving car rather than its drivers.

Uber came under fire from drivers earlier this year for introducing a fuel surcharge which they told Insider does not cover their cost of gas. Uber drivers said last month that the high cost of gas has cut their earnings considerably.

Companies have been forced to up their offering to entice drivers back as a result. Uber has now unveiled a debit card to give drivers 7% cashback if they use it to pay for gas per the report but it is dependent on their loyalty status.

It plans to bring back a ""Uber Pro"" rewards program in the fall to let drivers pick what areas they work in.

The new driver perks could mean greater freedom in choosing from a list of booking requests as well as being transparent with them through weekly earnings recaps the report said.

Uber was contacted for comment.

Uber on Friday said it will let drivers in the United States see trip details before deciding whether to accept them—a new feature long sought by drivers.

A common lament by drivers at the app-summoned ride platform has been that they have to accept a request before learning where trips will take them or how profitable they will be.

""Our new trip request screen makes it easier for drivers to decide if a trip is worth their time and effort by providing all the details—including exactly how much they'll earn and where they're going—upfront"" chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in a blog post.

Revealing details only once a driver had accepted a trip was seen as a way to ensure riders would get picked up promptly and not be snubbed because they were headed to locations deemed undesirable by drivers.

But Khosrowshahi said drivers have made it clear that they want more flexibility and choice.

Uber said the new feature called Upfront Fares was tested in several cities and was a success with drivers while resulting in shorter wait times for passengers.

The ride-sharing firm will also shift from sending drivers a single ride request at a time to letting them pick from a list of detailed passenger requests in an area.

Uber is engaged in a long-term effort to prove that its business model is socially and economy viable.

The ""gig economy""—which uses temporary independent contractors for short-term tasks—has grown rapidly since Uber's launch in 2009 and is promoted as a flexible way for people to earn money without the constraints of a full-time job.

But there has been growing backlash in countries around the world about the conditions and dangers gig workers face.

Uber driver ranks—which shrank during the COVID-19 pandemic—have not rebounded as quickly as demand for rides and soaring fuel costs have made the gigs less attractive.

The firm in March announced a surcharge on both rides and Uber Eats meal deliveries that would go directly to drivers to help offset high fuel prices.

HOUSTON — A man has been arrested and charged in connection to the death of a Houston pastor.

Deshawn Longmire was charged with murder in the death of Ronald Mouton Sr. a pastor at East Bethel Missionary Baptist Church according to court documents.

Mouton was shot and killed in an apparent road rage incident back in June.

Longmire who is an Uber driver was stopped on June 29 after running at least one stop sign. He was taken into custody and transported to HPD's Homicide Division for an interview according to the documents.

Longmire's vehicle was identified by a witness following the road rage shooting. According to court records Longmire said no one uses his vehicle except for him but that he was not in the area at the time of the shooting.

The documents say Longmire told detectives his phone records and Uber app could confirm his whereabouts.

After review police say his Uber records showed he was in the area of the shooting between 4:43 p.m. and 4:51 p.m. that day.

Longmire was taken into custody and his bond was set at $500000 on Saturday.

""Our thoughts are with Rev. Mouton Sr.'s family and friends during this difficult time"" Uber told KHOU 11 News on Saturday.

Uber says no passengers were in the vehicle at the time of the shooting and that Longmire's access to Uber was removed once they were aware of the investigation.

The family of Ronald Mouton Sr. said he has been a pastor for 32 years in the community. He will be remembered as a man who touched many lives.

His longtime friend Bishop James Dixon said Mouton's family is still grieving.

""For them this is at least some relief but they’re still going through they’re asking the public for prayer and privacy. But for all of us we’re hopeful that justice is done. The family wants justice to be done.”

""There are thousands of people within a five-mile radius of East Temple Church"" Dixon told us back in June. ""Ronald Mouton has been a blessing to that community.""

Dixon said he grew up with Mouton and knew him all his life.

“He fed the hungry he clothed the naked he helped to shelter the homeless"" Dixon said. “This can happen to anyone it doesn’t matter what your status or standing is in the community.”

Uber is expected to announce its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday.

In May the ride services company said its driver base was at a post-pandemic high. It had faced criticism about its treatment of those behind the wheels of Uber vehicles.

""We were focused sometimes more on building autonomous cars than focusing on our real drivers and our drivers ultimately are just not replaceable"" Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said at a driver event on Thursday.

The feature which the company started testing in February and will be expanding in close to 30 areas in August allows drivers to see how much they will earn and the pick up and drop off locations of their passengers before accepting a ride.

Matt Hughes who has been driving with Uber since 2016 said he wanted to make sure he was getting a good fare before he accepted a passenger. ""It’s got to make it worth your time so the upfront pricing is key information” he said.

Uber said it is also rolling out systems in the same cities as the ""Upfront Fares"" feature to let drivers choose from a list of trips and to get recaps of weekly earnings including Uber’s cut from completed trips.

To lessen the impact of higher gas prices the company introduced a new debit card that will give drivers up to 7% cash back on gas depending on their loyalty status.

The company said it will also re-introduce the Uber Pro driver rewards program with new features in November that will allow drivers to choose the areas they operate.

When you ride with Uber or get takeout with Uber Eats you’ll earn extra Loyalty Points good for earning status in the new American Airlines Loyalty Points scheme. The more points you earn the higher elite status you’ll be rewarded with at American.

Loyalty Points

American Airlines has revamped its loyalty program to replace the previously earned Elite Qualifying Miles (EQMs) Elite Qualifying Segments (EQS) and Elite Qualifying Dollars (EQDs) with a simplified Loyalty Points scheme. In order to earn status you need to earn Loyalty Points which can be earned in a variety of ways including flying staying at an eligible hotel and utilizing one of American’s partners.

SimplyMiles and Uber

SimplyMiles is a platform from American for AAdvantage members to earn miles on everyday purchases or activities when shopping in-store and online with their valid Mastercard.

There are 3 new offers to get more AAdvantage Loyalty Points by utilizing Uber though your account may not be targeted for all of them:

When you purchase $25 or more on Uber Eats by July 31 2022 you’ll earn 465 Loyalty Points .

by July 31 2022 you’ll earn . Take any trip on Uber  and you’ll earn 465 Loyalty Points  again through July 31 2022. This offer can be repeated 4 times for a total of 1395 points earned. This is likely the easiest of the 3 offers to participate in since there’s no spending threshold and it’s common for most folks to take an Uber at least once a month.

This is likely the easiest of the 3 offers to participate in since there’s no spending threshold and it’s common for most folks to take an Uber at least once a month. Purchase an Uber One membership and you’ll get 460 Loyalty Points. This offer can be repeated twice and carries the same expiration of July 31 2022. An Uber membership costs $9.99 per month so you’d simply need to keep your account active for 2 months in order to get both sets of Loyalty Points.

To activate the offers click Add to Card. A green ACTIVATED box with a checkmark will indicate that you’ve selected the offer.

Taking advantage of all 3 of these programs would net 3225 Loyalty Points.

The line which launched in 2020 and was developed with the help of dermatologist Jason Emer will be landing in 626 Ulta Beauty doors and 364 Ulta and Target shops-in-shop beginning July 31.

More from WWD

According to Jenny Frankel who is the chief executive officer of Nudestix and cofounded the brand alongside her daughters Taylor and Ally Frankel in 2014 the launch is among the brand’s key focuses for the year and part of its larger effort to increase its brick-and-mortar penetration.

“We really are in full COVID-19 recovery” Frankel said. “What’s really fueling us I think is this minimalist approach to beauty that before COVID-19 was more of a trend and now COVID-19 just really accelerated people’s love and understanding of minimalist beauty.”

Having previously launched online at ulta.com in 2020 Nudeskin’s eight-product range will now be available in-store at Ulta and ranges in price from $18 for its Gentle Hydragel Face Cleanser to $38 for the Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer.

Ulta stores will also carry an exclusive face mask as well as the brand’s first SPF product the Nudescreen SPF Daily Mineral Veil in shades cool warm and hot which launched in March and retails for $35.

“For us skin care is the true foundation — especially when you’re a less-is-more makeup brand” said Frankel who launched Nudeskin with the aim of simplifying skin care down to four key components: cleansing exfoliating toning and moisturizing.

The line’s key retailers include Macy’s Nordstrom and Selfridges and in 2023 Nudeskin will join Nudestix’s cosmetic line on sephora.com for U.S. and Canadian shoppers. Nudeskin will also launch at Harrods’ H Beauty in 2023.

Frankel said Nudestix and Nudeskin’s online presence at Ulta comprises roughly 30 percent of the brand’s global business and that Nudies which are the brand’s hero multipurpose cheek lip and eye makeup sticks make up 40 to 50 percent of its overall business.

Frankel did not comment on sales expectations but industry sources estimate Nudeskin alone could do between $5 million and $6 million in retail sales over the next year with somewhere between $1.5 million and $2 million of that total stemming from the brand’s online and in-store presence at Ulta.

“Taking our digital presence and partnerships to the next level is always top-of-mind but stores are still for us how most classic brands are built and we still truly believe in that” said Frankel.

Nudestix has also set its sights on an expansion into body care which the brand will be launching this fall: “We have what we call Skin Sticks which will be an expansion of our Nudies collection and will be skin-focused on vegan-powered actives and efficacy” said Frankel who noted that a yet-to-be-named celebrity will front the upcoming launch.

Little-noticed accidents have struck leading companies but the industry says it is thriving and that failure is necessary

By Alan Levin / Bloomberg





One prototype air taxi suffered a software glitch lost control and nosed into a field. Another’s computer erroneously thought it was on the ground shutting off power in flight and plunging it into the pavement. Batteries on two more burst into flames.

The race to develop a new family of flying machines to whisk people and cargo across traffic-choked cities has drawn billions of US dollars of investment and vast promise but some of the biggest names in aviation have had accidents during testinga Bloomberg review of reports dating back to 2018 showed.

They include Boeing Co and its subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences Corp Textron Inc’s Bell helicopter division billionaire Larry Page’s Kitty Hawk Corp Joby Aviation Inc and German air-taxi pioneer Lilium NV.

No one has died or been injured and advocates say accidents are a healthy sign that the industry is pushing the envelope.

However the new electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) use innovative technologies that have not been tested in routine service and some safety experts say this means that the road to government approval and public acceptance is unlikely to be an easy one.

The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to certify a handful of the new aircraft to carry people as soon as 2024.

Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen last month said in a speech that the agency is on track to meet that goal but the timing would be dictated by the safety of the new designs.

“This is harder than people generally understand” said John Hansman a professor of aeronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who coauthored a paper on the challenges facing eVTOLs. “You’re pushing the state of the art in multiple dimensions at the same time.”

Hansman is also an adviser to Electra.aero Inc which is developing a hybrid electric plane.

LEARNING EXPERIENCES

One of the most high-profile crashes occurred on Feb. 16 in a remote testing facility near Jolon California. A physical component on Joby’s six-propeller craft broke in midair three people familiar with the incident told Bloomberg.

The crash might not threaten the company’s long-term plans because the aircraft was operating at speeds far higher than the maximum 322kph it would fly in service two of the people said.

A flight track by the Web site ADSBexchange.com LLC showed that it was traveling at 439kph before it disappeared.

Joby declined to comment.

The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) which has not completed its investigation has only said the aircraft suffered an unspecified component failure.

Boeing had two crashes in 2019: Aurora’s prototype air taxi on June 4 and the company’s experimental pilotless cargo aircraft on June 21.

Aurora’s was caused by a computer’s erroneous command to shut engines and Boeing’s was due to gusty winds the NTSB said.

“We gained valuable knowledge and experience that will benefit programs across the company” Boeing said in an e-mailed statement.

The company is continuing its development work in a partnership with Kitty Hawk known as Wisk Aero LLC.

MANAGING MISHAPS

The accidents should not be viewed as comparable to the rare mishaps during flight testing of traditional aircraft said Walter Desrosier vice president for engineering and maintenance at the General Aviation Manufacturers Association trade group.

Significantly greater protections are taken in advance of test flights where pilots and engineers are going to be aboard Desrosier said.

“When we have the ability to test things without humans you can do additional things because you can manage the risks” he said.

All but one of the nine accidents reviewed involved craft being flown remotely.

Kitty Hawk’s Heaviside2 crashed in a field in California near Tres Pinos California on Oct. 17 2019 after a software error led to control problems an NTSB report said. A remote pilot attempted to land the hybrid aircraft designed to carry one person but it was not capable of touching down in a field while moving forward and suffered substantial damage the NTSB said.

The company told investigators it was revising the software and also changing its procedures.

Kitty Hawk did not respond to requests for comment.

Similar failures of software or aircraft structures have occurred during development of human-carrying craft but go unnoticed because they occur in a lab not during a flight Desrosier said.

Unlike crashes such failures mostly are not publicly reported.

FIRE HAZARDS

The crashes and incidents involving these new-age aircraft have occurred for a variety of reasons from failures in carbon-fiber structures to breakdowns in computer-human interactions. They highlight some of the design challenges with the technology.

Century-old flight controls used by traditional aircraft are being replaced in some cases by computerized motors and while some initial models would be guided by traditional pilots the goal is to transition to robotic flight.

Instead of liquid fuels they would be powered by lithium-based batteries creating new questions about fire hazards and ensuring an adequate charge.

A Jan. 22 2020 fire destroyed a prototype of Eviation Aircraft Ltd’s electric-powered nine-passenger commuter plane in Prescott Arizona.

The fire started in a ground-based battery that is not part of the plane’s main power pack the company said in an e-mail.

“We learned a valuable lesson from the event” the company said in an e-mailed statement adding that it has taken multiple steps to protect the lithium-based batteries from overheating and fire.

Similarly Lilium which is designing an aircraft that uses electric-powered jet engines to take off vertically said in an e-mailed statement that it had upgraded safety measures in its battery system after a fire on Feb. 27 2020 at an airport near Munich.

FUTURE BETS

The accidents have not stopped established companies from clamoring to invest in air-taxi start-ups or to order still-uncertified aircraft. Package shipping kingpins FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc have linked up with eVTOL startups and major airlines — including American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines Holdings Inc — also have placed bets on the industry.

However a May report by the US Government Accountability Office on the prospects of electric-powered air taxis said one of the biggest challenges facing the industry and regulators is ensuring buy-in from the public.

“Acceptance of large numbers operating in close proximity to people and buildings will require a concerted effort on the part of industry and government to show these aircraft’s safety by demonstrating safe reliable operations” the report said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The new packaging will degrade within 180 days through composting.

Why it matters: According to the State Post Bureau of China the country’s consumption of express packaging materials exceeded 40 million tons in 2020. Most packaging material will take at least a few hundred years to fully decompose.

More about the bags:

The packaging is made mostly of PBAT (butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate) and PLA (polylactic acid) helping reduce environmental impact

The material is more malleable and tear-resistant

The bags received a ‘Green Product Certification’ from the State Post Bureau

The path to green packaging: Henry Jiao a green packaging professional at UPS has been on the lookout for this new biodegradable material since 2019. “As is often the case it took a bit of time to balance quality and price; we needed to make sure the greener way was effective but also still affordable - and this solution makes good business sense. Research and development has improved a lot in the last few years and we’re proud to be helping our organization on its way to achieving our ambitious sustainability goals” said Henry.

According to a news release by the USPS the program is titled USPS Connect and will offer several solutions to help businesses — both large and small — meet growing consumer demand for affordable and and fast deliveries and returns.

“USPS Connect provides businesses of all sizes what they have been asking for — an affordable way to meet consumer demand for fast delivery” said Louis DeJoy Postmaster General and CEO. “A pivotal point in our Delivering for America plan it positions us to more fully leverage our network capacity to increase volume and revenue so we can continue to serve the American people with affordable reliable mail and package delivery.”

USPS said there will be four options for USPS Connect on its Aug. 1 launch in Arkansas.

USPS Connect Local will allow local businesses to reach out to local customers ""affordably and quickly."" The news release said this option will allow for next-day service in most locations with same-day delivery Sunday delivery and pickup options in select locations. USPS Connect Local Mail will also be available for documents up to 13 ounces.

USPS Connect Regional will provide next-day regional entry and delivery of Parcel Select packages and Parcel Select lightweight packages.

USPS Connect National will allow businesses to take advantage of the postal service's new mail processing equipment and reconfigured network to receive delivery of packages through First-Class Package Service Parcel Select Ground and Retail Ground.

USPS Connect Returns is said to allow businesses a service to offer their customers convenient returns with free enroute pickup by their carrier or drop-off at a local post office location.

“We’ve listened carefully to our business customers to develop this program” said Jakki Krage Strako chief commerce and business solutions officer. “We’re increasing next-day deliveries.

The United States Postal Service has served the American people for almost 250 years as one of the oldest and most venerable US institutions. You’ll recognize agency members by those timeless navy blue shorts and the eagle logo on the side of their trucks. The USPS has been making deliveries for centuries yet many Americans still don’t fully grasp the organization’s mailing laws. Namely what is the risk of mailing or shipping weed or edibles through the mail?

The short answer: mailing flower edibles vapes or any other cannabis product is federally illegal. Postal inspectors play a key role in helping wage the nation’s War on Drugs including cannabis. As one of the country’s oldest law enforcement agencies they work to identify and prosecute major drug mailers and intercept illegal drug proceeds that traffickers attempt to send through the mail.

But we know what you’re thinking: How many of those billions of packages being mailed each year contain cannabis? Are people getting away with mailing cannabis? Can I mail weed and not get caught? Is it worth risking the consequences? The long answer is a little more complicated and we’re here to break it down.

Potential penalties for mailing weed

Though states can legalize marijuana possession under local law possession for any reason outside limited research technically remains a federal crime as does shipping cannabis through the mail. Additionally as a government agency the United States Postal Service is subject to federal law; any illegal use of their services is a felony. Plus marijuana is still a Schedule I drug.

That means anything under 50 grams can potentially get you up to five years in a federal penitentiary and the penalties only increase as the amount grows. More than 200 federal laws protect the sanctity of the US mail enforced by the US Postal Inspection Service.

We should also note that even if you did not mail the package and are only the recipient your knowledge and participation in the planning of the shipping makes you just as guilty as the person who mailed the package. Once a package is seized a person is liable to face prosecution in both the state in which it was mailed as well as the state in which it was delivered. It’s totally at the discretion of the prosecutor.

Mailing hemp and delta-8 products

With the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill came the federal legalization of hemp and hemp-derived products which are defined as having less than 0.3% THC. Hemp products can be mailed legally within the United States by the USPS as well as private mailers like FedEx and UPS though there are some exceptions such as vaporizers and legality depends on if the sender or delivery state has laws in place that prohibit it.

Now you might be thinking that the rise of delta-8 THC a hemp-derived cannabinoid with intoxicating effects that differs from delta-9 offers a loophole. You can extract it from federally-legal hemp plants so you should be able to ship it anywhere in the country right? Well no. Delta-8’s legal status currently exists in a gray area; while the DEA has listed it alongside delta-9 THC on its scheduled substances list it hasn’t been officially scheduled as such yet.

But some states have passed their own laws against shipping and selling it likely because its products do not have to be tested and regulated like delta-9 THC. So if you live in a state that allows it yes you can ship delta-8 products (minus vapes) through the USPS.

What about mailing weed through private couriers like UPS or FedEx?

In terms of alternative carriers within the US there are a number of private couriers. The big three outside of USPS are FedEx UPS and DHL. A discerning cannabis shipper might ask “Which service should I choose and are any of these a better safer option than USPS?” Surely these private companies offer the paying customers greater protection against government interference and warrantless searches?

The answer is a resounding no. FedEx UPS and DHL all specify in their terms of service that they reserve the right to open and inspect any package at their own discretion. They all also specify that shipping any form of marijuana remains illegal and “unacceptable.” When you drop your package off at the FedEx or UPS store to be mailed you’re putting the property into the possession of a third party and the Supreme Court has ruled that giving your package to a third party “removes any reasonable expectation of privacy.” We should note that none of these couriers’ policies explicitly address delta-8 products.

FedEx

According to their terms and conditions FedEx not only prohibits the mailing of cannabis flower and THC products but also hemp plants oil and seeds. Compliant CBD products however can now be shipped. To compound this in 2014 the US Department of Justice indicted FedEx with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances over its alleged role in transporting illegal prescription drugs. While this isn’t marijuana it does strongly indicate that FedEx and other private couriers will be scrutinizing packages much more closely for any illegal substances.

UPS

UPS similarly prohibits shipping any cannabis products but it does allow for raw hemp plants and CBD products that comply with state and federal laws (minus vapes) as long as they are shipped domestically and do not come from companies who also produce or handle marijuana or THC products.

DHL

DHL accepts packages containing hemp plants and derived products with under 0.3% THC but only within the US. While DHL claims to inspect 100% of their packages they and other couriers are not required to x-ray all shipments.

The USPS seems like the safest bet

In contrast to these policies the US Postal Service seems like the preferred carrier for many drug shippers because it offers more stringent Fourth Amendment protection. Postal inspectors must acquire a search warrant based on probable cause before inspecting mail and parcels. According to the USPS:

“…first class letters and parcels are protected against search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution and as such cannot be opened without a search warrant.”

However although postal inspectors do have to obtain a warrant to search a suspicious package suspicion alone is enough to get parcels singled out and tracked. USPS actively encourages workers and the public to get involved in the identification of packages containing drugs by offering $50000 to anyone who provides information that leads to the arrest and indictment of a drug trafficker.

When it comes right down to the illegal transportation of cannabis via mail USPS is—relatively!—your safest bet. And we mean relatively. Remember the act is an illegal one and without a doubt carries a significant level of risk.

What happens when USPS or FedEx finds weed in packages? Are there penalties?

Crunching the numbers the Postal Service faces an enormous task in preventing the trafficking of illicit substances. Put simply the sheer volume of packages the carrier handles every day offers the chance that contraband packages will get delivered unchecked; the United States Postal Inspection Service enforces over 200 laws with over 1200 inspectors. They can put their collective shoulder to the wheel but no matter how hard they try it is virtually impossible for the USPS to catch all wrongdoers. In 2015 alone they seized 34000 pounds of marijuana from mailed packages.

For third party couriers the onus of responsibility falls on them to report illicit packages to the authorities who can acquire warrants and open investigations. Without reported data it’s impossible to estimate how many packages found to contain marijuana or other scheduled substances have been cited to open investigations.

Shipping drugs through the mail probably seems safer than it should be. The USPS as well as partnering law enforcement agencies simply don’t have the resources to try to figure out where the drugs are coming from and who’s expecting them.

However it would be unfair to fault the USPS in the matter; they are just not equipped to x-ray and investigate each package nor is there an official x-ray policy. Not only are packages given extra protection as we’ve outlined but the agency has also been losing money pretty much every year for the last decade due to a decrease in mail volume. The increasingly under-resourced organization faces increasing pressure to downsize exerted by the government.

In 2016 despite turning a profit in a financial quarter for the first time in five years President Obama still proposed the agency slash 12000 employees in his fiscal 2017 budget. The Trump-appointed and current Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has made further cuts to plant locations office hours and mail delivery times.

Does where I’m mailing the weed to impact the risk?

In short no. Since the USPS operates on federal law it remains illegal and risky to mail cannabis and cannabis products anywhere in the US including out of the country state to state and within a state even if medical and/or adult-use laws are in place. Like third party couriers the USPS does ship compliant hemp-derived products within the US if state laws allow and most states allow the shipping of delta-8 products.

What makes a package suspicious?

Post inspectors have a long list of signs and tells that help them determine if a package could contain marijuana or other illicit substances. In fact in 2016 the USPS founded the Administrative Non-Mailability Protocol (ANP) program which “does not require postal inspectors to obtain search warrants to open detained packages.” In fact if a package is detained and they don’t receive a response form the mailer or addressee in 21 days the package is considered abandoned and they can open it anyway. Factors that raise suspicion with packages include:

Outdated handwritten or missing return addresses

Odd shapes

Excessively taped

Excessive postage

Leaking unidentifiable substances

Excessive odor

What about mailing edibles cartridges and concentrates?

Unfortunately if it’s got any THC above 0.3% any cannabis-derived edible cartridge concentrate and even topical can be seized and even used as proof of a drug-trafficking crime. Even CBD and delta-8 vapes are prohibited though CBD and delta-8 edibles and concentrates that comply with federal and state regulations are allowed.

Drug trafficking is an existing problem

Ever since the closure of the infamous Silk Road and the media furor surrounding it people now know of the existence and the nefarious proclivities of particular groups within the Dark Net. Most Americans can access illegal substances with a simple click thanks to Internet access Dark Net markets and social networks like Instagram. Still these hidden online drug dealers don’t have access to some secret underground delivery method us mere mortals are unaware of; they simply use the Postal Service.

According to former Attorney General Eric Holder the problem is endemic:

“The postal service—the mails are—being used to facilitate drug dealing … It is shocking to see the amount of drugs that get pumped into communities all around this country through our mail system and we have to deal with that.”

Leafly previously contacted the Postal Service in the hope of getting more information on their policies regarding illicit substances in particular cannabis being transported in the mail. The USPS promptly responded while also providing some useful data:

“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is committed to eradicating illegal drugs and their proceeds from the U.S. Mail. We pursue traffickers of all forms of illegal narcotics—including marijuana which remains illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act and is therefore unmailable. Our prohibited narcotics program focuses on the disruption of organized narcotics-trafficking operations to help protect employees and customers from the violence related to drug trafficking and to inhibit the spread of illegal or unmailable substances into neighborhoods across America.”

On average 1000 suspects are arrested by postal inspectors each year for trafficking drugs and laundering drug money via the U.S mail in 2019 they made over 2500. In addition to seizing cash obtained through criminal activity postal inspectors have used federal forfeiture laws to seize houses vehicles boats artwork and other high-value items purchased with drug money.

Statistical trends: Mailing marijuana and other drugs

Despite these hefty risks and the fact more than half the country has legal access to either medicinal or adult use programs some cannabis users continue to dismiss the run-of-the-mill driving delivery system and keep mailing their product. In 2019 the USPS processed almost 55000 packages they suspected of containing marijuana.

The black market even in adult-use states continues to thrive so many might find mailing weed a lucrative endeavor. Even as DEA seizures od marijuana continue to decline year after year it’s unclear if this trend will be reflected in weed packaged mailed.

We’ve previously reported that while the overall number and weight of marijuana package seizures has been declining for years there was an uptick in 2016; since then however the numbers seem to decline but no one really knows just how much marijuana successfully makes it through the Postal Service undiscovered. Is it just a coincidence though that the level of detected cannabis has fallen as more states wholly legalize?

Prohibition has been seen in the past to encourage and incentivize the black market. Perhaps as cannabis becomes increasingly mainstream and regulated the lure of the black market will wane through easier access and the realization that shipping the drug is no longer worth the risk of harsh federal charges.

Why do people risk getting caught mailing cannabis?

Is it really such a bad thing to put some eighths in the mail? Why are there so many people willing to take a chance on something like mailing cannabis? Actually the data shows that it’s likely happening less and less.

Increasingly favorable legislation in the US coupled with Canada’s federal legalization and Mexico’s recent decriminalization means more legal avenues for cannabis careers and by extension a drop in related crimes. The latest data shows that while agents hit a seizures pinnacle in 2009 getting their hands on around 4 million pounds of cannabis they only confiscated about 1.5 million pounds last year. In 2021 the DEA made less than 1000 marijuana trafficking charges.

But let’s face it the USPS has been in financial trouble for the better part of a decade. In the past 10 years total volume has declined by more than 56 billion pieces (or 26%) first-class mail volume has declined by 34.5 billion pieces and single-piece first-class mail (primarily letters bearing postage stamps) has declined by 24.4 billion pieces.This translates to $47 billion in operating losses since 1971. Ultimately can beggars be choosers? To paraphrase Gertrude Stein traffic is traffic is traffic.

Well don't feel obliged to borrow a gas-guzzler for the duration of your stay as going electric is becoming an increasingly viable option.

Renting an electric car for a trip may not have all the same long-term benefits as buying your own EV true but there are still benefits. Like not paying for gasoline or having more interior space. Rental companies are offering more and more electric options so here’s how you can rent an electric car next time you go on vacation.

Which rental companies carry electric cars?

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Electric cars are no longer the niche machines they once were. For that reason the majority of the big car rental firms in the United States have some kind of electrified fleet.

Hertz is the one that’s made the most noise about electric car rentals over the past several months making a point of announcing the purchase of tens of thousands of Tesla and Polestar 2 cars. Hertz doesn’t make it particularly easy to filter for electric vehicles though.

The company offers various “collections” to search through including “The Green Collection.” However the cars in that list don’t seem to include EVs even when the full list does. Electric cars are marked as such so keep an eye out for that green label.

Enterprise offers two classes of electric car Intermediate and Luxury . It doesn’t specify which cars are stocked but Enterprise says you’ll get a Nissan Leaf “or similar.” In other words a more casual electric car without extravagant features and likely not as much range. An example of a Luxury car is a Tesla Model S .

Enterprise subsidiaries National and Alamo also stock cars in those two categories plus a third: Full Size Electric Elite. The example is a Polestar 2 so expect to get something more luxurious and feature-packed cars than a budget EV but not quite as frivolous as the likes of a Model S.

Budget’s electric-only listings are “Full-Size Elite SUV” which offers a Kia E-Niro or similar and “Luxury” which promises something akin to a Tesla Model 3. Meanwhile Sixt offers something similar to the Volvo XC40 Recharge  which is another all-electric SUV.

Finally there’s Europcar . It may not be one of the largest rental companies in the United States but it still has a pretty strong presence abroad. And there are electric cars in the fleet; not many but they are still available in some locations.

Which rental companies don’t have electric cars?

A surprisingly large number of car rental companies offer some form of EV rental but there are still a few that do not.

From what we can see online Avis Dollar and Thrifty (the latter two of which are owned by Hertz) don’t offer the option to rent electric cars which means you’ll have to go with someone else.

How do you search for an electric rental car?

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

Rental car companies don’t make a habit of telling you exactly what cars are available and where. You typically need to go through the search process and see what cars are actually available. Which is kind of a pain to be honest so thankfully there are comparison sites that will simplify the process.

There are plenty of sites that let you compare the cost of renting a car at any given time and place. A lot of them have also started offering an electric car filter to the results so you can quickly see which companies have electric cars on offer — assuming any of them do.

Not all aggregation sites offer this filter but there are plenty that do. Examples we found include Rental 24h Kayak Priceline Skyscanner RentalCars.com and AutoRentals.

It’s still worth remembering that electric cars are still in the minority and they won’t be available at every single rental location. So we couldn’t even begin to guess at the odds of being able to find an available electric car at the time and place you want it. Your only real option is to check and hope for the best.

Are there other ways to rent electric cars?

(Image credit: Nissan)

Rent from a dealer: Car dealers may not be as conveniently located as rental companies but some of them do have their own fleet of rental cars. And some of those dealers will have electric cars you can take out for a spin. Nissan is one such company  and actively advertises the fact it will let you rent a Nissan Leaf. Toyota offers it too  if you’d rather rent a hybrid.

Bear in mind that the same discovery caveats that apply to rental companies also apply to dealers. They’re not in the habit of advertising what they have and the easiest way to check is to make an inquiry.

Use car-share companies: Much like AirBnB lets you stay in someone else’s home in lieu of a hotel there are car sharing services that will let you drive around in someone else’s car. You find someone willing to hand over their keys pay a daily rate and you’re good to go. It’s a handy solution if the big rental companies don’t have any electric stock.

The downside here is that car-sharing prices vary and companies operate differently. Some only let members access listings or only rent to paid subscribers. ZipCar is a prominent example charging $8 a month (or $80 a year) plus however much you spend actually renting the cars.

Of course some car-sharing services are free to browse only charging when you actually book a car. Our favorite option is Turo  which lets you search and browse cars freely and quickly — as you would any major rental site.

Things to consider before renting an EV

(Image credit: Shutterstock)

How will you charge it?

The most important thing to think about before you rent an electric car is the local charging infrastructure. After all you will need to recharge at some point even if you get a car with extra-long range.

Be sure to check out our guide on how to find an electric car charging stations  and figure out what the local charging situation is. While you’re at it read our other guide on how to find free electric car chargers  and save yourself money on getting around.

Teslas have their own charging hurdles

If you’re renting a Tesla in North America you’ll need to account for the fact Tesla uses its own charger type  and is mostly restricted to Tesla’s own Supercharger and Destination charger networks. Fortunately Tesla’s charging network is one of if not the biggest around so there should be no shortage of options. Plus the car can tell you where to find them.

Adapters do exist to let you plug a Tesla into the AC J1772 charger  and Tesla sells one of its own for $50. But you’re probably not going to buy one to use with a rental car so this all hinges on whether the company supplies them or not. Hertz claims to include an adapter with each rental while others only mention including a mobile adapter which lets you plug into ordinary wall sockets.

It’s also worth asking how charging payments will be processed — since Tesla’s chargers automatically bill charging costs to the owner’s account. Hertz is the only one that seems to make this abundantly clear noting that charging costs will be passed onto the credit card they have on file with no additional fees.

How much charge does an EV need when you return it?

Anyone that’s rented a car before knows you have to return it with a full tank of gas — or at least more than you set off with. Otherwise you pay some outrageous fees. Electric cars don’t necessarily have that problem which is a good thing. Especially since recharging past 80% can be a very time-consuming process.

But you have to find out how much charge the car needs before you take it back. Unfortunately most rental companies aren’t very forthcoming about this. Hertz only asks for a 10% charge  which is more than doable. But for everyone else you’re going to need to call customer service beforehand or ask when you return the car.

How much driving will you do?

Some rental companies have different classes of electric car and you need to decide which one is right for you. A Nissan Leaf-equivalent will cost you less but you’ll end up with lower range than say a Tesla. Making your choice will all depend on how much driving you actually plan on doing and what the cost difference is.

If you’re going on a road trip then the longer the range the better. Otherwise you’ll be stopping to recharge all the time and that’s really not fun. Likewise if you’re only going short distances with plenty of opportunity to recharge in between drives then there may be no justification in paying extra for a long-range vehicle

What are the benefits of renting an electric car?

(Image credit: Shutterstock)

The main benefit of renting an electric vehicle when you’re away is that you’re not beholden to the local gas prices. The prices may have been going down in recent weeks but the average is still pretty high — $4.27 a gallon as of July 28 . Electricity is a lot cheaper by comparison and you’ll save money getting around.

Electric cars also don’t have big bulky engines. That means you get more interior space compared to similarly sized gas-powered cars. As a result there’s more room for you and your family as well as ample trunk space for all your luggage. Some electric cars like Teslas also have a smaller trunk under the hood for smaller items.

Some EVs even let you have the A/C on when you’re not in the car and without using up a crazy amount of power in the process. For example Tesla has ‘Dog Mode’ that keeps the interior nice and cool — even if a dog isn't there — while others let you set up pre-conditioning to make sure the cabin is a comfortable temperature on your return. A gas-powered car would need to be left idling which on top of being a security hazard would cost a fortune in wasted gas.

For those who don’t drive an electric car at home renting an EV can function as a non-committal way to see what they’re all about. Dealership test drives are fleeting at best but renting for a few days or weeks means you get to grips with the car without having to risk paying tens of thousands of dollars on a car you might hate.

For existing EV owners it means you don’t have to readjust to driving a gas-powered car. Plus you may be able to check out all the hi-tech features your own car doesn’t have — like Autopilot.

What are the cons to renting an electric car?

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

The main issue with renting an EV is the charging situation or more specifically the time investment. At home the majority of electric car charging is done overnight but if you’re staying in a hotel or Airbnb that might not be an option. Chargers aren’t hard to find but they do take time to fill up a car's battery — even at the highest voltage. Gasoline while pricey and polluting still only takes a few minutes to pump.

The other problem is the cost factor. If you’re on a budget and need to rent the cheapest car possible then an electric car might prove too expensive — especially if it’s a Tesla. Then again rental services that offer cheaper electric cars maybe be more within your budget.

Renting a Nissan Leaf from Enterprise at JFK Airport in late August costs $526.71 a week — the second-lowest weekly rate. That rate is the same price you’d pay to rent a Toyota Corolla and $7 more than the cost of renting a Mitsubishi Mirage or Nissan Versa. More expensive options range from $535.28 a week (Nissan Kicks) all the way up to $964.77 a week (Chrysler Pacifica).

However it’s worth noting that the Leaf’s range can be as low as 149 miles which would explain why it’s at the cheaper end of the spectrum.

Renting a Tesla Model Y in Orlando from Hertz at the same time costs $565.84 while the cheapest gas car (Volkswagen Jetta) is $490.11 — a difference of $75.73. The most expensive car on offer at this time is the GMC Yukon for $1420.88. So even the premium electric cars aren’t extortionately overpriced.

Should you rent an EV for your next vacation?

(Image credit: Rob Clymo/Tom's Guide)

Answering the question of whether you should rent an electric car on your next vacation is only something you can answer.

There are a great many advantages to renting an EV but they all hinge on whether running an EV for the duration of your vacation is both possible and practical. After all you can’t rent an electric car if none are available nor should you attempt it if there’s no way for you to recharge.

But if you do have the opportunity to rent an electric car that fits in with your vacation plans then you should go right ahead. Not only will you not have to worry about the price of gas you’ll have the opportunity to drive something you may not have at home. Or if you do then you'll be ready to go without much of a learning curve of adjusting to a new car.

It's not clear how often consumers confront this dreaded scenario. When it happens patient advocates say you shouldn't always accept the health plan's coverage denial as the final word.

They recommend asking insurers and health care providers two questions: Why is the service not being covered? And can the decision be reversed?

If this yields unsatisfactory answers there are more options including filing a formal appeal calling regulators and asking employers to intervene if it's for job-based coverage.

""I think step one is to try and see informally if you can fix it"" said Karen Pollitz co-director of the Program on Patient and Consumer Protections at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""When a problem does arise I usually pick up the phone — I wait on hold for however much hold music they can play for me — and I ask if they can reconsider.""

In July the California-based foundation published an annual report that's one of the more prominent — albeit limited — assessments of coverage denials in health insurance.

Using 2020 data from health plans sold on the federal government's HealthCare.gov marketplace researchers calculated that insurers denied an average of about 18% of in-network claims that year. Denial rates varied substantially across insurers from a low of 1% to a high of more than 80%.

The Kaiser report only looked at denials in coverage sold to individuals which is estimated at less than 6% of the U.S. population. The federal marketplace data meanwhile covers enrollees in just 33 states — a group that doesn't include Minnesota.

""The denial rate that is reported for marketplace plans strikes me as substantial"" Pollitz said. ""We don't have any kind of baseline comparison like [the] rate in employer-sponsored coverage which is what most people have.""

Why some claims are denied

The rates however don't reflect whether the claims ultimately end up getting paid said Kristine Grow a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans a trade group for health insurers. Denials can happen because health care providers didn't provide sufficient information the claim lacked prior authorization or a referral or a particular service is excluded from coverage said Lucas Nesse chief executive of the Minnesota Council of Health Plans a trade group for the state's nonprofit insurers.

""Denials commonly result in delays in payments to providers and sometimes require doctors to resubmit claims"" Nesse said in a statement.

Yet there is a subset of denials in which patients are financially responsible for huge medical bills said Jonathon Hess chief executive of Athos Health. Neither health care providers nor insurers publicly report information on these denials Hess said which makes it impossible for outsiders to know exactly how many people are left confronting tens of thousands of dollars in uncovered costs.

That's why Cancer Legal Care an Oakdale-based nonprofit that provides free legal services to Minnesotans with cancer launched a program a few years ago to help oncology patients seek reversals when health plans deny coverage.

Since 2020 the program helped 31 patients win coverage for about $1.8 million worth of care.

""Their denials were for a wide variety of reasons and our clients and their providers were unsuccessful in getting the denials overturned"" said Bill Foley a health insurance advocate with Cancer Legal Care. The nonprofit group ""made a commitment to this by hiring a couple uniquely qualified attorneys to help develop and manage the program.""

Where to start if denied

Not every medical service is going to be covered Foley said. But patients who review their health plan contract language and think coverage was erroneously denied have options for disputing it.

Even before an appeal patients should talk to their health plan and health care providers to see if there might be a way to get the situation resolved since denials can stem from billing errors that can be fixed.

Insurers have a process for internal and then external appeals. To make their case consumers should obtain and review health plan materials that spell out the details of their coverage Foley said. These are detailed documents that routinely exceed 100 pages in length he noted not the benefit summaries spanning just a few pages that enrollees usually see.

""If you keep running into dead ends you need someone who can advocate for you"" Foley said. ""Your CFO placing a call to the insurer or your benefits manager placing a phone call to the broker who signed your company up with the insurer — those aren't the first places to go but they may be able to get your claim reviewed by a higher level executive at the health plan.""

What if an internal appeal fails?

After trying an internal appeal with the insurer people with fully insured health plans can seek external appeals by submitting a request to the Minnesota Department of Commerce or submitting it to the Minnesota Department of Health. Some employer plans are regulated by the federal government.

The state Commerce Department has staff to help consumers determine which agency regulates their health plan and therefore should field their concern said Julia Dreier deputy commissioner for the department's insurance division.

Federal data suggest that relatively few people try formal appeals in response to denied claims said Amy Monahan an expert in employee benefits law at the University of Minnesota. That's potentially a missed opportunity for people with fully insured health plans in Minnesota Monahan said because state court rules here for external appeals are more consumer-friendly than in other states.

Why coverage may differ

With fully insured plans insurers take the financial risk for the cost of claims. While individuals as well as many small to midsize businesses buy fully insured coverage many employers — particularly large multistate companies — run self-insured plans regulated by the federal government.

Increasingly health insurers are adopting guidance documents that specify the circumstances in which they will provide coverage for emerging and expensive treatments Monahan said. This ""rulification of medical necessity"" she said is a growing problem for patients because they're forced to argue ""about whether you satisfy the list not about whether this is an appropriate medical treatment.""

""You really want to make sure you see that document … because it's going to tell you the basis on which the insurer is evaluating your claim"" Monahan said. She added: ""There aren't any great comprehensive sources that I'm aware of that tell you on average the percentage of medical claims that are denied.""

How Minnesota insurers stack up

The Kaiser Family Foundation report found Bloomington-based Bright Health had denial rates above 18% on individual market coverage in six of eight states where it operated during 2020. The insurer did not respond to questions on the findings.

Minnetonka-based Medica had above-average denials for its individual market business in Kansas Missouri and Oklahoma Kaiser reported.

Using the foundation's methodology the Star Tribune looked at regulatory filings for Minnesota carriers in the individual market and found they were less likely to deny claims in 2020. The lowest rate was 6.4% at Bloomington-based HealthPartners according to the Star Tribune review while the high was 15.5% at Medica.

The insurers said they could not verify the Star Tribune's calculations.

In general Medica said it wouldn't be surprising if the insurer's denial rate was lower in Minnesota than in other states because health care providers here have worked with the nonprofit health plan for many years. Through experience doctors and hospitals learn Medica's rules for submitting a bill the insurer says and when an authorization or referral is required.

""In states where we are developing relationships with providers we do see more denials for incorrect or incomplete billing missing referrals or for out-of-network services"" Medica said in a statement. ""Not every denial is a clinical decision. Many if not most are administrative.""

At HealthPartners officials said they work proactively with members and health care providers to avoid unexpected denials which in 2021 resulted in a claim denial rate of 3.5% for all individual market health plans. A chunk of HealthPartners subscribers receive care from hospitals and clinics that are owned by the nonprofit insurer.

""Contracted providers and health plans operate with contracts and administrative policies"" the insurer said in a statement. ""If a contracted provider's claim is denied for coding or submission problems the provider can't seek full payment from their patient. Claims denied for other reasons can be billed to the patient.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

1. What is the biggest issue facing your district and what would you do about it?

Hawaii is at a crisis point in our history with high cost of living lack of affordable housing grueling traffic rising crime a shortage of good jobs and low wages food insecurity aging and insufficient infrastructure increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters rising sea levels and a public educational system desperately in need of improvement. The foundation for solutions to all of these problems is adequate affordable housing for Hawaii’s families.

Hawaii’s average home price is over $1 million and our kamaaina families are being pushed out. I will work toward a Hawaii where those born and raised or who have grown roots here can live and thrive for this generation and the next.

Our state and counties must work together to ensure zoning regulations help support development for residential housing. We need streamlined regulation subsidized affordable housing development through leveraging state land including fully funding DHHL as a critical part of our statewide affordable housing solution and housing our people in public affordable rental housing. We need to contemplate innovative revenue generation opportunities including potential green taxes to create more funding. We need to find creative ways to provide direct assistance to Hawaii’s struggling families.

2. Many people have talked about diversifying the local economy for many years now and yet Hawai‘i is still heavily reliant on tourism. What if anything should be done differently about tourism and the economy?

If we invest in our aina and our people first everything else will follow. I support the Hawaii Tourism Authority’s movement to huliau or transform toward a kamaaina-driven visitor model focused on bringing the right visitors that are respectful and mindful of their impact on the local community.

We need policies that shift us closer toward sustainable tourism. Hawaii needs to encourage tourism which is place-based and culturally sensitive that provides distinct experiences that are only found in Hawaii like farm ranch brewery and vineyard-to-table restaurants and arts and crafts that are produced and manufactured in Hawaii as well as an emphasis on providing high quality public facilities for recreation of visitors and locals alike.

Economically we need to improve Hawaii through investing in history’s greatest economic drivers – home construction agriculture education and firm and renewable energy. I support creativity and innovation. Our communities have ancestral wisdom and are skilled with formal education street smarts and ingenuity. I can see innovative policies that address food security by supporting vertical farming to maximize growing crops in vertically stacked layers on our scarce land base as a part of that solution as well as potentially exporting specialty crops using the empty freight hulls of our airplanes.

3. An estimated 60% of Hawai‘i residents are struggling to get by a problem that reaches far beyond low income and into the middle class which is disappearing. What ideas do you have to help the middle class and working families who are finding it hard to continue to live here?

The Legislature should look at establishing a true living wage and paid family leave; truly universal health care; tax reform to balance the burden for those most at risk and proactively improving our public resource management to make the state more efficient.

The state has a strong foundation of programs and laws supporting families but in the current economic environment in Hawaii the Hawaii Temporary Disability Insurance Law Hawaii Family Leave Law Hawaii Prepaid Healthcare Act and Hawaii Kupuna Caregivers Act are not enough. We must find new policy solutions that work well for our island home.

We need increased revenue and that means increasing taxes and developing more efficient systems by which we deploy taxpayer dollars. I support tax reform where local families’ taxes are decreased and taxes are increased on the wealthy and tourists to ensure that they pay their fair share.

Further efficient public resource management starts with a more modern transparent procurement process that is integrated across the various state jurisdictions (like the Department of Education and the University System) as well as the counties.

4. Hawaii has the most lopsided Legislature in the country with only one Republican in the Senate and only four in the House. How would you ensure there is an open exchange of ideas transparency and accountability for decisions? What do you see as the consequences of one-party control and how would you address that?

While Hawaii’s Legislature is certainly lopsided on its face the legislative paralysis on major legislation over the last decade has clearly shown that there is healthy disagreement and factionalism within each chamber of the Legislature and between the Legislature the courts and the governor. These disagreements provide a lot of opportunity for different voices to be heard and diverse solutions to be proposed.

That said the consequence of single-party control is that those voices all still approach Hawaii’s problems from a relatively similar playbook of potential policy solutions. This narrows the range of potential ideas and solutions considered by the legislature for any specific problem.

One solution to this issue is for the Legislature to engage in further solicitation of public and expert ideas to expand the horizons of what is possible in Hawaii especially during the early parts of the legislative session before legislation is introduced. It will be interesting to see if this year’s legislative redistricting will change the balance between the two parties.

5. Hawaii is the only Western state without a statewide citizens initiative process. Do you support such a process?

Since the U.S. Supreme Court has defined money as free speech I do not believe that a citizens initiative process in today’s day and age would be truly democratic because of unfettered corporate and out-of-state funding. We have seen this play out in California where millions of dollars are dished out in initiative campaigns. Unless we can guarantee the equitable distribution of initiative information to our fellow citizens the wealthy and powerful will always have an advantage in getting their message across and will interfere with local democracy.

If we move forward with a citizens initiative process I would support the creation of a Citizens Initiative Review Commission. We can model after best practices from other states including Oregon where the commission is made up of a random sampling of fellow citizens similar to a jury and listens to panels of experts on the pros and cons of the initiative working in a nonpartisan manner to help voters understand the initiative by crafting an informational brief in plain language for voters.

6. Thanks to their campaign war chests and name familiarity incumbents are almost always re-elected in Hawaii legislative races. Should there be term limits for state legislators as there are for the governor’s office and county councils? Why or why not?

I can understand why people are calling for term limits given government corruption; lack of legislative transparency; and the mounting problems our island home faces. To address these concerns I would support anti-corruption measures including banning donations during legislative sessions championing initiatives to foster a more educated and engaged citizenry expanding public financing for candidates and limiting carryover funds between elections.

I believe that legislators should work full-time instead of part-time to reduce conflicts of interest and focus on the job of governing while being more available to their constituents. Everyone across the state should have a living wage – including lawmakers. One job should be enough to live in Hawaii. Constituents should be able to expect their legislators to focus on the public good and not be beholden to any special interest group because of their need to survive the high cost of living and campaigning in Hawaii. This would allow regular working people the opportunity to serve as a legislator without expecting them to have to make undue personal and financial sacrifices to be a public servant. An informed electorate will be able to “term limit” any legislator at the polls every election.

7. Hawaii has recently experienced a number of prominent corruption scandals prompting the state House of Representatives to appoint a commission tasked with improving government transparency through ethics and lobbying reforms. What will you do to ensure accountability at the Legislature? Are you open to ideas such as requiring the Sunshine Law and open records laws to apply to the Legislature or banning campaign contributions during session?

We should strive to have a system where there is no link between how a legislator votes and financial campaign donations to that legislator where each legislator is free to make decisions for the common good. I fully support efforts to stem corruption and the appearance of corruption in the state Legislature. I support prohibiting legislators from accepting campaign contributions while in session.

This could be done by adopting rules that restrict legislators from soliciting or accepting campaign contributions during the legislative session fully funding the Hawaii Ethics Commission so that it can investigate all disclosures of financial conflicts of interest adopting rules that no bill shall be deferred indefinitely without a recorded vote by the members of a committee and requiring that if a majority of legislators sign on to a bill then that bill should get at least one hearing. State legislators should be focused on doing the people’s work not on fundraising.

8. How would you make the Legislature more transparent and accessible to the public? Opening conference committees to the public? Stricter disclosure requirements on lobbying and lobbyists? How could the Legislature change its own internal rules to be more open?

I support legislative procedures that allow the public to hold legislators accountable and to increase legislative transparency. I would expand the Supreme Court’s ban on “gut and replace” limit the use of conference committee hearings and increase the length of the legislative session.

I also support stricter disclosure requirements on lobbying. Especially with the relatively low amount of money spent on political races in Hawaii compared to other states it is important to know exactly where the money for any particular candidate is coming from. Many times only a few donations can constitute a significant part of a candidate’s war chest and these donations provide clear impetus for legislators to feel beholden to their supporting interests.

The more clearly those interests are disclosed the more voters can hold their candidates accountable for the money they receive and the votes they make.

9. Hawaii has seen a growing division when it comes to politics development health mandates and other issues. What would you do to bridge those gaps and bring people together in spite of their differences?

We need to find common ground and practice civility and aloha as we determine the best path toward the common good. We should strive for win-win solutions where we find a workable compromise.

As the islands become increasingly unaffordable and middle class kamaaina families and younger Hawaii citizens move away the inequality gap in the state grows. In our system “haves” will always have a louder voice than the “have-nots” – just look at the way current homeowners advocate against accessible affordable low- and middle-class housing across the state. Our increasing average population age creates a similar phenomenon exacerbating our “brain drain” and “culture drain” and discouraging innovative solutions to our problems.

By focusing on our commonalities envisioning what a flourishing Hawaii might look like and remembering that we are all paddling in the same canoe will we be able to leave Hawaii better for the next generation.

The affordable housing family leave tax public administration tourism and economic revitalization proposals I discussed above are all specific attempts to address and reverse these major demographic shifts. Only by bringing our families home will the islands heal these growing divides.

10. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed numerous flaws in Hawaii’s structure and systems from outdated technology to economic disparity. If you could take this moment to reinvent Hawaii to build on what we’ve learned and create a better state a better way of doing things what would you do? Please share One Big Idea you have for Hawaii. Be innovative but be specific.

The pandemic has shown us how vulnerable our island home is. We are at a crossroads filled with challenges and I believe our communities are ready to face them and turn them into opportunities.

Let’s address our food security and disaster preparedness; expand our shoreline parks and protect our watersheds; repair and reposition our highways bridges roads and utilities; finish Honolulu Rail to Ala Moana and expand it out to UH Manoa and to West Kapolei; establish truly universal health care; create a Tax Reform task force to design a fairer tax code where local families’ burdens are lessened and the wealthy and tourist pay their fair share; ensure our keiki get the best public education possible; diversify our economy including shifting our visitor industry toward regenerative tourism in which our visitors kamaaina and aina mutually benefit; and fund OHA and DHHL because it’s the state’s kuleana and also a part of any statewide solution for affordable housing.

Only One Big Idea? Let’s prioritize housing our local families through developing public rentals and rent-to-own and fee-units with residency and resale stipulations that keep them from turning into more investment properties. Let’s build a better Hawaii through caring for our people.

This post will go through the remaining responses which include King County Prosecutor Washington Congressional District 9 and the Legislative Districts (LDs) in the Eastside and North Sound. We’ve already gone through responses in LD34 LD36 LD37 and LD46 and the South Sound.

The impact of newly-drawn district boundaries is mixing things up in some races. Republicans are hoping to regain control of the state legislature but recent polling shows they are struggling to connect with Washingtonians. The red wave might not be coming but it all depends on what happens between now and November.

The Primary Election ends August 2nd so do not forget to get your ballot in. Our endorsements are detailed here or a cheatsheet is below. We also encourage you to connect with your favored campaigns to help push them over the top to success.

The Urbanist Election Committee’s 2022 Primary endorsements. (The Urbanist)

Below you will find questionnaires responses for King County Prosecutor Leesa Manion Congressional District 9 candidates Adam Smith and Stephanie Gallardo Sen. Patty Kuderer Rep. Amy Walen Sen. Manka Dhingra Rep. Davina Duerr Rep. Cindy Ryu Rep. Strom Peterson Sen. John Lovick Rep. Brandy Donaghy and Richard May who is one of four candidates vying for an open seat in LD42.

The new LD48 following 2022 redistricting. (WA Redistricting Commission)

Sen. Kuderer and Rep. Walen represent the 48th District and each succeeded in winning us over. Kuderer faces one Republican and Walen and seatmate Vandana Slatter (who didn’t return a questionnaire) are running unopposed. The 48th District lost a chunk of Kirkland Redmond and east Bellevue but added a chunk of northwestern Bellevue. It should remain a Democratic stronghold.

The new 45th LD after 2022 redistricting. (WA Redistricting Commission)

Sen. Manka Dhingra represents the 45th District and faces one Republican challenger. She earned our endorsement with her responses. Neither Rep. Roger Goodman nor Rep. Larry Springer returned a questionnaire nor do they face any challengers from the Democratic side. LD45 picked up small chunks of Kirkland and Redmond but it lost some of Woodinville Duvall and Sammamish.

The new LD1 changed significantly in 2022 redistricting. (WA Redistricting Commission)

Rep. Davina Duerr (D – Bothell) represents the 1st District which changed significantly in redistricting. LD1 gained Lake Forest Park Kenmore Woodinville and some unincorporated outskirts of Lynnwood but it lost Mountlake Terrace North Creek and Maltby — the latter two are sprawling unincorporated communities in Snohomish County. Rep. Duerr and seatmate Shelley Kloba each face one Republican neither of much standing. The Urbanist Elections Committee was happy to endorse Duerr for her excellent housing and climate activism spearheading the HB 1099 effort to add climate into the Growth Management Act which died on the goal line but should be back.

LD32 after 2022 redistricting. (WA Redistricting Commission)

Rep. Cindy Ryu represents the 32nd District which didn’t change a ton in redistricting but did pick up Mountlake Terrace and lose some unincorporated outskirts of Lynnwood and Edmonds. Her responses and interview garnered our endorsement. Her seatmate Rep. Lauren Davis didn’t return a questionnaire. Each face one independent challenger neither of whom are showing fundraising totals yet.

LD21 after 2022 redistricting. (WA Redistricting Commission)

Rep. Strom Peterson represents the 21st District and we saw enough in his brief questionnaire responses to endorse his campaign. His seatmate Lillian Ortiz-Self (D) did not return a questionnaire nor did Sen. Marko Liias who chairs the Senate Transportation Committee. Peterson and Ortiz-Self each have Republican opponents none of who have raised much money but Liias is facing a well-funded challenge from Republican Janelle Cass an Edmonds business owner. In redistricting the 21st saw minor changes including picking up more of Edmonds and southwest Everett while losing some territory to the east. It’s still be very much a longshot for Republicans to win here.

Sen. John Lovick and Rep. Brandy Donaghy represent the 44th District and each won our endorsement with their questionnaire responses. Rep. April Berg (D) who didn’t return a questionnaire is also seeking a second term and like Donaghy faces a Republican challenger. Lovick faces three Republicans. The district shifted to the south in districting. Gone is Lake Stevens and Three Lakes. In its place are North Creek Maltby Cathcart and Silver Lake. The district should remain a Democratic leaner.

The 42nd District is one of the swing districts that will determine control of the state legislature. Rep. Sharon Shewmake (D) won a very tight race last time around and is seeking to move up to the State Senate where Trump minion Doug Erickson passed away from Covid in late 2021 leaving the district without a true incumbent. The Whatcom County Council appointed Republican Simon Sefzik to fill the seat for the remainder of Erickson’s term and Sefzik is seeking reelection but it has a Republican challenger in Ben Elenbaas. A Democratic pickup here would all but doom Republican hopes of taking the Senate.

Shewmake’s Senate run has opened up her House seat and two Democrats and two Republicans are in the running to replace her. The Urbanist received a questionnaire from Blaine City Councilmember Richard May and interviewed him too but ultimately opted not to endorse in this race. The other Democrat is Joe Timmons of Bellingham who works in the Inslee Administration. We may revisit our decision in the General. Democrat Alicia Rule is seeking reelection and is being targeted by two Republican candidates. LD42 didn’t change much in redistricting.

Leesa Manion: 2022 Urbanist Questionnaire Responses – King County Prosecutor

What is the role of the prosecutor’s office in an ideal world? What is it in practice?

In an ideal world the Prosecutor’s Office and its employees are committed to promoting a justice system grounded in fairness equity and compassion. This includes applying applicable law to criminal cases in a fair and transparent manner that respects human dignity protects constitutional rights and earns and maintains the trust of the communities it serves. In practice this means:

*Exercising prosecutorial discretion with humility and restraint in a manner that advances racial equity and justice for victims families and the accused;

*Openly sharing written filing and disposition standards with defense law enforcement and the public;

*Using data to actively identify and address disparities in the criminal legal system;

*Learning our Country’s true history and dismantling systemic racism and other forms of oppression within the criminal legal system;

*Inviting our communities’ participation in crafting and implementing restorative justice practices to effectively address harm and the root causes of crime;

*Offering culturally responsive and restorative services to victims and survivors.

By what process would you determine which criminal cases to prosecute?

With every contact with the public the accused law enforcement and victims and their families prosecutors and staff have an opportunity to build confidence in our justice system. The consistent application of criminal law is an important part of this work. I support these policies and practices:

*Publishing case filing and disposition criteria/standards to demonstrate neutrality and fairness in our decision-making;

*Maintaining convervative filing practices;

*Offering fair and appropriate case dispositions and promptly sharing evidence and discovery with defense and the accused;

*Protecting against bias in charging decisions by requiring regular training for deputies and staff on implicit bias and using checklists and other equity screening tools to ensure neutrality and fairness in our decision-making;

*Identifying nonviolent crimes that are more effectively addressed with diversion to community-based resources to increase access to the services that address root causes of crime and offer opportunities to lift individuals out of crisis and poor decision-making.

What is the cause of crime and what is the prosecutor’s role to address that?

Inequity is the cause of crime — poverty inequitable access to healthcare substance use mental health or other treatment racial discrimination inequitable employment and educational opportunities too few protective factors — all of these root causes of crime are rooted in inequity.



In order to effectively prevent crime and victimization we must build a society that supports the well-being of everyone. Prosecutors must expand their roles beyond the criminal legal system and partner with our communities to transform underlying conditions of inequity rather than focus solely on the symptoms (i.e. crime). Our ultimate goal should be to prevent crime and victimization from occurring in the first place by ensuring an equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. This will lead to significant reductions in social problems and challenges including crime.



Prosecutors must also utilize therapeutic alternatives including diversion and treatment courts to address root causes for those already entangled in the criminal legal system.

How would you define “progressive prosecutor” and would you identify as such? If so what policies would you implement in that vein? If not how do you identify your prosecutorial style and what does that look like in terms of your policies?

A progressive prosecutor seeks to remove racial inequity and other forms of oppression from our criminal legal system and exercises discretion in a fair and transparent manner that respects human dignity protects constitutional rights and maintains the trust of the communities they serve.



As someone who identifies as a progressive prosecutor I have taken action to dismantle racial inequities by initiating these reforms:

*Mandatory implicit bias training for all employees to promote impartial decision-making;

*Mandatory cultural competency training for employees to increase racial understanding;

*Office viewing and discussion of Ava DuVernay’s documentary “13th”;

*Office viewing and discussion of “Race: The Power of An Illusion”;

*Reviewed “Three Strike” cases and successfully supported 17 clemency petitions that ended life sentences and led to the removal of “Robbery 2” as a strike offense (which disproportionately impacts Black men) and the passage of SB 6164 which allows prosecutors to review and shorten prior sentences to advance equity.

The Washington Supreme Court recently overturned our state’s felony drug possession statute in State v. Blake197 Wn.2d 170 481 P.3d 521 (2021) requiring many convictions to be vacated as well as entitling many people to resentencing due to facially unconstitutional offender scores. What should the prosecutor’s role in helping to correct these errors be?

Long before the Washington Supreme Court issued its decision in State v. Blake I successfully secured funding to double the capacity of the Prosecuting Attorney’s Office’s (PAO’s) Post Conviction Unit (PCU) so that the PAO could proactively assist individuals seeking to vacate convictions and/or restore rights for all eligible crimes not just drug possession. The PCU also partnered with community nonprofits like the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle and legal organizations like the King County Bar Association to build and carry out a public awareness campaign and to enlist additional support/capacity from pro bono attorneys.

Post Blake I increased PCU’s staffing level to expedite and streamline vacating convictions recalculate sentences and note hearings to release eligible individuals as the result of Blake. I believe this important and corrective work is an essential part of the PAO’s mission and that post conviction assistance in all cases should be offered to all individuals who seek it.

Given that time in jail — let alone prison — can lead to defendants losing their jobs homes or parental rights even a short time behind bars or a minimal criminal record can destabilize families and their communities. Historically and presently this has been especially true for communities of color with devastating consequences. Does a prosecutor have a duty to respond to the systemic targeting of communities of color by policing and prosecution? If so how would you put that into practice?

Prosecutors have an absolute duty to respond to and end disparities in all parts of the criminal legal system. Our country’s history of racism and oppression manifests in the criminal legal system and serves to perpetuate the disparate treatment of BIPOC. These disparities can be insidious and covert even in the enforcement of seemingly race-neutral laws. In order to address these disparities police and prosecutors must guard against bias in all stages of decision-making. This includes training employees to combat bias and implicit bias to understand and dismantle systemic racism to use checklists and other equity screening tools to promote fair and impartial decision-making. Police and prosecutors must also collect and review data to identify disparities and proactively share this information with the public.

How would you describe the current relationship between the police/sheriff’s department and the prosecutor’s office? What is your ideal relationship between the offices and how will you make that a reality? If the police department chooses a policy you disagree with will you exercise your right not to prosecute those cases?

The PAO’s relationship with law enforcement is generally strong but frayed with some departments over juvenile justice issues. I have personally met with police chiefs and officers to mend relationships increase understanding and identify shared goals for addressing juvenile crime.

Ideally the office’s relationship with law enforcement is one of mutual respect and understanding even when we disagree. I will attend our monthly police chiefs/sheriffs’ meeting (unlike my predecessor/boss). I will be there to build relationships to be accountable and to build allyship. If law enforcement disagrees with my filing decisions I will meet in order to discuss their concerns answer questions and walk through my decision-making process.

I intentionally declined to seek endorsements from police guilds. I successfully fought for resources to create a new Public Integrity Unit to review use of force cases after I-940. This review would not appear fair and unbiased if I am endorsed by police guilds.

Would your office prosecute a homeless person arrested for sleeping on public transit in the light rail station or elsewhere in public? What will your policy be about responding to arrests of people whose criminal behavior clearly stems from poverty?

I would not prosecute a homeless person for sleeping on public transit or in any public space. I believe that individuals who are struggling with homelessness and poverty are deserving of housing services and opportunities that serve to address the root cause(s) of criminal behavior by working to lift the person out of homelessness and poverty. Services should be low barrier widespread and easy to access and culturally sensitive and responsive. And as leaders we must ensure that we are honest about the size of the needs in our communities and find sustainable funding and resources to adequately meet those needs.

What role should money bail play in our system?

In King County judges must follow Court Rule 3.2 which provides a presumption of release in noncapital cases. The elimination of cash bail can have the unintended consequence of limiting judges to a binary choice of either release or detention. Given an “either or” approach many judges may choose to hold an individual in jail out of an abundance of caution in order to protect public safety. I am a strong advocate for effective alternatives to detention that serve to protect public safety offer services to address the root causes of crime and ensure the individual’s return to court if released. I also support the use of technology to remind individuals of court dates and the continued use of video hearings as a way to ensure compliance with court dates and to avoid the issuance of bench warrants. I also support the continued practice of reasonable bail standards/guidance within the Prosecutor’s Office.

What is the role of alternative courts and diversion programs? What strategies are appropriate to ensure access to these opportunities are equitable?

Diversion works. I believe in the power of community-based programs as our best upstream crime prevention strategy. Community and prosecutors can work together to divert non-violent cases out of the criminal legal system. We can also address youth violence by strengthening pro-social norms and protective factors in youth and decreasing risk factors. These efforts are data-driven. Research shows that connecting youth to structure and opportunities such as employment job mentorship and training educational supports and behavioral interventions can improve youth well-being and reduce violence.

Within the criminal justice system I am a strong proponent of using therapeutic alternatives such as LEAD Drug Court Mental Health Court and Veterans’ Court to connect individuals who find themselves entangled in the justice system to important services that address root causes. Eligibility criteria should be drafted and reviewed with an equity lens to ensure access to alternatives are equitable and low/no barrier.

Stephanie Gallardo: 2022 Urbanist Questionnaire Responses – WA 09

What is your top priority for the upcoming term and how will you achieve it?

My top priority for the upcoming term is writing legislation that funds public schools at a level we have yet to see in our lifetime. This

bill will include free Pre-K for all full funding for our humanities tuition free college and a number of progressive legislative priorities

that center education. As a National Education Association Board Director and highschool teacher I have experienced firsthand the

destructive nature of underfunding our schools and neglecting our children’s education. As I state on my Education Justice platform

our federal government must prioritize the funding of public schools at a level that has never been attempted.

I am a vigorous supporter of Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s Green New Deal for Public Schools (GND4PS) Act. People who have followed my

campaign know from day one that I will co-sponsor the Green New Deal for Public Schools and put forward my own legislation to

further education funding for our public schools.

What can Congress do right now to alleviate the housing crisis? Are you open to expanding public housing stock? Funding social housing? Fully funding the Housing Choice Voucher program? Renters tax credits? Why or why not? If not what would you recommend to support rent-burdened Americans?

Congress must pass federal tenant protections that prevent price gouging wrongful evictions and housing monopolies. Equally

Congress must preserve existing housing stock as well as expand it. I support House Our Neighbor’s Initiative 135 which creates

funding for social housing here in Seattle. This initiative should be the model for national funding for social housing. I also support

fully funding the Housing Choice Voucher program to protect low-income families and individuals. Nationalizing renters tax credits is

a top priority of my domestic platform and is legislation I pledge to support in Congress.

Of course we need to do more. In my capacity as your congressional representative I will advocate for the highest possible support

for rent-burned Americans and champion these legislative priorities to address the housing crisis.

A year and a half of Democratic control of Congress hasn’t converted to much landmark legislation passed or progress on pressing issues. If (re)elected what will you do to change this?

My agenda for landmark legislation is wide progressive and rooted in community. In terms of what landmark legislation I support my

campaign has openly pledged our commitment to Educational Justice (GND4PS) Universal Healthcare (M4A) Climate Justice (GND)

expanding Labor Power (PRO ACT) and a plethora of legislative priorities that we must pass into law in order to uplift this district and

by extension the nation.

Unfortunately many of these priorities cannot be funded unless we cut the bloated military budget. I will also pledge to join the

Defense Spending Reduction Caucus started by representatives Barbara Lee and Mark Pocan and work towards a massive cut in the

pentagon’s budget.

If I am elected I will leverage the full power of my office the voices here in my district and progressives in congress to press these

issues to the forefront of our nation’s attention. I plan to join the other progressive lawmakers in congress in immensely pressuring

the establishment to pass our ambitious agenda. However I am prepared to work with Republicans to pass landmark educational

legislation so long as that work didn’t entail sending any funding to charter schools.

Will you work to enshrine reproductive healthcare access legislatively? What will your strategy be?

The assault on reproductive rights while serious and urgent is part of a larger attack on our civil rights and liberties. In this case the

Democratic party has failed to legislate reproductive rights into federal law even though on multiple occasions they have had large

majorities in Congress including a filibuster-proof majority when Barack Obama was sworn in.

Reproductive rights must be treated as an urgent healthcare matter and not just a fundraising “hook” for Democrats. This requires

elected officials who are willing to hold their own leadership accountable when they fail to legislate and when they campaign for anti-choice members of their own party like they did recently in the Texas runoff between Henry Cuellar and Jessica Cisneros.

Since my campaign is not beholden to the Democratic Party machine I will be in a position to fight harder than the party is willing to

fight and to push even my own party to act with the urgency that this moment requires.

The conservative movement has orchestrated a takeover of the Supreme Court and many of the lower courts installing in key positions partisans willing to legislate from the bench. What do you aim to do about it? How can we prevent

judicial overreach?

Since the House of Representatives has minimal power over the judiciary I will answer with an analysis of why this country is lurching

further to the right with every election.

“Vote blue no matter who” has been a tactic that has clearly failed us. Every time we are told that we just need more Democrats and

then they will fix everything even as they control the White House and both chambers of Congress. In 1992 Bill Clinton came to power

with Democrats in charge of both houses of Congress. He passed NAFTA and faced a right wing backlash in 1994. In 2008 Barack

Obama came to power with a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. He bailed out the banks and not the homeowners and two years

later lost his majority in Congress. The right-wing appeal to many working class Americans can only be reversed when there is a

progressive alternative that will materially improve their lives.

Something representatives can do is put forth support for efforts to reverse the conservative takeover of the Supreme Court. I plan to

take a hard stance against these partisan actors and cosponsor the Judiciary Act of 2021 to expand the court to 13 seats.

With the raging Covid pandemic and threat of long Covid Americans are facing greatly increased healthcare needs and

costs. How should the government ensure those needs are met? Do you support universal health care? If so how

would you achieve that?

One major piece of legislation that the government can pass that ensures the financial and healthcare needs of the American people

is universal healthcare AKA Medicare for All. I absolutely support universal healthcare as it is a cornerstone of my platform and a

major legislative priority of mine; if elected to office I will cosponsor Medicare for All put forward by neighboring congressional

representative Pramila Jayapal.

However it is not enough to put your name on a colleague’s legislation and move on. This needs to be a priority for every member of

Congress who signs the legislation. We need to use the platform that is the United States Congress to speak up against the myths

and half-truths that the private insurance and pharmaceutical lobbies put out. We need to convince voters in red blue and purple

districts that Medicare for All is in their personal self-interest.

Furthermore I believe it is a moral imperative that we build on our current progress by expanding stimulus payments started by the

American Rescue Plan pushing for reduced prices for drugs and lifesaving medical procedures and renewing child tax credits.

How would you like to see funding from the infrastructure bill spent? What are the biggest remaining infrastructure

needs? Where does high speed rail rank for you? How about the pedestrian safety crisis?

In a district with areas that are rapidly gentrifying and others left completely underdeveloped it is imperative that we direct funding

from the infrastructure bill to projects that uplift our underserved communities. This means creating vibrant and accessible public

transit infrastructure and subsidies to incentivize more working-class people to use public transit. We also need more affordable housing near public transit. It makes no sense that the majority of housing being built along the Link light rail lines consists of luxury condominiums.

I highly value constructing a national high-speed rail that connects our cities providing an alternative transportation service that

works against climate change exacerbated by our nation’s overuse of gas-powered cars. Cars roads and highway

expansion/construction have been at the center of our pedestrian safety crisis. As your congressperson I will direct federal funding to

create safe walkable transit-accessible and vibrant infrastructure for our pedestrians.

America is a world leader when it comes to climate emissions. How will you fight to ensure America leads the way in

climate action and environmental stewardship? Do you see the Green New Deal as a model to deliver such action? Why

or why not?

I am an outspoken fighter for the Green New Deal (I have taken the GND Champions pledge). I support public renewable power

decarbonization and addressing the biggest polluter on our planet: the U.S. Military. My platform piece titled “Building our Clean

Energy Future” addresses this in great detail. The federal government must play a bigger role since the market is clearly failing to

provide renewable energy fast enough for the scale of the need. Our nation needs an expanded renewable power generation system. It

is called a “Green New Deal” to evoke 1930s and WWII levels of Federal spending which for a period exceeded 40% of GNP. We need a

federal investment of 5% of GDP for a decade.

We’ve done this before through the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority as part of the original New Deal and on a smaller

scale for wastewater systems in the 1970s through EPA’s Construction Grants program under the Clean Water Act. The United States

can afford a $780 billion defense budget and yet we can’t “afford” to defend against climate change? This country needs elected

officials who will shut down business as usual in DC until the climate crisis is addressed.

How can Congress increase public safety and reduce crime? Do you support federal legislation further increasing police funding? How do you balance that with the need to fund violence prevention and diversionary programs social services and other priorities that are often overlooked?

While most policing is under the jurisdiction of local authorities the federal government can play a key role through the provision of

funds and equipment. For starters we must immediately end the Pentagon’s 1033 program that sends “surplus” military equipment to

local police departments. Multiple studies (cited on my campaign platform) demonstrate that such programs result in militarization of

the police and encourage officers to view the public as “the enemy” to be controlled not citizens who need protection.

I support calls by the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund that Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act should cut federal funding to

any local police department that is found to engage in racial discrimination.

Federal tax dollars are a major source of funding for many local police departments. And we have on the books a law that would

require the federal government to cut this funding from police departments that are found to engage in racist policing from

Minneapolis to Seattle.

Although temporary the American Rescue Plan was effective at reducing poverty lifting 12 million Americans out of poverty and cutting child poverty in half. Should we continue or expand such relief? Would you support a guaranteed basic income program to build on this work?

I pledge to support further federal funding for violence prevention and diversionary programs social services and restorative justice

priorities across the board. It is imperative that we approach public safety with a community centered response.

It is a moral imperative that we not only continue but expand on the protections and relief provided by the American Rescue Plan.

Direct stimulus Child Tax Credit and other legislative measures included in the American Rescue Plan that directly uplift working

families must persist especially as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. I vigorously support a guaranteed basic income program to

build on our progress and I am committed to proposing and cosponsoring legislative measures to make it law.

Adam Smith: 2022 Urbanist Questionnaire Responses – WA 09

What is your top priority for the upcoming term and how will you achieve it?

I believe that perhaps the greatest issue of our time is economic insecurity. Middle class wages have not kept up to the cost of living. We have seen an increase in food insecurity housing insecurity etc. We need to ensure that workers receive better wages affordable education and the support they need to make it in this country. On that front I have fought hard to pass legislation such as paid family leave for all federal employees. I have also been working hard to drive federal dollars to our community particularly towards affordable housing. Continuing to work with unions and community organizations to combat economic security will continue to be a priority of mine.

What can Congress do right now to alleviate the housing crisis? Are you open to expanding public housing stock? Funding social housing? Fully funding the Housing Choice Voucher program? Renters tax credits? Why or why not? If not what would you recommend to support rent-burdened Americans?

It is critical that Congress take action to alleviate the housing crisis. That means building more affordable housing units. I have and continue to advocate for significant federal investment that would drastically increase the supply of affordable housing.

Affordable housing and transit are essential to our sustainable development. I was proud to vote in favor of the Build Back Better Act that would make a massive investments in clean energy infrastructure helping put the U.S. on a path to decarbonizing all sectors of the economy.

The Build Back Better Act also included historic investments in housing affordability. My bill the Promoting Affordable Housing Near Transit Act was passed into law last year as part of the FY 2022 NDAA. It establishes a process by which a non-profit organization or other third-party entity can receive a land transfer from a federal transit agency at zero cost for the purposes of a transit-oriented development or affordable housing project. We must be creative about securing affordable and efficient housing in King County and that is why I fought so hard to pass this measure into law.

A year and a half of Democratic control of Congress hasn’t converted to much landmark legislation passed or progress on pressing issues. If (re)elected what will you do to change this?

While Congress has been able to pass important legislation like the American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure bill there is still much more work that needs to be done. I have been a strong supporter of landmark legislation in the House of Representatives. We have managed to pass the PRO Act Women’s Health Protection Act John Lewis Voting Rights Act Bipartisan Background Checks Act etc. While the House has passed this vital legislation they have not been taken up in the Senate. I am a firm believer that it is long past time the Senate does away with the filibuster and passes these bills.

I also think it is essential that Democrats do a better job at rallying public support for our agenda. We need to build a durable progressive majority that can get elected govern effectively and get elected again. I am going to fight to help build this coalition.

Will you work to enshrine reproductive healthcare access legislatively? What will your strategy be?

Yes; I am an original cosponsor of the Women’s Health Protection Act and voted for its passage through the House of Representatives. I believe that a woman has the right to choose what she can and can’t do with her body. Congress must protect this right. I will continue to support and advocate for legislation that will enshrine reproductive health care into law.

The conservative movement has orchestrated a takeover of the Supreme Court and many of the lower courts installing in key positions partisans willing to legislate from the bench. What do you aim to do about it? How can we prevent judicial overreach?

It is crucial that we work to build a durable progressive coalition that can win elections and maintain public support through passing essential legislation. In doing so we can work to shift the balance of the courts over time. Congress must also pass crucial legislation enshrining among others a woman’s right to choose and voting rights into law.

With the raging Covid pandemic and threat of long Covid Americans are facing greatly increased healthcare needs and costs. How should the government ensure those needs are met? Do you support universal health care? If so how would you achieve that?

I am an original cosponsor of the Medicare for All Act. I have been a firm advocate for expanded healthcare throughout my career having voted for the Affordable Care Act expanding coverage to millions of Americans. While that was a crucial step in the right direction there is much more that needs to be done. We need to ensure that everyone has access to quality medical dental and vision care.

Reproductive care is an essential part of this. I am a cosponsor of the Women’s Health Protection Act which would codify the protections of Roe v. Wade and protect a woman’s right to an abortion.

How would you like to see funding from the infrastructure bill spent? What are the biggest remaining infrastructure needs? Where does high speed rail rank for you? How about the pedestrian safety crisis?

I have been a longtime supporter of greater investment in infrastructure provided by a wide range of means–including public/private partnerships–to promote economic growth and responsibly invest in infrastructure that helps to create good jobs spur the economy and provide the needed updates to our roads highways bridges and transit among others. I believe we need to build a robust high speed rail system and ensure that we are building it in a way to ensure the safety of pedestrians. I also think that the investments in broadband access in the bill are crucial.

America is a world leader when it comes to climate emissions. How will you fight to ensure America leads the way in climate action and environmental stewardship? Do you see the Green New Deal as a model to deliver such action? Why or why not?

I am a cosponsor of the Green New Deal and support bold action to combat the climate crisis. I believe that we need to take bold steps to reach carbon neutrality as soon as possible. I support the climate measures in the Build Back Better Act. I also support implementing a carbon tax and using the money gained through that tax to invest in low income neighborhoods across the country.

How can Congress increase public safety and reduce crime? Do you support federal legislation further increasing police funding? How do you balance that with the need to fund violence prevention and diversionary programs social services and other priorities that are often overlooked?

I believe that we need to ensure that police departments have necessary funding while also investing in diversionary programs and police reform. I introduced a bill in the 117th Congress to divert non violent 911 calls to specialized responders and fund community-based public safety programs. By utilizing these community based programs we can reduce violent encounters help restore trust between law enforcement and community members and provide better care for public safety.

Although temporary the American Rescue Plan was effective at reducing poverty lifting 12 million Americans out of poverty and cutting child poverty in half. Should we continue or expand such relief? Would you support a guaranteed basic income program to build on this work?

We should continue to expand on the relief in the American Rescue Plan to provide a strong social safety net for the middle and lower class. I believe that the federal minimum wage should be increased to at least $15 an hour. I also believe that we need to pass many of the provisions in the Build Back Better Act such as the provisions to provide access to childcare. With the cost of childcare continuing to grow our middle class families are being hit hard.

Patty Kuderer: 2022 Urbanist Questionnaire Responses – LD48 Senate

What is your top priority for the upcoming term and how will you achieve it?

Our economy in Washington does not work for everyone and it is my priority as a legislator to reform our tax structure to invest in marginalized communities across the state. We need a tax system where everyone pays their fair share and our tax dollars are invested in programs that we know address systemic income inequality. We need affordable housing accessible early childhood education and strong apprenticeship and other job training programs that will work to dismantle racial and economic disparities. We also need to build on our work to increase access to home ownership for marginalized communities to close the racial wealth gap.

Washington State adopted a “Target Zero” goal of ending traffic deaths by 2030 but fatalities are trending in the wrong direction. What do you propose to rectify this situation?

The key to reducing traffic deaths is to invest in public transportation that gets people out of their cars and to continue investing in a multi-modal system that offers safe alternatives to single occupancy vehicles. I hope that the investments from Move Ahead Washington in trail and bike lane infrastructure as well as in public transit help move us in the right direction.

What is your stance on Rep. Jessica Bateman’s missing middle housing bill (HB 1782) that failed to pass last session and would you support similar legislation to legalize abundant housing statewide? If so what steps will you take to ensure its passage in the upcoming session? If not what policy to promote housing growth and affordability do you support?

I am Chair of the Senate Housing & Local Government Committee and believe housing is a human right. I was a cosponsor of the Senate companion to Rep. Bateman’s bill SB 5670 which we heard and exec’d out of my committee. I have committed to working with Rep. Bateman and stakeholders on passing a bill that establishes a statewide floor that leverages existing infrastructure so we can build more housing faster.

Would you vote for a bill that ends the ban on rent control in Washington? Why or why not? Would you support statewide rent stabilization similar to Oregon?

I supported bills ending the statewide prohibition in the past and believe that local governments should have the authority to enact rent stabilization programs that fit their communities. That said there are other approaches I am open to that may get us to the same place. I am following the public housing initiative in Seattle community land trusts are an option and “rent-to-buy” programs could also be pathways to stabilize rents which now are tied to area median income which is higher here due to the tech industry. Regarding the Oregon model I am still studying the data and it appears some property managers are simply raising the rent the full 7% every year regardless of whether it is actually needed or not and that is unsustainable in my view.

Washington State has ambitious climate goals but isn’t yet on course to meet them. What do you see as the missing pieces?

We have and continue to see the impacts of the climate crisis. First we need to ensure our legislation is based on science and take into consideration the advice and recommendations from respected groups that advocate for our environment every day. Second we need to continually publicize the immediate and direct impacts of climate change on our daily lives and do what we can on societal and individual levels to mitigate these effects. That includes helping to transition carbon workers into green jobs and ensuring that clean energy projects continue to have strong labor standards. Finally the state must continue to lead by example — upgrading to green fleets using green technology in our buildings and innovating to reduce waste. The bottom line is we must reduce carbon emissions and I will continue to support legislation to accomplish that goal.

Under what circumstances if any would you support adding highway lane miles?

When public safety demands that we add another lane and we have the space like repurposing the shoulder into a bus rapid transit lane then it makes sense. It makes more sense however to prioritize mass transit and a multi-modal transportation system.

What reforms of the Growth Management Act do you support if any?

I supported Sen. Short’s bill from last year that permitted the swapping of land that is not developable within the urban growth boundary with an equal size of developable land that is contiguous to the UGA in question. I am open to looking at the GMA but will not undermine the goals or intent of the legislation.

Do you think Washington state should have an income tax (yes/no)? If yes what is the legislative path? If not would you pursue any tax reform?

We need to completely overhaul the broken regressive tax system in our state. I was proud to support the capital gains tax when it came before the legislature and support further tax reforms that relieve the burden on our seniors veterans and working families and like most people I am closely following the lawsuit challenging it as an unconstitutional income tax. A progressive income tax is currently unconstitutional in our state due to a 1930’s Washington Supreme Court decision holding that “income” was “property” and our Constitution says all property must be taxed “at a uniform rate.”

The uniformity clause is regressive punitive and unfair and is a big reason why Washington’s tax structure is rated dead-last. The best way to address this is to amend our Constitution — an admittedly heavy lift that will require significant public support. It is however essential that we amend our state constitution if we want to bring equity and fairness into our tax structure. The tax system is the one that is truly rigged — loopholes for the ultra-wealthy penalties for working people (e.g. earned income is taxed at a higher rate than passive income the wealth accumulated from the growth in stocks/bonds). In the meantime until we make the foundational changes to our laws that enable us to build a truly progressive tax structure I will support reforms that we know are legal that still address our upside-down tax system and ensure the wealthiest among us pay their fair share.

What more should the State be doing to increase mobility for those who cannot drive or chose not to a constituency which composes about a quarter of the population?

Our Move Ahead transportation package drove historic investments in public transit bike and pedestrian infrastructure to increase mobility across our state. We made stark increases in the Safe Routes to Schools projects and other bike and pedestrian infrastructure projects to keep people safe as they move throughout their communities. I was a proud supporter of these increases but I know we must do more to shift away from car-centric development. I support increasing the funding for these necessary projects and will champion them in future transportation budgets.

What approach will you take to promoting public safety?

To keep our communities safe we must enact smart data-driven policies proven to deter crime dole out the appropriate consequences to people who commit crimes and prioritize the needs of survivors of crime. People deserve to know their legislators want them to feel safe and I am committed to supporting effective public safety measures. Crime is up across the United States and the causes of that are varied and complex. Just as there is no single cause there is no single solution. That’s why we need to be smart on crime and target our human and financial resources for the greatest effect.

For example a quarter of all homicides and attempted homicides in King County are committed by men with a prior conviction for domestic abuse. Our response thus far is to remove guns from those convicted of domestic violence and to allow victims to seek civil protection orders in “coercive control” situations a known precursor to physical violence. Gun violence is also up and our country is reeling yet again from another horrific school shooting. I have sponsored and/or co-sponsored common sense gun safety laws every single year I have been in the legislature. My bill to ban assault weapons will be reintroduced next year and it is my sincere hope my fellow colleagues on both sides of the aisle will see we don’t need weapons of war in civil society.

We have seen a rise in cyber harassment and stalking and we passed legislation to give victims more power to stop the behavior early on; and to prevent the tragedies of murdered and missing indigenous people in our state from getting worse we established a Missing Indigenous Person alert system. Finally for catalytic converter theft another crime that is increasing we established retailer responsibilities and criminal penalties and created a task force made up of all stakeholders including law enforcement to recommend further legislation to stop this once and for all. Public safety also requires a capable police force and that is why I sponsored a bill that would have required an increase in police officer pay while expanding the pool of applicants entering the law enforcement academy. I also voted to fix legislation from last year to allow law enforcement to protect our communities to the best of their abilities while making sure public safety works for all of us.

Amy Walen: 2022 Urbanist Questionnaire Responses – LD48-2

What is your top priority for the upcoming term and how will you achieve it?

Housing. HB 2020 and it’s principles will be broken into several bills and carried by housing champions.

Washington State adopted a “Target Zero” goal of ending traffic deaths by 2030 but fatalities are trending in the wrong direction. What do you propose to rectify this situation?

COVID put people back on the road in SOVs. We need to make public transit safe again to reverse this trend and increase law enforcement presence in the meantime. Infrastructure developments need dedicated and separated lanes for non motorized as the proliferation of E bikes and scooters will absolutely reduce vehicles on the road if we ensure riders are safe. More investment in non-vehicle transit corridors is essential.

What is your stance on Rep. Jessica Bateman’s missing middle housing bill (HB 1782) that failed to pass last session and would you support similar legislation to legalize abundant housing statewide? If so what steps will you take to ensure its passage in the upcoming session? If not what policy to promote housing growth and affordability do you support?

As above my approach is HB 2020. I think we can require cities to take density but still allow them to put it where it makes sense. Some compromise with cities will be necessary to advance Rep Bateman’s bill. Density bonuses for passive housing expedited permit review for affordable projects as well as policies already in place in Kirkland and Redmond around mandatory inclusion of affordable housing density around transit and missing middle strategies and not allowing SEPA to be weaponized. I also believe I have the plan for anti-displacement and maintenance of neighborhood character.

Would you vote for a bill that ends the ban on rent control in Washington? Why or why not? Would you support statewide rent stabilization similar to Oregon?

I don’t support rent control. I believe rent control artificially disguises what is a lack of supply problem.

Washington State has ambitious climate goals but isn’t yet on course to meet them. What do you see as the missing pieces?

All of the policies we have enacted have very long lead times. We have chosen electricity as the way to move from fossil fuels rather than allowing the innovators to determine the correct technology. For example hydrogen would use existing gas station infrastructure saving jobs and using the network that exists rather than requiring all new recharging systems and does not require rare earth minerals for batteries / battery waste problems. We have much more to do on organics compositing and requirements that our communities use their own waste rather than exporting it. We need multi jurisdictional coordination because our water air fires and floods our climate doesn’t stay within state borders.

Under what circumstances if any would you support adding highway lane miles?

None.

What reforms of the Growth Management Act do you support if any?

HB 1099. I also think that we need to tie infrastructure dollars the state provides to taking (smart) growth and honoring GMA.

Do you think Washington state should have an income tax (yes/no)? If yes what is the legislative path? If not would you pursue any tax reform?

Yes. We need a constitutional amendment to enact it and to limit sales and property taxes.

What more should the State be doing to increase mobility for those who cannot drive or chose not to a constituency which composes about a quarter of the population?

I think my transit answer above covers this topic.

What approach will you take to promoting public safety?

We need to transform policing. We have put every kind of crisis in our families in the hands of traditional law enforcement. We need DV and SUD and behavior health crisis action teams as part of our peace officer teams and we need to make sure law enforcement teams reflect communities they serve to build and sustain trust.

Manka Dhingra: 2022 Urbanist Questionnaire Responses – LD45 Senate

What is your top priority for the upcoming term and how will you achieve it?

Developing a statewide behavioral health crisis system to support the national 988 number is my top priority. Rep. Orwall and I passed a bill setting up the infrastructure and now we have to make sure all the details are filled in. I am working with work groups and stakeholders to ensure we have a trailer bill that can execute the vision.

Washington State adopted a “Target Zero” goal of ending traffic deaths by 2030 but fatalities are trending in the wrong direction. What do you propose to rectify this situation?

Eliminating traffic injuries and deaths has been a priority for so long. We know people have to slow down and not be distracted however getting people to change behavior is challenging. I think the best solution is incentivizing the use of collision prevention technology in cars.

What is your stance on Rep. Jessica Bateman’s missing middle housing bill (HB 1782) that failed to pass last session and would you support similar legislation to legalize abundant housing statewide? If so what steps will you take to ensure its passage in the upcoming session? If not what policy to promote housing growth and affordability do you support?

We need more housing options at all price points as well as high density housing especially near transit areas. The issue does hinge on local control and while there are cities that are good partners there are others that are not. I am proud to represent cities that do want to be good partners and it is key to ensure we are working with them to get their buy in. However at some point in time the state has to act to ensure we are making dramatic progress in addressing affordability.

Would you vote for a bill that ends the ban on rent control in Washington? Why or why not? Would you support statewide rent stabilization similar to Oregon?

I am not familiar with what Oregon has done. I do believe we need a stable rental market — one that is affordable. I will need to understand the pro/cons on rent control. While I am proud of the work lead by Sen. Kuderer in the Senate on affordability and homelessness we have a lot more to do in terms of rent stabilization.

Washington State has ambitious climate goals but isn’t yet on course to meet them. What do you see as the missing pieces?

I am proud to support our environmental policies and goals. My expertise does not lie in this policy arena so I do look to experts in this field to drive the agenda.

Under what circumstances if any would you support adding highway lane miles?

If we need to widen highway lanes to put in light rail or add carpool lanes for transit.

What reforms of the Growth Management Act do you support if any?

The Growth Management Act needs to be updated. This is another area where I don’t have expertise and rely on others who are leaders on this issue. Sensible practical policies that protect our environment while addressing affordability are doable and I am eager for the legislature to make progress in this area.

Do you think Washington state should have an income tax (yes/no)? If yes what is the legislative path? If not would you pursue any tax reform?

Yes WA should have a state income tax. All data supports that being a much more equitable taxation system. I am not sure there is a legislative path. I think the path is with the voters as an initiative. I eagerly await our Supreme Court’s decision on legality of the capital gains excise tax.

What more should the State be doing to increase mobility for those who cannot drive or chose not to a constituency which composes about a quarter of the population?

State funding for programs like Hopelink’s Non-Emergency Medical transportation need to be expanded to provide transportation services to more people for more diverse reasons. Partnering with our cities to provide free local transportation in downtown areas is a good way to reduce isolation and enable people to frequent local businesses.

What approach will you take to promoting public safety?

Public safety is not the same as police accountability. These days the two appear to be conflated. We can ensure public safety while having transparency and accountability. We also need to distinguish between property crime and crimes of violence. Rape culture power control issues gender based violence are what makes our community unsafe and these are the issues we must focus on. There has been a 30% increase in domestic violence since Covid first started. I have worked on years to update our protection order process and address gender based violence. I have long been a supporter of therapeutic alternatives to incarceration to ensure that public health issues like substance use disorder and mental illness have a public health response.

Davina Duerr: 2022 Urbanist Questionnaire Responses – LD1-1

What is your top priority for the upcoming term and how will you achieve it?

Adding Climate Change element to the GMA. Since we came so close last session we feel good that we know what the sticking points are and are working to get around them.

Washington State adopted a “Target Zero” goal of ending traffic deaths by 2030 but fatalities are trending in the wrong direction. What do you propose to rectify this situation?

We need to put more money into protected bike lanes slower speed limits and more consequences for drivers that break the law.

What is your stance on Rep. Jessica Bateman’s missing middle housing bill (HB 1782) that failed to pass last session and would you support similar legislation to legalize abundant housing statewide? If so what steps will you take to ensure its passage in the upcoming session? If not what policy to promote housing growth and affordability do you support?

Yes I would but more than that I will work to make sure it gets out of our caucus and passes on the floor of the house

Would you vote for a bill that ends the ban on rent control in Washington? Why or why not? Would you support statewide rent stabilization similar to Oregon?

It’s hard to make a prediction on whether I would vote for a bill without knowing the details. In general I think renters need more protections and Oregon’s law makes sense to me with the addition of the California provision that prevents rent spikes before the law goes into effect.

Washington State has ambitious climate goals but isn’t yet on course to meet them. What do you see as the missing pieces?

Adding Climate Change as an element to the GMA.

Under what circumstances if any would you support adding highway lane miles?

If it supports transit such as BRT if there are not transit options available or likely to be any time in the near future or if it’s an important freight corridor and there aren’t other options for moving frieght.

What reforms of the Growth Management Act do you support if any?

Adding Climate Change as an element to the Growth Management Act

Do you think Washington state should have an income tax (yes/no)? If yes what is the legislative path? If not would you pursue any tax reform?

Yes. The tax structure working group has done extensive public outreach and I believe that work supports reforms such as B & O reform and an income tax. I would look to them to lead the effort. I do believe in income tax as a progressive tax

What more should the State be doing to increase mobility for those who cannot drive or chose not to a constituency which composes about a quarter of the population?

People needs options other than cars. We need to do more to expand protected bike lanes and create a better commuting network for bikers. Also much needs to be done around adding sidewalks and walkability for those who don’t drive. Basically we need to be more like Copenhagen that prioritizes bike scooter and walking infrastructure. Our transit system also needs to expand and change from one dependent on park and rides to one that covers that last mile.

What approach will you take to promoting public safety?

Defunding police is the worst slogan ever and harms what we should actually be trying to do which is expanding our mental health and crises response for which police are not trained and would very much like assistance with.

In Bothell we have had a Radar Navigator program which pairs a mental health professional with police to respond to mental health and crises calls for about 5 years. Mental health professionals answering crises calls lead to better outcomes as they are trained in de-escalation and are actually less expensive than deploying police to these events. Individuals in crises get the support services they need and fewer people end up in jail. We are expanding the program in Bothell and across north King County because it is so effective. The next step is to expand the number of facilities and beds available.

What is your top priority for the upcoming term and how will you achieve it?

With the successful passage of HB 1815 Deterring Catalytic Converter Thefts I am inspired to work on organized retail thefts which led to $2.7 billion losses in Washington State last year. This drives up consumer prices and presents a massive sales tax revenue loss for the state and local governments. As we continue to work on catalytic converter thefts ecosystem I think we will find parallel boosters and black market supply chain dynamics.

Washington State adopted a “Target Zero” goal of ending traffic deaths by 2030 but fatalities are trending in the wrong direction. What do you propose to rectify this situation?

New drivers aged 15-16 are required to take drivers’ education courses but older first-time drivers are not and as more people waited to get licensed we saw a shift from younger to older 18-21 age group being the most likely to cause accidents leading to fatalities. So we should look at drivers’ education for all new drivers. For the other end of the spectrum older drivers get discounts in the auto insurance rates with refreshers so building in an incentive system for how insurance rates are set could help — but the Office of the Insurance Commissioner is otherwise occupied.



Another could be reducing impaired driving whether from alcohol or other substances. Other countries such as South Korea have on-call DaeReeUnJeon driver paid services to safely drive the car home after imbibing.



Lowering speeds on our roads could be another approach to reduce fatalities and severity of injuries as I learned when I introduced and passed HB 1045 (2013) Authorizing certain local authorities to establish maximum speed limits on certain nonarterial highways for the bicycle community which is being practiced in Seattle.



Finally getting more vehicles off the roads or reducing vehicle miles as would have been directly linked with HB 2445 (2012) Regulating mileage-based insurance bill and instead increasing usage of mass transit should help but we must increase frequency of service and perhaps reduce/eliminate fares and instead pay for transit build-out and operations in other ways.

What is your stance on Rep. Jessica Bateman’s missing middle housing bill (HB 1782) that failed to pass last session and would you support similar legislation to legalize abundant housing statewide? If so what steps will you take to ensure its passage in the upcoming session? If not what policy to promote housing growth and affordability do you support?

I am a cosponsor of HB 1782 and as a former chair of the Housing committee I will continue to support similar legislation. I am thankful that the chair of Local Government Committee was able to move it out of the policy committee and I voted for its passage out of Appropriations Committee. Losing Rep. Senn’s vote probably means there were concerns within the House Democratic Caucus and its success in the Senate was not assured in the challenging 2022 Session. Assuming Democrats retain majority in both chambers I would suggest Rep. Bateman work closely with Democratic members of both chambers to respond to/answer the outstanding concerns. I have and will continue to support policies and funding of housing growth and affordability.



Specifically in the 32nd LD I am working on pre-planning for 400 units of permanently affordable housing along with a community resource center for local non-profits to be co-located on the SW and SE corners of Fircrest Campus where 12 acres of DNR land and 5 acres of DSHS land have been identified to be available.

Would you vote for a bill that ends the ban on rent control in Washington? Why or why not? Would you support statewide rent stabilization similar to Oregon?

I would vote for bills that stabilize rent but do not lead to the unintended consequences of driving smaller landlords out of the rental market as I am worried about losing rental units and gentrification. In the Seattle Metro area the pressures of increasing value in a tight sales market can easily convince Mom-and-Pop landlords to give up providing housing to sell to the highest bidder including conversions to vacation rentals REITs and alternatives like Delaware Statutory Trusts where the units are taken off the long-term rental market or the ownership and operation control will be converted to a corporate investment model.

Washington State has ambitious climate goals but isn’t yet on course to meet them. What do you see as the missing pieces?

One of the missing pieces is an office of resiliency to coordinate among agencies and to plan for the long term. I introduced HB 1147 (2021) Creating the Washington state office of resiliency after a 2-year work group convened by the Office of the Insurance Commissioner. I am now serving on the National Conference of State Legislators work group to learn more about instituting resilience based on EDF work and plan on introducing a new bill for the 2023 Session. https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/InstitutingResilience-FINAL-Web.pdf

Under what circumstances if any would you support adding highway lane miles?

Where there are lack of public transit and congestion is leading to unacceptable freight mobility delays. I can’t imagine adding lane miles in the Seattle metro core area however so we must add transit services and routes to increase passenger miles.

What reforms of the Growth Management Act do you support if any?

Make SEPA process more efficient; fund local governments’ planning activities; coordinate various agencies and utilities from local to state in planning so that infrastructure investments both public and private are aligned and additive.

Do you think Washington state should have an income tax (yes/no)? If yes what is the legislative path? If not would you pursue any tax reform?

Yes. We need larger Democratic margins in both chambers. Yes I will support the work being spear-headed by Rep. Frame.

What more should the State be doing to increase mobility for those who cannot drive or chose not to a constituency which composes about a quarter of the population?

Increase public transit; vehicle and ride sharing. I’ve supported safe routes to school bicycle lanes and pathways and sidewalks.

What approach will you take to promoting public safety?

I introduced and passed HB 2908 (2016) Establishing the joint legislative task force on community policing standards for a safer Washington and I will continue to support work being done each session.

With HB 1815 (2022) my goal was to not add new crimes but rather improve the ecosystem of recyclers and vehicle wreckers on how they conducted business as well as eventually fund law enforcement to develop best practices targeting illegal purchases maintain working relationships within that supply chain and establish a metal theft grant and training program. I will take a similar approach to tackle organized retail theft.

Improving the perception of public safety must also include providing permanent housing and supportive services for the homeless population. We must also continue to increase affordable housing units to keep vulnerable populations from becoming homeless.

Strom Peterson: 2022 Urbanist Questionnaire Responses – LD21-1

What is your top priority for the upcoming term and how will you achieve it?

Housing.

Washington State adopted a “Target Zero” goal of ending traffic deaths by 2030 but fatalities are trending in the wrong direction. What do you propose to rectify this situation?

Continue to increase safe streets funding.

What is your stance on Rep. Jessica Bateman’s missing middle housing bill (HB 1782) that failed to pass last session and would you support similar legislation to legalize abundant housing statewide? If so what steps will you take to ensure its passage in the upcoming session? If not what policy to promote housing growth and affordability do you support?

Strong supporter and cospsonsor.

Would you vote for a bill that ends the ban on rent control in Washington? Why or why not? Would you support statewide rent stabilization similar to Oregon?

Yes.

Washington State has ambitious climate goals but isn’t yet on course to meet them. What do you see as the missing pieces?

Better coordination between housing and environmental opportunities like Rep Duerr’s bill (1099).

Under what circumstances if any would you support adding highway lane miles?

Perhaps if there is a corresponding (and larger) investment in public transportation.

What reforms of the Growth Management Act do you support if any?

I don’t have any specific reforms in mind but there is some opportunity for updates.

Do you think Washington state should have an income tax (yes/no)? If yes what is the legislative path? If not would you pursue any tax reform?

Yes but there is no real legislative path. An income tax would need to come from the citizens. The legislative work group has done great work on this.

What more should the State be doing to increase mobility for those who cannot drive or chose not to a constituency which composes about a quarter of the population?

Proud to have voted for Move Ahead WA and especially excited about free transit for youth.

What approach will you take to promoting public safety?

Public safety and criminal justice reform cannot be separated.

John Lovick: 2022 Urbanist Questionnaire Responses – LD44 Senate

What is your top priority for the upcoming term and how will you achieve it?

Good safe schools good safe roads and jobs with benefits.

Washington State adopted a “Target Zero” goal of ending traffic deaths by 2030 but fatalities are trending in the wrong direction. What do you propose to rectify this situation?

Not all fatalities are DUI related. However about 1/3 are. I believe we need to follow the state of Utah and lower the blood alcohol content (BAC) level to .05.

What is your stance on Rep. Jessica Bateman’s missing middle housing bill (HB 1782) that failed to pass last session and would you support similar legislation to legalize abundant housing statewide? If so what steps will you take to ensure its passage in the upcoming session? If not what policy to promote housing growth and affordability do you support?

I support the bill.

Would you vote for a bill that ends the ban on rent control in Washington? Why or why not? Would you support statewide rent stabilization similar to Oregon?

I would give it serious consideration but I would need to know more.

Washington State has ambitious climate goals but isn’t yet on course to meet them. What do you see as the missing pieces?

Climate change is real. We need to hammer that message every single day. Climate change is something we need to address.

Under what circumstances if any would you support adding highway lane miles?

I think there are areas that we probably need to add Highway lanes. Like the US to Trestle. It only has two lanes in each direction. I think a third lane would be helpful in managing traffic in that area.

What reforms of the Growth Management Act do you support if any?

We need to look at some of the proposals. I’m not sure yet what changes I would support.

Do you think Washington state should have an income tax (yes/no)? If yes what is the legislative path? If not would you pursue any tax reform?

I do not think Washington should have a state income tax. I am looking forward to the recommendations from the bipartisan tax structure work group.

What more should the State be doing to increase mobility for those who cannot drive or chose not to a constituency which composes about a quarter of the population?

The wonderful transportation package we passed in 2022 is a great start. We’re looking at the ability for young people to ride free on buses trains and ferries. It is not everything that we need to do. But it’s a start. More busses and trains. Building more housing near transit stations.

What approach will you take to promoting public safety?

I was a state trooper for 31 years served as County Sheriff for six years. We clearly need more diversity in policing. I believe what we are doing now with accountability is the direction we need to go. When I checked there are 10 classes of recruits being trained at the Criminal Justice Training Center (CJTC). I believe that these men and women are going to change the culture of law-enforcement.

Brandy Donaghy: 2022 Urbanist Questionnaire Responses – LD44-1

What is your top priority for the upcoming term and how will you achieve it?

Community resiliency. This is done by ensuring that the right resources are directed to the right places to ensure that all Washingtonians have what they need to be able to thrive. This is done by viewing all policy through an equity lens and being proactive rather than reactive.

Washington State adopted a “Target Zero” goal of ending traffic deaths by 2030 but fatalities are trending in the wrong direction. What do you propose to rectify this situation?

Decrease DUIs by adopting a lower limit (this has been demonstrated to be successful in other states) making sure that our emergency responders road workers are safe while doing their jobs encouraging a shift to public transportation replacing dangerous intersections with traffic circles when reasonable etc.

What is your stance on Rep. Jessica Bateman’s missing middle housing bill (HB 1782) that failed to pass last session and would you support similar legislation to legalize abundant housing statewide? If so what steps will you take to ensure its passage in the upcoming session? If not what policy to promote housing growth and affordability do you support?

We need more housing at all levels and we need to find creative ways address it. Part of this requires an greater expansion of transit and other required infrastructure to allow for growth.

Would you vote for a bill that ends the ban on rent control in Washington? Why or why not? Would you support statewide rent stabilization similar to Oregon?

I am not an expert in rent control. It seems though we have an issue if we have both renters unable to afford market rate housing and small business landlords unable to maintain their properties below market rate. When this happens we need to be able to address the multiple causes of this to prevent future issues while also addressing the need for resources to make sure that everyone has what they need.

Washington State has ambitious climate goals but isn’t yet on course to meet them. What do you see as the missing pieces?

More focus on large corporations’ impacts on our climate while providing resources to help those who live and work here do what they can as well.

Under what circumstances if any would you support adding highway lane miles?

Highways are still a pathway for individuals transit systems and current shipping infrastructure. We need to maintain that access until there is a new infrastructure in place that would adequately address those needs. Additionally there are many areas that don’t have adequate public transit necessitating other options and sometimes work needs to be done to make sure people are safe when traveling.

What reforms of the Growth Management Act do you support if any?

I think we need to ensure that we are recognizing the technological changes that impact this along with how the current state of being aligns with prior projections and if/how that requires change.

Do you think Washington state should have an income tax (yes/no)? If yes what is the legislative path? If not would you pursue any tax reform?

Income taxes can be less regressive than our current system; however in order to shift to an income tax we would need to be prepared to decrease/eliminate the regressive taxes that are designed to address areas that would be covered by the revenue from income taxes. This would be difficult because the people would have to be willing to support something like this in a multi step process.

What more should the State be doing to increase mobility for those who cannot drive or chose not to a constituency which composes about a quarter of the population?

Additional multimodal transportation infrastructure.

What approach will you take to promoting public safety?

Building community resiliency includes steps to holistically address public safety by addressing the myriad issues that currently increase risk.

Richard May: 2022 Urbanist Questionnaire Responses – LD42-2

What is your top priority for the upcoming term and how will you achieve it?

Affordable housing.

Washington State adopted a “Target Zero” goal of ending traffic deaths by 2030 but fatalities are trending in the wrong direction. What do you propose to rectify this situation?

We already need an increase in public transit which would reduce traffic which would improve traffic behavior with less chaos and more room between vehicles. I helped lead a citizens initiative in Bellingham that passed 68% to rethink traffic calming measures. In my 10 years as a planning commissioner we found that many design features could cause cars to slow down on residential streets with things like rumble bumps curved streets speed indicator displays parked decoy police cars blinking yellow lights etc. Better planning and designation of which streets are arterial and which are to be calm is important but realistically allowing capacity for arterial traffic in order to deter arterial traffic from cheating onto side streets in attempts to quickly speed past jammed up traffic.

What is your stance on Rep. Jessica Bateman’s missing middle housing bill (HB 1782) that failed to pass last session and would you support similar legislation to legalize abundant housing statewide? If so what steps will you take to ensure its passage in the upcoming session? If not what policy to promote housing growth and affordability do you support?

With many great bills this past two years it is important to figure out who will torpedo your bill and why and then seek them out and have realistic conversations about what would reduce their opposition. Simply being on the best side of an issue will not ensure that your bill passes. After my 10 years as planning commissioner and two terms on my county permit appeals board I know the difference between intent and outcome on many zoning policies. There are symbolic and small cutout concessions that could get a bill passed that would do 80% of what the Bateman bill intended. Sometimes that’s the progress you can get.

Myself I would vote yes on that bill if it’s the only version in front of me but I would be more enthusiastic about having restrictions with mandated affordability tied to median income for any upzoning. Predatory investor landlords will take away a single family house and then replace it with a two or three unit luxury homes project that is no more affordable. The thinking from 20 years ago that increased inventory will always lead to reduced prices is not factoring in the billions of dollars in hoarding and holding that investors are doing to purchase whole neighborhoods. As long as people keep paying the outrageous prices there is zero incentive to lower the price. And of course people pay. It’s a necessity. Canada is laying down the hammer and so can we.

Would you vote for a bill that ends the ban on rent control in Washington? Why or why not? Would you support statewide rent stabilization similar to Oregon?

Yes. Vancouver Canada has a rule that rent can’t be raised more than 5% per year. Period. We can do that here. In Bellingham I know people who had their rent raised 40% this month. Nobody can afford that.

Washington State has ambitious climate goals but isn’t yet on course to meet them. What do you see as the missing pieces?

The free market will charge as much as people will still show up and pay. So currently the cost of electric cars and many other electrification is out of the budget of average families. The point is not to hand over taxpayer money to pay the outrageous prices the point should be to have lower prices. (Same problem about Obamacare it still had twice the price other nations pay per person for care). People want to go green they just need to be able to afford it. Local food supply and realistic seasonal shifts in diet can greatly reduce the amount of trucking and fuel used to cart around food from thousands of miles away. Better more efficient tech for generating energy is still needed. I supported Mona Das’s single use plastics and percentage of post consumer paper bills in the last two years.

Under what circumstances if any would you support adding highway lane miles?

Paired with a lot of mass transit and only where there is existing highways so that the traffic that would still be on roads could flow and go home rather than sit and stop and go while emitting exhaust. Europe and the NorthEast USA have fantastic train systems that are worthwhile and functional enough that people prefer to use them and get there better than if they drove. Mass public transit reduces traffic more lanes in some key areas increases flow which reduces emission time and improves quality of life.

What reforms of the Growth Management Act do you support if any?

I supported the recent bills in the last biennium to adjust the GMA to be more forward thinking towards transitioning away from sprawl and from fossil fuels such as HB 1099 and SB 5042.

Do you think Washington state should have an income tax (yes/no)? If yes what is the legislative path? If not would you pursue any tax reform?

Like it or not our state constitution prohibits progressive tax and it would require a 2/3rds vote of the state to change that. We do not have 2/3rds of the state in agreement. I have participated with the legislative tax reform work group and it will take many smaller measures to get the results we want. If we retain the sales tax model I propose a two tiered tax with more like 6% for necessities and 11% for luxury items. I support reworking our business tax. I opposed Boeing getting billions in tax breaks and then still moving the jobs away.

What more should the State be doing to increase mobility for those who cannot drive or chose not to a constituency which composes about a quarter of the population?

See my answer above re: mass transit.

What approach will you take to promoting public safety?

Everyone deserves due process and a day in court. New technology is needed so that a person could be detained with nearly no harm to the detainee or the enforcement officer. Anything else is unacceptable. The root causes of property crime drug use and violence need to be addressed at the core not simply by continually locking up people who are reacting to the conditions that lead to these behaviors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3RyaW5pZGFkZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvbG9jYWwvd2hvLXJlcG9ydC1zaG93cy1wb29yZXItaGVhbHRoLW91dGNvbWVzLWZvci1tYW55L2FydGljbGVfZjg0ZWExODYtMTEyNy0xMWVkLWFjOGUtZTNlZDhiYjc5NjEyLmh0bWzSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly90cmluaWRhZGV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2xvY2FsL3doby1yZXBvcnQtc2hvd3MtcG9vcmVyLWhlYWx0aC1vdXRjb21lcy1mb3ItbWFueS9hcnRpY2xlX2Y4NGVhMTg2LTExMjctMTFlZC1hYzhlLWUzZWQ4YmI3OTYxMi5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WHO report shows poorer health outcomes for many,"Freetown Collective’s success would be impossible without the women in and around the band says lead singer Muhammed Muwakil.

DESTREHAN – St. Charles Parish Hospital recently held a ribbon cutting ceremony celebrating a new ear nose and throat (ENT) clinic at Ochsner Health Center – Destrehan.

The ENT clinic is equipped with new specialized pediatric equipment funded by a $100000 donation from Valero Energy Corporation as part of the company’s 2021 Benefit for Children. Equipment includes pediatric scopes an audiometer used to diagnose hearing deficiency and a tympanometer used to evaluate middle ear function and determine if pressure equalizer (PE) tubes are necessary a common medical procedure necessary in some children to help decrease ear infections.

“We are so grateful to Valero Energy Corporation for their generous donation. Their support allows St. Charles Parish Hospital to continue to provide high-quality healthcare in our community including our youngest patients. With the new space we will now be able to care for and treat patients of all ages with ear nose and throat medical concerns right here in our parish” said Keith Dacus chief executive officer St. Charles Parish Hospital.

In addition to the specialized ENT equipment Valero Energy Corporation has donated $100000 to the Ochsner Hospital for Children Michael R. Boh Center for Child Development through Benefit for Children and issued $10000 in fuel cards to SCPH employees totaling $210000 of in-kind support for Ochsner Health in 2021.

Otolaryngologists Marcie Tauzin MD Emily Burke MD and audiologist Tanya Andrepoint are now seeing patients at the Ochsner Health Center – Destrehan ENT clinic. To schedule an appointment please visit ochsner.org or call 985-764-7669.

St. Charles Parish Hospital is fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and managed by Ochsner Health with 630 providers and 500 employees. In the spring of 2022 St. Charles Parish Hospital earned an ‘A’ hospital safety grade by The Leapfrog Group for its efforts in protecting patients from harm and meeting the highest safety standard in the United States.

Stakeholders in Nueces and San Patricio counties celebrated the milestone during a Thursday event at the Solomon P. Ortiz International Center marking the next step toward the nonprofit enacting an action plan with the goal of keeping the region's airshed in attainment — meaning it meets national air quality standards.

The nonprofit the Coastal Bend Air Quality Partnership aims to improve air quality by promoting voluntary improvement measures and emissions-reducing activities proposing programs for monitoring and improving air quality and advancing discussion on those topics.

The nonprofit represents the ""next evolution"" of the Corpus Christi Air Group an ad-hoc group established in 1995 after the region's airshed was on the verge of nonattainment. Due to the group's work Corpus Christi has never failed to meet federal or state air quality standards.

""This has been a long time coming"" said Sharon Bailey Murphy the nonprofit's first executive director who was hired in May. She has worked in environmental affairs for the city of Corpus Christi since 2009. ""It can't be said enough that this is 27 years of voluntary collaboration from our community that went above and beyond compliance.""

Gretchen Arnold led the Corpus Christi Air Group and helped with establishing the new nonprofit. Murphy likening the continuance of Arnold's and others' work to a relay race said it was on the new board of directors to continue their work.

""They ran their race well"" Murphy told the audience before gifting each board member with baby-blue batons marked with the Coastal Bend Air Quality Partnership logo. ""Now they're passing the baton to us.""

The Nueces and San Patricio county judges and mayors of Corpus Christi and Portland appointed one board member each. The Port of Corpus Christi Authority appointed one and industry and business leaders appointed three. In addition one community leader and one non-voting member with a background in academia were selected.

Here's who makes up the board.

Sarah Garza will serve as the nonprofit's first president. She works as the Port of Corpus Christi's director of environmental planning and compliance. She is the port authority's representative.

will serve as a board member. He works at Bay. Ltd. He is a business and industry representative. Joseph David Felix will serve as a non-voting board member. He is an assistant professor of environmental chemistry at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi.

The Coastal Bend Air Quality Partnership is funded for three years of operation through contributions from local cities counties industry associations and other entities.

The nonprofit will unviel a website sometime in August. Next the board will be tasked with establishing an action plan. A draft of the action plan is projected to be before the board in December 2024.

The nonprofit's structure was established by a transition workgroup that included industry leaders the planning director of the Corpus Christi Metropolitan Planning Organization and notably a member of the Coastal Alliance for Protection of Our Environment — an environmentalist group.

More:The Port of Corpus Christi has a new environmental policy. Here's what it means.

Portland resident Errol Summerlin a founding member of CAPE said the collaboration with industry leaders was engaging and fruitful in creating the nonprofit which he said is a ""great start"" in lowering emissions.

Summerlin hopes the nonprofit delivers on its stated mission to lower emissions more than the minimum required by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency. In addition he said he hopes it ""sends a message"" to local industry to install more monitoring equipment.

""There is a heavy industry presence (on the board) but that is because they have a lot at stake if we reach nonattainment"" Summerlin told the Caller-Times. ""It is a great start and I will keep myself aware of what they are doing. I certainly want them to push for more.""

A 2020 study by Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi's South Texas Economic Development Center states that continued population and economic growth — particularly the development of industrial manufacturing plants in the Port of Corpus Christi district and across San Patricio County — is expected to degrade local air quality further.

The airshed reaching a nonattainment status the study says could have a significant impact on the local economy. In a hypothetical scenario wherein the area is at nonattainment the study found the annual average costs to the Corpus Christi metro area would be $586 million to $1.7 billion.

Así es la mansión que vende Sofía Vergara. Hace dos años que Sofía Vergara y su marido Joe Manganiello se compraron una vivienda en Los Ángeles una gran mansión estilo villa toscana en la comunidad de Beverly Park con vigilancia que han estado reformando para entrar a vivir así pues no es de extrañar que hayan decidido poner a la venta su antigua casa.

El próximo 15 de agosto toreará en Las Ventas la plaza más importante del mundo y ahora el extremeño vuelve a Madrid con la ilusión de que en esta ocasión su paso por la capital española le valga para abrirse camino. Lidiará astados de Fuente Ymbro junto a los espadas Ángel Sánchez y Adrien Salenc (confirmación).

«Es un regalo de Dios y una excelente oportunidad. Tengo que darle las gracias a la Copa Chenel que organiza la Comunidad de Madrid. He cogido confianza en mí mismo y llego con muchas ganas. También me ayudó mi estancia en México para madurar. La mente en la tauromaquia se necesita más que el cuerpo lo que tengas en la cabeza es lo que sale reflejado en el ruedo. Llevo bastante tiempo en este mundo y he tenido momentos muy buenos otros más difíciles de estar muy aparcado… Creo que ahora estoy en uno muy bueno me siento delante del toro en un gran nivel» manifiesta el matador de toros.

Jairo Miguel se encuentra ante el desafío de su vida. «Madrid lo es todo para cualquier torero. Sentir la presión de su afición y ganarte sus oles es algo que me gusta y motiva. En mi cabeza no ha habido otra cosa que no sea triunfar en Las Ventas. La preparación y la exigencia es máxima pero soy consciente de que Madrid siempre te exige un plus más. Es un cartel muy bonito. En mi cabeza voy día a día y por supuesto sólo pienso en el día 15» señala Sánchez a El Periódico Extremadura.

Ya nota por haber llegado hasta aquí que está de vuelta y viene para quedarse. «Es un balance muy importante que está teniendo gran repercusión me ha cambiado de cómo estaba a cómo estoy ahora. Lo más bonito que tiene esta profesión es la autenticidad y se puede demostrar en la plaza» concluye el torero cacereño. Esa personalidad esas ganas de querer triunfar.

Sin embargo gracias a la penetración de los canales digitales en los hábitos de las personas cada vez es más accesible poder llevar adelante iniciativas a un costo regulado y con un potencial impacto en la facturación de tu empresa.

Es por eso que he desarrollado una guía con los cinco canales que todo emprendimiento y las pymes debe tener en cuenta a la hora de iniciar en el proceso de captación de nuevos clientes y aumento de las ventas:

1) Email Marketing: Consiste en enviarle emails que le generen valor a los usuarios/clientes. Se suelen enviar emails con promociones con lanzamientos de nuevos productos o servicios aperturas de nuevas sucursales o contenido que le aporte valor en algo específico que vos sabes que le puede interesar. Es importante que tengas en cuenta que solo puedes enviarle emails a personas primero hayan aceptado recibir tus comunicaciones y que les des la posibilidad de desuscribirse de tus listas.

2) Redes Sociales: Utilizar redes como Instagram Facebook Snapchat o TikTok son casi obligatorios para la mayoría de los emprendimientos. Es fundamental generar contenido original humano que no sea 100% comercial y que genere valor. De acuerdo a tu cliente será la red social que te conviene y también en base a tus posibilidades es si harás videos o posteos (con imagen y texto). Es importante que trates cuanto antes de armar tu comunidad ya que luego ellos se transformarán en tus clientes leales.

3) Marketing Automation: El marketing automation o automatización del marketing consiste en ayudar a las empresas a priorizar y ejecutar sus acciones de marketing de una forma más ágil y eficiente apalancados en herramientas digitales que les permiten automatizar procesos propiciando con ello el alcance de sus objetivos en un tiempo menor y en algunos casos a un costo menor. Un ejemplo de esto es: cuando armas un flujo de emails comerciales para no tener que enviar uno por uno de forma manual.

4) Guías online: Recuerdas las guías que llegaban a los domicilios una vez al año y que eran amarillas o blancas? bueno ahora existen en versión digital y muchísimas otras. Son muchas las guías online que son gratuitas y aparecer en esos listados permite que te encuentren muchas personas que están buscando los servicios que ofreces.

5) Google My Business: Es una herramienta gratuita creada por Google para ayudar a las empresas a gestionar su presencia en internet. Esta herramienta va a ayudarte a que más personas te encuentren cuando hacen búsquedas en Google y en Google Maps. Este servicio es gratuito y es importante que lo aproveches! Puedes personalizar tu perfil con fotos ofertas publicaciones y también recibir reviews de clientes.

Es importante que antes de iniciar en estos canales te informes bien de cómo funcionan de cuánto tiempo te llevaría tenerlos funcionando y si necesitas de ayuda externa para poder desarrollarlos. Una de las claves es que siempre te pongas en los zapatos de tus clientes y les brindes experiencias de calidad como las que te gustaría recibir a vos si fueras el cliente.

La venta de libros en Amazon es un campo de minas puedes comprar una copia de menor calidad sin saberlo

🔥

Amazon vende cientos de miles de productos diferentes en su web y aunque lleva años luchando por mantener un alto estándar de calidad a veces no es tan sencillo. Amazon puede venderte los productos de tres maneras diferentes: vendido y enviado por ellos gestionado por ellos o vendido y enviado por un externo. Los pedidos vendidos y gestionados por Amazon tienen todas las ventajas y seguridades de Amazon Prime pero cuando se trata de vendedores externos es donde hay más dudas.

Amazon permite que prácticamente cualquier minorista se cree un perfil en Amazon y venda sus productos a través de la web. Lo hace para evitar quedarse sin stock en un producto concreto y cuando se agotan las existencias que tiene Amazon en almacen recurre a vendedores externos con tal de no etiquetar el producto como ""agotado"". Amazon tiene mano dura contra el fraude y es muy difícil que permita en su web tiendas que no venden lo que anuncian. Pero hecha la ley hecha la trampa.

François Chollet autor del libro ""Deep Learning with Python"" ha desenmascarado recientemente en Twitter una estafa importante en Amazon. Algunos vendedores estaban comercializando su libro en Amazon con una calidad menor e incluso con errores en el texto. Estas tiendas externas estaban vendiendo el libro a precio completo pero con una calidad de impresión precaria y con encuadernado de peor calidad.

Q: How do I know if my copy is counterfeit?



A: The surest way to check is to try to register it with Manning at: https://t.co/WAQ42jTz7I



Other than that the fakes have much lower print/make quality.



- Darker cover colors.

- Flimsier paper.

- Poorly bound.

- Cut smaller. pic.twitter.com/xChRUuXQIr — François Chollet (@fchollet) July 23 2022

Chollet adjunta en Twitter imágenes que demuestran la teoría. Los libros vendidos por externos son más finos y claramente de menor calidad. El papel y la pasta del encuadernamiento parecen directamente papel reciclado y los colores son más apagados a causa de una impresión de menor calidad. En este caso los contenidos del libro son exactamente iguales pero en apariencia las diferencias son más que evidentes.

Una práctica que perjudica tanto al autor de la obra como al consumidor

Lo peor de todo es que no es un caso aislado. En la categoría de libros de Amazon hay muchos vendedores que están utilizando esta técnica para aumentar los beneficios y reducir costes. El problema principal es que muchas veces estas ventas se valoran de forma positiva ya que la gente no sabe que están comprando un producto de menor calidad. El libro te acaba llegando a casa pero no de la manera en la que el autor o la editorial lo querrían.

Cuando estos productos se compran en Amazon a través de un vendedor externo el autor no se lleva ni un euro de la compra. Es práctica muy sangrante dentro del sector. La mejor forma de no caer en la trampa es fijarse siempre en quién es el que vende el libro.

Si aparece ""Vendido y enviado por Amazon"" se trata de un producto Prime que ha pasado todos los estándares de calidad. Si no lo vende Amazon debes fijarte que el vendedor sea la propia editorial del libro o alguna librería física si no desconfía. Si el envío está gestionado por Amazon podrás devolver el libro sin ningún problema pero como ya hemos mencionado a veces es difícil notar el bajón de calidad si no tienes una referencia.

“Rechazamos las declaraciones del vocal de la Sala Constitucional Primera de La Paz que sin ningún respaldo técnico ni jurídico culpa al TSE de un ‘error’ de inicio en el proceso de supervisión a una organización política” escribió Vargas desde su cuenta de X.

El fin de semana el vocal Campero señaló a la red Erbol que “el primer error y el error de origen lo cometió el Órgano Electoral. El Órgano Electoral es un órgano técnico no es un conjunto de amigos que se reúnen para decidir una cuestión. (…) Es absolutamente inaceptable que un Tribunal Supremo Electoral (TSE) al momento de autorizar o no un congreso no advierta que dentro de la inscripción normativa existe una cláusula que es de difícil inobservancia”.

Lea más: El TSE informará en 10 días sobre la supervisión al congreso del MAS arcista

Campero justificó de esa forma el fallo emitido por la Sala Constitucional que instruyó al TSE realizar la supervisión del congreso del MAS arcista en El Alto pese a que precisamente en la anterior semana la entidad electoral rechazó el acompañamiento de este encuentro.

La cláusula a la que hace referencia la autoridad judicial es la resolución emitida por la Sala Constitucional en diciembre de 2023 en la que se ordena que el congreso del MAS debe ser convocado “previo consenso” con sus organizaciones matrices.

Vargas también indicó que el TSE en la supervisión del congreso verifica el cumplimiento de la norma y del estatuto del partido político. “En este caso la división dentro de las organizaciones sociales reconocidas en el estatuto del partido político ha derivado en complicaciones internas en este proceso”.

El instrumento político oficialista está marcado por la división de su liderazgo entre evistas y arcistas. Por un lado está el Pacto de Unidad que respalda al presidente Luis Arce y realizó desde el viernes hasta el domingo un congreso en El Alto para elegir una nueva directiva; por el otro se encuentra la dirección nacional a la cabeza del expresidente y jefe del partido Evo Morales; que convocó a otro congreso para el 10 de julio en Villa Tunari Cochabamba.

La autoridad electoral dijo que el ente electoral emitió todas sus resoluciones en el marco de la Constitución Política del Estados las leyes y los reglamentos que regulan su accionar pero además exigió el “respeto al Órgano Electoral y que se garantice la independencia de los órganos del poder público como establece nuestra CPE”."

Lumos a Waynesboro-based high-speed internet provider plans to spend $83 million to install fiber in parts of Virginia Beach Chesapeake and Portsmouth. The coverage area will reach almost 85000 residents and businesses in Hampton Roads according to a July 21 announcement.

“These communities are going to get fiber for the first time and it’s a transformative experience” Lumos Chief Customer Officer Jay Winn said.

The company likes to expand in areas without competing fiber providers so parts of Hampton Roads not covered by the Verizon Fios network made sense Winn said. Lumos will be laying more than 760 miles of network in a mishmash of locations in Virginia Beach Chesapeake and Portsmouth.

In Portsmouth Winn said the company will focus on areas south of the Elizabeth River that lack access to fiber. In Chesapeake it’s Deep Creek North Deep Creek South South Norfolk and along the northern end of Great Bridge Boulevard. Lastly in Virginia Beach the company will install a network in parts of Pungo Sandbridge Sigma North Virginia Beach and along Nimmo Parkway Salem Road and Lynnhaven Parkway.

Notably the service won’t go to places with Fios or to Norfolk where Metronet is installing its own fiber service. Mayor Kenny Alexander announced Metronet’s plans in April 2021 during the State of the City address. Construction began in early 2022 near the Five Points intersection and is progressing in several neighborhoods according to a construction progress website.

The Lumos service costs will depend on the internet speed Winn said. For 500 megabits a second costs will run around $50 a month. A gigabit a second will run around $60-80 a month and 2 gigabits a second costs around $100 monthly.

The advantage of fiber compared with cable is the technology has a higher capacity of 100 gigabits a second Winn said. So the service is relatively future-proof.

Lumos construction is expected to begin in 2023 and it will take about two years to build out the network Winn said.

It was the first time the winner of a Cup Series race had been disqualified since 1960. Chase Elliott never led a lap but was deemed the official winner after finishing third. Elliott is the 7-2 favorite for Sunday's 2022 Verizon 200 in the latest 2022 NASCAR at Indianapolis odds at Caesars Sportsbook. The 2022 NASCAR at the Brickyard green flag drops at 2:30 p.m. ET on Sunday on NBC (stream now on FuboTV).

Kyle Larson has the second-shortest 2022 Verizon 200 odds at 11-2 after leading the most laps and finishing third at Indianapolis Motor Speedway last year. He has recorded three top-five finishes in his last five races but should he be included in your 2022 Verizon 200 bets? Before scouring the 2022 Verizon 200 starting lineup and making any 2022 NASCAR Brickyard predictions be sure to see the latest NASCAR at Indianapolis picks from SportsLine's proven projection model.

Developed by daily Fantasy pro and SportsLine predictive data engineer Mike McClure this proprietary NASCAR prediction model simulates every race 10000 times taking into account factors such as track history and recent results.

In the 2021 season McClure nailed Martin Truex Jr. to win at Martinsville for a strong 3-1 payout. Then it called Chase Elliott to win at Road America for a 5-2 payout. McClure's model also called Larson's win at Texas for an 11-4 payout and his win at Kansas for a 9-4 payout in back-to-back weeks before nailing Larson to win the season-finale in Phoenix to claim the 2021 NASCAR Cup Championship.

In total it nailed five of Larson's wins during a historic season and has also gone 15-9 on its head-to-head matchup predictions to start the 2022 season. Earlier this season it was high on Ross Chastain to win in Austin giving him a far better shot to win than his 40-1 odds implied. The model was also high on Joey Logano before he won as a 15-1 underdog at Darlington and high on him again when he returned 14-1 for his win in St. Louis. Anyone who followed its lead on those plays saw huge returns on their NASCAR picks.

Now the model simulated the 2022 NASCAR at the Brickyard race 10000 times. Head to SportsLine to see the complete projected 2022 Verizon 200 leaderboard.

Top 2022 NASCAR at the Brickyard predictions

One surprise: the model is high on Kyle Busch even though he's a 15-1 long shot in the latest 2022 NASCAR at the Brickyard odds. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The two-time Cup Series champion has been in the headlines all week after being disqualified at Pocono. Busch has been one of the top contenders all season finishing inside the top three in five races.

He also has the most wins (60) among active drivers and ranks ninth on the all-time wins list. Busch would have added another top-two finish to his season resume if not for the failed inspection last week. He has posted solid results this season and will be looking to prove a point on Sunday making his 15-1 price tag look very appealing. See which other NASCAR underdogs to pick here.

And a massive shocker: Tyler Reddick one of the Vegas favorites at 10-1 stumbles big-time and fails to crack the top five. There are far better values in the 2022 Verizon 200 starting grid. Reddick captured his first career victory in the last road race in the NASCAR Cup Series at Elkhart Lake and saw his fourth-place finish at Pocono improve to second after Hamlin and Busch were disqualified last week.

However he also had a 35th-place finish in the prior road race at Sonoma and struggled at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course last season. Reddick finished 21st despite starting 11th and leading six laps during the race. The model doesn't see a lot of value in playing him as the fourth favorite on Sunday. See which other favorites to avoid here.

How to make 2022 NASCAR at Indianapolis picks

The model is also targeting three other drivers with 2022 NASCAR at the Brickyard odds of 15-1 or longer to make a serious run at the checkered flag. Anyone who backs these drivers could hit it big. You can see all of the model's NASCAR picks over at SportsLine.

Nobody except the loons that is: those very special people who willfully eschew logical reasoning and the established corpus of knowledge in favor of febrile theories weird cultural grievances and other made-up bullshit. As luck would have it there were enough loons out there for the network to be aired by many cable providers and to reap millions of dollars in carriage fees year after year after year. Then in a shocking development one of America’s foremost loons was elected president—and One America News Network the network that nobody liked found itself having A Moment.

It is now July 2022 and OAN’s moment is definitively over. On Sunday July 31 the network’s carriage deal with Verizon Fios expires and will not be renewed meaning that OAN will no longer be included in any of Verizon’s cable packages. The Verizon deal is the second major carriage deal that OAN has lost this year; its lucrative distribution agreement with DirecTV expired and was not renewed in April. As of August 1 the network will only be viewable via certain streaming services its own app and on certain smaller cable providers such as GCI which operates in Alaska. Yukon ho conspiracists!

Some OAN network personnel have characterized this trend as “cancel culture” motivated by a “Marxist agenda” rhetoric which in itself sort of shows you why very few companies want to be in business with the network anymore. Accusations of censorship aside the deplatforming of OAN can also be seen as a simple business decision on the part of Verizon and DirecTV: Namely that it no longer makes sense for these carriers to spend good money each year airing a network that nobody watches is beset by lawsuits and is a vector for toxic misinformation. Before we bid farewell to OAN though let’s look back at its “glory days” such as they are.

OAN was founded in 2013 by Robert Herring a high-school dropout and serial entrepreneur who apparently saw a market for a cable news network that wasted neither time nor money on standard production values or credible fact-checking. The market opportunity was driven by the way that the business of cable and satellite television works. These carriers long attracted customers by touting subscription packages featuring hundreds of channels many of which go broadly unwatched. (Have you watched “So Yummy TV” lately? How about “World Harvest Television”?) These tiny networks are sustained by and large by carriage fees: micropayments that are assessed on a per-subscriber basis and paid out by the cable/satellite provider to their constituent networks. The providers generally roll these fees into the subscription prices that they charge their users which means basically that it doesn’t cost DirecTV much of anything at all to create a channel slot for like The Mistletoe Network or Broom Closet TV.

If you’ve ever wondered why cable and satellite packages are so expensive it’s because you’re paying for the hundreds of stupid little channels that you don’t watch in order to access the dozen or so that you do. Cord-cutting and the rise of streaming services have of late imperiled this business model which is one big reason why many major cable and satellite providers are seeking to divest themselves of channels that no longer add value. Back in 2013 though if you had had sufficient resources sales acumen and ambition you too could have launched a bare-bones cable network and realized profit via carriage fees.

OAN probably would have remained broadly unnoticed on the back end of the channel list shouting weird theories and paleoconservative dogma to insomniacs and shut-ins and reaping the carriage fee boondoggle. But then came the rise of Donald Trump. OAN’s moment in the sun began with Trump’s election because Trump effectively was the network’s core demographic: an aging inattentive crank receptive to conspiracies and addled by resentments. While Fox News’ eventual embrace of the Trump candidacy seemed perhaps a bit opportunistic OAN and Trump were in each other’s wheelhouse right from the start. “It’s a great network” Trump said of OAN in August 2017 after taking a press conference question from the network’s 23-year-old White House correspondent. The network was still obscure and unpopular but now it had a well-placed champion.

OAN’s moment arguably peaked in November and December 2020 as right-wing viewers seeking validation of their objectively incorrect belief that Donald Trump actually won that year’s presidential election fled Fox News for OAN and Newsmax another right-wing news channel. Those two networks were willing to entertain the premise that the election had been stolen (it had not been stolen) and as a result they saw a short-term bump in their ratings numbers and their public profiles. Then on Jan. 6 2021 thousands of loons agitated by these stolen-election lies marched on and over-ran the U.S. Capitol in an effort to interrupt the certification of the presidential election to take a bunch of selfies in the Rotunda and in various Congressional offices and if they could find him to possibly hang Vice President Mike Pence.

This violent incursion marked the beginning of the end of OAN’s moment. Right-wing cable audiences moved back to Fox News after that network purged itself of many of its remaining reasonable voices while promoting Greg Gutfeld and Jesse Watters. OAN was named in several expensive lawsuits filed by individuals and entities which it had insinuated were complicit in the “theft” of the 2020 presidential election. The cable and satellite providers which had sustained OAN via their carriage fees meanwhile were bleeding subscribers to streaming services and had a renewed incentive to cut the fat. (It probably didn’t help the network’s case that long past Jan. 6 some on the network continued to yell about “all these people who are responsible for overthrowing the election” while noting that “in the past America had a very good solution for dealing with traitors: Execution.”)

It’s true that in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection liberal groups such as Media Matters had publicly called upon OAN’s providers to drop the network. Make no mistake though: It’s likely that the demise of OAN is driven less by public pressure campaigns or those providers’ distaste for fascist rhetoric than by simple economics. (After all DirecTV and Verizon also faced pressure campaigns from OAN fans urging them to keep the network.) If the cable and satellite business model still worked as well as it did a decade ago OAN would likely still be on the air. Likewise if the network was actually pulling high enough ratings it wouldn’t matter what its anchors were saying or whom they wanted to execute: OAN would still have a place in Verizon and DirecTV’s channel lineups. America’s cable and satellite providers are more than willing to platform even the most toxic loons as long as those loons make them money."

The CEPA deal is expected to advance bilateral trade beyond $10 billion within five years and add $1.9 billion to the UAE’s GDP within the same time period.

It was also the second bilateral trade accord concluded by the UAE following the UAE-India CEPA which entered into force on May 1.

VMC,Vulcan Materials Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vYm9yZ2VucHJvamVjdC5vcmcvcHJvc3RoZXRpY3MtaW4tdmlldG5hbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vulcan Augmetics Offers Prosthetics in Vietnam,"

Though the Vietnam War ended 47 years ago buried in Vietnamese soil thousands of unexploded land mines grenades and cluster bombs continue to injure or kill people. There are 100000 amputees requiring prosthetics in Vietnam and about 80% are from landmines. Till today 2000 people are stepping on live landmines every year. In 2018 two expatriates founded Vulcan Augmetics a social enterprise startup that utilized 3D printing and injection molding to create customizable and upgradable prosthetics. Its goal is to support amputees in developing countries and lower the cost of prosthetics.

Affordable Price

In developed nations most amputees have access to social assistance and medical insurance covered by the legislation. In contrast 95% of amputees in Vietnam have to support their own lives with unemployment high up to 70%.

Rafael Masters and Akshay Sharma founded Vulcan Augmetics in 2018. One of their inspirations to start the company Vulcan Augmetics is to subsidize Vietnamese amputees with accessibility to high-functioning prosthetics when they lack quality insurance coverage.

Vulcan Augmetics combines traditional metal frames with plastic parts made through 3D printing. The innovation in filled materials controls prices of prosthetics at $1100 making them more affordable than most prosthetic arms that cost $2600 on average explained Masters to KrASIA.

Sustainable Design

Another advantage of Vulcan Augmetics is to give amputees a say in developing artificial limbs augmenting them to meet their own needs.

Rather than offering traditional fixed prosthetics the company designed and produced flexible components for modifying and upgrading. Vulcan’s prosthetics plug and click together like Lego pieces enabling rearrangement to suit the daily demands of a given occupation or task according to KrASIA.

For the base model there is also an adjustable mechanical device inside the hand with multiple functions providing users the ability to do daily chores said Masters to KrASIA. Going through the cheap and efficient entry-level ones customers can upgrade to advanced models for more possibilities in life and work.

Broad Market

Till 2021 Vulcan has partnered with 17 major hospitals and clinics with orthotic and prosthetics services in Vietnam offering new prosthetics to 32 people in need. It targets to have at least 50 users per month in 2022 and aggrandize its business to other regions in Southeast Asia according to Youth Colab.

Positioning itself as a social enterprise Vulcan Augmetics lists prices and detailed product information upfront on its website so potential buyers can know what options are available no matter where they are.

For startups aiming to break down barriers to artificial limbs worldwide this decentralized approach helps place the customer at the forefront. People no longer have to approach hospitals and clinics to find a prosthetic but getting to see product options and collaborate in building prosthetics online without geographic hurdles.

Vulcan Augmetics plans to develop product lines for people with paralysis or weak muscles and those without disabilities want to be more durable and flexible in special physical activities. For a long-term goal the company wishes to serve 38 million disabled people globally in addition to providing prosthetics in Vietnam according to KrASIA.

Your little goblin may be getting bags of pennies from your neighbors when they trick or treat this Oct. 31.

Hershey the big candy maker issued a warning this week that said a possible candy shortage may affect your Halloween pickings. The big concern is the shortage of raw ingredients which will cause a major candy capacity problem.

The shortage is a result of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine where restrictions have been made on Russian gas and oil imports which are specifically hurting the German import of supplies that aren’t going to make it to Pennsylvania and the world’s fifth largest candy maker.

According to an article in the Washington Post candy has seen an 11% gain in share in 2021 with an amazing $37 billion dollars in confectionary sales revenue.

The increase in candy sales across the board coupled with the lack of supplies coming from Europe have put a big stress on shelves now selling candy. Candy makers are at “all hands on deck” mode to keep the shelves stocked three full months before Halloween.

The Halloween scare at Hersey’s and Mars is very real. Not only is there a problem in Europe but here in the states there is a milk shortage that will add to the problems that candy makers are trying to ward off. The milk shortage is a result of one of the Borden Dairies' production facilities permanently closing its doors in Chicago. Borden Dairies has one of the country’s largest milk production plants. This closing in Chicago will affect mostly Illinois and Wisconsin retailers but those retailers are spreading out to get dairy deliveries outside their states to keep up the demand which will put more of a strain on the national market.

All in all we have three months to see how this shakes out. Hopefully it will be a Happy Halloween with lots of candy for your little trick-or-treaters and you too!

MUNCIE Ind. — The Delaware County Prosecutor formally charged a man for a deadly Saturday evening shooting in the parking lot of a Muncie Walmart.

Tyler Abrams 32 of Muncie was arrested Saturday night less than 30 minutes after police say he shot and killed Sam Gillum in the parking lot of a north side Walmart located at 4801 W. Clara Lane.

Friday Prosecutor Eric Hoffman formally charged Abrams with murder criminal recklessness obstruction of justice and pointing a firearm.

Police were called to the shooting at around 8:45 p.m. They arrived to find a man identified as Gillum who had been shot in the head and was lying on the ground in the parking lot. He was taken to IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital where medics pronounced him dead.

Witnesses told investigators they saw a man in dark shorts and a red shirt shoot Gillum and then run west before leaving the Walmart's parking lot and going onto Morrison Road.

Surveillance video captured the shooting and documents explain it corroborates what the witnesses told police.

In the video Gillum and his wife could be seen leaving the store and pushing a shopping cart toward their car.

Meanwhile a man wearing a face mask dark shorts and a red shirt identified as Abrams could be seen walking toward Gillum's car.

When he made it to Gillum's car he raises a hand ""as if he's pointing something at the victim"" documents say adding that it appears Abrams is holding something in his hand at this point.

Police say Abrams then turns and runs to the southwest side of the parking lot.

When police identified Abrams as the suspected shooter they began searching for him. A witness who was fishing in a pond west of the Walmart at around the same time the shooting happened saw a man wearing dark shorts no shirt and carrying a gray plastic bag similar to a Walmart shopping bag. He was also carrying a red shirt the witness said.

The witness told police the man believed to be Abrams was walking west and appeared to have come from Walmart. He also was walking quickly and was out of breath.

A little after 9 p.m. police found Abrams hiding near a home in a wooded area in the 2000 block of North Nebo Road about one mile from the Walmart where the shooting happened.

When officers got close to him documents say he immediately put his hands in the air and said ""I give up I'm turning myself in.""

Abrams was arrested on initial charges of murder criminal recklessness obstruction of justice and pointing a firearm.

Documents say he was wearing blue shorts and didn't have a shirt on. However he had a red shirt like the one seen in the surveillance video on the ground next to him.

Abrams didn't have a gun with him when he was arrested. Documents said ""It appears Abrams discarded the firearm within 26 minutes of shooting Gillum and fleeing the scene.""

Muncie Police told 13News there is no ongoing threat to the public.

Anyone with information about the shooting is being asked to contact the Muncie Police Department Detective Division at 765-747-4867 or Muncie Police Dispatch at 765-747-4838.

Seth Goshorn has worked as a reading tutor and second-grade teacher for six years according to a video he posted on TikTok earlier in July. Goshorn says the chief reason for his move is the pay which is far higher than his teaching gig despite not needing a degree.

""Think about how good our teachers can be if they could focus on just teaching and not have to work a second job on the weekends"" Goshorn told Good Morning America on Thursday.

""They didn't choose to have to work a second job that comes along with it and that's the thing that I would have loved to see go away"" he added.

There are always rumors surrounding the next big superhero movie and there are just as many around the next big addition to popular theme parks like Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Sometimes these rumors turn out to be true or at least have some truth to them but one recent rumor concerning Walt Disney World has many fans concerned that it might not be called Walt Disney World much longer.

While it’s difficult to pinpoint where this rumor started though it was recently mentioned on the popular Disney Dish podcast  the idea is that Disney might be looking to drop the “Walt” from Walt Disney World and simply start referring to the resort as Disney World or alternatively Disneyworld. As one expects Walt Disney World fans who are frequently resistant to change  are largely not fans of this idea. But is there even a real concern that it could or should happen?

The History Of Disney World’s Name

When a press conference was first called in November of 1965 and it was confirmed that yes it was Walt Disney who had been buying up all that swampland in central Florida the project itself didn’t have an official name. It was being referred to internally by code names like Project Winter or simply The Florida Project but the Disney World name had been attached to it early because it was going to be like Disneyland only bigger.

Eventually the Disney World name became official but just over a year after that initial press conference Walt Disney died. He would never see his dream project completed and the new head of the company Walt’s brother Roy O. Disney made the decision to change the name from Disney World to Walt Disney World so that his brother’s name would always be associated with a project that was designed to be his crowning creative achievement. And while much of what Walt Disney World was meant to be never happened  the name has been there for 50 years.

Why Disney Might Be Considering The Change To Disney World

While a potential name change to Walt Disney World especially one so small might seem like such a minor issue that it’s not really worth doing there are some reasons why it could happen. The biggest of these is the fact that most people already call it Disney World anyway.

While the official name has always been Walt Disney World since it opened in 1971 the fact is that millions of people visit every year and most of them don’t use the full name. For most people it is just Disney World so changing the name to that is simply getting the official name in line with the unofficial name. The official website is DisneyWorld.com  likely because if the website were called WaltDisneyWorld.com a lot of people would have trouble finding it. Sometimes a business just has to do what makes things easy for its customers.

There have also been some indications that Disney as a company is taking steps away from Walt. The biggest of these came on July 17 the anniversary of the opening of Disneyland. In recent years Walt Disney’s original dedication speech has been played inside the park but this year that did not happen.

A lot of fans questioned not including the speech . Some wondered if Disney’s recent advancements to try and make the park more inclusive meant distancing it from Walt who has not exactly been seen as an inclusive figure. Splash Mountain is being re-themed away from its Song of the South roots and Song of the South was produced and even championed by Walt.

While most of the worst stories about Walt’s personal opinions are untrue once again it’s a question of perception. Even if the speech not being included was simply an oversight the fact that this oversight took place was potentially telling regarding what was seen as important for the anniversary and what was not.

There’s an argument to be made that Walt Disney had no intention of naming the Florida resort Walt Disney World so changing the name would put things more in line with own wishes anyway. That’s certainly true as far as it goes but I wouldn’t expect to see that as an argument why the name change should happen. Using Walt to justify the removal of Walt is a circular argument that won’t get anybody very far.

Why Walt Disney Isn’t Going Anywhere

If somehow the Walt Disney Company did want to distance itself from its founder there would need to be a lot more work done than simply removing the first name from the theme park resort. It is called The Walt Disney Company after all. The motion picture studio and the animation studio also have Walt’s full name attached. Removing the name from the theme park alone seems like a useless change if there isn’t a plan to do the same thing from the entire company. That’s a much bigger process that would take a lot of time and likely cause a lot of controversy that Disney probably isn’t looking for right now.

Even removing Walt’s name from the Florida resort doesn’t take Walt out of Disney World. There’s a statue of him standing in front of Cinderella’s Castle at Magic Kingdom. A second statue is currently planning to be added to Epcot in the near future and it’s been confirmed to still be happening very recently. Putting Walt physically in the resort while taking his name off doesn't make a great deal of sense. Disney is even in the process of putting together a movie about the creation of Disneyland  and that means Walt Disney himself will be a character in a major upcoming release . Walt isn't being ignored by Disney.

Is it possible that Walt Disney World could just become Disney World officially rather than just unofficially? Sure it’s certainly possible. Nothing ever stays the same at theme parks and just like the attractions and experiences change and evolve inside the parks the names can also change. While fans would certainly lament this particular change it wouldn’t mean all that much in the grand scheme of things. Disney World would still be Disney World with or without Walt’s name attached.

But if I were to place a bet I’d put my money on this change not happening. Disney the company trying to distance itself from Walt Disney the man is simply unnecessary because Walt Disney has been more symbol than man since before he passed away. Walt’s name is still frequently invoked by people inside the company but it’s in an almost mythic way. Walt is a part of Disney history and nostalgia and without history and nostalgia Disney wouldn’t be where it is today.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhdWdoaW5ncGxhY2UuY29tL3cvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA3LzMwL29mZmljaWFsLWQyMy10b3Vycy1vZi10aGUtd2FsdC1kaXNuZXktc3R1ZGlvcy1pbi1idXJiYW5rLXJldHVybmluZy1hdWd1c3QtMTF0aC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Official D23 Tours of The Walt Disney Studios in Burbank Returning August 11th - LaughingPlace.com,"D23 is bringing back a long-time favorite tour for members that being the Official Walt Disney Studios Tour!

Two of them – lifelong friends Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston – had vacation homes in Julian California an 1870s gold rush town about 65 miles from San Diego (and about 120 miles from Disneyland). There train enthusiast Ollie built a backyard railroad and thanks to Airbnb Disney fans can book another kind of Southern California vacation with a Disneyland twist.

But before you pack your suitcases and head to Julian here’s a bit of Disney railroad history:

Walt Disney’s love of trains has been well-documented but it was Ollie – a key animator on “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” “Bambi” “Peter Pan” “Robin Hood” “Alice in Wonderland” and many other Disney classics – who originally inspired Walt to build the Carolwood Pacific Railroad that circled his Los Angeles backyard and later the more extensive Disneyland Railroad circling his brand new theme park in Anaheim.

The Disneyland Railroad (then known as the Sante Fe & Disneyland Railroad) opened with Disneyland in 1955 but many Disney fans don’t know that Walt added a second train to the park in 1957: the narrow-gauge Viewliner Train of Tomorrow. That’s probably because the second train only operated until 1959 (when it was replaced by the Disneyland Monorail system) but Disneyland’s loss was Ollie’s gain as the railroad ties from the Viewliner tracks made their way to Julian where they were used to build Ollie’s backyard railroad dubbed the Deer Lake Park & Julian Railroad (DLP & J).

According to Ted Thomas (Frank’s son) Frank and Ollie bought the Julian property in 1966 so Ollie would have a place to run the narrow-gauge locomotive he was restoring which he named the Marie E. after his wife.

“They each built weekend homes on the property and Ollie set about building his railroad which eventually formed a ‘U’ around 2/3 of the entire acreage” Ted told me.

In 1967 Ted and his brother Ollie’s sons and “unsuspecting” high school friends (invited for what they thought would be a leisurely weekend in the mountains) were recruited to build the railroad. Ted says the 1100 cross ties were initially used in Disneyland for the Viewliner attraction. As for the rail he recalls some of that also came from the attraction but since Ollie’s railroad ended up being about a 1/2 mile long Ollie had to add more rail to the initial Disneyland-sourced supply.

“I recall that [the rail] came from Japan and was considered too light to be used on the Disneyland Railroad but believe me both the rail and the cross ties were plenty heavy to work with when we laid track” Ted said. “What I do recall clearly is how when delivered there was a huge mound of ties like tinker toys and an equally imposing stack of rail.”

After Ollie had the roadbed bulldozed by a local contractor it was up to the boys to move rail measure out and level ties bolt rail and drive spikes. Luckily for them word got out among Southern California steam train enthusiasts and help quickly arrived in Julian to volunteer “many many hours of time and labor.”

The result Ted says was “a beautiful and one-of-a-kind little railroad through the oak trees and alongside the meadow.”

Ollie last ran the train around 1998. The locomotive and cars were sold in 2002 and most of the track was taken up (except the section that crosses the trestle directly in front of the back deck). However Ted notes that there is a Disney and Disneyland connection that continued.

The new owner of the Marie E. and rolling stock was John Lasseter a steam enthusiast and former Disney/Pixar animator himself (as well as the former Chief Creative Officer of Pixar Animation Studios and Director of the first two Toy Story movies and first two Cars movies). In 2005 John surprised 92-year-old Ollie by getting permission to run the Marie E. at Disneyland before the park opened (the first time outside railroad equipment was allowed to run at any Disney park).

“On May 10th 2005 we had a ceremony at the New Orleans Square Station which was interrupted by the Marie E. pulling into the station” Ted recalled. “The engineer blew the whistle before we could see the locomotive and like a parent recognizing their child’s voice Ollie looked over his shoulder and said ‘That’s my engine!’ He was then helped into the cab and took the throttle for a run around the park.”

Here’s footage of Ollie taking the Marie E. for spins around his Julian property and Disneyland:

And now if you’re a Disneyland fan a train fan or a Disneyland train fan you’ll definitely want to start packing because the original DLP & J trestle is still on the grounds of Ollie’s rustic three-bedroom house and you can rent the 20-acre property through Airbnb.

According to current homeowners David Koplewicz and Amanda Sager Julian residents who have lived in the area since Frank and Ollie built their homes shared that when Ollie would sound the “steam trumpet” all the neighbors knew it was time to head over for a ride. Not only are parts of that historic track and trestle still on the property but David says the home’s primary bedroom also features a copy of Ollie’s “train rules” that were previously located in the property’s warehouse.

Here are a few highlights from the Airbnb listing:

The house accommodates up to 6 guests in three bedrooms (1 with a king bed and two with queen beds).

The location is home to wildlife such as deer wild turkey blue jay falcon hawk woodpecker roadrunner hummingbirds and many other friends.

The large deck out back spans the width of the home and is perched over the train track trestle. Surrounding and behind the train tracks are oak trees opening to an expansive view of North Peak Mountain.

At night stargaze on the back porch while listening to the soothing music of rustling leaves while soaking in the views from the cedar hot tub inset into the deck.

Additional features: full kitchen Wi-Fi; free parking on premises; 50″ HDTV with Fire TV HBO Max and Netflix Bluetooth sound system and record player (there’s even a Bambi soundtrack record); in-unit washer and dryer; Central air conditioning; and security cameras on the property.

Julian is a Great Vacation Destination

There’s a reason Frank and Ollie chose Julian for their vacation homes. As if the Disneyland railroad connection isn’t motivation enough to plan a trip there are plenty of family-friendly things to do including The Eagle Mining Co. where guides will teach you how to pan for gold and lead you through the tunnels of the Eagle and High Peak Mines (two of Julian’s original gold mines).

Julian is also known for apples – and in fact in the 1890s was proclaimed the “greatest apple belt in the world” – so apple picking (in September and October) and apple pies (any time) are must-dos for every visitor. There are ample apple treats all over town but my favorite is the Julian Pie Company on Main Street.

Another very cool (and little-known) activity in Julian is to visit The California Wolf Center where you can learn fun facts about the resident wolf pack and get an inside look at wolf conservation. Tours are by appointment only.

One more thing…

As I mentioned Walt’s backyard Carolwood Pacific Railroad inspired by Ollie was the spark that ignited Walt’s decision to build the larger Disneyland Railroad but when his L.A. area house was sold his railroad workshop – which he named the Carolwood Barn – was relocated to Griffith Park where you can visit the barn-turned-museum for free from 11 a.m.-3:00 p.m. on the third Sunday of each month (weather permitting).

Next to Walt Disney’s red Carolwood Barn is the original bright yellow Retlaw1 Combine coach #101 from the Santa Fe & Disneyland Railroad that circled the Anaheim park on opening day (Retlaw is Walter spelled backward) but a (literally) hidden gem tucked behind the Retlaw1 is Ollie’s Station.

This whimsical little yellow train depot (reminiscent of the New Orleans Square Station at Disneyland) was part of Ollie’s other backyard railroad in La Cañada California (yes he had two) – and if you listen closely you can hear the tapping sound of morse code just like in the park.

Fun Fact: Another reason to visit Walt Disney’s Carolwood Barn is that Disney experts and Imagineers often drop in so you never know who you’ll see there. When I visited on Disneyland’s recent 67th birthday I had the opportunity to meet Marcy Carriker Smothers who was signing her book Walt’s Disneyland and Tania Norris an Imagineering interior designer who worked on New Orleans Square the Haunted Mansion (including working on the design of its famous purple wallpaper) and Club 33.

To learn more about Frank and Ollie (and see awesome home movies of the Deer Lake Park & Julian Railroad) I highly recommend “Frank and Ollie” (currently streaming on Disney+). The charming documentary directed by Ted Thomas showcases the iconic Disney animation moments the pair created as well as their remarkable friendship.

Let’s see what the Disney Parks Blog had to say about the OtterBox cases.

New Phone Cases

This sponsorship is fitting since otters have had a big influence on the OtterBox brand. Sea otters’ uniquely insulated fur protects them from the elements – like the protective qualities of OtterBox products – which is how the OtterBox name came to be. And fun fact: the company mascot is none other than a sea otter named Ollie!

Discovery Faces First Post-Honeymoon Earnings As Layoffs Streaming Decisions Loom,"Warner Bros. Discovery is heading into a very important week. The company whose regime just crossed the 100-days-in-office mark reports its Q2 earnings Thursday when CEO David Zaslav and his team are expected to lay out more concrete plans for the combined entity than they did on the Q1 earnings call held just a couple of weeks after the $43 billion Discovery-WarnerMedia merger had been completed. That could include more details about how the two companies’ streaming services HBO Max and Discovery+ would be combined and under what name; about the company’s theatrical-streaming film strategy; and how a promised $3 billion in savings (a number many expect to go higher) would be achieved.

August had long been rumored to be the month of mass layoffs with the first wave now expected as early as next week as the honeymoon period for the new regime is coming to an end. This coming Monday also marks the start of WBD‘s three-days-a-week return-to-office mandate which became one of the first major tests for the new leadership; the return plan was met with strong resistance by WarnerMedia employees when it was announced soon after the merger was completed.

HBO Max which has positioned itself as a top-tier streamer after two years of operation has found itself at the center of all sorts of wild speculation for the past couple of months — from a supposed shutdown and folding into Discovery+ to individual departments dissolving to a buying freeze and dramatic cull of its development slate.

While the streamer has paused new live-action kids and family programming as well as unscripted content most of the rumors could not be substantiated as HBO Max is preparing for one of its biggest launches ever with the Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon. Further consolidation of HBO and HBO Max’s scripted operations under Casey Bloys is expected and the future of HBO Max’s unscripted division is in question given the pending merger with the nonfiction-focused Discovery+.

WBD’s film strategy for HBO Max also is believed to be under scrutiny with movies expected to get theatrical distribution before going on the streamer going forward. Also under discussion is a potential unifying moniker for the consolidated WBD streaming platform that would combine the coastal/metropolitan appeal of HBO Max and the Middle America pull of Discovery+. Zaslav was thought to have been keen to changing the name of the streamer when he first discussed the deal but now is believed to have more of an open mind.

There have been a handful of layoffs so far — along with high-profile executive departures like Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff and Warner Bros. President of Global Kids Young Adults and Classic Tom Ascheim — in the first three months since the Discovery-WarnerMedia merger was completed but the majority of cuts are expected to start in August and wrap by Thanksgiving. Thousands of workers are expected to be affected as the company deals with a “bigger mess” than initially expected.

With the last division reports on layoff targets reportedly due this past Friday the trigger could be pulled at any moment. Mid-August had been recently rumored but now there is chatter that the first batch could come next week. After that first wave a second one is anticipated in September. Overall the hope is that the majority of layoffs are made over the summer and the goal is for the cuts to be over before the start of the holiday season.

Since the deal was first proposed in May 2021 $3 billion has been repeatedly mentioned as the target for the amount of expense that can be squeezed out of the new operation. John Malone the media billionaire who is an influential member of the new company’s board of directors has indicated that $4B is a feasible target. High-level insiders tell Deadline that the figure could come closer to $5B. In a research note to her clients in April Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich called the $3 billion target “highly achievable if not conservative given several areas of duplicative expenses (e.g. tech ad/distribution sales force real estate etc.).”

WBD has already made cuts in its sales division led by Jon Steinlauf with around 1000 roles or 30% of that workforce axed. Sales remains a primary target for cuts with marketing distribution and engineering also rumored to be among the areas impacted the most as the company looks to eliminate redundancies. While most post-merger departures so far have been WarnerMedia employees rumor is that layoffs on the Discovery side may come first this time.

Word is that division leaders have not been given a headcount to hit but rather told to present a strategic outlook of how their operations can work more efficiently. Unlike the WarnerMedia cuts following the acquisition by AT&T WBD has not implemented voluntary buyouts as a way of reducing workforce and layoffs are expected to be largely performance-based.

“People are looking back a little wistfully at the AT&T era” one recently senior exec who exited the company this year told Deadline. “They were a phone company but they understood that and they tended to mostly stay out of our business.”

A major restructuring at WarnerMedia was a defining moment of AT&T’s troubled stewardship of the company. Longtime silos between divisions were removed and a large roster of seasoned execs walked out the door. The joining together of two media companies in WarnerMedia and Discovery each with cable TV portfolios production operations and a streaming platform has created different challenges.

“I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone come in and look to just outright gut a company like this” one longtime senior Warner vet tells Deadline.

The pattern is familiar to those who worked with Zaslav during his 15-year run overseeing Discovery. “The cuts were constant” one veteran of those years said. “And they were so stealthy – 20 here 30 here never a huge number that would attract attention or require a write-down. It became a running joke to come in on Monday and everyone would say ‘Well hey my security badge still works!’”

The pending cuts may appease long-skeptical investors as WBD like many media companies is facing economic headwinds and a challenging financial environment which likely will be reflected in the earnings. The stocks of Discovery and former WarnerMedia parent AT&T both lost significant ground during the 10 months when the deal was pending. WBD stock has fallen 38% since it began trading on April 11 and closed Friday at a mere $15 a share. Times have been tough for most stocks lately but the decline is steeper than that of shares in Disney Comcast and Paramount in that same time span.

When they come cuts in the content teams will likely be among the most high-profile.

The linear Turner Networks were the first major target and have already seen a slew of changes including the departure of Brett Weitz general manager of TNT TBS & truTV; SVP Original Programming Adrienne O’Riain; and unscripted chief Corie Henson. The combined networks group now led by Nancy Daniels under Kathleen Finch has cut a number of unscripted series such as The Big D weeks ahead of its premiere and let go a number of big-ticket development as well as axed/ended most scripted series such as Chad Snowpiercer and Kill the Orange Bear.

It’s believed that over time a new programming strategy will be put in place that will include cheaper reality fare and potentially new scripted series.

On the unscripted front there have been constant rumors that the company will make sizable cuts to HBO Max’s alternative team led by Jennifer O’Connell who also runs live-action kinds/family programming an area from which the streamer has already pulled back.

Unscripted is a major source of synergy given it is the area where there’s the most crossover between the WarnerMedia units and Discovery teams. However from a buying point of view HBO Max and Turner Networks spend a lot more on programming on average than Discovery. For instance a show like HBO Max reality series FBoy Island costs between $1.5M-$2M an hour compared to a traditional hour of Discovery programming that is pegged around $400000-$500000.

There’s been little noise around Mike Darnell’s unscripted production group which suggests that the studios divisions — which include Warner Bros. Unscripted Television. Telepictures Productions and Warner Horizon Unscripted Television — may continue as is helped by the fact that Discovery didn’t produce many of its own shows.

The high-profile scrapping of J.J. Abrams’ HBO series Demimonde last month raised the question how the merged business will deal with A-list talent.

The Lost co-creator and his Bad Robot signed a mega five-year overall deal for film and television with the studio in 2019 in a competitive situation. The WBD top executives have been scrutinizing Bad Robot’s output so far and there’s a feeling the relationship may have been “mismanaged” with the new company leadership keen to get some projects moving through the pact. That includes shows in the works at HBO Max which are believed to be moving along despite rumors over the past week to the contrary.

Overall outside of possible further consolidation with HBO Max HBO will likely remain business as usual. Zaslav is a noted admirer of what HBO and HBO Max Chief Content Officer Bloys and his team have achieved as evidenced by him signing the exec to a new five-year contract. Zaslav also was front and center at this week’s glitzy premiere of HBO’s House of the Dragon which is expected to get one of the biggest ever — and possibly the biggest — marketing campaign for an HBO/HBO Max series.

Sports is expected to be a continued focus for the Turner Networks which see the NBA and NHL Major League Baseball and March Madness college basketball as linchpins for the networks. WBD currently pays $1.2 billion a year for NBA games. That deal is up at the end of the 2024-25 season adding another big decision to the new company’s growing list.

Elsewhere IP will be a huge differentiator going forward. Warner Bros. Discovery has the libraries of DC Comics Harry Potter Hanna Barbera and Looney Tunes a collection matched only by Disney with Marvel Lucasfilm’s Star Wars and Pixar.

Proper management of the big franchises is a top priority with finding a DC chief who can revitalize the comic book universe the way Kevin Feige has done with Marvel of upmost importance. There’s been much chatter about new Harry Potter extensions including a TV series and Zaslav is understood to have recently met creator J.K. Rowling.

Film strategy will likely remain focused on theatrical. Zaslav is not thought to be a big fan of direct-to-streaming movies believing that the return on investment is low and it doesn’t help churn across HBO Max. He recently brought in former Disney exec Alan Horn a heavyweight who will help consult on feature strategy working with former MGM chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy who recently took over a larger portion of the portfolio previously overseen by Toby Emmerich.

As he immerses himself into areas in which he has no hands-on experience like movies and scripted TV Zaslav has relied on the counsel of industry veterans. In addition to bringing Horn on board he also reportedly has sought advice from a number of other former top executives including Peter Roth who led the Warner Bros. Television Group for many years.

As WBD closes the book on its first 100 days the next 100 might give us an idea about what the future of the company actually looks like. We may get the first glimpse at that on the WBD earnings call Thursday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vcHVjay5uZXdzL3phenMtdHdlZW4tZ2FtYmxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zaz's Tween Gamble - Puck,"SHARE

Some eighteen months ago the company once known as WarnerMedia announced that it was going to increase its investment in kids and family content tenfold. At the time then-C.E.O. Jason Kilar under the auspices of AT&T and John Stankey was planning to order more than 3000 episodes and films for the family division of HBO Max and the Cartoon Network which was set to become a cornerstone brand for the streaming service. This was part of a broader directional recognition that streaming services needed to provide bundled value to all members of a family unit. In 2019 after all with Disney+’s launch on the horizon Netflix doubled down on its own family and children’s programming which was being watched by about 60 percent of the platform’s global audience. Kilar was determined to fight for market share.

Ever since WarnerMedia and Discovery combined to create Warner Bros. Discovery however C.E.O. David Zaslav has treated many of Kilar’s decisions as mere suggestions or simply irritants as he seeks to manage Wall Street’s expectations by finding $3 billion in synergies across the company simultaneously growing its streaming ambitions while paying down its staggering debt. CNN+ was an early casualty. As my partner Matt Belloni has noted even J.J. Abrams is susceptible to Zaz’s cost-cutting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWFya2h1Z2hlcy8yMDIyLzA3LzMxL2NvbmZpcm1lZC1iYXRmbGVjay1yZXR1cm5zLWluLWFxdWFtYW4tYW5kLXRoZS1sb3N0LWtpbmdkb20v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Confirmed: Batfleck Returns In 'Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2022/07/31/confirmed-batfleck-returns-in-aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWFya2h1Z2hlcy8yMDIyLzA3LzMxL2NvbmZpcm1lZC1iYXRmbGVjay1yZXR1cm5zLWluLWFxdWFtYW4tYW5kLXRoZS1sb3N0LWtpbmdkb20v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vc2FuZG1hbi1kYy11bml2ZXJzZS1uZXRmbGl4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Sandman Erase the DC Universe From Its Story?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vc2FuZG1hbi1kYy11bml2ZXJzZS1uZXRmbGl4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL2Jlbi1hZmZsZWNrLXJlcG9ydGVkbHktcmVwbGFjaW5nLW1pY2hhZWwta2VhdG9uLWFzLWJhdG1hbi1pbi1hcXVhbWFuLTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ben Affleck Reportedly Replacing Michael Keaton as Batman in Aquaman 2,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbW92aWV3ZWIuY29tL2Jlbi1hZmZsZWNrLXJlcG9ydGVkbHktcmVwbGFjaW5nLW1pY2hhZWwta2VhdG9uLWFzLWJhdG1hbi1pbi1hcXVhbWFuLTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The results showed that from 1990 to 2020 the total ecosystem services value in the YRB showed a dynamic trend of decrease-increase–decrease with overall increasing trend and a total increase of 31.85 × 1010 USD with an average annual increase of 1.14 × 1010 USD (Table 2). This changing trend is consistent with land use cover change in the area. In 30a YRB cultivated land decreased by 8663 km2 due to rapid urbanization. In addition after year 2000 China began to implement the policy of returning farmland to forest and grassland on a large scale which accelerated the reduction of cultivated land. Results again showed that the forest area increased by 30933093 km2 indicating that the implementation of “returning farmland to forest and grassland”policy achieved great results thus increased the value of ecosystem services generated by forest land by 167.66 × 1010 USD. Grassland increased by 738 km2 as corresponding ESV increased by 28.73 × 1010 USD while unused land decreased by 8131 km2 with 9.52 × 1010 USD ESV decrease. In general the ecological protection and management measures in the YRB have achieved remarkable results and ecosystem service values has been significantly improved due to forest and grassland increase.

Table 2 The value of ecosystem services in the YRB from 1990 to 2020. Full size table

In terms of ecosystem service structure in the YRB (Table 3) the relative proportions of various ESVs did not change significantly resulting in relatively stable ESV structure. Soil conservation and waste disposal are the most important among them accounting for about 37% of ESV's total value. The YRB ecosystem as can be seen emphasises the importance of soil conservation and waste disposal in the basin with Climate regulation Biodiversity conservation and Entertainment accounting for only 11.99 percent of the total. Various services have changed to varying degrees during the study period. Waste disposal and climate regulation for example have suffered losses of 22.23 × 1010 USD and 20.29 × 1010 USD respectively.The rest of the services showed an upward trend among which the value of the Food production service increased the most which was 19.03 × 1010 USD owing to the obvious increase of the forest land and grassland area in the YRB.

Spatial distribution and variation characteristics of ecosystem services in the YRB

The total ESV value of the study area and changes in the value of each service could not reflect their spatial differences. To describe the temporal and spatial distribution pattern of ESV in the study area the natural breakpoint method was used. This method was further used to classify ESV with reference to existing studies and divided the area into four levels: low-value lower-value higher-value and high-value areas. Takin the three-level watershed of the YRB as the statistical unit for analysis the result showed that the higher the level the higher the ESV. As shown in Fig. 2 from 1990 to 2020 the spatial characteristics of ESV were relatively stable. The YRB's upper reaches from Shizuishan to the north bank of Hekou Town the Fenhe River Basin from Hekou Town to Longmen and the Jinghe River Basin are all rich in high-values. The forest and grassland are relatively concentrated in the above-mentioned areas the ESV coefficient is high and the watershed area is large resulting in a high total ESV. The higher value areas are mainly distributed in the areas from Longyang Gorge to Lanzhou main stream basin the Daxia River and Tao River basin and the Wei River basin. The area above Baoji Gorge and the inflow area fall in the transition zone between the high-value area and the lower-value area. For example the transition area between the Loess and Qinghai-Tibet Plateaus is a higher-value area. The lower-value area mainly includes the Huangshui River Basin the Datong River Basin the basin below Lanzhou and the Guanzhong Plain area. Thus the unused land in this area is widely distributed. Due to the large area of construction land in the Guanzhong Plain the ecosystem service value has shrunk. The low-value area is found in the YRB's lower reaches which contains the most extensive and large area of construction land in the basin has a poor ecosystem service function and is also the YRB's most economically developed area. In terms of changes in the value of watershed ecosystem services the number of watersheds at the ESV level did not change significantly between 1990 and 2020. The average ESV of the watershed is 40.52 × 1010 USD. There were 7 high-value 5 higher-value 12 lower-value and 5 low-value watersheds respectively.

The hotspot analysis revealed the spatial agglomeration characteristics and ESV evolution law in the YRB from 1990 to 2020 (Fig. 3). In most of the YRB the ESV accumulation characteristics were not significant in space and significant areas were dominated with high and low ESV accumulation. The Maqu-Longyangxia River Basin Daxia River and Tao River Basin the Datong River Basin and Fen River Basin were the five core areas where ESV had the highest value. The Inner River YRB's northern and eastern margins and the lower reaches are primarily low-value agglomeration areas. The high-value agglomeration area and low-value agglomeration area did not change significantly in space from 1990 to 2020 but the number of grids in each decreased from 647 to 627 and 699 to 681 respectively. In general the YRB's high-value agglomeration areas are strewn about whereas the low-value agglomeration areas are scattered.

From 1990 to 2020 the barycenter coordinates of the ESV in the YRB remained stable between 106.78°–106.94° E and 36.40°–36.65° N (Fig. 4). During the study period the ESV barycenter coordinates showed a transfer trajectory of first to southwest then to northeast and then to southwest. From the perspective of overall transfer direction ESV barycenter shifted from northeast of Huanxian County to southwest from 1990 to 2020. The ESV in the northeast decreased while that in southeast increased. From 1995 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2005 the migration distance of ESV barycenter in the YRB was longer by 16.33 km and 15.75 km respectively while the barycenter migration distance of ESV from 2005 to 2020 was shorter.

Response of ecosystem services to land-use change

The area of land use type change in the YRB increased by 64356 km2 between 1990 and 2020. Each land type's area has changed to varying degrees. Cultivated land and construction land are the two land types that have seen the most changes. The area of cultivated land has shrunk by 8663 km2 while the area of construction land has grown by 13109 km2. In comparison to water forest and grassland unused land has undergone significant transformations. However in comparison to 1990 it shrunk by 8131 km2 in 2020. The forest increased by 3093 km2 while grassland increased by 738 km2. Ecosystem services are significantly impacted by changes in land use types. Using the spatial analysis method the researcher introduces a resilience index to reflect ESV's response to land-use change in this paper. During 1990–2000 and 2000–2010 average elasticity of ESV change in the YRB relative to land use change was 0.27 and 0.44 respectively but dropped to 0.04 during 2010–2020. This indicates that the disturbance capacity of land-use change on ecosystem services was low between 1990 and 2000 but increased between 2000 and 2010. Land-use change has had less of an impact on ecosystem services since 2010. The range of changes in land land-use types was wide during this time but the average elasticity index was low because there were so many different types of land land-use changes such as the conversion of forest land and cultivated land to construction land and the conversion of forest land and water area to cultivated land. The decrease in ESV caused by the change in land use per unit area was minor. Furthermore the forest land and grassland in the river basin have been effectively increased as ESV has increased. Overall the value of ecosystem services has remained relatively constant.

Accurate spatial statistics on the elasticity index from 1990 to 2020 was carried out (Fig. 5). The elastic index of the upper YRB and Loess Plateau is higher and the impact of land use change on ecosystem services is more apparent in this region according to the findings. This is mainly due to the implementation of large-scale ecological engineering measures in response to vegetation degradation in the upper reaches of the YRB and soil erosion in the middle reaches (Loess Plateau) by the Chinese government. In addition Lanzhou New District Guanzhong Plain and the lower Yellow River region also showed higher elasticity index. The above-mentioned regional development and construction as well as human activities have resulted in a rapid increase in construction land resulting in a significant decline in ecosystem services and a higher resilience index as a result of rapid urbanisation.

Figure 5 Spatial distribution of elastic coefficients in the YRB from 1990 to 2020. Full size image

In general the land use types in the YRB have changed dramatically and land type conversion is very common. The conversion of ecological land to urban construction land as well as the conversion of unused and cultivated land to ecological land has resulted in significant changes in ecosystem service value. This demonstrates that the basin's ecological construction projects have yielded positive environmental results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51bmRwLm9yZy9tb2xkb3ZhL25ld3Mvd2hhdC1jYW4td2UtZG8tbGVmdG92ZXItY29mZmVlLW1vbGRvdmFuLWFuZC1wb2xpc2gtY29tcGFuaWVzLXBhcnRuZXItdXBjeWNsZS1zcGVudC1jb2ZmZWUtZ3JvdW5kc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What can we do with leftover coffee? Moldovan and Polish companies partner to upcycle spent coffee grounds,"In Moldova’s capital city Chisinau about 2000 to 3000 kilograms of coffee waste end up in landfills each month adding up to greenhouse gases emissions. A local coffee chain Tucano Coffee is joining forces with UNDP and with Polish technology company EcoBean to change the game and inject coffee waste into the circular economy process. EcoBean is a technology company with a mission to help reduce coffee waste and extends the coffee value chain established as the spin-off from Warsaw University of Technology. Tucano Coffee is an international network of coffee shops with focus on corporate social responsibility. Tucano Coffee has been established in 2011 in the Republic of Moldova. Their initiative a feasibility study that will map up the coffee waste collection practice in the Republic of Moldova – from the legislation process and the identification of logistical partners and warehouses to the establishment of the coffee grounds utilization method and the selection of partners for scaling up – is financed under the Polish Challenge Fund with funds from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland. From 2020 Polish Challenge Fund has supported in total 21 new initiatives which brought new solutions and ideas like environmental chat bots air quality monitoring or smart solutions for bees keeping in Belarus Georgia Republic of Moldova and Ukraine. I interviewed the founders and CEOs of both companies Marcin Kozlowski in EcoBean and Ruslan Cojocaru in Tucano Coffee to find out more about their innovative path: Where did the idea to re-use coffee waste come from – and what is the story behind it?

"" I was aware of how much coffee waste was collected and thrown away in each of our coffee shop and wanted to find a solution to recycle it or use it in a way that would not harm the soil or the air. When we were invited to participate in the feasibility study we thought it would be a great opportunity to join forces with EcoBean and UNDP to expand our vision and spread awareness of bio waste and how it is handled here in Moldova."" Ruslan Cojocaru CEO Tucano Coffee

Marcin: Our solution meets coffee industry needs and at the same time fulfills an environmental mission. Every business operation requires waste management activities which are cost- and time- consuming. We collect spent coffee grounds directly from the clients’ facilities and convert it into valuable bio-products such as cups for drinks straws briquettes etc. It makes coffee business operations more eco-friendly and at the same time provides ecological alternatives to plastic products. What problem were you trying to solve? Ruslan: Waste management issues are quite serious in our country: People are aware of the problem and are eager to sort waste but the separate waste collection infrastructure is poorly developed and only a few facilities are available to the public. At Tucano we are trying our best to sort waste and to minimize it but sometimes it ends up being mixed again with regular waste. We want to be a company that shows social responsibility and hope to show to our government that the waste management issue has to be solved and that it could start with us. Marcin: Our solution is a response to challenges such as a linear consumption model growing environmental pollution and CO2 emissions through the use of fossil resources distant and limited sources of biomass suboptimal logistics and EU legal regulations. How do you intend to roll out your joint project in Moldova? Marcin: We are introducing a circular economy in which the supplier of coffee waste is also a user and/or a distributor of products made from its own coffee grounds so we extend the coffee value chain.

""By processing coffee grounds into raw materials and eco-products we reduce the carbon footprint – the implementation of the entire technological process could reduce CO2 footprint at least by 20% throughout the whole coffee value chain - and contribute to reducing the amount of waste generated by our partners."" For us coffee grounds are a new local source of biomass that does not require increasing the area of arable land. We are introducing a circular model that enables reverse logistics and offers a highly efficient logistics process for collecting biomass from distributed sources.""

PHOTO: STAR

Large firms offering both commercial and residential waste collection services make a nice bundle of money by collecting and processing trash in the West. Just consider the economic value in the following items: Bottles and cans toys metallic objects boxes paper products books clothing and old mobile phones and computers – all thrown away without a thought about the negative externalities that they create. Then there is the organic waste generated in millions of kitchens. Is this all trash or is there cash in trash? Cash may be interpreted as benefits not only for individuals but also for communities society the economy and the very environment that absorbs much of what we carelessly discard. Here we explore the opportunities that lie hidden in the items that we flippantly discard. Instead of being used or reused much of it ends up in the landfills.

Today's world is vibrant with innovation. In the last century we were blessed with unprecedented technological and economic growth. Along with it however came new models new technologies and new ways of doing the same thing – perhaps more efficiently. As newer innovations made inroads disposal of old solutions began to generate a mountain of discarded goods never seen or experienced. But there is a great opportunity in all that people discard.

The garbage that we all generate every single day in hundreds of thousands of tonnes offers opportunities for economic growth as well as social transformation. It can all be done through a simple yet effective system.

CHART: Courtesy

Firstly the system in question needs to be designed to create a circular movement in all sectors of urban life the environment and the economy. Circularity means perpetual motion and perpetual growth is the end goal. Let's look at rain for example. It is a part of a circular process. Water evaporates on a hot day to the atmosphere and when it cools it comes down to Earth to evaporate again repeating the cycle endlessly. Our thinking uses this simple principle of circularity with no resource loss. Instead of water we move waste in a circular pattern endlessly generating both economic and social value for citizens. Citizens are the ones who enable circular movement of waste for which they ought to be rewarded with social/economic benefits. The scope of these rewards depends on their contribution to waste circularity serving as a catalyst for economic and social growth for both individuals and communities.

Secondly individuals and different communities within Dhaka can be incentivised to be the building block of the circular flow of waste based on how much they accumulate individual and community points from the waste they help put in circular motion. The accumulated points then become enablers for personal and community growth ranging from simple things which would make day-to-day life easier for individual households (e.g. a shopping coupon or a bus pass) to being able to decide what to invest in when talking about community upliftment (e.g. repairing roads improving schools or street lighting) or even receiving educational benefits or investible funds for sustainable start-ups. In other words everyone of every background would be able to create a better world while gaining rewards for themselves and their community in the process. Through such an incentive system Dhaka city could achieve crowdsourced innovation stability and citywide growth in multiple ways.

The entire city could be integrated into this new way of life by making it simple to participate in while the system is highly rewarding for both individual households and different communities based on points accumulated. All it needs is the adoption of a digital application that is well-designed and which efficiently incorporates the circular process. It must be simple for the users but highly impactful by its ability to generate environmental economic and societal points from and for all Dhaka residents.

The circular process must be adaptable to the demands of the public and to the goals of the local government leadership whereby people get exactly the kind of resources they want and need as a benefit for participating in the circular process.

Adaptability and being aligned with the needs of the broader public can make the idea of circularity indefinitely relevant for Dhaka city. It presents itself as a game bringing everyone together like on a game night with your friends and family. It's a game which you can't lose by mere dedicated participation; but if you win (using the reward system correctly) the world can change around you for the better. This system would uplift everyone in the city while also building a powerful circular economy and a stable happy and empowered society.

CHART: Courtesy

Finally the idea of circularity can be perpetuated with community-building in mind through a creative endeavour of leadership technology intervention and astute management.

The proposed system – rather a way of life – can be described as an overarching circular-waste-flow-inducing smart-investment community-building framework which unifies a variety of factors for perpetual value generation in all sectors of life in Dhaka. A critical challenge will be to communicate the idea to the city residents to participate in this creative endeavour. A pilot project can make a real difference to make the idea successful.

Once it operated under the name of the King Fisher and sailed under the flag of the Caribbean nation St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Then it switched to Georgia the former Soviet republic. It was only in 2019 that it began flying the banner of Cameroon.

The Trondheim is one of several vessels reflagged under Cameroon’s growing fishing fleet that have changed names and been accused of illicit activities at sea. Currently an investigation by The Associated Press found 14 of these vessels are owned or managed by companies based in European Union member states: Belgium Malta Latvia and Cyprus.

The AP examined over 80 ship profiles on MarineTraffic a maritime analytics provider and matched them with company records through IHS Maritime & Trade and the International Maritime Organization or IMO.

“They’re interested in the flag. They’re not interested in Cameroon” said Beatrice Gorez coordinator for the Coalition for Fair Fisheries Arrangements a group of organizations highlighting the impacts of EU-African fisheries arrangements that identified the recent connection between companies in EU member states and the Cameroon fleet.

Each of the vessels changed flags to Cameroon between 2019 and 2021 though they had no obvious link to the country and did not fish in its waters. The Trondheim and at least five others have a history of illegal unreported and unregulated fishing according to a report by the environmental group Greenpeace. Both the vessels and their owners conceal what they catch where it goes and who is financially benefiting from it maritime and company records show.

In recent years Cameroon has emerged as one of several go-to countries for the widely criticized “flags of convenience” system under which companies can — for a fee — register their ships in a foreign country even though there is no link between the vessel and the nation whose flag it flies.

The ships are supposed to abide by that nation’s fishing agreements with other countries. But experts say weak oversight and enforcement of fishing fleets by countries with open registries like Cameroon offer shipping companies a veil of secrecy that allows them to mask their operations.

That secrecy the experts say also undermines global attempts to sustainably manage fisheries and threatens the livelihoods of millions of people in regions like West Africa. Cameroonian officials say all the ships that fly its flag are legally registered and abide by all of its laws. But regulators in Europe recently warned the country that its inability to provide oversight of its fishing fleet could lead to a ban on fish from the country.

Cameroon’s flagged fishing fleet is minuscule compared to countries such as Liberia Panama or the Marshall Islands. But the rapid adoption of the country’s flag by some shipping companies accused of illegal fishing is raising alarm.

“This is a big issue” said Aristide Takoukam a biologist and founder of the African Marine Mammal Conservation Organization a non-profit based in Cameroon that monitors illegal fishing. “I don’t think Cameroon is able to monitor these vessels that are flying Cameroon flags outside its waters.”

A history of lax oversight

Cameroon has long been criticized for lax oversight of its fishing fleet. A study published last year in the journal African Security documented deep-rooted corruption in the ministries that oversee the fishing industry. In that same year the European Commission issued a “yellow card” to the country warning it to step up its actions against illegal fishing.

The commission identified a series of shortcomings including that the country had registered several fishing vessels — some of them accused of illegal fishing — under its flag in the past few years raising concerns about the nation’s ability to control and monitor the activities of its fleet.

If Cameroon does not comply after its initial warning the commission can issue a “red card” effectively listing them as a non-cooperating country. And it can ban their fish products from entering EU markets.

The commission’s report named a dozen fishing vessels registered between 2019 and 2020 whose names were not provided to them by Cameroonian authorities. At least eight of the 12 identified vessels are managed or owned by European companies. The AP found six more vessels not included in the EU report.

The European Commission did not respond to the AP’s requests for comment.

Data from two maritime intelligence companies Windward and Lloyd’s List Intelligence reveals an accelerated growth in the number of vessels that sail under the Cameroonian flag in the past four years from 14 vessels in 2018 to more than 129 in 2022. According to the Environmental Justice Foundation Cameroon’s fishing capacity is now nine times larger than it was before 2018.

While the number of flagged ships has grown the resources to monitor them have not kept pace a review of budget documents show. The documents show that the budget for the Ministry of Livestock Fisheries and Animal Industries’ control and supervision of fisheries declined 32% from 2019 to last year.

While countries have a right to allow vessels to adopt their nationality and fly their flag Article 91 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea requires a “genuine link” to be established between a vessel and its flag state.

Despite this foreign vessels in countries with open registries often have little to no relationship with their flag states. The responsibility falls on the flagged country to control operations of the vessels in their fleet including any illegal activity caused in other nations’ waters or on the high seas.

“The very point of flags of convenience is that it’s easy it’s cheap you can do it quickly and they are not necessarily looking at your history of compliance” said Julien Daudu senior campaigner at the Environmental Justice Foundation a British NGO focusing on environmental and human rights issues.

Paul Nkesi a representative of the agency that oversees fisheries the Ministry of Livestock Fisheries and Animal Industries says that although the government recognizes the need to step up its surveillance of industrial trawlers all vessels are registered lawfully in Cameroon.

All of the 14 EU-linked vessels registered to Cameroon are massive trawler ships at least 100 meters long; none operate in Cameroonian waters. Tracking data show the ships journeying between ports in Mauritania Angola South Africa and Namibia.

Still for the local fishermen who already compete with the Chinese-owned vessels in their waters the pressure of a growing fleet is creating concerns that Cameroon will be completely overpowered by foreign-owned vessels.

“Their business is only fishing; they can fish more than 1000 local boats. If those bigger [international] vessels enter here we’ll be really affected” said Simeon Oviri a local fisherman in Youpwe a coastal area near Douala Cameroon’s largest city.

Maurice Beseng a research associate at the University of Sheffield’s Institute for Sustainable Development and visiting fellow in maritime security at Coventry University said ships operating the flags of convenience appear to be using the system to circumvent the limits on fishing imposed by the European Union.

Differing sets of rules

The EU has fishing agreements with numerous countries and EU-flagged vessels are subject to stricter fishing restrictions around the world including in West Africa. But ships flagged to other countries outside the union are not subject to the same fishing limits.

For example data from Global Fishing Watch which uses satellite data and machine learning to monitor activity at sea shows most of the EU-affiliated Cameroonian-flagged trawlers appear to be fishing in Mauritania a country that has one of the most robust fishing agreements with the EU.

Under this agreement trawlers fishing with an EU flag have a total fishing capacity of 225000 tons for a maximum of 19 vessels. Once that quota is met all fishing activity has to stop.

But foreign vessels not under any agreement can fish in Mauritania under a free license. For the Cameroon-flagged trawlers this means they can go above the EU limit without having to land their catches in Mauritania.

The same goes for Gambia where industrial fishing vessels flagged to Cameroon may fish for any species outside the 7-mile nautical limit. However if the vessel is flagged to an EU member state the vessel can only fish for tuna and hake according to current sustainable fisheries partnership agreements between the small West African country and the EU.

“They are able to use that as a loophole to go beyond the agreements” said Charles Kilgour director of fisheries analysis for Global Fishing Watch.

The trawler vessels catch small fish species including horse mackerel sardinella and anchovy which recent stock assessments have shown are overfished along the Atlantic coast of West Africa.

These species are a lucrative and vital food source across the region with an estimated 6.7 million people dependent directly on them. Sardinella in particular are locally consumed in the region as an affordable source of protein and nutrients. Currently the Food and Agriculture Organization lists most of the targeted species as either fully exploited or overexploited.

Although it’s unclear where the fish goes after being unloaded in ports Beseng notes that the fish targeted by these vessels commonly enter EU markets to be used as fish meal and fish oil.

“Their impact is huge. These are species that the local population depend on"" Beseng said. “The increase in catch has increased food security challenges for coastal communities.”

While environmental and maritime security experts applauded the EU for issuing the yellow card to Cameroon for the lax oversight of its fishing fleet they say not enough is being done to target the EU-based companies that are the culprits.

“If you have European companies that are working under this flag"" Daudu said “you should also demonstrate exemplary behavior by going after your own nationals.”

But just finding the trail can be a daunting — and sometimes insurmountable — challenge. “It’s really like an ink bottle. You can get so far and then at some point it becomes completely opaque” Gorez said. “It makes it really difficult to find information on who owns these vessels.”

The companies

The AP tracked the 14 vessels ultimately to four active companies: Ocean Whale Co. Ltd in Malta INOK NV in Belgium Sundborn Management Ltd in Cyprus and Baltreids SIA in Latvia.

Ocean Whale operates several former Soviet trawlers including a ship formerly known as the Coral that has changed the flag under which it operates seven times since 2005. Recently it switched to the Cameroon flag after two months under the Russian flag.

Other ships in the company’s fleet were involved in a 2010-12 fishing license scandal in Senegal. Under an agreement that was neither allowed by law nor publicly disclosed the fisheries ministry granted several of its vessels licenses to catch small fish that were in danger of being overfished. The company and the minister denied wrongdoing.

The company did not respond to the AP’s requests for comment.

On its website the Ocean Whale Co. said it catches fish in Mauritania Guinea-Bissau Angola Namibia and that “the company is only engaged in legal fishing activities under the licenses issued by the coastal States and strictly adheres to all applicable environmental regulations.”

Another group of ships registered to EU companies and recently flagged to Cameroon were also named in the Senegalese fishing scandal. Data from the IMO the Maritime & Trade database and the Russian maritime register of shipping identifies the fleet’s owners as various companies in Cyprus and Belgium with each ultimately managed by Sundborn Management Ltd a company registered in Cyprus and INOK NV a company registered in Belgium.

Both INOK and Sundborn Management offer vessel registration services. Among them: choosing a “flag of convenience and a ship register for a vessel” in Malta Cyprus Panama Belize and other countries.

Neither company responded to requests for comments from the AP.

Belgium’s Department of Agriculture and Fisheries said it has been contacted by the European Commission about vessels managed by INOK that have reflagged to Cameroon between 2019 and 2020 but said it couldn’t comment on ongoing investigations.

Baltreids Ltd a Latvian fishing company established in 1998 manages five Cameroon-flagged vessels. The company structure includes two other holdings listed as official owners of the vessels in 2021 Limmat Inter SA based in the Seychelles and Oceanic Fisheries NB Ltd based in Canada.

Baltreids has been accused of a number of suspicious activities including insurance fraud and illegal fishing in the Atlantic Ocean. A 2020 Canadian Broadcasting Corp. investigation found that Oceanic Fisheries N.B. was flagged by global banks for more than $31 million in suspicious money transfers according to documents shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and other news organizations as part of the FinCEN Files.

When trying to track down a physical presence of the company in Canada the CBC hit a dead end.

The Latvian IUU Single Liaison Office the team that works with the EU Commission to regulate IUU fishing in Latvia told the AP that the Marshal Vasilevskiy was excluded from the Latvian Ship Register in November 2019 when the ship reflagged to Cameroon and the Kaptian Rusak was never registered under the Latvian flag. Instead the vessel is listed as owned by Fishing Company SA a company based in the British Virgin Islands.

IMO data lists ownership of the five Cameroon-flagged vessels owned by either Baltreids Ltd Limmat Inter SA or Oceanic Fisheries NB Ltd effective between 2019 and 2021. The New Brunswick corporate register indicates that Oceanic Fisheries N.B. has been inactive since October 2021.

Baltreids denied ever having links to Oceanic Fisheries N.B. or to engaging in any illegal fishing or money laundering to the CBC. In response to the AP the company said it presently owns two vessels registered in Latvia.

Upping the accountability

According to Gorez the timing of the ships’ reflagging to Cameroon in recent years seem to correspond with the 2017 adoption of the Sustainable Management of External Fishing Fleets  a regulation adopted by the European Parliament aimed to monitor EU vessels that operate outside EU waters.

The regulation requires fishing vessels to provide information regarding their operations’ sustainability and legality before their EU member state can issue them an authorization to fish in the waters of third countries.

“This regulation is really trying to catch these guys but as soon as it becomes too complicated then the easy way out is to change the flag” Gorez said. “It’s like when you try to catch soap with your hands. It slips and goes somewhere else.”

Since 2010 the EU has incorporated other provisions to make its nationals more accountable for fisheries operations regardless of country or vessel flags — most notably by penalizing EU nationals who engage in or support illegal or unregulated fishing anywhere in the world under any flag.

But it’s up to the member states to address the issue. Gorez says the states involved in this matter — Latvia Malta Belgium and Cyprus — have so far shown little interest.

“We can see the duplicity of the EU in terms of their effort to fight IUU fishing. They’ve come up with good regulations but when you go deep into how this is implemented in practice you see that there are a lot of loopholes” Beseng said.

Part of the SMEFF regulation is to maintain a database including information on the beneficial owners of operations by vessels flagged in an EU member state. As of now the information remains confidential.

“How can you expect an official in a remote country that sees a vessel coming to be able to easily retrace the whole history of the vessel by himself if the former flag state does not put that information online?” said Daudu. “It would cost a lot of time. It would take a lot of verification. Sometimes it’s so well concealed that you can’t even find information.”

Deputy Editor

The proposed merger of CBZ Holdings and ZB Financial Holdings (ZBFH) which is envisaged to create a financial behemoth capable of underwriting big projects could come unstuck due to inherent complexities in consummating the deal especially at a time when legacy shareholding issues in ZBFH are still outstanding while the 2005 transfer of Beverly Building Society to CBZ is also increasingly coming under the spotlight it has been learnt.

It is believed ZBFH is desperate to see the deal over the line especially after its proposal to amalgamate ZB Bank and ZB Building Society (formerly Intermarket Building Society) – designed to meet the stipulated US$30 million minimum capital requirement by December 31 2022 – recently fell through.

In January 2020 the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) increased minimum capital requirements for various classes of banking institutions.

Although the deadline for compliance was December 31 2020 it was later pushed back by 12 months owing to complications arising from the coronavirus pandemic.

However by December 2021 only five out of the 18 operating banking institutions – AFC Commercial Bank Nedbank Zimbabwe CBZ Building Society National Building Society and ZB Building Society – were unable to meet the deadline.

ZBFH then proposed to merge ZB Bank ZB Building Society and Intermarket Banking Corporation by year-end.

Setback

But The Sunday Mail Business understands the transaction is now dead in the water.

It has since emerged Transnational Holdings Limited (THL) which is a “direct shareholder” in Intermarket Holdings Limited (IHL) the company that owns the Building Society last year wrote to ZBFH raising its objection to the deal “until the Government-brokered settlement for the resolution of the dispute between Transnational and ZBFH over the scandalous and fraudulent acquisition of Intermarket by ZBFH is fully implemented”.

“We note with concern ZBFH’s continuous brazen spurning of the Government-brokered settlement of the Intermarket-ZBFH dispute … Until the settlement is fully implemented Intermarket and ZBFH remain separate entities” said Mr Nicholas Vingirai founder of investment vehicle THL in a letter dated November 22 2021 which was addressed to ZBFH company secretary Mr Tinashe Masiiwa.

“All parties should avoid complicating matters by doing the honourable thing … The blatant colossal ‘white-collar’ financial fraud and concealment committed by ZBFH executives in the Intermarket case since 2004 makes a mockery of all pronouncements of good governance … It will be another ‘sad day’ for the group and the market if the current ZBFH team were to continue on the same fraudulent path and the misinformation of shareholders the investing public and the regulator.”

The letter was copied to ZBFH chairperson Mrs Pamela Chiromo RBZ Governor Dr John Mangudya and Finance and Economic Development Permanent Secretary Mr George Guvamatanga.

The May 2016 Settlement Agreement negotiated by Government ordered the return of the IHL Group which was controversially acquired by ZBFH in 2006 through buying off equity held by the RBZ in Intermarket to Mr Vingirai’s THL.

Although THL reportedly agreed in principle to accept a 33 percent stake in ZBFH as restitution only 22 percent had been transferred by August 2020.

While the remaining 12 percent was expected to be settled through the transfer of part of the 378 percent shares held by NSSA in ZBFH the envisaged transaction has seemingly become impossible after the shares were snapped up by Datvest Nominees which incidentally has a shareholding in CBZ Holdings.

Government decided to restore Mr Vingirai’s assets after an investigation absolved him of externalisation and breaching exchange-control regulations which lay at the heart of the challenges his business faced in 2004.

In a letter addressed to Mr Tawanda Nyambirai Mr Vingirai’s lawyer on October 1 2012 then-RBZ Governor Dr Gideon Gono indicated the banker and former Commonwealth Secretariat money market field expert “was a victim of some elaborate skulduggery which is now a common feature against successful black businesspeople”.

THL has recently been pushing for a separation from ZBFH owing to inordinate delays in implementing the Settlement Agreement.

However separation means ZB has to restore Intermarket to its early 2006 position and this involves restoring all the Intermarket branches countrywide of which Intermarket Building Society alone had no less than 45 fully operational branches at the time.

Realising the potential negative impact that this could have on ZB the central bank reportedly began pushing for a deal.

On its part Government has been actively working to bring closure to the long-running dispute.

With the collapse of the proposed ZB Bank and ZB Building Society merger ZBFH is now hard-pressed to come up with an alternative viable plan to ensure compliance which CBZ conveniently provides.

It is also believed that CBZ Holdings is desperate to attach itself to the superior quality of IHL’s balance sheet and especially its property and insurance assets.

The Sunday Mail Business understands there have been a series of behind-the-scenes lobbying for the merger among shareholders and parties are generally amenable to the transaction.

But sources say the shareholding dispute affecting ZBFH could complicate the deal and ultimately scupper the whole process.

THL which is the second-largest shareholder in the banking group with 235 percent after Datvest Nominees (34 percent) reportedly agrees to the merger in principle but is pushing for full restitution before the deal can be consummated arguing that merging the two entities before internal “hygiene issues” are addressed would be tantamount to putting the cart before the horse.

Attempts to get a comment from Mr Vingirai was fruitless while questions sent a fortnight ago to ZBFH had not been responded to by the time of going to print despite repeated assurances.

Sticky Beverly Issue

Sources further claim the “controversial” acquisition of Beverly Building Society by CBZ in 2005 could return to haunt parties to the deal both of which coincidentally were central to the transfer of the asset from IHL.

Apparently it is IHL’s bid to buy Beverly Building Society (BBS) in 2003 that set off a chain of events that saw the ambitious bank being put under curatorship while the building society was subsequently transferred to CBZ.

After reportedly making about US$3 million in offshore payments to London-based Andrew Weir & Company (AWC) IHL was accused of externalisation although it had curiously received authorisation from the central bank.

In 2004 the RBZ-appointed curator Mr Ngoni Kudenga made a court application seeking to attach IHL’s group CEO Mr Vingirai’s financial and immovable assets after claiming the veteran banker had “reportedly fled the country and his whereabouts are unknown” an averment later denied by Mr Vingirai.

According to an affidavit dated July 14 2004 the court order was used to sell Mr Vingirai’s personal investments such as Zimbabwe Stock Exchange-listed shares as well as those of his investment vehicle Transnational Holdings Limited which wholly controlled IHL.

AWC were also forced to return US$27 million of the amount that had been paid to it by IHL.

In a letter to ZBFH directors who curiously were now also IHL directors at the time then-company secretary Mr Charles Kathemba indicated that AWC agreed to pay back US$700 000 cash and $250 million (apparently a far cry from what should have been the local currency equivalent of the outstanding US$2 million.)

The central bank directed that the exchange rate applicable at the time AWC initially offered to repatriate the funds originally paid to it by IHL be used for purposes of settling the matter.

“It would appear RBZ has made this decision primarily in order to facilitate the consummation of an unrelated transaction the acquisition of Beverly Building Society by CBZ Holdings Limited” said Mr Kathemba in the letter then.

THL insists that it suffered double jeopardy as the money repatriated back was funnelled into ZBFH which by then had effectively taken over IHL while Mr Vingirai’s assets were also seized purportedly to repay the funds paid to AWC.

Investigations by independent experts have since established that in the two-year period between 2004 and 2006 personal assets that were sold off ostensibly to recoup funds that were purportedly externalised include 111 million Econet shares; 86 million shares in Cassava; 125 million shares in CBZ; one million shares in Barclays; 36 million in FML; 600 000 in FBC; 197 million shares in ZB; 122 million in TSL; 730 million shares in Willdale; nine million in TA Holdings; 16 million in Cottco; and 101 million in Zimnat.

Overall the inherent complications and loose ends in what could be one of the biggest deals in the financial services sector in recent times are making the task increasingly daunting.

Because of the sheer size of the envisaged merged entity the Competition and Tariff Commission (CTC) is reportedly intently looking into the proposal.

Under separate plans to ensure CBZ Building Society complies to the RBZ’s minimum capital requirements CBZ Bank and CBZ Building Society will be amalgamated.",,,,,,

A routine inspection 90 minutes before the gates opened at JFK Stadium in July of 1989 revealed a slew of fire-code violations and safety hazards confirming a report that warned the city a year prior about the condition of the 63-year-old stadium in South Philadelphia.

But there already were 20000 Grateful Dead fans waiting outside. So officials — fearful of sparking a riot like the one they faced a few years earlier during a Rolling Stones concert — let the show go on.

The Dead jammed for three hours played 19 songs and the gates to JFK Stadium never opened again. Mayor Wilson Goode closed the stadium six days later eventually announcing that it would be razed as repairs were too costly.

The goliath horseshoe stadium could hold more than 100000 fans and had hosted everything from Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney’s 1926 heavyweight title fight to 1985’s Live Aid. And soon it would meet a wrecking ball.

It didn’t take long to determine what could be built on the 55-acre site as Flyers owner Ed Snider was already in the early stages of planning a new home for his team to share with the 76ers. More than seven years passed between Jerry Garcia walking off the stage and the opening of the CoreStates Center — first called Spectrum II and now known as the Wells Fargo Center — on the site of JFK Stadium.

The planning negotiations and building moved with the pace of a Grateful Dead concert as the process never seemed to end. There were disagreements between the Flyers and Sixers an attempt by New Jersey to build an arena and lure the teams from South Philly and years of stop-and-go planning. In August 1996 it finally opened.

And the road to that night started with a Grateful Dead concert in a historic stadium that was falling apart. It’s a path worth revisiting as the Sixers announced plans earlier this month to leave that arena in 2031 for a new home on Market Street.

Time to go

The Sesquicentennial — America’s 150th birthday — largely is remembered as a flop as the celebration lost millions of dollars because of a low turnout for the World’s Fair-like exposition in South Philly

But the event did give birth to JFK Stadium — initially called Sesquicentennial Stadium — and the largest-attended sporting event in city history when 120000 people watched Tunney top Dempsey in September 1926 for the heavyweight title.

The stadium resembled the L.A. Coliseum and was designed by the same architect behind the Strawbridge’s building on Eighth and Market streets. JFK hosted the Army-Navy games for decades the Eagles for a few seasons and mega-rock concerts every summer.

JFK Stadium was a key piece of the city but eventually started to fall apart because of a lack of upkeep. A report commissioned by the city in 1988 said repairs would cost $4.5 million. But none of them were completed when the Grateful Dead came to town.

“It was terrible. It was tough to manage that place” said Jay Snider whose company Spectaguard provided security for JFK concerts in the 1980s. “We had wars in that place. I remember with the Rolling Stones it was sold out and tickets just kept getting sold. There were like thousands of people outside trying to get in and luckily we had good relationships with the Philadelphia mounted police and they were doing their best and what they could.

“But they were rushing those gates and the old gates were these iron bars that went up. They were throwing bottles at them and they exploded. We had a guy who lost his sight from glass in his eye. It was bad. They’d rush the gates and break them down and we’d try to get them closed again. That place was ready to come down. It had not been renovated.”

The need for an arena

The Spectrum opened in 1967 and “America’s Showplace” started to show its age in the late 1980s. New buildings in Detroit and Orlando redefined what arenas could be and the rising costs of player salaries created a need for more revenue streams such as luxury boxes.

So Snider — even before the city locked up JFK Stadium — knew he needed a new building.

“Like the Spectrum a lot of buildings were built as the NBA and NHL expanded in the 1960s and early 1970s” said Snider’s son Jay who then was the Flyers president. “But 25 30 years later everything changed dramatically. The revenue the corporate boxes the food service all the upgraded amenities you could offer fans. Just to keep up financially it became a necessity not a luxury.”

The Flyers wanted to keep the Sixers as tenants in the new arena but owner Harold Katz — who said he had “the worst lease in the NBA” — had already been talking to New Jersey about building an arena on the Camden waterfront. And soon Jersey started talking with the Flyers too. Perhaps the two teams would move together from South Philly to South Jersey.

Jersey’s offer was great — much better financially than building in South Philly Jay Snider said — but ultimately the Flyers decided to stay home. They appealed to Katz knowing that they needed the 76ers as tenants and did not want to compete with a rival building.

“It’s not maybe better they were better” Jay Snider said. “The arena was built virtually 100 percent with private money. As I recall there was $12-15 million by the state in infrastructure and maybe one small low-interest loan. But basically we didn’t hold the city or state up for anything.

“It was a really sweet deal but Dad was loyal. Even though we had a lot of Flyers fans and Spectrum fans who came to all the other events from New Jersey and in Delaware he was just loyal to Philadelphia about being the home of the Flyers.”

The plans were announced at a City Hall news conference in June 1991 for a 21000-seat arena to open in the fall of 1994. The new arena they said would also include a parking garage and shopping mall that would link the Spectrum to its new neighbor. Those plans ultimately were scrapped but Jay Snider and other executives traveled to Disney World and Disneyland searching for inspiration as they wanted to build more than just an arena.

“We had a lot of ideas” Snider said. “We had all that space. Thought about a major entertainment center a la Universal Studios.”

A football stadium instead

JFK Stadium was razed in February 1992 with groundbreaking scheduled for May. But that day passed without a shovel touching the dirt. The deal that was announced at City Hall had fallen through in October 1993. Katz wanted out as he believed he was being shortened and started talking again to New Jersey.

With the plans paused Ed Rendell — who became mayor in 1992 — told Eagles owner Norman Braman that he could build a football-only stadium on the site of JFK if Snider was unable to build his new arena. The Eagles launched a feasibility study in December 1993 and Braman said he wanted to build a stadium like the one used by the Buffalo Bills.

The pressure was on for the Flyers and Sixers to come together as their tract of land in South Philly seemed to be slipping away.

A deal is made

Snider and Katz four months after their deal fell apart came to an agreement in February 1994. A month earlier the Sixers’ move to Camden was squashed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman who wasn’t convinced the stadium could lure enough non-basketball events from Philadelphia and even consulted with Jon Bon Jovi. For the Sixers it was back to Philly.

The building — which originally was supposed to open in eight months — would open three years later. By then Katz no longer owned the Sixers as he sold the team to Comcast just before the team left the Spectrum with Snider being the managing partner.

The arena has not hosted a heavyweight title fight like JFK Stadium did but it has hosted two political conventions WrestleMania and the NBA and NHL championships. Comcast which still owns the building is nearing the completion of a years-long renovation it says will make the arena “essentially a new facility.” The company referred to the 26-year arena this week as “the new Wells Fargo Center.”

But those renovations don’t sound to be enough to keep the Sixers who plan to head north to Market Street instead of east to Camden. To do so they’ll have to knock down some of the old Gallery Mall a slightly less historic place than JFK Stadium. The new arena is still nine years away and if their last new arena is an example getting there could be a long strange trip.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9tZWdhLW1pbGxpb25zLWxvdHRlcnktZXhwZXJ0LWFkdmljZS1wbGF5ZXJzLXBvdGVudGlhbC13aW5uZXJzLTE3MjkxNjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mega Millions Lottery: Expert Advice for Players and Potential Winners,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/mega-millions-lottery-expert-advice-players-potential-winners-1729162 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9tZWdhLW1pbGxpb25zLWxvdHRlcnktZXhwZXJ0LWFkdmljZS1wbGF5ZXJzLXBvdGVudGlhbC13aW5uZXJzLTE3MjkxNjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbGV2aXR0b3dubm93LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzMwL2Jhbmstb2YtYW1lcmljYS1jbG9zaW5nLWZhaXJsZXNzLWhpbGxzLWJyYW5jaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank Of America Closing Fairless Hills Branch,"The Bank of America in Fairless Hills in November 2021.

Bank of America has filed paperwork with federal regulators to close an area branch.

The North Carolina-based bank chain filed paperwork with U.S. Department of the Treasury independent bureau Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that they will be closing their location along South Oxford Valley Road in the Queen Anne Plaza shopping center in Bristol Township’s Fairless Hills section.

Bank of America said the location will close for good on October 25. It advises residents to close safe deposit boxes during branch business hours.

The Philadelphia Business Journal reported Bank of America has 78 locations in the Philadelphia area. It recently closed locations in Montgomery County Philadelphia and Ocean City New Jersey.

Bank of America has spend time over the past decade closing branches in the region.

The bank is the fourth largest deposit taker in the region the Philadelphia Business Journal reported.

The pandemic forced consumers to become more involved with virtual and mobile banking options which has sped up a trend of major banks consolidating locations.

Bank of America operates an existing branch at the Marketplace at Oxford Valley on East Lincoln Highway and several area ATMs. Outside of the Levittown area the bank has nearby branches in Bensalem Township Lower Southampton Township Newtown Township and Trenton.

Now they profit big,"Shubham Saharan

Bloomberg

The last time inflation burned hot consumers could put money in the bank and watch it grow like the prices on store shelves easing much of the pain.

Not this time – and that’s stoking profits for U.S. lenders.

The gap between what banks pay depositors and what they earn from lending money to borrowers hasn’t been so wide in the past half-century with the average savings account paying a skimpy 0.06%. Many banks are telling shareholders that so-called deposit betas measuring how quickly deposit rates rise in the wake of Fed hikes will remain advantageous for banks in the months ahead as they’re not yet feeling much pressure to pay savers more.

Betas are now the buzziest bit of jargon across the financial industry. The phrase was invoked more times during Bank of America Corp.’s analyst briefings in the past two months than in the prior two years combined. This month the lender’s executives predicted interest income may climb by as much as $1 billion in the third quarter from the second as they stay “disciplined” in what they pay customers.

“Our consumer-banking segment continues to see good momentum” Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan told analysts July 18. “We grew loans at the fastest quarterly pace in nearly three years.”

The reasons that savers are getting so little relief are myriad starting with the Federal Reserve which waited until inflation was strong before it began raising interest rates from longtime lows. From there it takes time for deposit rates to rise too. The result is pain: The consumer price index jumped 9.1% in June while banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co. offered deposit rates as low as 0.01% according to their websites.

While deposit rates are widely expected to tick incrementally higher as the Fed’s rate hikes for borrowers take hold there’s ample evidence that the benefits for savers will come slowly. That’s because many banks face little competitive pressure to pay more. Many are flush with cash thanks in part to a surge in deposits that piled up during Covid-era lockdowns and stimulus programs.

Even big clients that aren’t doing a lot of business with a bank aside from parking their money will have little leverage to push for a higher interest rate on their deposits.

“Banks have plenty of room on the funding side” said Erika Najarian a banking analyst at UBS Group AG. That means they can allow “more rate-sensitive deposit-only relationships to walk because they don’t necessarily need that funding.

While deposits have been slipping somewhat at many banks it’s unlikely that enough consumers will switch lenders to ratchet up pressure quickly even as online and community-based institutions burnish rates to attract inflows. Synchrony Financial and American Express Co. for example each offer rates of at least 1.5%.

One reason for that inertia is that only people of a certain age can remember an era when banks routinely paid much more interest on deposits blunting the impact of inflation. Another is that accounts aren’t as portable as they were decades ago. Many customers have their paychecks deposited directly and arrange for bills to be paid automatically making switching to a new bank a hassle.

To be sure the more generous rates banks paid for deposits in the 1980s were a result of longstanding inflation and the Fed’s efforts to tame that with much higher interest rates for borrowing.

This time both interest and deposit rates are coming off ultra-low levels said Greg McBride chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com which tracks the deposit rates banks offer. Banks will want to see the benefit from higher borrowing rates before they start to pass that along to savers he said.

Getting to higher deposit rates will also depend on how long the Fed keeps borrowing rates elevated Najarian said. She suggests deposit rates might reach 1.2% before the Fed starts to ease again."

Illustrating his observation the former Sinn Féin national party chairperson and Derry City councillor cited operations including Bloody Sunday (January 30 1972) which resulted in the murder of 14 people and the Springhill / Westrock massacre (July 9 1972) in which three teenagers and a Catholic priest were murdered by the British army.

Said Mitchel: “'Free Derry' as it became known goes right back to the Battle of the Bogside when the British army was initially introduced and there have been several subsequent manifestations.

Mitchel McLaughlin erecting an Irish street sign in Cable Street in the Bogside. Included from left: Sinn Féin activists Martha McClelland Tony Brown Dodie McGuinness Donnacha McNelis and Tony Doherty.

“The 'Free Derry' barricades were substantial but it was never believed they could prevail against the British army had it wanted to come in. British soldiers could just have climbed over them or smashed through them.

“There was a very healthy debate at the time about the barricades. They inhibited the ability of the Brits to roam in and out freely however they also inhibited the IRA going out on operational activity. There were only so many points of entry and egress and in reality this actually made it easier for the Brits to track the movement of known suspects.

“Motorman was well flagged in advance. People like Bishop Farren had been alerted I suspect by the RUC Commander Frank Lagan who had also taken a stand against the deployment of the British army on Bloody Sunday in fairness to him albeit quite ineffectively but he had at least recorded his objection.

“He was also briefing people like John Hume and others that the Brits were bringing in heavy armaments. They were already offshore and ready to be landed. They were coming up Lough Foyle. The briefings were quite detailed. The idea was obviously to alert the IRA so as not to start a firefight” he said.

Mitchel contended the British army was not concerned about losing such a firefight rather it was concerned about killing more civilians in Derry just six months after Bloody Sunday.

He added: “The decision was subsequently taken by the Republican movement in the knowledge the British army was coming in to move all the gear out of Derry stand down the IRA and not to get involved in any conflict on the streets. This was pretty well observed. There was a considerable amount of discipline and control in those circumstances.

“What I remember about the day itself and it made you wonder if the Brits were able to predict or control the weather was that it was a morning like no other. I don’t remember any similar mornings. There was the heaviest fog I have ever seen in Derry. It was perfect cover for them coming in.

“Myself and some others were driving around Creggan looking for them and I nearly drove into a Centurion tank. It was huge the size of a building and it was adapted with a massive shovel for moving the barricades. It was very early in the morning about four o'clock. We had to make a hasty retreat. They did not interfere with us.

“I presume there were soldiers behind them in smaller vehicles which would have been more mobile but the tank would simply have rolled over us if we hadn’t reversed and got offside” said Mitchel.

As the day went on he recalled information starting to filter back about people being beaten and people being arrested.

“There seemed to be quite a few arrests although there were not many people charged afterwards. They were just scooped and taken away.

“Then word came through about young Daniel Hegarty (15) and Seamus Bradley (19) being shot dead. Lethal force was used again in Derry within a few short months of Bloody Sunday just in case people thought the first incidence was a mistake and the Brits would avoid it in future.

“They minimised it but they were certainly prepared to use it. Maybe they couldn’t necessarily contain every single soldier but they shot young Hegarty using a machine gun and Seamus Bradley was shot deliberately as he was arrested. I don’t think they knew him. He wasn’t a known Volunteer. He wasn’t on the run.

“The people who were on the run who were identified they were gone. They were not going to make themselves available for arrest” revealed Mitchel.

According to Mitchel the efficacy of putting barricades around Derry had been well debated.

“It raised questions including 'Could you actually do it?' and if you did could you take responsibility for ensuring safe passage for milkmen bread men oil deliveries everything which also provided the opportunity for the Brits to actually send people in in tankers and things like that who would not necessarily be spotted.

“Interestingly I remember a wee man called [Gerard] O'Grady from Rinmore Drive who was a former Irish army officer. He was a member of the Alliance Party a very rare kind of animal in those days. We were making barricades and they tended to go upwards but he advised us that was wrong and they should be more spread out. He said: 'Spread them out and they'll be harder to shift.'

“Our barricades were just piles of stones. They were made like a wall. The Brits could dismantle them. Even the jeeps could knock them down and scoop them up so it was an interesting dynamic to have Mr O'Grady's advice.

“It was a community in revolt after Bloody Sunday including this wee man who was avowedly Alliance. It was very game and brave to be an Alliance member in those days. There were not many people giving him room” said Mitchel.

People in 'Free Derry' were also debating what would happen if the British army had free run.

“Nobody actually knew the answer to that in advance” said Mitchel. “Some people were arguing 'Well if they come in we might have a shot at them'. Other people were saying 'If they come in they can do lightning raids' and the example of Colm Keenan and Eugene McGillan was given.

“Colm and Eugene were sleeping in their billets in Dove Gardens when the alarm went up because there were vigilantes on the barricades at night. It was a Brit raiding party. They just opened up with automatic fire and Eugene and Colm ran into it. The two of them were not even fully dressed. I think Eugene was in his bare feet.

“So people had that in mind. The Brits could come in and do that again. They could do it any time they wanted. Sneak in shoot anybody in the street and just make allegations they were shot at by whoever.

“The arguments went back and forth but the Brits in their own way and I think at the end of the day stupidly just stalled that complete argument. They moved into the Gasyard the High Flats and the Essex factory and built fortifications and lookout towers. They also moved into the Shell garage out in the Foyle Road. They set up down at the bottom of Abercorn Road guarding the Craigavon bridge” said Mitchel.

The British army ringed the city centre. They also had Fort George on the Strand Road.

“They were down at the border too where they tried to constrain traffic” said Mitchel “but in the Gasyard in particular and in the High Flats they were eventually actually driven out because they had the same kind of problem the IRA had; they were sitting targets. There was a time when they were actually flying supplies into the Gasyard.

“And even ordinary punters and some of the community workers who were not necessarily Republican were saying 'You would think they would know that is a stupid place to be' because from the Lone Moor Road or any of the high ground at all you could just ping away at them. They took a lot of casualties in the Gasyard more than anywhere else.

“In a sense that proved that while the idea of 'Free Derry' politically had some kind of purchase at the end of the day it had more strategic disadvantage than it had advantage. I think people kind of moved off the idea not because the Brits were actually in the area but because they had much more operational opportunity. Eventually the British army was driven off the High Flats Essex the Gasyard and the Foyle Road Shell garage.”

Mitchel described Motorman as a “significant day” not least because of the casualties.

“There was no more 'Free Derry' but in fact 'Free Derry' has existed in a whole lot of ways since maybe not so much now but many times during operations including SAS shootings the whole of Derry rejected the British government and Stormont and whatever. It was a society in revolt.

“Free Derry and the different variations of that theme throughout the North areas where the cops and Brits were excluded became a debating point probably internationally as well.

“Maybe it politicised a lot of people as well in the sense that the misbehaviour of the RUC and the Brits once they got back in cemented that politicisation process.

“UltimatelyI don’t think the Brits got much strategic gain out of Motorman and they took a lot of pain and casualties which they might not have got if they had stayed out but they maybe could not stay out because of their sense of their own importance. The British government was listening to the unionists ranting and raving about 'no go areas' on a daily basis and the media played its part in building the pressure. The Brits were always going to have to come in” said Mitchel.

Perhaps surprisingly Mitchel said he did not think the demise of 'Free Derry' was not mourned for very long.

He said: “I don’t think the IRA lamented it anyway. Free Derry after Burntollet was symbolic more than anything.

“It didn’t stop the RUC coming in and wrecking St Columb's Wells. The slogan on the Free Derry wall which survived was a battle in itself. The authorities wanted to demolish the house to make way for the flyover a British military intervention. But it did not come down. The only thing not up for discussion was the dismantling of the wall.

“Bearing in mind there were those who were in support of the campaign and those who were not I think one of the things they probably all agreed on in an unsaid way was they were glad to see the back of the barricades.

“The presence of the British army on the streets was resented especially after Bloody Sunday albeit the majority of the families were not Republican. Derry was in essence anti-British and anti-Stormont between the history of Stormont and the discrimination against Derry to start with and then the Brits coming in reinforced this.

“And division was there between the SDLP and the Provos. The SDLP was arguing an unarmed political approach while the IRA were responding to the lethal force the British army and RUC were using. That was what was dividing people. It was not over the nature of the conflict. It is like the Good Friday Agreement. The war is over but the conflict continues” Mitchel now aged 76 concluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Only six boys have ever broken 2:14 while in the 11-12 age group.

The swim is a huge personal best for the 12-year-old who entered the meet with a 2:22.61. In prelims Lee got down to a 2:17.75 before lowering his mark again in finals. In total he dropped 8.45 seconds over the course of the day.

Lee – Finals Lee – Prelims 50 32.13 32.56 100 1:06.00 (33.87) 1:07.62 (35.06) 150 1:40.15 (34.15) 1:43.16 (35.54) 200 2:14.16 (34.01) 2:17.75 (34.59)

In finals Lee was faster than his prelims self on every 50 of the race. However it’s the improvements made to his middle hundred that particularly stand out. He dropped over a second on both the second and third 50 from prelims to finals which is where he picked up the majority of his time.

It wasn’t just the 200 back where Lee shone though. He also put up 2:18.48 in the 200 IM good for second best in his age group this season. That was a 2.08 second drop for him and his first time under 2:20. He also set new personal bests in the 100 free and 400 free dropping over six seconds in the latter to get down to 4:29.53.

Other Notable Results

15-year-old Ella Jablonski cracked 1:00 in the 100 fly for the first time. The Seattle Metropolitan Aquatic Club swimmer won the race in 59.70. It was a .73 drop on the day for her as she’d gone 1:00.27 in prelims before getting under the barrier in finals. Jablonski swam at Santa Clara Futures this weekend. She was unable to get under again but it’s still a huge personal best for her.

Lee’s West Coast Aquatics teammate Aiden Hammer dropped an 8:26.22 in the 800 free. That was a huge swim for the 14-year-old and an almost 16 second drop. However Hammer wasn’t done. At the Santa Clara Futures meet Hammer dropped even more time clocking 8:21.93 for the second fastest swim in his age group this season and 20th all time.

Noah Laird and Ben Bricca both hit multiple junior national cuts. Laird qualified in the 200 and 400 IMs swimming 2:07.78 and 4:32.89 respectively. For the 18-year-old the 400 IM cut is especially impressive; he entered with a 4:43.14 and dropped over ten seconds on the day to make his cut. Bricca swam 57.38 in the 100 back and 2:05.95 in the 200 back to qualify in both those events.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oZXJhbGRuZXQvbmFtZS9rZW5uZXRoLXdpbHNvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjM1MDE1NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kenneth Wilson Obituary (1951 - 2022) - Everett WA - The Herald (Everett),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/heraldnet/name/kenneth-wilson-obituary?id=36350154 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oZXJhbGRuZXQvbmFtZS9rZW5uZXRoLXdpbHNvbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjM1MDE1NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZlcm5vbm1vcm5pbmdzdGFyLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2pvaG4tY2hhcmxlcy1yZWlk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Charles Reid - Obituary -,John's family was profoundly saddened to say good-bye to him on July 30 2022.

The agency added that the decision also could divert funding away from the state’s policy goals including reducing greenhouse gas emissions through clean energy projects and achieving climate resilience.

The controversy has been brewing since May 5 when the Office of People’s Counsel (OPC) an independent state agency representing Maryland’s utilities customers filed a petition with the Public Service Commission which oversees and regulates Maryland utilities.

In the petition the OPC asked the Commission to direct electric utilities in the state to disclose the plans and projects they planned to submit for grants under the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The petition said it is in the public interest that electric companies provide reports to the Commission on any funding they have applied for and explain how they intend to use the funds in relation to the state’s policy goals as well as any conditions that must be met to obtain the grant.

Signed into law by the Biden administration on Nov. 15 last year the Act provided $42.8 billion in federal funds to among other things support the development of clean energy systems over $50 billion for improving grid resilience and another $6.5 billion for energy efficiency projects. The funds are being allocated to state and local governments through various grants.

The infrastructure act “makes substantial grant funding available to the State’s utilities to support system resiliency promote innovative technologies and help the State meet its greenhouse gas reduction goals” said People’s Counsel David Lapp in a statement.

He added “Public input and transparency are critical for making sure Maryland utilities use the IIJA’s federal grant opportunities to further the public interest.” Such a proceeding will give the public and state policymakers access to information and an opportunity for input Lapp said.

On Friday Adina Kauzlarich communications manager for Pepco Holdings released a statement on behalf of Pepco BGE and Delmarva Power that said all three Exelon-owned utilities are “taking the necessary steps now to mitigate the effects of climate change as indicated by our own Path to Clean of net zero carbon emissions.”

The federal infrastructure bill the statement said “will provide the opportunity for utilities like BGE Delmarva Power and Pepco to request funding that would support a broad array of projects and initiatives that will help mitigate the impacts of climate change and help to further advance clean safe reliable and affordable energy service for our customers and communities. We look forward to the opportunity to potentially leverage IIJA funding to help further support the clean energy and climate goals of the communities we serve.”

Earlier in response to OPC’s petition five utility companies asked the commission to deny OPC’s request to open the grants process to public input.

The companies argued that allowing public comments could cause “undue delay and jeopardize their chances to receive awards in what is a highly competitive process.” They proposed instead to provide periodic reports on grant application opportunities and progress.

In its June 29 ruling on the matter the Public Service Commission denied OPC’s petition to allow public input and oversight of the federal funds available to the utilities under IIJA and said the utilities’ proposal to submit periodic reports to the Commission was sufficient. The ruling further said that interested parties could submit their comments on programs and opportunities available to the utilities under IIJA but did not require the companies to accommodate those suggestions in any way.

Tori Leonard the PSC’s communications director said in a statement that the Commission “recognizes the competitive and time-sensitive nature of the IIJA application process and that disclosure of certain information and undue delays could disadvantage utilities—it is in the best interest of Maryland’s utility customers not to leave this money on the table.”

She added that the Commission encourages the utilities to review and fully consider comments filed in the docket when pursuing IIJA funding and found that OPC’s recommendation to explicitly solicit written comments “for actions the Commission should take to facilitate the application receipt and deployment of available federal funds” is beyond the scope of the General Assembly’s directive in the Climate Solutions Now Act to “provide assistance and support to electric companies applying for federal funds.”

The PSC’s ruling set off widespread criticism from environmental groups citizens organizations and state delegates asking the Public Service Commission to review its decision.

“The commission cannot leave the decision-making regarding this once-in-a-generation funding opportunity solely to the utilities” wrote the chairmen of the state legislature’s Economic Matters Committee and Appropriations Committee in a June 29 letter.

The committee chairmen recommended that the Commission consult “low-income advocates distributed energy suppliers environmental advocates state and local agencies and financing experts” to craft proposals that meet the needs of Maryland’s residents. “The utilities’ proposal to provide after-the-fact reports is fundamentally flawed” the legislators wrote and “provides no assurances that the proposals will be designed in a manner that benefits all Marylanders and achieves the State’s policy goals.”

Separately a group of 14 nonprofit organizations known as the Climate Partners filed a joint letter in support of the OPC’s petition calling the Commission’s ruling “disconcerting at best” and saying it was issued without “due process or consideration of the myriad of stakeholder voices.”

The organizations said in the letter that IIJA grants must align with Maryland’s climate objectives under the Climate Solutions Now Act which seeks to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent from 2006 levels by 2031 and achieve net-zero statewide greenhouse gas emission by 2045.

Recently passed by the Maryland General Assembly the Climate Solutions Now Act requires the Public Service Commission to engage with “utility providers to apply for and access” federal funds in coordination with the state’s Department of Environment and Energy Administration.

“[I]t is incumbent upon this Commission to ensure that this funding opportunity addresses Maryland’s goals rather than solely addressing the priorities of the utilities” the letter added.

On July 27 the Office of People’s Counsel filed a motion for rehearing asking the Commission to reverse its decision. OPC’s motion said the Commission’s June ruling puts the utilities in charge of decisions related to IIJA funding which undermines OPC’s and other stakeholders’ ability to advocate for better use of federal funds and provide public oversight.

In a statement OPC said “The PSC will fail to meet its responsibility to regulate and supervise the utilities” unless it reverses its June 29 decision and makes sure the state and its utility customers get maximum benefit from the billions of dollars under the federal infrastructure act.

“The Commission’s job is to regulate and supervise the public utilities to make sure their IIJA grant applications are in the public interest and consistent with Maryland’s Climate Solutions Now Act” said OPC’s David Lapp. “The June order abdicates that responsibility by giving the utilities complete discretion over what IIJA funding to apply for.”

“The Act requires the utilities to report their IIJA funding applications their purposes and any conditions” Lapp said adding that it further authorizes the commission to “adopt regulations or issue orders” requiring electric utilities to apply for funding “in a timely manner.”

He cautioned that in the absence of any guidelines from the utilities commission on what constitutes a prudent use of federal funds utilities are encouraged to use public dollars for projects that increase costs for ratepayers.

“Federal grant money should reduce costs for utility customers not increase costs” he said. “Most of Maryland’s utilities are controlled by corporate holding companies with little connection to Maryland and with obligations to shareholders not to Maryland customers or to Maryland’s policy goals. Without effective regulation their plans for federal grant money will prioritize those private obligations over the public interest.”

Kim Coble executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters said “The Public Service Commission has the responsibility to ensure that the public’s best interests are taken care of. And for them and the utilities to oppose more transparency more input more insight from the wider stakeholders on how federal grants can be accessed used and brought to bear that improves life for Marylanders is really disappointing.”

Coble said that an unprecedented amount of federal funds is available for the next five years under IIJA and the impact of these investments will be felt for decades. “This once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity should be used to make real progress on climate change” she said adding “That is why it is all the more important to open up the conversation to maximize the potential for the right kind of investments of public money.”

The single paragraph on Wednesday’s Las Vegas City Council agenda isn’t being presented by the city attorney’s office which has been busy battling with the developer but as an administrative item for discussion and possible action. How much discussion and action are yet to be determined.

The timing is intriguing for many reasons not the least of which is that it comes in the wake of last week’s surprise ruling by District Judge Monica Trujillo that the city’s rejection of Lowie’s plans for a 65-acre parcel in the area constituted an unlawful taking. Although Trujillo didn’t determine damages her ruling followed a similar one last year by District Judge Timothy Williams. He decided the city’s efforts to interrupt a 35-acre development plan by a Lowie company was worth $34.1 million in damages.

Trujillo’s call from the bench was also interesting because it came when the appeal of the Williams decision by the city was still being considered by the Nevada Supreme Court. In other words there’s a chance Williams’ decision will be overturned.

Although it’s an easy thread to lose in the fog of multiple litigations the cases aren’t identical. In fact Trujillo’s ruling in the case reversed a previous decision to grant summary judgment and dismiss the 65-acre development lawsuit. That ruling was made by then-District Judge Douglas Herndon who now gets his mail at the state Supreme Court. It would be nice to know what Justice Herndon thinks of Judge Trujillo’s decision.

Going by the city’s past legal strategy it would be easy to conclude that Trujillo’s ruling will be swiftly appealed to the state supreme court. But now I’m not so sure.

In light of Wednesday’s agenda item the city council might be losing its willingness to continue to approve the funding of a string of litigations that after several years have produced very mixed results in court.

It’s my understanding that Wednesday’s administrative agenda item comes at the suggestion of Ward 2 Councilwoman Victoria Seaman. That makes sense for a couple reasons. First the epicenter of the contested development is in her ward. Second she strolls the corridors of City Hall in no small part because of the political support of Lowie & Co. and makes no secret of her disdain for the city’s costly efforts against the developer.

That aside it’s hardly unusual for elected officials at the city and elsewhere to attempt to balance the fiscal legal and political costs of an issue. It’s made especially difficult when the opponent is a double tough negotiator who has been quick to litigate his council critics.

So I suppose it can be argued that it makes a certain kind of sense to settle a protracted dispute with a guy who has millions to spend and shows no interest in scrapping his projects. Call it a very expensive insurance policy if you’d like.

EHB has a substantial track record of success including One Queensridge Place Tivoli Village and Sahara Center properties. And for fans of irony EHB also designed and constructed downtown’s Nevada Supreme and Appellate Court Building downtown.

But $64 million as they say ain’t peanuts. Such a move would not only provide Lowie with his victory but it would also surely send a message to other developers whose projects have been rebuffed by the city.

That much money would however buy at least some of the infrastructure improvements necessary to complete Lowie’s lofty vision. From roads and sewers to flood zone upgrades none of it will come cheap.

If members of the city council were looking to settle a thorny series of litigations that have cost millions to fight and threaten to cost many millions more should the high court’s decision not go its way the council couldn’t have picked a better time to punt than the dog days of August when vacations are on many minds. Politically speaking the timing might be right.

And from what I can tell the $64 million settlement plan was practically a secret — until now.

You can buy clothes and food with it in some places and Kwik Trip and Cub have traditional ATMs and new ones for crypto.

Home Depot Whole Foods and Starbucks are among retailers that now accept crypto at checkout said Vivian Fang Honeywell professor of accounting at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management. Payment platform and credit service company PayPal late last year introduced a crypto checkout option and most services that use PayPal now let shoppers pay for their items with crypto.

""That opens up the options to over 2 million online merchants in the U.S."" Fang said.

In the simplest terms cryptocurrency is unregulated digital money which is usually named by the company offering it such as the most popular form called Bitcoin. You buy a certain amount and your transaction is recorded in a digital ledger which down the line is used to make sure you have enough of a balance to cover your transaction.

Bitcoin spending by consumers is moving toward large value purchases in categories like real estate investment travel digital goods and gaming sectors as well as charitable donations said Josh Held head of strategy at OpenNode a Los Angeles-based Bitcoin payments platform that helps companies in more than 125 countries add Bitcoin to their payment stack.

""On the business side we're seeing demand from many types of businesses and merchants who are looking for instant reliable lowest cost payments"" Held said via e-mail. ""In some cases these are businesses that need bitcoin want bitcoin or are curious about the new technology that optimizes the transfer of value. On the payments side luxury goods purchases with Bitcoin continue to grow as well as any type of purchase enabled through e-commerce solutions like Shopify.""

Financial institutions say they have seen an uptick in investments in digital currency and use for foreign transactions. There also are a growing number of small companies financing through crypto.

Immigrants also have been increasingly using it to send money to relatives in their home countries according to the Wall Street Journal.

The downside is that cryptocurrency is still unregulated so it's a buyer beware system. The consumer must research whether a company is viable and ethically run.

For example the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Coinbase Global for trading digital assets that should be registered as securities. The SEC also sued one of the company's managers and two others for insider trading Bloomberg reported last week.

Celsius Network which promoted itself as serving the function of a bank without all the hassles filed for bankruptcy protection.

Crypto's fast immersion into mainstream payment systems has led lawmakers to believe it must be regulated. The U.S. government and individual state agencies are trying to get a handle on the fast-growing digital asset segment with regulations and monitoring illegalities.

Under a legislative bill called the Responsible Financial Innovation Act elected officials are trying to regulate cryptocurrencies in the U.S. The bill introduced in early June and not yet passed by the House or Senate would implemented taxation of digital assets and decentralize autonomous organizations that may execute blockchain-based contracts among other things.

Minnesota officials have taken a stance on enforcing the law against crypto-based firms that fail to comply with state law. Earlier this year the Minnesota Department of Commerce joined 31 states and the SEC in a $100 million settlement with crypto fintech BlockFi for sales of unregistered securities. As a result of the settlement the state will receive more than $940000 that will go to the state's general fund.

Raising capital and transferring funds are a portion of crypto's overall value though. Growing wealth by investing in crypto assets is where most people find it useful and financial advisory institutions like Charles Schwab offer investment opportunities in coin trusts Bitcoin futures and stocks for clients interested in crypto for trading purposes outside their traditional portfolio.

Over $2 trillion was lost as cryptocurrency values nosedived this spring mostly due to inflation high interest rates and instability of the digital coins. And while many of the companies have since recovered some in the markets some analysts have pointed to the volatility as a reason not to engage in the digital currency.

But others liken it to the dot-com burst in the late 1990s which in the end strengthened many companies that survived.

""This is the third or fourth crypto cycle we've been through"" said Chris McAlary founder and chief executive of Coin Cloud which operates digital currency machines similar to ATMs. ""We've ridden out these cycles before.""

And in the background with crypto many finance companies that don't want to miss out on a possible market are maneuvering to equip themselves to handle the digital coins. For example the Wall Street Journal reported that big credit card companies Visa and MasterCard are preparing to engage with it.

Las Vegas-based Coin Cloud about a year ago made a deal with Cub Foods parent United Natural Foods Inc. to put the machines in 500 of its locations. The partnership could grow to 4000 spots making it one of the largest retail relationships for Coin Cloud. Right now 159 Coin Cloud kiosks are in Minnesota with 105 inside UNFI-owned groceries.

Coin Cloud also has kiosks in Lewis Drug locations in South Dakota and the Williston Basin International Airport in North Dakota McAlary said.

McAlary intentionally sought partnerships with brick-and-mortar retailers because they receive high levels of foot traffic. It's also where customers are most likely using cash.

""They are a place of people's daily routine"" McAlary said.

Earlier this year La Crosse Wis.-based gas station and convenient store operator Kwik Trip — which has over 800 locations in Wisconsin Minnesota and Iowa — announced a partnership with Bitcoin ATM operator Coinsource. Texas-based Coinsource's kiosks are in 2500 locations in 46 states.

Twin Cities entrepreneur Chad Capp is currently trying to figure out technology for people to pay gym memberships with crypto maybe even launching his own brand. Capp is the co-founder and president of HelloGym an Osseo company that developed software to manage gym operations and now works with over 800 gyms.

""With our gym membership management software we want to be cutting edge and we felt that this is a way to incorporate something a little different"" Capp said adding the branded crypto could then serve as a driving factor for rewards programs.

Small entities also have found digital currencies allow for successful crowdfunding campaigns. That trend will seemingly grow in the coming years. Kickstarter the popular New York-based crowdfunding platform said late last year it was developing a sister company that will live on blockchain the cryptic data-storing technology used for crypto.

Supplying a way for people to convert cash to crypto to make payments or transfer funds to another person has become a lucrative opportunity for companies. Cash App the digital money transfer application owned by Block Inc. allowed users to send and receive Bitcoin starting in 2018.

So far more than 10 million Cash App accounts have bought Bitcoin the company recently reported. The company also added a new direct deposit feature that allows users to have a percentage of their direct deposit automatically converted to Bitcoin for free.

Using PayPal or Cash App still involves most users attaching a bank account. Meanwhile most crypto exchanges and crypto wallet operators don't require a bank account for use making it an attractive alternative for millions of people who don't have a traditional banking and credit account Fang said. Per the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. an independent agency created by Congress an estimated 5.4% of U.S. households in 2019 equivalent to 7.1 million people were without a checking or savings account that year.

As a result cryptocurrency is becoming more widely used among minorities in the low-income bracket who see barriers with traditional financial products Fang said. According to the Pew Research Center Asian Black and Hispanic adults are more likely than white adults to say they have ever invested in traded or used cryptocurrency.

Accessibility not affordability is the main obstacle holding most people back from using crypto Fang said.

""There's no hurdle when it comes to crypto"" Fang said. ""You don't need a decent credit score.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3NlbnRpYWxseXNwb3J0cy5jb20vYm94aW5nLXRlbm5pcy1uZXdzLXdlbGwtZmluZC1vdXQtaG93LXRvdWdoLXNoZS1pcy1taWtlLXR5c29uLW9uLXdpbGwtYW5kLWRyaXZlLW9mLWhpcy1kYXVnaHRlci13aG8tb25jZS10cmFpbmVkLXdpdGgtc2VyZW5hLXdpbGxpYW1zLWNvYWNoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“We'll Find Out How Tough She Is”: Mike Tyson on His Daughter Who Once Trained With Serena Williams' Coach,"A variety of social factors determine one’s will and drive.

As a result one’s mindset and goals in life can highly differ from another given the fact they belong to different strata of social life.

When Mike Tyson recently appeared on Hart to Heart host Kevin Hart referred to how his will want and hunger differed from Mike’s. According to Hart the place where one came from determined their will want and hunger. At this Mike Tyson opined that the competitor one is going up against plays a significant role and likewise borrowed an example from his daughter’s life.

In Kelly's case her wedding had been subcontracted out by South West Photo & Film. This meant the couple were able to contact them directly to get their photos. However as the subcontractor was not paid by South West Photo & Film Kelly and James are now facing an additional cost and additional waiting time to receive their edited photos. They are still waiting to receive their photos now.

Kelly who lives in Yelverton said: “I’m lucky that Lee didn’t personally do my day like I wanted him to because if I had him I would have no chance of getting my films or photos back. I’m just really angry that he’s done this to so many people.""

The couple booked the company for their wedding at Barons Hill Farm in Avonwick last April and paid their deposit. When Kelly went to pay the remaining balance in January this year he had changed the company name to South West Photo and Film which sparked concerns for Kelly.

However she could not afford to give up the deposit so instead voiced her concerns to him about who the photographer on the day would actually be. Lee spoke to her and reassured her about the people he subcontracted.

The wedding went ahead in June and the photographer and videographer on the day were good and professional. After the wedding speaking to Lee again he said the photos would take eight weeks to be ready but soon changed that to ten weeks. When Kelly went to chase him earlier this week she discovered his website and Facebook page had disappeared.

She then saw a Facebook post from the videographer who filmed her special day saying that Lee’s company had ceased trading and they had not been paid for their work. Luckily Kelly had previously been sent a Dropbox link to her videos and downloaded them as this link also disappeared.

Frantic about losing her wedding photos Kelly found the photographer and contacted them directly and luckily they still had the photos and said they would send them to Kelly but as they had also not been paid by Lee needed additional money to edit them. Kelly now has to pay an additional £150 to receive her edited photos and wait a further four weeks.

She said: “It doesn’t sound like a huge amount but when you’re a student with three children at home it is a lot of money. I’m just annoyed that I’m having to pay out extra to get my photos when I’ve already paid over £1000. I know there’s a lot of other people who have been affected by this”.

Kelly originally chose Lee as he had a good deal on at the time and he had been recommended by a friend from years ago. Kelly has tried phoning Lee but his phone rings out and his answerphone is full.

She added: “I am so angry with him the fact that he has done this and how he said last week that everything was fine and you’ll get the photos next week”.

A Facebook group has been set up by a photographer from Devon and another from Dorset to help brides and grooms find alternative photographers for their big day. It has also become a platform where people have shared stories of how they have been detrimentally let down by South West Photo and Film.

Devon-based photographer Grace Hill is an admin on the page that was set up by Weymouth-based Laura Dean called Let's Find You Another Wedding Photographer/ Videographer 2022. It was created yesterday July 27 and already has 1300 members.

Laura said in a post promoting the page yesterday: ""Many couples in the South West have unfortunately been let down by their wedding photographer who has declared themselves bankrupt leaving them without a photographer and out of pocket. Around 400 couples are said to be in this position and are in desperate need of a solution.

""Laura has kindly started a group where couples and photographers are able to join in hopes between us we can find all couples new photographers. Community is everything and we are working as hard as we can to help people.""

About Swedish House Mafia

In 2008 a trio of individual artists DJs and producers united to unassumingly break every rule in electronic music. Ensconced in flames Swedish House Mafia—Steve Angello Sebastian Ingrosso and Axwell—infused house music with swaggering hip-hop beat-craft rock ‘n’ roll attitude and big screen-worthy grandeur brought to life on stage with one legendary live show after another. Ushering dance music culture out of the warehouses and clubs and into arenas and stadiums on an unrivaled scale it would be nearly impossible to imagine how the genre might’ve shaken out without them. They became the first electronic act to headline (and sell out) Madison Square Garden in 2011 and the first to grace the main stage at Coachella in 2012. They garnered two consecutive GRAMMY® nominations in the category of “Best Dance Recording” for the platinum “Save the World” in 2012 and quintuple-platinum Hot 100 Top 10 hit “Don’t You Worry Child” in 2013. Rolling Stone described their meteoric rise as “redefining rave culture“ and NME christened them “the rockstars of the dance music world.” The marathon record-breaking One Last Tour paved the way for a five-year break before they returned as surprise headliners of Ultra Music Festival’s 20th anniversary in 2018. Following the Save The World Reunion Tour a year later this holy trinity of electronic music gods focused on the one thing they hadn’t done yet making their 2022 full-length debut album Paradise Again [Republic Records]. Their return was announced with the cover of Billboard and garnered immediate press and a late-night television performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon followed with a trending hit “A Moth To A Flame” featuring The Weeknd.

Posted on: July 30 2022 06:40h.

Last updated on: July 31 2022 06:11h.

Playtech is abandoning plans to bring Caliente Interactive’s Caliplay unit public in the US. The concept would have been executed via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Its demise potentially deals another blow to the once-hot territory of gaming blank-check deals.

Citing a deteriorating capital market climate Playtech said it’s pulling the plug on the SPAC deal adding that it’s working with Caliente Interactive on other options for the Caliplay business.

The company continues to explore alternative opportunities with Caliplay management to build a standalone US gaming business under the Caliente brand focused on the Hispanic community in the US. Both parties also continue to have discussions with the SPAC and its associates regarding this alternative opportunity. Discussions are at an early stage and further updates will be made if appropriate” according to a regulatory statement issued by Playtech.

Playtech doesn’t identify the SPAC in question. But it’s rumored to be Las Vegas-based Tekkorp Digital Acquisition (NASDAQ:TEKK). Reports surfaced last December that Tekkorp was in talks to merge with Caliente Interactive in a transaction said to be worth $2.5 billion.

Playtech/Caliplay Transaction Has Complexities

UK-based Playtech a maker of gaming software controls nearly half of Caliente through a joint venture. The British technology company makes software for internet casinos web-based poker rooms and online sports wagering. Playtech also provides software for fixed-odds arcade games online games and provides services for scratch games. It was founded in Estonia more than two decades ago and is headquartered in the Isle of Man.

Efforts to monetize Caliplay via a US listing are somewhat complex. When rumors of the SPAC deal initially surfaced it was believed that Caliente Interactive would be taking over Playtech’s rights to own 49% of Caliplay. From there the stage would have been set for the blank-check merger.

Had the SPAC transaction come to fruition a $250 million private investment in public (PIPE) would have been delivered by Spanish language broadcasting giant Univision and its shareholders. Although this hasn’t been publicly confirmed by the blank-check entity. Another $190 million from other institutional investors would also be included.

Univision is an early financial backer of Caliente Interactive which has the bulk of its operations in Mexico — Latin America’s second-largest economy.

Latest Gaming SPAC Deal to Fizzle

Playtech canceling the Caliplay SPAC merger is the latest sign that the previously scorching hot market for gaming blank-check deals has cooled in dramatic fashion.

Last November Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) abandoned plans to bring its iGaming and sports betting unit public via a SPAC merger. Additionally shares of many gaming companies that came to market via blank-check transactions are slumping mightily and some of those firms are on the brink of collapse.

As for Playtech there are some signs of optimism including some attributable to the Caliente relationship.

“As announced in our statement on 14 July 2022 the Company is trading ahead of expectations. In particular the Company has seen B2B performance driven by very strong momentum from the Americas including Caliente and other structured agreements in addition to a strong performance across the wider B2B operations” said the tech company in the statement."

Not Roger Waters.

The Pink Floyd bandleader took a very different approach to putting a local spin on Saturday night's This Is Not a Drill Tour stop at Target Center a stunt that tells you a lot of what you need to know about the possibly polarizing but ultimately astounding performance.

After opening with two of his old band's best-known pieces ""Comfortably Numb"" and ""Happiest Days of Our Lives/Another Brick in the Wall"" — two of the best-known rock songs of all time really — the 78-year-old Englishman launched into a montage of solo tunes in which he turned his now-well-documented political rhetoric up to 11. Yeah uh oh.

During the piano-led 1992 song ""The Bravery of Being Out of Range"" he used the impressively giant cross-shaped video screen over the in-the-round stage to list off war crimes he accused all U.S. presidents of committing since Ronald Reagan (Trump and Obama were both called out for drone attacks; for Biden the screens simply read ""Just getting started."")

As Waters sang the terse lines of 1987's holdover ""The Powers That Be"" his screens ticked off murders he said police committed in cities around the world alongside the alleged crimes of their victims. And that's where both Minneapolis and St. Paul got the special treatment.

Next to the names of George Floyd and Philando Castile Waters named their crimes as: ""Being Black."" (Castille it should be noted was fatally shot by a St. Anthony police officer not St. Paul.)

Rhetoric like that is a big reason why the upper level of the Minneapolis basketball arena was half-empty compared to the packed houses at Xcel Energy Center for Waters' last two times in town at Xcel Energy Center in 2010 and 2017. His recent bashing of both Israel and the Weeknd in the press probably hurt too — one likely more than the other.

Musically speaking though the 11000 or so fans on hand Saturday were actually treated to the most riveting and refined of those three most recent performances.

After twice putting off his tour since 2020 due to COVID — he thanked ""everyone who held onto their ticket for two years"" — Waters seemed well-prepared extra-determined and literally pumped to unleash the show on Twin Cities fans. The dude looked muscular and downright svelte for his age.

He came with a well-built band too. There weren't any name-brand players in it like Lucius the vocal duo that sang backup on his 2017 trek. Although he did bring one former Twin Cities resident: drummer Joey Waronker (Beck R.E.M.).

The clearly expert crew brought the old songs to life with new energy. Some of the night's biggest numbers in fact were far from by-the-numbers.

""Comfortably Numb"" was heavily remade into a more hushed almost Leonard Cohen-ish dirge. ""Wish You Were Here"" — accompanied by a sweet tribute to late Floyd singer Syd Barrett on the screens — turned twangier with pedal-steel guitar and a slower almost waltz-like tempo.

The biggest treat for old Floyd fans was hearing ""Wish You Were Here"" sandwiched between ""Have a Cigar"" and ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond Pts. VI-IX"" — the same order they came in on Side 2 of the ""Wish You Were Here"" album. Waters pulled the same trick in the second half of the concert playing the entire second side of ""Dark Side of the Moon"" in order.

With a couple other more cultishly loved Floyd nuggets also tossed in (""Sheep"" from ""Animals"" ""Two Suns in the Sunset"" from ""The Final Cut"") Waters genuinely seemed to enjoy dishing up treats like those for fans this time around; you know so long as he also got to fork out his views on current affairs.

That seemed like a better deal than having to sit through a show filled with songs from a new album nobody wanted to hear as is often the case with many other rock legends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vY29sb3JhZG9zdW4uY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMzAvZGVudmVyLWJ1ZGdldC1mZWVzLXJlc2lkZW50cy1vcGluaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: Denver is nickel-and-diming its most vulnerable residents with fees,"Coloradans are facing a growing avalanche of new and increased fees that local governments and utilities are using to slowly but surely pick our pockets.

Wellington Webb

Every month these fees chip away especially hard on the working poor and senior citizens on fixed incomes who barely can survive. These fees along with higher food and gas prices impact the middle class as well.

Often we don’t know our pockets have been picked until our bills arrive.

Let me give you just a few examples.

The Denver City Council recently approved fees on trash collection for the first time in the city’s history. Denver voters also will see a new proposed fee for sidewalk repairs on the fall ballot.

So Denver residents in 2023 will pay $9 a month for a small garbage bin (35 gallons) $13 for a medium bin (65 gallons) and $21 a month for a large bin (95 gallons). For someone on a fixed income $108 a year for trash removal is a big hit.

I’m not impressed with the city pushing the fee dressed up as a way to increase recycling. Denver residents often gripe about how our city has gotten dirty from trash in the last decade but let’s not charge for trash collection and instead make cleaning up the city — especially downtown Denver — a priority with existing general budget funds.

If this trash fee had been on the November ballot it surely would have failed.

The sidewalk fee proposal on the ballot would cost the average single-family home on a local street with a 50-foot property frontage about $107.50 a year. I don’t disagree that sidewalk repairs are necessary but again the city should budget for this expense instead of tacking on another fee.

There also is a petition drive to put on the fall ballot a new tax in Denver on marijuana which is basically a tax that statewide voters already rejected. That means Denver residents would pay a higher tax on marijuana than their neighbors. There’s still a lot of unanswered questions on this one.

Now I’m pleased the library district’s idea to replace the Denver Public Library was dropped because there has been enough attempts to take power away from Mayor Michael Hancock and the institution of mayor. Denver has a strong-mayor form of government that has benefited the city for decades.

If a mayor doesn’t have the institutional controls to manage the government you might as well have a city manager because authority and power has been shifted to the City Council.

I would support a mill levy increase that helps the libraries but keeps the mayor’s power intact.

Meanwhile Coloradans are dealing with increased fees already showing up on electric and water bills. The average electric bill for Xcel Energy’s residential customers increased $5.24 a month. This 6.4% increase was approved in April by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission.

Then this summer the Commission gave Xcel approval to collect a half billion dollars from its customers to cover the spiraling costs of natural gas during a winter cold snap in 2021.

Gov. Jared Polis didn’t like the Xcel increase. He can’t stop it but maybe he will appoint new members to the commision who support consumers.

Late last year the Denver Water Board also approved a rate increase. Most single-family residential customers depending on where they live have seen an increase in their monthly bill by a range of about 47 cents to $1.34.

An increase of $100 here and $100 there and the financial hole gets deeper and deeper for our most vulnerable residents along with many middle-class households.

Individuals and families are having to make tough choices as inflation hits us all. We should expect our elected officials to do the same.

Instead of burying our residents with an avalanche of new and increased fees sharpen your pencils and find a way to get these needs done in the general budgets.

Just minutes before the shotgun start of the annual Warroad Celebrity Golf Tournament on Saturday July 30 officials from Bally Sports North announced that Warroad will host Hockey Day Minnesota for the first time.

“We’ve been waiting a long time to be able to host Hockey Day Minnesota in Warroad otherwise known as the real Hockeytown USA” said Tad Palmquist Hockey Day Minnesota 2024 Local Organizing Committee co-chair in a statement released by the Minnesota Wild. “As a small community of 1800 people located near the Canadian border Warroad and the surrounding area has an impressive hockey legacy. We are excited to showcase how we live life on the ice during HDM 2024 to the entire State of Hockey.”

Inside TRL Stanley Cup winner T.J. Oshie talks about getting his Warroad number retired being Ovechkin's teammate Back in his adopted hometown this week T.J. Oshie discusses his time with the University of North Dakota playing for the St. Louis Blues playing in the Olympics and picking hockey over basketball. All this and more with The Rink Live's Jess Myers and Mick Hatten.

The event will take place over a winter 2024 weekend to be announced. The games are expected to be played at an outdoor rink that will be constructed with a view of Warroad’s iconic water tower which features crossed hockey sticks. Warroad (population 1830) is the hometown of seven U.S. Olympic hockey players — four of them gold medal winners — and two current NHL players.

The announcement was made on an outdoor stage with Anthony LaPanta from Bally Sports North — who has been a part of the broadcast team for Hockey Day Minnesota from the start — surrounded by dozens of youth the high school players from Warroad.

""This is the kind of community for me that Hockey Day Minnesota is all about where hockey is life for the little guys all the way up"" said LaPanta. ""Kids here are legitimately skating outside all winter long and I think this is just going to be a great host.""

In 2022 Warroad's high school girls team won the state title while the boys finished as state runner-up.

One of those current NHLers Washington Capitals star T.J. Oshie was on hand for the announcement just hours before his number 19 jersey was retired by Warroad High School. Oshie was a key player on the Warriors’ 2003 and 2005 Minnesota state title teams.

Hockey Day Minnesota which was first held in 2007 roughly 40 minutes down Highway 11 in Baudette is a day-long celebration of the sport in the state featuring outdoor hockey games in the morning and afternoon and culminating with a Minnesota Wild game in the evening. Warroad which sits just six miles from the Canadian border will be the northernmost community to host the event.

The full schedule of games will be announced at a later date once the 2023-24 Minnesota Wild schedule is known but there was immediate speculation that Warroad and long-time arch rival Roseau could meet on the outdoor rink. Both the Warriors and Rams have participated in Hockey Day Minnesota in the past. Roseau beat Blaine 1-0 in 2008 in Baudette in a game played under frigid conditions with the temperature and wind chill well below zero. In 2020 Warroad defeated host Minneapolis 5-1 on an outdoor rink with a view of the skyscrapers of Minnesota’s biggest city.

Warroad is the home of Marvin one of the nation’s largest manufacturers of windows and doors and local officials noted that the company will have a prominent sponsorship role in the event. Christian Brothers a hockey stick brand was founded in Warroad and operated there for more than 40 years before the brand name was sold.

Earlier in 2022 Mankato became the first southern Minnesota community to host Hockey Day Minnesota with more than 10000 fans filling the football stadium at Minnesota State Mankato for a men’s game between the host Mavericks and St. Thomas.

Methane gas is a fossil fuel that pollutes our air and poses risks to public health. But you wouldn’t know it from the way the gas industry portrays it.

What most people call “natural” gas is actually primarily made up of methane a short-lived but super-potent greenhouse gas. Over the first 20 years after it’s released into the atmosphere methane causes 80 times the climate-warming harm of carbon dioxide.

When natural gas is extracted from the ground and transported through pipelines  it releases climate-heating methane into the air. Then when it is burned natural gas releases even more global warming pollution into our air in the form of carbon dioxide.

Methane is responsible for nearly half of global warming to date. Not only does methane gas use threaten to destabilize our planet’s climate system but burning gas in the home can also be damaging to our health. Cooking with gas for example can produce air pollution levels indoors that would exceed outdoor standards.

Sadly most Americans are not fully aware of the dangers associated with burning methane gas to heat our homes and cook our food. One of the reasons for that is that utility companies have greenwashed natural gas to make it appear safer and cleaner than it really is. Here are ten examples of how gas companies use misleading language to advertise gas to consumers.

‘Clean’ gas

Some utilities tell their customers that gas is a ‘clean’ fuel. They claim this because burning gas is cleaner when compared to burning coal. This reasoning fails to account for all the ways that gas pollutes at every stage of its life cycle. When it comes to global warming methane pipeline leaks mean that gas can have a similar climate impact compared to coal over the short term. A new study from the Harvard T. Chan School of Public Health found that the gas we burn in our homes contains many health-damaging air pollutants and the impacts that fracking for gas has had on our nation’s waterways and natural landscapes is anything but clean.

Gas companies like Philadelphia Gas Works in Pennsylvania describe gas as the “most sustainable energy choice” because it’s the “cleanest” fossil fuel. A truly clean source of energy is one that doesn’t pollute our air at all. Gas companies like this one ignore truly clean energy options like solar wind and geothermal power.

‘Safe’ gas

Utilities work hard to disguise the dangers of gas. For example Xcel Energy in Colorado describes gas as a “safe” form of energy when in reality gas is prone to disaster. Methane gas is highly explosive putting communities at risk. Unfortunately gas leaks and pipeline incidents occur more often than you’d think leading to death and injury. In fact we know that 2595 gas pipeline incidents occurred from 2010 to 2021 – and those are just the leaks that were reported to the federal government. The total number is much higher. Reliance on gas puts public health and safety at risk but Xcel would lead you to believe otherwise.

‘Renewable’ gas

“Renewable natural gas” (RNG) is what the industry calls biomethane a climate-warming pollutant. RNG is created by capturing waste methane from landfills manure and sewage. While that means it does reduce emissions compared to traditional methane gas when it’s burned biomethane still emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere just like regular gas. And there isn’t even close to enough of it to keep up with our current demand for methane. Still companies like Nicor Gas in Illinois say that “renewable natural gas” is an option that benefits the environment. The sun that powers our solar panels and the wind that turns turbines are abundant truly renewable resources.

‘Net-zero’ gas

To reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions we must stop using fossil fuels for energy. Atmos Energy in Texas for example touts their ability to build “zero net energy” homes as “a part of the solution to achieve our low carbon energy future.” Directly burning gas in buildings and other fossil fuels in the home is a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions. To actually get to a net-zero emission home would require installation of electric technologies powered by renewable energy. A true clean energy home would use a mix of electric space and water heating and electric appliances powered by the sun and wind resulting in zero emissions.

‘Non-toxic’ gas

A New Jersey gas company PSEG claims that if natural gas is inhaled in small amounts it is not harmful or poisonous to humans. But even if it’s true that it isn’t harmful in small amounts that’s not how this plays out in real life because cooking with gas without ventilation can produce air pollution levels indoors that would exceed outdoor standards. That means that doing something as simple and innocuous as making a meal can release pollutants into our homes that some studies show lead to the development of asthma especially in children and may worsen symptoms for those with preexisting respiratory illnesses. One report compared the effects of using an unvented gas stove around kids to those of second-hand smoke exposure.

‘Organic’ gas sources

Gas companies often use misleading language to disguise the harm that their products do to the environment. Utilities like PG&E in California describe their biomethane as a fuel that comes from “non-hazardous” and “organic” sources. These words have positive connotations with consumers that may cause them to overlook the damage that biomethane combustion causes. The use of this language masks the fact that biomethane is still methane which leaks often and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere during combustion and warms our planet. Using words that deceive customers about supposed environmental benefits is called greenwashing – and PG&E is guilty of it.

Using gas to meet our climate goals

In the United States President Joe Biden has set a goal of 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030. Many other states and localities have committed to 100% renewable energy. Gas companies like Washington Gas which serves Washington D.C. and the state of Maryland claim “natural gas is a foundational fuel that can help us achieve our climate goals.” This contradicts a new study from Princeton University that found that for the U.S. to reach net zero emissions by 2050 (which is necessary to prevent the worst effects of climate change) methane gas production would need to decline by up to 90%. Methane gas cannot continue to be a “foundational fuel” if we need to reduce production to that extent and instead we need to focus on powering our homes and buildings with clean electricity.

More efficient than electrification

Advances in electric technologies have made them much more efficient than their fossil fuel counterparts. Electric technologies like heat pumps heat pump water heaters and induction stoves are efficient options to replace fossil fuel powered appliances in the home. Yet the Texas Gas Service website claims that gas excels at efficiency. In reality electric technologies powered by the sun and wind can be much more efficient than those using natural gas. For example an electric heat pump produces 3-6 times as much heat per unit of energy as a gas furnace. A sustainable future lies in electricity from renewable energy sources not fossil fuels.

Methane gas vehicles as clean transportation

Gas companies would like you to believe that transportation requires burning fossil fuels. In Maryland Washington Gas markets compressed natural gas as a clean alternative to gasoline and diesel claiming the emissions “dissipate seamlessly into the air”. But compressed natural gas vehicles still emit climate pollution that warms our planet. The company fails to mention even cleaner transportation options – such as electric vehicles. Cars that run on electricity have zero tailpipe emissions making them essential to reducing emissions in the transportation sector.

Gas propaganda in children’s coloring books

Perhaps the most insidious marketing strategy that gas companies use is directed at children. NW Natural in Portland Oregon sends free activity booklets to schools that praise the benefits of natural gas. Within these books the company refers to natural gas as a “clean” transportation fuel. What the book doesn’t mention is that cleaner forms of transportation exist – for example electric buses that do not emit harmful emissions. Gas companies know that children are the next generation of consumers and are trying to influence how kids perceive gas through childhood education. NW Natural is not alone. Evrersource in Massachusetts has provided similar books to schools and Xcel in Colorado has similar downloadable classroom materials.

Americans are increasingly concerned about climate change and they deserve the facts about the impacts of gas when they are making their energy choices. It’s time gas companies stopped greenwashing methane gas.

Yum! Brands Inc. is the world’s largest group of companies in the area of system catering with more than 50000 restaurants in 150 countries. The headquarters of the company is located in Louisville. It was founded in 1997 as Tricon Global Restaurants and was created through the spin-out of the fast food restaurants owned by PepsiCo. In May 2002 the company was renamed to the name of today.

McDonald’s first tested the meat-free burger McPlant burger in eight US restaurants in November to understand how the menu item would impact its kitchens. In February it rolled the product out into to about 600 locations in Texas and California to learn more about consumer demand for the menu item.

While McDonald’s said the US trial had ended ‘as planned’ US analysts’ research reported lacklustre demand for the meat-free burger which is made using Beyond Meat patties.

An analyst with JP Morgan on Friday said the product was pulled earlier in many stores. Low sales were cited as the primary reason.

Neither McDonald’s nor Beyond Meat has announced any plans for additional US testing or a nationwide launch.

McDonald’s continues to offer or trial a McPlant burger in several European countries. Earlier this month the company announced a small Australian trial in restaurants in Victoria having quietly pulled its original McVeggie burger in July last year.

Beyond Meat share sink further

Shares in New York Stock Exchange-listed Beyond Meat fell six percent on Friday trading after analyst JP Morgan confirmed that McDonald’s had ended its US test of the McPlant burger.

Beyond Meat’s share price has fallen 53pc this year dragging its market value down to US$2.06 billion. Wall Street analysts have become increasingly sceptical over the company’s long-term growth opportunities as US grocery sales lag. Partnerships with other large US food service giants like Pizza Hut owner Yum Brands have not yet progressed to many permanent nationwide menu offerings US trade press said on Friday.

The US is easily McDonald’s largest global market accounting for more than 13400 restaurants – about half the company total worldwide.

McDonald’s decision to pull the product in the US added to the mixed messages from the US fast-food business regarding its interest in plant-based menu items US trade press said.

For some time quick-service restaurant chains had fallen in love with the prospect of plant-based representations of burgers and chicken. Burger King in 2019 generated strong sales that summer with its Impossible Whopper introduction and more recently doubled-down on its plant-based commitment with new versions of the product.

KFC introduced its plant-based Beyond Fried Chicken earlier this year attracting massive social media interest. Same-store sales however slowed on a three-year “stacked” basis in the period compared with the fourth quarter based on a Restaurant Business analysis.

Numerous other US chains have jumped on the plant-based bandwagon in some form or another. Several have since pulled their various products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L3RvcC0xMC1hcnRpZmljaWFsLWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS1jb21wYW5pZXMtcmVkZWZpbmluZy10aGUtbWVkaWEtZWNvc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Companies Redefining the Media Ecosystem,Dstillery is the leading custom audience solutions company empowering brands and their agencies to maximize the value of customer data and transform the way they connect with their audiences.

The Godfather was setting box office records a burglary at the Watergate Hotel would cause a national scandal and Title IX opened the door to expanded female participation in sports. That same year a venerable German ski brand made its initial foray into the tennis market.

Using their knowledge of engineering skis with wood and other materials they produced their first frame. The Zebra print racquet—one of the earliest composites made—introduced Volkl to the tennis world. A half-century later the brand is still churning out innovative high-performance gear for discerning players.

To celebrate its 50th anniversary Volkl has created modern updates of two of its most popular and important frames. Back in 1994 Volkl launched the first V1. Its 102 sq. in. head size 10 oz.

Lt. Gov. Josh Green has a business through which he contracts his services as an emergency room physician.

U.S. Rep Kai Kahele receives income for his work as a Hawaiian Airlines pilot and the Hawaii National Guard and receives an income from real estate properties he owns in Tennessee.

Businesswoman Vicky Cayetano started United Laundry Service and still maintains an ownership interest in the business’ parent company although she has stopped collecting a regular paycheck as president of the laundry service.

All candidates were required by state law to disclose their sources of income this week in financial disclosure reports. The candidates appear to be complying with campaign and state financial disclosure laws by reporting their business interests and the income from them on the required reports. The law does not require the candidates to disclose a list of clients and contracts for their side jobs.

But Kahele and Cayetano have recently been teaming up to call attention to Green’s outside employment and on Wednesday held an unprecedented joint press conference calling out Green for his outside sources of income and criticizing the press for failing to investigate Green’s income sources.

Civil Beat reviewed available records for all three of the candidates and requested interviews with all three candidates to further discuss their business interests.

Green and Cayetano talked with Civil Beat for this story although they declined to answer some specific questions about the amount of money their companies bring in and from what sources.

Kahele refused to talk to Civil Beat for this story despite calling out Civil Beat reporters by name in recent campaign appearances for not doing a story on Green’s outside employment. Kahele also has been critical on social media and in other forums of Honolulu Star-Advertiser reporters who he thinks have also ignored the story.

Here’s what we found:

Josh Green

Green has so far refused to release a full list of his clients but did explain to Civil Beat how money flows from his contracts through his company Green Health International through which he reported earning between $100000 to $150000 last year.

His income outside government has actually dropped since he became lieutenant governor.

At his peak in 2013 and 2014 Green earned between $260000 and $425000 from two jobs for his work in health care as well as some income from rent. That was in addition to his pay as a state senator where he spent several years as chairman of the Senate Health Committee helping to direct health policy in Hawaii.

Green has held elected office since 2004 but financial disclosures are not available online because the state Ethics Commission says it destroys those documents after a six-year retention period.

In the most recent filing this year Green reported earning between $100000 and $150000 from Green Health International.

Green created Green Health International in 2016. The company’s registered agent is Jeffrey Schmidt who salary records show was a former state insurance commissioner who Green hired as a senior adviser for the lieutenant governor’s office.

Green first reported income in the range of $25000 to $50000 from his company in 2018. In 2019 that reported income went up to between $150000 and $250000.

That came from contracts with at first the Robert Watkins Emergency Group and later the Hawaii Emergency Physicians Associated. Both entities had a contract to provide emergency room physicians for the Kohala Hospital on the Big Island where Green works.

Cory Lum/Civil Beat/2021

Green’s financial disclosures going back to 2014 show that he earned between $100000 and $150000 for his hospital work. At times those reported earnings rose into the $150000 to $250000 range. The state requires only a range of income to be reported not exact figures.

Green has listed both the Kohala Hospital and the Watkins group at various times on his financial disclosures. His contract with Watkins ended in 2021 when the group’s contract to provide doctors to Kohala ended. That’s when Green came under contract with HEPA which also provides physician coverage at 12 hospitals across the state.

In 2018 and 2019 Green also did consulting work for a Hawaii medical group and provided clinical support for a hospice care team. His campaign declined to release the names of those entities.

Since the pandemic began in early 2020 the only income for Green Health International has come from emergency room work at the Kohala Hospital according to Green.

“It was simply a penny-to-penny pass through” Green said of his income from Green Health International.

Prior to becoming lieutenant governor Green also worked as the medical director at the Hawaii Independent Physicians Association.

In 2013 and 2014 Green reported earning between $100000 and $150000 as medical director. Between 2015 and 2018 his reported pay was in the range of $150000 and $250000.

He also reported earning between $10000 and $25000 renting office space to a Maryland based medical lab Alere Inc. in 2013 and 2014.

Data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services shows that Green received $4550 from the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. Green said those were actually donations to his campaign.

The data also shows that in 2021 the pharmaceutical company Zimmer Biomet paid about $2200 for food beverage travel and lodging for Green.

In June the lieutenant governor registered a nonprofit organization with the state called Josh Green for Hawaii. His campaign said that the entity was created to pay state taxes on merchandise sold by his campaign.

In 2017 Green was the president of the Hawaii Homeless Healthcare Hui a nonprofit that provides hygiene products social services and temporary shelter for homeless individuals.

The nonprofit reported that Green did not earn any income from his role as president and he left the organization when he became lieutenant governor. When it started H4 as the nonprofit is also called reported revenues of about $216000 from contributions. The nonprofit now reports total revenues of over $2.1 million.

Green also previously sat on the board of the Sex Assault Treatment Center.

Green also reported earning between $1 and $1000 for sitting on a physician advisory panel of the Hawaii Medical Services Association in 2017.

Green has been criticized for taking a greater number of out of state donations compared to the other two candidates. State law requires donations from outside the state to comprise less than 30% of all donations received.

Of the $3.1 million his campaign raised since 2020 about $879000 or 28% came from out of state. About 9% of Cayetano’s donations came from out of state while Kahele has not received any out of state money.

The state Campaign Spending Commission fined Green’s campaign $1000 in 2019 for misreporting addresses for out of state donors.

Kai Kahele

Kahele is a Hawaiian Airlines pilot and member of the Hawaii Air National Guard in addition to representing Hawaii in Congress. He also owns several rental properties in Tennessee where he used to live before moving back home to Hawaii.

In April when Civil Beat reported that Kahele was still flying for Hawaiian Airlines while staying in Hawaii and voting by proxy rather then traveling to Washington D.C. questions were raised by the national press about whether he violated House ethics rules that state members of Congress are not allowed to earn more than $29895 from an outside employer while serving in office.

Cory Lum/Civil Beat/2022

There were also concerns that Kahele was pushing legislation that benefited his employer and his union — the Air Line Pilots Association — which had carved out a special deal in its contract to allow Kahele to work part time while serving in Congress.

At the time Kahele refused to talk to Civil Beat about his work for Hawaiian Airlines or how much he was being paid. The only publicly available information was his financial disclosure statement filed with the House Clerk’s Office in August 2021 that showed he received a salary of nearly $120000 in 2020 but because he was not yet elected he was not subject to the earned income limits for members of Congress.

Kahele later clarified that he was working part time for Hawaiian Airlines and had earned $29151.79 from the company in 2021 and $2861.90 in 2022.

As a state senator Kahele was not subject to the same income limits as those imposed on federal legislators.

When he was appointed in 2016 to finish out the term of his late father Gil Kahele who died in office Kahele reported to the state ethics commission that he earned between $100000 and $150000 as a Hawaiian Airlines pilot and between $10000 and $25000 flying part time for the National Guard.

Kahele’s Hawaiian Airlines income increased in subsequent years. In 2019 for instance he reported a salary range of $150000 to $250000 for Hawaiian Airlines while also earning more than $62000 a year as a state legislator.

Kahele owns several rental properties around Memphis Tennessee where he used to live with his ex-wife. County records show that Kahele started buying the homes in 2007 the same year the housing bubble burst sending the country and eventually the global economy into a financial tailspin.

Many of the transactions occurred under his own name or that of his company Koa Investments LLC which is no longer active according to business records held by the Tennessee Secretary of State.

The records show that Kahele and his company have been involved in transactions concerning at least 15 different properties between 2005 and 2020. His father also bought a house in Memphis from one of Kahele’s business partners Tyson Lee.

Hawaii business records show Kahele Lee and another man Kelii Bandmann once owned a real estate company together called Hawaii Property Solutions which is no longer in good standing with the state and has since been terminated.

Kahele’s state and federal financial disclosures list anywhere from four to seven of his rental properties depending on the year. In his 2021 federal disclosure which was filed in May Kahele reported that he had four rentals with each one generating income between $5001 and $15000. His July gubernatorial disclosure however lists five Tennessee properties but does not report that he earned any income from the homes.

Court records show that between 2009 and 2015 Kahele filed nearly a dozen legal actions against more than two dozen of his tenants seeking to evict them from his properties. The court records also show that he himself was the plaintiff in each of the cases.

The Campaign Spending Commission also has fined Kahele’s campaign in the past — $100 for the late filing of a report in 2016.

Vicky Cayetano

Cayetano’s financial disclosures and related business and nonprofit filings show her connections to some of Hawaii’s largest businesses and biggest industries particularly those in tourism and finance.

Cayetano reported earning between $250000 and $500000 as president of United Laundry Service a commercial laundry company started in 1988 by Cayetano and owners of Waikiki hotels and Hawaii hospitals.

Hotel and health care interests continued their involvement through the early 2000s. A business filing from 2001 lists executives from Kyo-ya Hawaii Pacific Health Kuakini Hospital Wahiawa General Hospital and St. Francis as officers and directors.

Cory Lum/Civil Beat/2022

Before United Laundry Service merged with a mainland private equity firm around 2015 the company’s officers included David Okabe at the time vice president of Hawaii Pacific Health; Jerry Correa president and CEO of the St. Francis Health System; and Victor Kimura a vice president at Kyo-ya which owns several Sheraton hotels in the state.

United Laundry is now owned by Alvarez & Marsel Capital Partners. It does business as PureStar.

Cayetano stepped down as president of United Laundry in February to focus on the campaign.

Cayetano now works as a senior adviser for the business a role for which she reported earning between $10000 and $25000. She also reported owning interest in AMCP Clean Parent Co. That interest is valued between $25000 and $50000.

In an interview Friday Cayetano said she’s only had a handful of conversations with United Laundry’s new president about the business. Otherwise she said she has stayed out of operations and business decisions.

She said she needs to get permission from PureStar President Brian Herington to disclose the number of shares she holds in the company a list of United Laundry’s recent clients and whether any hotels or hospitals still hold interest in the company.

A campaign spokeswoman later said that Cayetano has not received any dividends after she sold her shares in the company and the hoteliers and hospital executives who previously owned shares in United Laundry no longer do.

Cayetano’s business connections extend beyond hotels hospitals and laundromats.

Cayetano is also listed as a director for the local investment firm Tradewind Capital Group. She reported earning between $10000 and $25000 in that role. Cayetano said board members were offered stock options to purchase but she declined.

Tradewind Capital has real estate investments in commercial warehouses in Mililani Tech Park as well as condos like 801 South Street and new developments Azure Ala Moana Sky Ala Moana and the Honolulu Mandarin Oriental.

It also has a variety of investments in private businesses including Pyramid Insurance Landmark Logistics Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Hawaii Realty and the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. Tradewind Capital also acquired the printing press that prints the paper and other publications in 2019.

Cayetano ran a handbag company between 2009 and 2012.

Some of her investments have literally paid off for her campaign for governor. Cayetano lists sales of stocks valued between $10000 to $50000 from more than 100 companies. She said she liquidated a portion of her retirement portfolio to raise campaign funds. The former first lady has loaned her campaign $1.5 million as of June 30.

Cayetano is also listed as a member of the Hawaii Business Roundtable a private group of business executives concerned with economic development.

Some of its members include Bank of Hawaii CEO Peter Ho Hawaiian Electric CEO Scott Seu HMSA CEO Mark Mugiishi developer Bert A. Kobayashi Hawaiian Airlines CEO Peter Ingram and about 50 other executives listed on the roundtable’s business filing.

Cayetano and other members of the roundtable don’t earn income for their roles on the board according to the organization’s tax filings.

The roundtable has weighed in on controversial decisions in Hawaii including the debate over civil unions and the acquisition of Hawaiian Electric by NextEra. In 2020 the roundtable gave the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization a $65000 grant for economic research. It also gave a $25000 grant to the Makaukau Campaign for visitor education programs ahead of tourism’s return to the islands.

Cayetano also sits on the board of the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra alongside ABC Stores CEO Paul Kosasa and her sister Ginny Tiu. The Legislature awarded the orchestra $150000 this year for music education programs at Moanalua High School. HSO reported more than $5.2 million in revenue in 2019.

Cayetano also ran a nonprofit herself alongside husband and former Gov. Ben Cayetano.

The couple created the Cayetano Foundation in 1999 to provide scholarships to Hawaii youth. A newspaper article from 2000 reported that the foundation raised $300000 from a charity golf tournament and money left over from Ben Cayetano’s inauguration.

The Cayetanos dissolved the nonprofit in 2004 and rolled it into the Hawaii Community Foundation which now oversees all of its funds.",,,,,,,,,,,,
