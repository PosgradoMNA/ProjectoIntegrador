As COVID-19 cases soar some health experts are calling for more widespread wearing of N95 masks. If you wear them properly they can provide better protection against COVID-19 than other types of masks such as fabric masks and pleated rectangular medical masks. Though as with all things involving the pandemic there isn’t expert agreement on whether expanded use is needed. This article will largely skip over the politics of N95 masks and focus on the logistics of buying and wearing them.

I’ve been buying and wearing N95s for the past year donning them in higher-risk settings such as on a crowded bus. Here are some of the questions I’ve posed and the answers I’ve found.

Where can you buy them?

A huge of range of N95 designs are available. To avoid counterfeits stick with masks that have been approved by Health Canada or NIOSH. Look for the brand name search online for news coverage of the company that makes them to assess their credentials.

Go to the websites of mask manufacturers (some are listed below). Look in pharmacies medical-supply houses first-aid supply companies and stores that sell safety supplies hardware industrial supplies and office supplies. Some of these places prefer not to sell in small quantities to non-business customers but it doesn’t hurt to ask.

You could check these databases to confirm approval:

Health Canada authorized devices list

What did I buy?

After sampling a variety of N95s and N95 equivalents I settled on two models: the 3M 8210 and in second place the Eclipse Horizon.

While I like these you might not. Mask fit is very personal.

• The 3M 8210 is widely used. It’s a cup style a bit rigid with a metal nose clip that’s visible on the outside. Two straps go behind the head as they do with most N95s. It’s made in the United States from globally sourced materials the box says. I’ve seen it for sale online at uline.ca and at staples.ca. Search for 3M N95 mask; don't get the valve version (see below).

• The Eclipse Horizon comes folded flat individually wrapped in plastic. It feels like a thickish piece of flexible fabric; the nose clip is embedded in the material. The fold is horizontal which has led to a nickname for this style of mask: the duckbill. (Some wits at the office like to say quack quack when they wear it.) When breathing in and out the mask material might go in and out. It’s one of the few masks I’ve seen that’s available in three sizes: small regular and large. Read the directions and make careful face measurements before buying. It’s made by Eclipse Innovations Inc. based in Cambridge Ont. and sold online at The Canadian Shield.

• There’s also the Eclipse Arc which has a vertical fold made by the same company. I haven’t tried it. The Canadian Shield sells it too.

Several companies in British Columbia make N95 or N95-equivalent masks.

• I’ve tried the Eternity from Eternity Medical Equipment in Surrey. It’s made of a thickish flexible material has a vertical fold and an embedded nose clip. I’d buy it again if the 8210 wasn’t available.

• There’s Vitacore in Burnaby. I haven’t managed to track down their masks yet. Vitacore sells via their website and through London Drugs.

• Innolifecare in Port Coquitlam also makes and sells masks. I haven’t tried them. Their website lists a 4-layer cup mask but it doesn’t have N95 labelling.

• I’ve seen people wearing the Kross Direct N95 mask from a company in Etobicoke Ont. On their website they sell in volume to commercial customers. You might find some at retailers. I have never worn one.

How do you cope with the out-of-stock messages?

Select some websites and check them daily. With a little luck you’ll eventually encounter re-stocking day. Some places take pre-orders.

How much should they cost?

Prices vary depending on brand style and how many you buy. At retail expect to pay $1 to $3.50 per mask if you buy in multiples. Price gouging is happening. 3M has published a list of prices that you should expect for its masks.

How do you wear an N95?

Fit is extremely important. You might as well not wear an N95 if you don’t wear it properly. The edges of the mask must be tight to the face — no gaps. I’ve seen people use medical tape at the nose for a better seal. Here’s a video that CHI Health in the U.S. posted on YouTube demonstrating how an N95 should be donned. To remove a mask pull the bottom strap forward over your head then the top strap; don't touch the mask hold only the straps.

How comfortable is it?

It takes getting use to. It’s tight. You might have to try a few models to find one that suits you. Wear one around home to get accustomed to it before going public. Practise putting it on and taking it off. I’ve found that the behind-the-head straps are more comfortable and better at pulling tight than earloops.

Also because N95s such as the 3M 8210 and the Eclipse Horizon don’t come in contact with mouth and nostrils it’s easier to breathe while wearing them versus the rectangular medical masks.

Expect to have creases in your face after extended wearing of an N95.

Once you get used to it you barely notice you’re wearing an N95. This happened: I unwrapped a chocolate bar aimed for my mouth and rammed the bar into the mask I was wearing.

How long will they last?

You can’t wash them. The science on how long you can wear an N95 is murky. It depends on what happens to the mask. Replace if it gets wet soiled damaged if breathing through it becomes difficult it no longer fits tightly or if you've worn it for many hours in a risky environment. An expiry date should be printed on the box. If they are relatively new the expiry will be several years into the future.

An article in the Washington Post: How often can you safely reuse your KN95 or N95 mask?

Should I get an ear-loop version of an N95?

No. A tight fit is too painful with ear loops. Buy N95 masks with two straps that go behind your head.

What about N95s with exhalation valves?

The one-way valves (your breath comes out) are meant to make breathing easier. Many places including some airlines say valve masks are not acceptable because viruses could come out through the valve. But some manufacturers say it’s no worse than what comes out through the gaps of a rectangular medical mask. An option: wear a medical mask on top of a valved N95.

Here’s a document on the issue from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in the U.S.

What’s an alternative to an N95?

Double masking. Put on a disposable medical mask put a cloth mask on top of it for a tighter fit and an extra layer of protection.

The project update is contained within a new report which is being presented to North Ayrshire Council planners next week.

Protection works for the existing seawall structure will likely last for three weeks while the new seawall installation itself will last nine and the backfilling and paving eight. The works will take place in tandem.

The document warns locals to prepare for 'noise nuisance dust and traffic disruption.""

The report adds: ""The proposed works are likely to cause temporary disturbances to residents visitors local businesses beach goers and recreational users of the immediately adjacent marine area. However they are necessary for the long term use and enjoyment of the Largs promenade.""

New steps will be provided to facilitate access to the shoreline with the current steps - which are currently fenced off - deemed too dangerous.

The report also states: ""The proposal will involve construction works within the marine area and the retained height will vary from approx one to four metres.""

The original sea wall was constructed from reinforced concrete in the 1970s. As it decayed it was sprayed with a concrete facing but this has since failed and become detached from the 1970s concrete structure.

There are high levels of corrosion of the existing wall reinforcement with patches of exposed reinforcement visible throughout the length of the wall. High levels of chloride ingress to the existing concrete wall have also been identified.

The height of the replacement seawall structure will be as per the existing seawall

The existing handrail along the promenade will be removed and stored for reuse.

It's almost two decades since The Story of Tracy Beaker first graced our screens and 30 years since the books were released.

The popular CBBC show documented the life of main character Tracy Beaker and the other children living in the Dumping Ground.

There was plenty of drama during the series ranging from feuds between other kids and some of them attempting to escape the care home.

Dani Harmer who played main character Tracy Beaker has gone on to further her acting career while some of the other cast members have chosen different career paths.

Daily Star takes a look at what the entire cast has been up to since the show ended in 2005.

Dani was the star of the show as she played Tracy – a lovable child who was a bit rough around the edges.

At the end of the programme in 2005 she was eventually fostered and then adopted by Cam.

When Dani left the show she signed a record deal worth £3m in 2008 seeing her release a single called Free.

However it only reached 117 in the charts. She eventually quit music altogether in 2012.

In 2010 Tracy Beaker Returns came to our screens and it saw Dani trade places as Tracy came back as a worker in the care home. Dani later quit after three series.

Beto O'Rourke said Texas has left billions of dollars on the table by failing to expand Medicaid during Gov. Greg Abbott's tenure.

""Expanding Medicaid which if we had done at the beginning of the Abbott administration would have brought in $100 billion to this state's economy"" O'Rourke said at a Nov. 19 rally in Houston.

Texas is one of 12 states that hasn't expanded Medicaid coverage which is backed mostly by federal funding. Using 2020 data roughly 1.4 million uninsured adults would be eligible for health care coverage under Medicaid expansion in Texas — 34% of the state's uninsured nonelderly adult population according to a February Kaiser Family Foundation fact sheet.

There's no doubt Texas passed up a lot of money by not expanding Medicaid. But is O'Rourke's statement accurate that Texas passed up $100 billion?

Where the $100 billion figure comes from

When we reached out to O'Rourke's campaign for evidence to support the claim an official pointed us to a 2018 editorial from the Houston Chronicle that shared the opinion that turning down federal funding for Medicaid expansion puts the onus on counties to figure out how to serve uninsured people.

The editorial board wrote ""Under the plan passed as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2014 Texas would have received an estimated $100 billion over the course of a decade in exchange for increasing Medicaid eligibility to 138 percent of the poverty line.""

In 2021 138% of the federal poverty line works out to an income of $17774 for an individual and $36570 for a family of four.

Texas lags behind the rest of the nation when it comes to health care coverage. According to 2019 Census Bureau health insurance coverage data released in 2020 nearly 1 in 5 Texans or 18.4% are uninsured.

Adults without dependents or disabilities are not eligible for Medicaid regardless of income in Texas and parents of dependent children are eligible up to about 14% of the federal poverty level according to a 2020 Texas A&M study on Medicaid expansion for Episcopal Health Foundation an advocate for Medicaid expansion.

So Texas has a coverage gap between Medicaid eligibility and eligibility for a federally subsidized Affordable Care Act Marketplace plan that begins at 100% of the federal poverty line.

The $100 billion number in the editorial as well as in other early news articles appears to have originated from research conducted in 2013 by a consulting firm belonging to Billy Hamilton former deputy comptroller of Texas.

Commissioned by the Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas the report found that Texas legislators “must decide whether to accept $100 billion in federal funding over 10 years to provide additional Medicaid health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for our state’s neediest citizens.”

The consulting firm analyzed federal funding under scenarios of minimal enrollment moderate enrollment and high enrollment levels. The amount of federal dollars Medicaid expansion brings depends on enrollment and enrollee costs per month.

Assuming moderate enrollment the report looked at total federal spending from 2014 to 2017 and found that it would be nearly $23 billion for adults and $4.5 billion for children — a total of $27.5 billion for those four years. Under the Affordable Care Act the federal matching rate declined from 100% of the cost to 95% in 2017 and to 90% of the expansion cost in 2020.

In a footnote the study cited a 2012 presentation made by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission before the Senate Health and Human Services and Senate State Affairs committees on the Affordable Care Act.

Bee Moorhead executive director of the interfaith legislative network Texas Impact was a researcher on that study who had worked under Hamilton at the comptroller's office. She said in a phone interview that the presentation did estimate just over $100 billion in federal funding — and that it also included year-by-year estimates up to 2023.

Moorhead said that the methodology used by the agency was the same as that used by Billy Hamilton Consulting. She described the agency's estimates as a realistic outlook on how much Texas could depend on the federal government for funding if it expanded Medicaid.

Moorhead said however that more recent estimates on the amount of forgone federal funding could be a lot less or more than what her study found. That's because other factors like the state's population growth and poverty rates could indicate greater possible federal funding.

Recent estimates

More recent estimates suggest Texas would receive federal funding between $5 billion and $6 billion annually if it expanded Medicaid. The state meanwhile would be responsible for 10 cents on every dollar or $600 million to $700 million annually according to an April 2021 article by the American-Statesman.

Two such estimates:

In a 2020 report for Episcopal Health Foundation former chief operating officer of the Texas Department of State Health Services Randy Fritz and Texas Star Alliance found that if Medicaid were expanded to include 1 million enrollees that would bring a total annual cost of $6.3 billion. Of that Texas would pay $650 million per year including $20 million for administrative technology and state employee costs.

In a separate September 2020 policy analysis also funded by Episcopal Health Foundation Texas A&M University researchers estimated that if 73% of newly eligible uninsured people enrolls and 95% of current marketplace enrollees eligible under Medicaid expansion enrolls there would be $5.4 billion in annual federal funding. The state's share in costs would be $600 million.

Economic stimulus effects

Though his office cited an editorial that focused on federal funding O'Rourke most likely was referring to the larger economic effects of Medicaid expansion which ""would have brought in $100 billion to this state's economy.""

O'Rourke then said ""[Medicaid expansion] would have further fueled the Texas Medical Center– the jobs that are being created right there would have brought more doctors to more big cities and more rural communities alike."" He then mentioned the number of rural hospital closures.

Medicaid expansion is expected to have a stimulus effect or an economic ripple effect that comes with an injection of money into the state economy the Texas A&M analysis found.

Predictions for that effect vary. Nationwide research shows state budgets were positively affected under Medicaid expansion with a ""very small"" increase in spending by states relative to federal spending.

A December 2020 report by the Perryman Group and funded by Episcopal Health Foundation and Austin-based St. David's Foundation looked at the economic effect. The Waco-based economic consulting group estimated the state could see gains of $244.7 billion over 10 fiscal years (2022 to 2031) as well as more than 2.1 million job-years of employment.

Vivian Ho at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy also highlighted the multiplier effect saying that the economic effect of federal funding was likely more than $100 billion.

""That happens with any type of dollars put into an economy. And so here it makes sense you have that"" Ho said. ""These are federal dollars that the state would not receive otherwise so they boost the economy in general.""

Economic effects also include less uncompensated care increased profitability for health care providers and improved financial security for low-income adults according to a review of recent academic research by the Kaiser Family Foundation. A July 2020 insight article in the Journal of the American Medical Association highlighted job creation as a result of Medicaid expansion as an economic stimulus.

So if O'Rourke is talking about the potential economic effect of the federal funding then the benefit is likely far more than $100 billion.

Our ruling

O'Rourke said ""expanding Medicaid...would have brought in $100 billion to this state's economy"" if it had been done at the beginning of Abbott's tenure.

Projections rely on making assumptions for the number of people who would register the reimbursement rate and additional funding. The figure O'Rourke drew from was based on a 2013 estimate drawn up by the state government and verified by current and former state government financial experts.

More recent research suggests the amount of forgone federal funding could be less than the $10 billion per year on average that the $100 billion suggests. It could be $5 billion to $6 billion.

But the ripple effect of even this smaller influx of federal money on the state's economy could be larger than $100 billion.

The statement is accurate but needs additional context. We rate it Mostly True.

The Grade 8 students led a successful food drive for the Al Nelson food pantry.

Abbott Memorial School Donates to Al Nelson Friendship Center

FLORIDA Mass. — Abbott Memorial School donated 1508 items to the Al Nelson Friendship Center Food Pantry in North Adams as part of its Project 351 Food Drive.

""The outpouring of support to help others through food contributions by Gabriel Abbott Memorial School students and families was staggering"" Principal Martin McEvoy Jr. said. ""It is another reflection of the colossal empathy generosity and spirit of the community. To realize how willing the school community was to help their neighbors even while facing formidable challenges of their own says so much.""

Project 351 is an independent nonprofit organization that fosters youth-led service by engaging ambassadors from each of Massachusetts' 351 cities and towns.

The ambassadors this year from Abbott were 8th-graders Ryleigh Rathbun of Florida Amari Smith of Monroe and Marley Miner of Savoy. These students lead the program.

""We are very proud of the ambassadors representing Florida and the two towns with whom our school has a tuition agreement"" McEvoy said. ""... These student-leaders did an amazing job of planning and executing the drive along with the project's coordinator second-grade teacher/Assistant Principal Denise Chesbro.""

The entire school was involved and McEvoy said the 103 students who attend the small school which is part of the Northern Berkshire School Union collected 1340 pounds in just nine days.

""I was surprised that a school of our small size could collect a total of 1340 pounds of food but not surprised at the level of generosity and goodwill shown by the Abbott Memorial school community"" he said. ""I have come to learn quickly how caring and supportive the school community and town is of its kids school and larger community.""

He added that the school has participated in many fundraising and donation efforts over the years. He said giving back is most definitely part of the Abbott Memorial education.

""The parameters of public education today are ever-broadening in order to put students in the best position to live productive meaningful and happy lives in a constantly changing complex world"" he said. ""One of the overriding and critical outcomes of education which we focus on here at Abbott is to prepare students to become engaged thoughtful and contributing members of society.

In fact this project gave us the opportunity to live our school's vision which we collectively developed at the beginning of this school year: 'At Abbott we strive everyday to nurture growth love of learning and a sense of community in the Berkshires and beyond!'"""

Technological advancements in big data made it possible for companies to collect store and process data at unprecedented scale. “Data is the new oil” means to say that raw data just like crude oil isn’t valuable in and of itself but rather the value is created when gathered and connected to other relevant data. But what does it help if we turn oil into petroleum but have not enough people to drive the cars we fueled?

We have reached a point where our ability to collect data exceeds the throughout at which we can analyze and act upon the data available to us. In the data economy of tomorrow success is no longer measured by the amount of data you have but by the amount of people that are empowered to make use of it. To be successful companies must shift gears from acquiring the right set of technologies to collect and process large amounts of enterprise data to empowering entire workforces to collaborate on the data made available to them. Those enterprises which fail to broaden the scope of who is empowered to work with data will miss out.

Enterprise Data Collaboration: A bumpy road ahead of us

A large-scale data literacy study conducted by Qlik & Accenture finds that 67% of the global workforce have access to business intelligence tools while 75% percent have access to data analytics software [2].

Enterprises arewaking up the opportunity of enabling more employees to take advantage of data in their work. Clearly a leap in the right direction but one that leaves many of us stumbling. The very same study finds that increasing investments in data analytics & BI tooling have done little in enabling people to become more confident in working with data.

74% of employees report feeling overwhelmed or unhappy when working with data

59% of employees globally exhibit symptoms of burnout (feelings of being unproductive frustrated or stressed) when working with data analytics and business intelligence tools

36% of overwhelmed employees globally report spending at least one hour a week procrastinating over data-related tasks

14% percent would avoid the task entirely

Seriously What is going on? Simply put technological advances have outpaced people’s ability to cope. Providing people access to data in solitude is a stressful experience because data in itself is unhandy and without additional context well just data. Whatever technology stack we might be able to get our hands on turning data into insight most probably always remains an interdisciplinary exercise which draws on diverse skills and knowhow spread over many heads in an organization. More often than never the person who knows how to analyze data is not the person who has the context and business acumen to judge its rightfulness and relevance. Completely different people will know where to locate this data in the backend. Others will have to chip in when it comes to data privacy and compliance. The long list continues. And while collaboration is key to success organizations struggle to make it happen. A recent study by HBR qualifies organizational silos as the number one organizational barrier for organizations to transform into data-driven enterprises [3]. According to Statista employees report a lack of organizational alignment as biggest challenge to big data adoption [4].

Eventually the best technology is useless if users cannot work it. At the same time great talent can’t be brought to bearing if the tools in use do not gear towards collaboration. The opportunity costs of carrying on the way things are right now are tremendous.

The moment data becomes everybody’s business

Nearly all employees are now expected to be able to use data in their roles. In the current reality data exploration is in the hands of a small group of specialists crunching data on everybody else’s behalf while most employees have to watch from the side-line until their analytical demands are being served. In this largely transactional setup the confidence with which employees rely on data the speed with which analytical requests are executed and the number of analytical requests that can be served at any given point in time are strictly dependent on the number of specialists available.

In an alternative reality people of any background collaborate and converse about data. The moment data becomes everybody’s business these metrics are set to skyrocket. Interdisciplinary dialogue between various business and IT stakeholders surfaces the necessary context for data to be understood and trusted. Making it feasible for different profiles to contribute knowhow would not only raise the quality of the output — an ad-hoc analysis a dashboard an analytical app  you name it — but also the scale and speed at which enterprises can operate on data. Like in soccer where not everyone should be a striker not everyone needs to deploy code and build complex models in a data-driven project. But to get to this point all players need to communicate and collaborate to get the ball across the pitch. If you manage to find more strikers great but don’t be surprised if your overall gameplay doesn’t improve. The real challenge will be to empower all players to perform to the best of their abilities because data is a team sport.

Data collaboration made easy for everyone: An emerging business opportunity?

Companies amassed a lot of data and tools to analyze it. With the human part of the equation left behind these investments do not pay off today. A pain without a solution? Of course not! Let’s consider a few emerging business which made it their mission to tear down organisational hurdles to make collaboration the new norm.

While the past two pandemic years have put enterprise collaboration on a stress test software tools like Mural  Miro and Figma have provided companies incredible remedy to port creative workshops and design sessions into the digital sphere where collaboration between people relegated to working from home. Catering to the specific challenges of working with data software platforms Deepnote and detective.solutions are rethinking the way interdisciplinary data collaboration can be staged in organisational settings. The team around Deepnote offers a Jupyter-compatible data science notebook environment for real-time collaboration on machine learning model development. While the former gears towards tech savvy personnel detective.solutions offers a digital co-working canvas with no code access to big data. This is to help enterprise users of any background to master the collaboration- and communication-intensive phases of data-driven projects.

As it is the case for all innovation attempts time will tell whether such platforms are here to stay. But one thing is clear: Data analytics projects whether they are in their conceptual infancy or already deeply immersed in data and algorithms count on businessmen and data workers to collaborate on data. Failing on this imperative reduces a company’s odds to make serious money from any data carefully made available over the last few years.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It's a tricky technique to get the most out of and on occasion it's not even possible. In those situations perhaps you can fake it instead.

Every year — or rather every year the pandemic isn't involved — there is a motorsport event in London that I attend as press. I am a petrolhead to the core and 6 or 7 years ago I tried my luck at getting a press pass for the event so I could photograph the racers. Somehow I was given accreditation and I found I could make a little money selling my shots to the drivers. It's not really about the money however it's about how much I enjoy the day.

This is in part because of the cars but also because of how difficult it is to get great printable images of the cars racing. Panning takes a lot of trial error and practice to be consistent and even then you will never nail every shot. The event lasts several days and I like to try different parts of the track. There is one that has so many small turns that panning isn't worthwhile or possible in many cases. One option I have here is to fake the panning effect in Photoshop. I haven't done it yet but I must admit this tutorial shows believable results.

The only change I'd make to OpticalWander's image is the wheels which are typically blurred too. If they aren't — and I have an example of this — the driver has probably locked their brakes and is about to have an expensive 10 seconds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFqbWMuY29tL3ZpZXcvcmVzZWFyY2gtb2ZmZXJzLXBvc3NpYmxlLWFsdGVybmF0aXZlLXRvLXJmLWNsLWNvbWJvLWZvci1oaWRyYWRlbml0aXMtc3VwcHVyYXRpdmHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Research Offers Possible Alternative to RF-CL Combo for Hidradenitis Suppurativa,"Clindamycin (CL) monotherapy may be a viable treatment option for patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) particularly those with mild or moderate disease according to new study findings published in Annals of Dermatology.

If further studies confirm the safety and efficacy of CL monotherapy the treatment could offer an alternative to CL in combination with rifampicin (RF) which comes with concerns of developing resistant bacteria due to long-term use.

“Though HS is not primarily an infectious disease the RF-CL combination is recommended as first-line therapy in moderate to severe HS for their antimicrobial anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties” wrote the researchers noting that various bacterial species have shown to be involved in the disease. “However there are still several concerns regarding long-term RF-CL combination treatment.”

According to the researchers despite concerns of drug-resistant bacteria as well as several adverse events associated with long-term use of the RF-CL combination few studies to date have explored possible alternatives to the treatment.

In their retrospective single-center study the researchers found that CL monotherapy was both safe and useful in 53 patients with HS after 8 weeks of treatment. Resistance to CL occurred in 15% of patients which the researchers note was lower than a previously reported rate of 65.6%. They add that the presence of CL-resistant bacteria seemed to not have a significant impact on the efficacy of CL monotherapy.

Thirty-four of the patients had available efficacy data and these showed that 61.76% achieved Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (Hi-SCR). By stage all patients with Hurley’s stage 1 disease 80.0% of patients with Hurley’s stage 2 disease and 52.17% of patients with Hurley’s stage 3 disease achieved Hi-SCR.

In addition the treatment showed more favorable efficacy results in patients with mild or moderate disease compared with patients with severe or very severe disease which the researchers say is in line with previous reports.

Across the full cohort of patients 26.2% experienced an adverse event 9 of which led to treatment discontinuation. These adverse events included diarrhea occurring in 12 of the cases as well as abdominal pain skin rash and elevated liver enzyme levels.

“Systemic CL monotherapy may be a safe and useful alternative to RF-CL combination therapy” the authors concluded “and no significant difference in the efficacy of the therapy depending on the presence of CL-resistant bacteria was observed.”

Still they recommend future trials investigate their findings to confirm the results seen in this study.

The Texans are extending the former Super Bowl champion running back through the 2022 season.

Although Burkhead provided Houston with a spark in the backfield and leads the team with 110 carries for 403 yards and three touchdowns the former Cincinnati Bengals 2013 sixth-round pick will be 32 years old when Week 1 of the 2022 campaign kicks off.

Do the Texans really want to have a player with that kind of mileage leading their ground game? Is Nick Caserio giving out contracts to former Patriots so they will have a place to still carry on their careers?

Burkhead has done a fabulous job with his locker room presence and showing younger players how to prepare for the weekly grind of the NFL. As the Texans complete their rebuild with 2022 being a key year due to the amount of top-100 draft picks and a tad more salary cap space they will need players like Burkhead to help the running back room stay on target.

Caserio and the personnel department need to break from a Texans tradition going back to the days of Arian Foster. Because of how much of a home run the former 2009 undrafted free agent from Tennessee was and how much of a bust Ben Tate was (2010 second-rounder from Auburn) the Texans have turned to veterans to carry the rock. It worked in 2016 and 2018 with Lamar Miller and 2019 with Carlos Hyde. It has been an underwhelming commitment to “three yards and a could of dust” that has yielded more dust than yards.

The Texans don’t need to use a No. 1 overall pick on a running back but they do need to consider how spending draft capital at the position could truly give quarterback Davis Mills the weapon he needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ub3Zhay1kam9rb3ZpYy1sYXd5ZXJzLXJlY2VudC1jb3ZpZC0wODQzMTkxODUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Novak Djokovic's lawyers say recent Covid infection gave him vaccine exemption,"Novak Djokovic contracted Covid-19 in December according to legal documents (Mike Egerton/PA) (PA Wire)

Novak Djokovic was granted a vaccine exemption to enter Australia because he contracted Covid-19 last month his lawyers have claimed.

In court documents published on Saturday it is stated that the Serbian recorded a positive test on December 16 and has “not had a fever or respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 in the last 72 hours”.

Djokovic has been detained at an immigration facility in Melbourne since Thursday morning after his visa was cancelled following scrutiny of the medical exemption he had secured to travel to the first tennis major of the year.

According to his legal team Djokovic was also provided with a letter from the Chief Medical Officer of Tennis Australia recording he had a medical exemption from Covid vaccination.

It is claimed that the exemption certificate was “provided by an Independent Expert Medical Review panel commissioned by Tennis Australia” and that “the decision of that panel had been reviewed and endorsed by an independent Medical Exemptions Review Panel of the Victorian State Government”.

Djokovic’s lawyers added that he was granted an “Australian Travel Declaration” because he was told by the authorities that [he met] the requirements for a quarantine-free arrival into Australia”.

Djokovic a nine-time Australian Open winner must wait for a hearing on Monday to discover his fate.

On Friday it emerged that two other people connected to the tournament have joined Djokovic in being instructed to leave the country by the Australian Border Force.

One of the individuals is Czech doubles specialist Renata Voracova who played in a warm-up tournament in Melbourne this week but has now opted to leave Australia.

Djokovic 34 is under instruction to stay at Melbourne’s Park Hotel which is used to house asylum seekers and refugees before Monday’s hearing.

He broke his silence on Instagram saying: “Thank you to people around the world for your continuous support. I can feel it and it is greatly appreciated.”

His wife Jelena also took to social media to express her gratitude to the player’s fans for their backing.

In Instagram and Twitter posts Jelena Djokovic wrote: “Thank you dear people all around the world for using your voice to send love to my husband.

“I am taking a deep breath to calm down and find gratitude (and understanding) in this moment for all that is happening.

“The only law that we should all respect across every single border is Love and respect for another human being.

“Love and forgiveness is never a mistake but a powerful force. Wishing you all well!”

Australia’s Nick Kyrgios who has been a fierce critic of Djokovic on many matters weighed in on Twitter to call for his country to “do better” in its treatment of the 20-time major champion.

The world number 93 wrote: “Look I definitely believe in taking action I got vaccinated because of others and for my mums health but how we are handling Novak’s situation is bad really bad.

“Like these memes headlines this is one of our great champions but at the end of the day he is human. Do better.”

The first was her looking fabulous in an alcove as she waved goodbye to 2021 and the next one made headlines for her voluptuous toned figure. But this one may be our favorite because it has that Hayek humor we love about her.

In an interview with Holmes Place Hayek talked about how she accepts aging naturally. “I don’t dye [my hair] because I am curious to see how I am going to look with this. I am sure in the next movie they will say sorry you will have to dye it but I am enjoying watching them come in. I don’t have any Botox.

They said their robots had drawbacks such as running away from customers wearing lots of jewelry.

One robot Amy chatted too much to guests so they had to switch off her interactive functions.

Amy Ella Will and Josh work in a restaurant as servers. They bring food to tables interact with guests and from time to time they roll away to recharge their batteries.

All four of them are robots and they're the main attraction at Robotazia a restaurant in Milton Keynes UK.

Even so Robotazia's owners Joy Gittens and Mark Swannell told Insider they'd never replace all their human servers with machines because the robots have a few notable drawbacks.

They run away from guests wearing lots of jewelry

The robots turn around and roll away from guests wearing lots of metal jewelry which has something to do with signals being reflected off the metal.

Amy. Kate Duffy/Insider

""They'll go over to the table for delivery but not let people take their food off the tray and then turn away"" Gittens said.

Gittens and Swannell said they have to first check if customers are wearing lots of jewelry in order for them to ""get the best experience.""

They chat too much

Amy has an interactive function that allows her to respond to customers' questions. ""We turned that off because you would never get a delivery done as she would stay there having conversations"" Gittens said.

The robots which were manufactured in Japan also spoke in ""an odd sort of English which didn't quite make sense"" Swannell said.

Amy who served my meal spoke with a robotic American accent but she didn't ask any questions or respond to mine. Instead she said ""bon appetit"" before heading back to her base.

They give up work when they're hungry

When the robots need to recharge they make a quick exit.

Ella. Kate Duffy/Insider

""If they have had enough and they feel that their charge is going low they tell you they need to recharge"" Gittens said. ""No matter what they're doing they go off and put themselves at their set points"" she said referring to their charging stations.

Amy did this during one of the restaurant's busiest Saturdays Gittens said. Gittens said she made light of the situation by telling guests that ""at least she knows when she needs a recharge.""

The robots are also capable of displaying certain emotions. For example if a customer gets too close a tear appears on the robot's face.

They can't perform some basic tasks

The robots can deliver food on trays but they can't clear tables. They also can't check if a person is old enough to buy alcohol.

Further they can't clean themselves or change their batteries. Gittens and Swannell employ four humans one for each robot to keep them in working order.

The robots are more expensive to employ than human servers Swannell said. This is partly down to maintenance. Swannell said he fixes or tweaks parts on the robots every Tuesday.

They're not human

Swannell and Gittens say they value their human servers. Robotazia's website says ""people are at the core of our business and the hospitality industry.""

Two members of the US Congress have raised concerns about home rental firm Airbnb Inc’s business activities in China’s Xinjiang region where Washington says Beijing is committing genocide against Muslim Uighurs and other ethnic groups.

Senator Jeff Merkley and Representative James McGovern two Democrats who respectively chair and co-chair the Congressional-Executive Commission on China sent Airbnb a letter (PDF) asking about some of its listings in Xinjiang and other issues.

The legislators said they were raising “questions about Airbnb’s commitment to human rights and anti-discrimination in China as it sponsors the Beijing Winter Olympics” that starts next month.

“While Airbnb continues to maintain listings in the XUAR it has not publicly condemned the continuing genocide taking place there or other egregious systematic human rights abuses being carried out against ethnic minorities in China” the letter said referring to the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.

China denies abuses in Xinjiang.

The legislators cited an Axios website report that more than a dozen of Airbnb’s listings in Xinjiang are on land owned by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) which was hit by US Treasury Department sanctions in 2020.

The action freezes any US assets of the company and officials and generally prohibits Americans from dealing with them.

The letter cited the US Department of State as saying XPCC is a quasi-military organisation “directly involved in forced labor and possibly other human rights abuses” in Xinjiang.

The two legislators said Airbnb “continues to operate in a country whose laws require hosts to discriminate based on ethnicity place of origin or lack of a passport when the ability to obtain a passport can be impossible for people of some ethnic groups”.

Airbnb did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2019 the online home rental company also came under intense criticism by Palestinian rights groups for continuing to list rental properties in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

Xinjiang has become a significant point of conflict between Western governments and China in recent years as United Nations experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people mainly Uighurs and members of other Muslim minorities have been detained in camps there.

The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday repeated its denials of abuses in Xinjiang and said certain members of Congress “repeatedly hyped up the issues and exerted pressure on companies”.

It asserted some legislators had a “malicious intention of hijacking business with political schemes and keeping China down with Xinjiang-related issues”.

On Tuesday Tesla was also criticised following its announcement that it has opened a showroom in Xinjiang.

Under intense pressure from the US Congress President Joseph Biden signed a new law in December banning products made in Xinjiang due to the reported rights abuses.

The law imposes a near-blanket ban on the import to the US of goods from Xinjiang by requiring suppliers to first prove their products were not made with forced labour. Xinjiang is a large supplier of cotton and solar panels.

China said the US action is a form of “economic bullying”. Beijing also imposed sanctions on four members of the US government’s Commission on International Religious Freedom in retaliation for penalties imposed on Chinese officials over the Xinjiang issue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwcGhvZW5peC5jb20vbmV3cy9zY290dHNkYWxlLWNyYWNraW5nLWRvd24tb24tc2hvcnQtdGVybS1yZW50YWxzLXdpdGgtbmV3LWxhd3PSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxMHBob2VuaXguY29tL25ld3Mvc2NvdHRzZGFsZS1jcmFja2luZy1kb3duLW9uLXNob3J0LXRlcm0tcmVudGFscy13aXRoLW5ldy1sYXdzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scottsdale is cracking down on short-term rentals with new laws,"The city of Scottsdale is making some changes to short-term rental laws in the area which they say will help them to better deal with so-called ""party houses.""

There have been several issues with Airbnbs causing many noise complaints.

""Multiple complaints would come into the city to the city council's office the city manager's office. They put together a 12-week task force I believe was in April to June to come up with recommendations on what happened how was it implemented and what can we do with all the complaints that come in"" said Sergeant Kevin Quon with the Scottsdale Police Department.

Back in December the city council approved changes to local laws that just went into effect on Jan. 7.

These laws include requiring owners to have an emergency contact who is available to respond within an hour in case of a disturbance. Another change allows police to issue a civil citation rather than a notice violation that would have gone to another city.

""If there is more than one violation of a civil statute you could be issued another citation. [It's] similar like if you go down the road run a red light and go down the road again and run a red light. Well that's two separate violations so if we get called out for that and it hits the thresholds you can get a citation. And then a few hours later we're called out again. It's very similar to that"" Sgt. Quon said.

Scottsdale resident Jewell Drozda says she's happy about the recent changes having seen issues with Airbnb's in her area.

""My friend had two Airbnbs across from him and it was party time with bottles on the ground people making noise and playing music all night in a residential neighborhood.""

Airbnb released a statement in response to the latest changes which read:

""Short-term rentals support local economies across Arizona and give residents a way to supplement their income -- this is more important than ever as changes in personal finances caused by the pandemic have inspired people to start sharing their extra space with travelers and the city looks to recover from the impacts of the pandemic. Airbnb is focused on supporting the return of the local tourism economy by empowering residents to supplement their income by sharing their homes and working with elected officials on sensible policies.

In addition we supported SB1379 a bill introduced in the state legislature last year that would have given jurisdictions more powerful tools to protect quality of life and public safety -- including the ability to levy increased penalties against operators who failed to register among other violations. While SB1379 was rejected we hope to work with officials in Scottsdale and statewide to revisit the regulations proposed under this bill and help ensure residents can continue to make ends meet by sharing their homes responsibly.""

Sgt. Quon says for anyone using a short-term rental in the area ""be a great neighbor come into the area and just remember people live here.""

The new policy stems from the settlement of a lawsuit that claimed hosts could reject customers because they could conclude that the prospective renters were Black based on their first names.

The change takes effect on January 31 and will last for at least two years.

It will only apply in Oregon – it won’t even cover people from other states trying to rent an Airbnb listing in Oregon according to the company.

Civil rights representatives and the company said on Thursday that they see the policy as a research tool.

“If Black users face fewer incidents of discrimination under this system where you’re obscuring first names then it should be applied nationwide” said Johnny Mathias an official with Color of Change which has worked with Airbnb to measure discrimination on the site.

Asked about expanding the initials-only policy Airbnb spokeswoman Liz DeBold Fusco said “We want to evaluate the impact of this change first… to understand if there are learnings from this work that can inform future efforts to fight bias.”

In 2017 three Black women in Oregon sued Airbnb claiming that the company’s requirement that customers post full names and photos enabled hosts to discriminate based on race in violation of the state’s public-accommodations law.

Airbnb changed its policy the following year so that hosts could only see a photo after they accepted a booking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pb3dhLWJhc2VkLWNhcnBlbnRlci10dXJuZWQtdHJhaW4tMTIwMDAwNTYzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An Iowa-Based Carpenter Turned A Train Caboose Into A Cozy Airbnb,"Located in Decorah Iowa the CR Station Train Caboose is an actual train caboose that has been turned into a two-bedroom one-bathroom Airbnb.

The steel gates are original to the dam since it went into service and help control water flow used to generate electric power.

A 2016 inspection found some buckling in some of the gates. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which licenses the dam then required Alliant to further review and evaluate this issue according to Jan. 4 letter the utility sent to the Public Service Commission.

An inspection conducted from 2017 to 2019 determined that all of the gates needed to be repaired or replaced. Since the gates were nearing the end of their useful life Alliant decided to replace them all. Six gates will receive additional components designed to increase dam safety and water flow during winter months.

The gates are referred to as Tainter gates named after a Wisconsin engineer who invented the convex shaped floodgate in 1886. Since then they have been used worldwide including 321 installations alone on the Mississippi River.

The estimated $25 million project at Prairie du Sac will replace six to 10 gates per year from 2022 to 2026.

Alliant spokesman Tony Palese couldn’t estimate the project’s impact on customer electric bills but said the cost would be spread out over a number of years and be part of the utility’s much larger capital and maintenance budget.

“In addition to dam improvement projects we are accelerating our solar energy development to expand our renewable asset portfolio avoid $1.6 billion in future costs and deliver long-term environmental benefits for our customers” Palese wrote Friday in an email.

The project is not expected to have any effect on the level of Lake Wisconsin located above the dam or the Wisconsin River below the dam or recreational use of the lake or river. The work will be done within the area of the dam where the public is prohibited from entering due to safety concerns.

The project may cause the closing of a parking lot for a week at the start and end of the construction season to facilitate transporting and launching barges Palese said.

A parking lot and access area above the dam were closed several days last month after replacing the spillway operator deck was completed.

Another recently completed project involved installing hundreds of steel pilings to add support to the thousands of wooden pilings used to construct the spillway.

Other than ongoing routine maintenance no other repair projects on the scope of the gate replacement work is scheduled at this time Palese said.

“The Prairie du Sac hydroelectric facility has been in operation for nearly 110 years. It’s a remarkably well-built and well-maintained facility that will continue delivering local residents and businesses clean safe and reliable energy for many more years to come” he wrote in an email.

Norwegian immigrant Magnus Swenson set his sights on building the Prairie du Sac dam after completing the dam at Killbourn now Wisconsin Dells in 1906.

The Prairie du Sac dam would be the largest west of Niagara Falls until the federal government began damming western rivers decades later according to the Fox-Wisconsin Heritage Parkway an organization that promotes connections between towns and the two rivers.

The Prairie du Sac dam produces 31 megawatts of power enough to power 31000 homes according to some industry standards.

The dam also created Lake Wisconsin which has been a boom to real estate development and recreation in the area.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDZub3cuY29tL25ld3MvYm9hei10by1ob3N0LXdpc2NvbnNpbnMtMXN0LWNvbW11bml0eS1zY2FsZS1taWNyb2dyaWTSAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g2bm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2JvYXotdG8taG9zdC13aXNjb25zaW5zLTFzdC1jb21tdW5pdHktc2NhbGUtbWljcm9ncmlkLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boaz to host Wisconsin's 1st community-scale microgrid,"article

Tucked just off Highway 14 on the way from Richland Center to Readstown the village of Boaz has a church a bar and a supper club.

It will soon add a battery-powered microgrid to its list of amenities the Wisconsin State Journal reported.

Alliant Energy is installing the $3 million microgrid in an effort to improve reliability with technology that could someday make the electrical system more resilient and able to make better use of intermittent wind and solar energy.

With just a single overhead distribution line running into town Boaz population 156 presented Alliant with an opportunity to test a new approach in a real-world situation.

""It’s a relatively small community ... and it’s in a unique situation: a community connected to a three-mile extension cord"" said Mike Bremel Alliant’s director of engineering.

""There’s times we’re out three four times a year"" said village trustee Kerry Gies. ""If a tree lands on the line between Boaz and Blue River we’re pretty much out.""

Rather than spend the money to bury the line or build a backup Alliant decided to install a 250-kilowatt battery designed to meet peak load for up to 8 hours and keep the lights on for more than a day under normal circumstances.

""Do you underground your extension cord or do you have a battery? ... The project is really designed for us to get ahead of how these technologies may be used in the future and understand how they’re used before they’re at our feet.""

Bremel said test projects like this will be key to Alliant’s plans to replace thousands of megawatts of coal-fired power plants with wind and solar energy.

Expected to be operational by fall the Boaz battery will initially be charged with electricity from the larger grid. There may be an opportunity in the future to add solar panels Bremel said.

A microgrid is essentially a smaller version of the electrical grid that delivers electricity from power plants to homes and businesses. What makes it special is the ability to keep operating when the larger grid goes down said Peter Asmus a researcher with Guidehouse Insights who tracks microgrid development.

""Microgrids come in all sizes and shapes all different kinds of resources"" Asmus said.

Pioneered by UW-Madison scientists microgrids can use solar panels diesel generators batteries or some combination of resources to supply electricity when operating as islands.

When strung together they can make the grid more flexible and less susceptible to interruptions and make better use of small ""distributed"" generators like rooftop solar panels said Fei Ding a senior engineer with National Renewable Energy Laboratory who is studying ways that microgrids can help restart the larger grid after blackouts.

Microgrids are seen as a way to bring power to people in regions without access to electricity as well as a way to increase reliability and resiliency in developed countries while making better use of intermittent clean energy sources.

They also offer a more manageable platform for utilities to test out things like battery storage said Dominic Gross an assistant professor of electrical engineering at UW-Madison.

""Developing all these technologies at grid scale can be a very costly endeavor"" Gross said. ""This allows you to develop them at a smaller scale.""

Alliant last year installed a small solar-powered microgrid at a remote state park as an alternative to running wires through rugged terrain. And regulators earlier this year approved an Xcel Energy pilot program to equip large customers — such as factories and municipal facilities — with microgrids.

But Boaz will be the first community-scale microgrid in Wisconsin.

Though microgrids have been around for decades Asmus said wildfires hurricanes and other extreme weather events have driven a ""huge uptick"" in interest including from utilities that have historically viewed them as competition.

""They can put their head in the sand and pretend nothing’s changing or figure out what is their role as the energy market is changing"" Asmus said. ""More and more businesses are generating their own power. They’re not going to have a monopoly.""

WESTWEGO – It was a battle of top-ranked teams.

Amite is No. 1 in the most recent LHSAA Class 2A power rankings while Ouachita Christian tops the Division IV power rankings.

The Warriors turned it on in second half to down Ouachita Christian 66-54 to win the 11th Annual Allstate Sugar Bowl National Prep Classic Gold Bracket at the Alario Center in a game aired live Saturday afternoon at Crescent City Sports.

Diminutive senior point guard Jalencia “Jen” Pierre came up huge as she frequently does.

Sophomore Hai’ley Brumfield was outstanding as well with 18 points nine rebounds five assists and two blocks. Madison Jennings chipped in with nine points five rebounds and three assists.

The first half was a see-saw affair with 12 lead changes.

After Amite jumped out to a 4-0 lead the Eagles got hot and outscored the Lady Warriors 18-8 the rest of the period to take an 18-12 lead.

The second quarter saw Amite score the final four points to take a 33-31 lead at halftime.

The Lady Warriors (16-2) basically won the game in the third quarter opening the frame on an 11-0 run to take a 44-31 lead and maintained a solid edge the rest of the way. Amite led 53-38 going to the final quarter.

The Eagles got within 10 points on a couple of occasions in the final quarter but would get no closer.

Seniors led the way for OCS (19-2). Avery Hopkins paced her squad with 17 points and six rebounds. Mackenzie Lips finished with 13 points and three rebounds and Jayden Ellerman had 11 points nine rebounds six assists three blocks and two steals.

It had filed complaint against Alphabet Inc Google India Private Ltd and Google Ireland Ltd. ""The allegations of the informant when seen in this vertically integrated ecosystem operated by Google makes it prima facie appear that news publishers have no choice but to accept the terms and conditions imposed by Google"" CCI said on Friday. ""Google appears to operate as a gateway between various news publishers on the one hand and news readers on the other. Another alternative for the news publisher is to forgo the traffic generated by Google for them which would be unfavourable to their revenue generation"" the watchdog said. The association said the majority of the traffic on news websites comes from online search engines and Google is claimed to be the most dominant search engine. It said that more than 50% of the total traffic on the news websites is routed through Google and being the dominant player Google by way of its algorithms determines which news website gets discovered via search.Besides Google is the major stakeholder in the digital advertising space and it unilaterally decides the amount to be paid to the publishers for the content created by them as well as the terms on which the aforesaid amounts have to be paid.It further said the members of the association have to suffer a loss of advertising revenues and the inability to bargain a fair share in the value chain of news dissemination despite working and generating credible news.Digital News Publishers Association said there is lack of transparency in online digital advertising intermediation services which makes it difficult for publishers to audit and verify the ad revenue generated on their websites.""No doubt Google being the gateway generates substantial traffic for news publishers but at the same time the bargaining power imbalance and denial of fair share in the advertising revenue as alleged by the Informant merit detailed probe"" CCI said.As per the regulator it needs to be examined if Google imposes any discriminatory condition or price on various news publishers.

With Ivey dressed in a fluffy pink tutu and a pink and white tie dye sweatshirt Spears captioned the post: ""Don't let the pink tutu fool you she only has one mode and it's full throttle.""

It had filed complaint against Alphabet Inc Google India Private Ltd and Google Ireland Ltd.

Another alternative for the news publisher is to forgo the traffic generated by Google for them which would be unfavourable to their revenue generation"" the watchdog said. The association said the majority of the traffic on news websites comes from online search engines and Google is claimed to be the most dominant search engine. It said that more than 50% of the total traffic on the news websites is routed through Google and being the dominant player Google by way of its algorithms determines which news website gets discovered via search.Besides Google is the major stakeholder in the digital advertising space and it unilaterally decides the amount to be paid to the publishers for the content created by them as well as the terms on which the aforesaid amounts have to be paid.It further said the members of the association have to suffer a loss of advertising revenues and the inability to bargain a fair share in the value chain of news dissemination despite working and generating credible news.Digital News Publishers Association said there is lack of transparency in online digital advertising intermediation services which makes it difficult for publishers to audit and verify the ad revenue generated on their websites.""No doubt Google being the gateway generates substantial traffic for news publishers but at the same time the bargaining power imbalance and denial of fair share in the advertising revenue as alleged by the Informant merit detailed probe"" CCI said.As per the regulator it needs to be examined if Google imposes any discriminatory condition or price on various news publishers.

AMZN,Amazon,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS9hbWF6b24td2FyZWhvdXNlLXRvcm5hZG8tZWR3YXJkc3ZpbGxlLWlsbGlub2lzLWRlYXRoc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Workers Are Dying Because Amazon Treats Human Beings as Disposable,"On December 10 a tornado touched down in Edwardsville Illinois. At the time De’Andre Morrow a twenty-eight-year-old from St. Louis was working his shift at an Amazon delivery warehouse. De’Andre had been saving up money to take a trip with his girlfriend. He told his father he was planning on proposing during that trip to Thailand. De’Andre Morrow was one of six Amazon workers killed at the Edwardsville Illinois warehouse. When the tornado struck there were forty-six workers trapped in the building but only one designated safe room. The safe room was located at the northern edge of the 1.1-million-square-foot facility. Some accounts have the tornado touching down at 8:28 p.m. and the Amazon warehouse collapsing at 8:33 p.m. All six workers who died that night were unable to reach this segmented safe area. Morrow and his coworkers died during a natural disaster. But it would be a mistake to view their deaths as accidental or as isolated tragedies. These workers were killed because Amazon has an ongoing policy of threatening people’s jobs and coercing employees to continue working through dangerous situations whether it’s a tornado a pandemic or just the daily grind of “making rate” during a ten-hour shift. While Amazon has kept the national scope of worker deaths under lock and key Cori Bush Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren are now demanding a ten-year list of all on-site deaths with an explanation. Amazon has ignored previous requests of this type in the past. What we do know is that serious worker injuries at Amazon are increasing year after year despite the company’s chronic underreporting and they are already 80 percent higher than industry averages.

Incessant Turnover During the tornado in Edwardsville one of Amazon’s contract delivery drivers was texting with their supervisor. In the hour leading up to the tornado’s touchdown the driver was told to “just keep delivering” despite their requests for a chance to find shelter. When their supervisor said no the delivery worker accused Amazon of “wanting to turn this van into a casket.” A recurring complaint from Amazon warehouse and delivery workers has been the feeling that they are completely disposable. Amazon has a nationwide weekly turnover rate of 3 percent or roughly thirty thousand employees — equivalent to a total replacement of all its hourly workers every eight months. While many companies consider high turnover costly Amazon’s workplace is designed for rapidly replacing workers. Jeff Bezos famously called an entrenched workforce a “march to mediocrity.” Rapid turnover also benefits Amazon’s bottom line by making long-term strategies like unionizing more difficult and stopping employees from accessing the benefits accrued over time repeatedly touted by company spokespersons as an advantage of working there. Amazon has a nationwide weekly turnover rate of 3 percent — equivalent to a total replacement of all its hourly workers every eight months. High turnover thus accelerates a race to the bottom whereby wages get repeatedly reset to their starting point. In a practice being mainstreamed by Amazon workers after their first year of employment are offered increasing sums of cash up front if they choose to quit. In 2019 to make the point clearer Amazon hired around 770000 new hourly workers but had fired or lost more than 660000 of them by the year’s end. By all accounts these trends only accelerated with the pandemic. And that’s not to mention the fate of part-time employees. The politics and policy of disposability can also be seen specifically in the death of these six workers inside the Edwardsville warehouse. Theories of disposability were popularized by critical race scholars to describe how structural violence operates to abandon racialized populations killing by neglect. Disposability politics asks how we can understand Morrow and his coworkers’ deaths as an outcome Amazon allowed expected and predicted.

Dead Labor Perhaps no one has addressed this question more acutely than James Tyner author of Dead Labor: Toward a Political Economy of Premature Death published in 2019. Tyner’s work traces history back to the 1600s in order to understand how the premature death of workers became something “calculable manageable predictable and even profitable.” Tyner’s work explores the long-standing contradiction within capitalism between increasing work demands and keeping workers alive. As Tyner points out citing Karl Marx “Capital . . . takes no account of the health and the length of life of the worker unless society forces it to do so.” Natural disasters such as this tornado cannot themselves be controlled. But they are predictable and in fact predicted. Far from this being a freak accident Illinois weathers an average of fifty-four tornadoes each year and it’s located on the border of what’s known as “tornado alley.” When Amazon decided to construct this Edwardsville facility in 2018 it was always a question of when not if a tornado would hit. During a press conference the following Monday Amazon’s senior vice president of global delivery serviced John Felton said “all procedures were followed correctly.” In a sense he was right: it is company procedure to keep scores of workers on-site during natural disasters; it is company procedure to continue working through severe weather alerts and tornado sirens; and it is company procedure to wait until a tornado has actually touched down before allowing workers to stop working and find shelter. You’re a body. Once that body’s used up they’ll just bring somebody else in and do the work. Looking at what Tyner calls the political economy of death we can infer from this catastrophe that the value of workers’ lives at Amazon is less than the potential profits from a single day or even a single hour of their labor. If those calculations were otherwise Amazon would have simply allowed workers to go home once the National Weather Service issued an emergency alert. These calculations in the aggregate are what Tyner calls an “economic bio-arithmetic” whereby many are “left to die so that others may enjoy the fruits of (dead) laborers.” This is the price of Amazon Prime’s next-day deliveries. Every day Amazon shifts the burden onto employees to make these life-and-death decisions weighing their job against their safety. In Boulder Colorado an Amazon driver was hailed as a “hero” and an “angel” for rescuing a family of three during the urban firestorm that consumed six thousand acres and one thousand homes last week. As the fire blazed the driver — “Lou Ann” — drove through the evacuated emergency area in order to deliver a bike pump to the family. Newsweek reported on the incident taking a baffled tone writing that the Amazon driver had “apparently decided to risk life and limb to deliver a bicycle pump amid the inferno” [italics added]. Newsweek’s description is both true and egregiously devoid of a labor perspective. Of the 190 people employed at the Edwardsville delivery depot only seven are full-time Amazon workers. Subcontract capitalism embodied by the gig economy depends on these illusory notions of worker choice and agency. Tyner writes “Neither corporations nor the state take responsibility for the plight of any particular individual if as totally free agents he or she is assumed to be fully responsible for his or her condition.” All workers are compelled to participate in the wage labor market in order to get by — so all labor is to some degree forced. Yet Newsweek ascribes this worker the status of a free agent — an autonomous actor making the unconstrained yet illogical decision to deliver bike pumps into a wildfire.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c2lnbmFsLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzA5L2Jhc2VkLW9uLWZhbHNlLWFzc3VtcHRpb24tYW1hem9uLXN0aWxsLWNlbnNvcmluZy1ib29rLW9uLXRyYW5zZ2VuZGVyaXNtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Banned His Book on Transgenderism,"For three years Amazon sold Ryan Anderson’s book “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment.” Then last February the book disappeared from Amazon’s virtual shelves.

Anderson—president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center a conservative research institute—first learned his book was being censored when he received a message from someone who wanted to buy the book but could not find it on Amazon.

“So I pull up my Amazon app and the hardback is gone the paperback editions gone the Kindles gone the audiobooks gone even the used copies” Ryan told The Daily Signal.

The author contacted his book agent and then the publisher. No one knew why Amazon had suddenly stopped selling “When Harry Became Sally.”

Upon contacting Amazon a representative of the online giant informed Anderson it had removed his book because it violated its content policy.

Anderson and many of the readers and political leaders who benefited from his extensive research on the transgender issue were puzzled by Amazon’s vague rationale for censoring the book.

Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida Mike Braun of Indiana Mike Lee of Utah and Josh Hawley of Missouri sent a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos last Feb. 24 asking a series of questions about why Amazon removed the book.

Brian Huseman Amazon’s vice president for public policy responded to the senators in a letter on March 11 writing: “We have chosen not to sell books that frame LGBTQ+ identity as a mental illness.”

But “the book doesn’t do that” Anderson explained.

“When Harry Became Sally” details the topic of “gender dysphoria though it doesn’t discuss it in the context of a mental illness” Anderson said adding that he avoided using such language because it’s “stigmatizing.”

“It belittles people. It marginalizes people” he explained.

Anderson first decided to write a book about gender dysphoria and the “transgender moment” when he began hearing the stories of those who had transitioned and then detranitioned. One of those accounts Anderson first heard was that of Walt Heyer.

Heyer spent eight years living as a woman before he detransitioned more than 30 years ago. Heyer now 81 has dedicated the past several decades of his life to helping others struggling with gender dysphoria. After Anderson heard Heyer’s testimony he began reading and watching videos of others who struggled with gender dysphoria.

The “stories were just utterly heartbreaking” Anderson said.

Anderson who was working as a research fellow at The Heritage Foundation at the time began the process of writing what would ultimately become “When Harry Became Sally.” (The Daily Signal is the news outlet of The Heritage Foundation.)

“I ended up reading thousands of pages about the biology the science the medicine the psychology the psychiatry the philosophy the law. I was like each one of those issues can become a chapter of the book” he said.

The book was published in February 2018 and was available for purchase on Amazon and elsewhere.

Anderson describes gender dysphoria as “deep discomfort that someone would feel as a result of a biological sex that doesn’t line up with their gender identity.”

He is quick to add that gender dysphoria is a real problem and a very difficult one that requires a sincere and authentic response:

You wouldn’t want to be experiencing gender dysphoria but if you were experiencing it you would want someone to be giving you authentic compassionate guidance. And compassion detached from truth isn’t authentic right? It’s a phony form of compassion where you just say what people want to hear.

Readers can still purchase “When Harry Became Sally” at Barnes and Noble and elsewhere but Amazon still refuses to sell the book.

Amazon controls 72% of sales of new books for adults online according to The Wall Street Journal. CNBC estimates that Amazon is now valued at about $1.65 trillion.

By refusing to sell the book Anderson says Amazon is “harming people with gender dysphoria who aren’t getting some of the knowledge that they need.”

The online giant’s continued censorship of “When Harry Became Sally” is also “insulting to the intellects of people on the left” Anderson said because the implication is that Amazon has to “protect you from dangerous ideas [because] you are so fragile that if we sold Ryan Anderson’s book what? He might persuade you?”

An Amazon spokesperson responded to The Daily Signal’s request for comment writing:

As a bookseller we provide our customers with access to a variety of viewpoints including books that some customers may find objectionable. That said we reserve the right not to sell certain content as described in our content guidelines for books which you can find here. All retailers make decisions about what selection they choose to offer and we do not take selection decisions lightly.

Anderson thinks that Amazon’s actions relieve a fear on the far left that they “might lose on the transgender issue” and that they “might not be on the ‘right side of history’ that we might have truth in our side.”

The live-action TV series based on the post-apocalyptic world of the ""Fallout"" video games has taken a big step closer to production as Variety reports that Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner are now attached to serve as co-showrunners.

Robertson-Dworet is best known for her work on the 2018 ""Tomb Raider"" film starring Alicia Vikander and for ""Captain Marvel."" Wagner's past credits include ""Silicon Valley"" ""Portlandia"" and ""The Office.""

In addition Jonathan Nolan will direct the first episode of the series. Nolan was a writer on ""Interstellar"" ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and arguably his best work ""Memento."" Nolan is also responsible for giving us ""Westworld."" Feel free to interpret that as either a positive or a negative.

The Amazon-produced ""Fallout"" series was first announced in July 2020. ""Fallout"" is a series of post-apocalyptic role-playing video games created by Interplay Entertainment and set during the 21st 22nd and 23rd centuries. What made it truly unique was the retro-futuristic atompunk environment and aesthetic influenced by the post-war culture of 1950s USA. It beautifully encapsulates the mood of the time that was in essence happiness in the home through nuclear technology on one side of the coin and the lurking fear of total annihilation on the other.

""Fallout 3"" was the first incarnation of the game developed by Bethesda Softworks and available for consoles (PS3 and Xbox 360) and it was an instant sensation in 2008. Aside from a lackluster conclusion one of the biggest draws was whether or not to save or nuke the town of Megaton as — for reasons best left alone at this point — it had been built around live unexploded atomic ordinance. The game won critical acclaim and a number of awards including Best in Show at E3 that year.

""Fallout 4"" was released in 2015 to an overwhelming reception — and the game was exceptional with the major addition of being able to build settlements in the wastelands surrounding bombed-out Boston. Unfortunately Bethesda became fixated on that world-building to the detriment of developing future gameplay. A number of spin-off games were produced including ""Fallout: New Vegas"" developed by Obsidian Entertainment which was a huge underground hit.

The last entry in the franchise was released back in 2018. Called ""Fallout 76"" it was the first online multiplayer version of the game that originally had no non-player characters (NPCs). However later updates added these and subsequent character dialogue.

In early 2021 Microsoft finalized its $7.5 billion deal to acquire ZeniMax Media the parent company of Bethesda (who also produced ""Doom"") but there's been little news on the ""Fallout"" front since then.

AirlineRatings.com has named Air New Zealand as the safest airline in the world for 2022.

The organization publishes the top 20 list every year and ANZ beat out 2021's top carrier Australia-based Qantas.

Five US carriers made the list in 2022 though Southwest Airlines dropped off after ranking 13 last year.

AirlineRatings.com a source for airline safety and product reviews has revealed its top 20 safest carriers in the world for 2022 with five US airlines making the list.

Established in 2013 AirlineRatings.com is a trusted website that rates airline safety inflight products and COVID-19 compliance of 385 worldwide carriers on a unique seven-star scale. Every year AirlineRatings.com releases a list of the top safest airlines in the world and this year Air New Zealand snatched the title from Australia-based Qantas.

AirlineRatings.com editor-in-chief Geoffrey Thomas explained in a press release that ""there is very little between the top 20 they are all standouts.""

""Our top 20 safest airlines 2022 are always at the forefront of safety innovation operational excellence and the launching of new more advanced aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787.""

Air New Zealand is the safest airline in the world for 2022 according to AirlineRatings.com with carriers like Etihad Airways TAP Air Portugal Qatar Qantas Lufthansa and Finnair also making the list. Five US carriers also earned top spots including Alaska Airlines Delta Air Lines Hawaiian Airlines American Airlines and United Airlines.

According to Thomas ANZ earned the title because of its superb incident record number of technological innovations and cockpit advancements comprehensive pilot training and low fleet age which averages just 6.8 years.

AirlineRatings also said ANZ's pilots operate in harsh weather conditions and remote environments adding to the carrier's safety ranking. Moreover the airline excelled in COVID policies and practices.

""Air New Zealand has won countless awards and has a firm focus on safety and its customers and over the past 18 months COVID-19 has brought yet another new dimension to the challenges"" Thomas said.

According to the organization the 2022 awards were based on six factors including crashes in the past five years serious incidents over two years audits from aviation governing bodies government audits fleet age and COVID policies.

However Thomas clarified that all airlines experience incidents and that it is not always the fault of the carrier when things go wrong but sometimes rather the aircraft or engine manufacturer.

""It is the way the flight crew handles these incidents that determines a good airline from an unsafe one"" he said.

There were several ranking shifts in 2022 compared to 2021 most notably were Qantas losing its crown to Air New Zealand after a three-year winning streak Southwest Airlines falling out of the top 20 after ranking number 13 last year and TAP Air Portugal being named Europe's safest carrier after not making the list in 2021.

The Seattle-based carrier had previously dismissed concerns from the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) about the rollback of pandemic era safety measures but a sharp uptick in employee sickness from the Omicron surge sweeping across the United States appears to have resulted in a rethink.

Last week Alaska Airlines said ‘unprecedented’ levels of staff sickness combined with bad weather had forced it scrap 10% of scheduled flights through January to give the struggling carrier “time and space to find our path forward together”.

Along with cutting back drinks services and axing fresh meals Alaska Airlines will also reduce the number of pre-orders allowed on transcon and Hawaii flights from 63 to just 42 per flight. The carrier’s picnic packs will be removed from the pre-order selection but a limited number will still be available to purchase onboard.

All the measures were taken directly from a list of recommendations that AFA presented to the airline last month. The union said it had spent “hours upon hours’ in meetings with management trying to convince them to reduce inflight service levels but had been rebuffed by the airline.

Jeffrey Peterson president of the Alaska Airlines branch of the flight attendant union told members Alaska management appeared “profoundly out of touch with flight attendants” and that morale amongst flight attendants had hit the “lowest ever within recent memory”.

Peterson said flight attendants were pushing for a reduction in service in order to reduce the amount of time crew members had to interact with passengers. The union also said reducing service levels would give passengers less excuse to lower their face masks.

Last week Air New Zealand curtailed inflight service altogether on domestic flights so that passengers wouldn’t have to lower or remove their face masks for the duration of the flight. The longest domestic flight in Air New Zealand’s network is just over two hours long and passengers will still receive a small snack as they deplane.

At the end of this week Finnair was told to stop selling alcoholic drinks on domestic flights after 5 pm because officials decided it was subject to the same pandemic restrictions that have been slapped on restaurants bars and cafes. The airline’s lounges at Helsinki airport must also remove all alcoholic drinks after 5 pm.

American Airlines and Southwest continue to enforce alcohol bans of varying degrees over fears that when combined with the federal face mask mandate drunk passengers could become unruly.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1uZXdzMS5jb20vb2gvY29sdW1idXMvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAxLzA3L21ldHJvLXJ0YS1hbm5vdW5jZXMtYnVzLXJvdXRlLWNoYW5nZXMtZHVlLXRvLWRyaXZlci1zaG9ydGFnZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Metro RTA announces bus route changes due to driver shortage,"AKRON Ohio — Metro RTA recently announced plans to reduce the frequency of certain bus routes due to a shortage of drivers.

What You Need To Know Metro RTA plans to reduce the frequency of Route 1 (West Market) Route 2 (Arlington) and the DASH service in downtown Akron



The changes begin Jan. 16



The changes are due to a shortage of bus operators



Metro officials say they are short 40 to 45 drivers

The changes which will begin Jan. 16 will impact Route 1 (West Market) Route 2 (Arlington) and the DASH service in downtown Akron Metro RTA spokeswoman Molly Becker said in a press release.

""These changes were made to minimize the impact on our riders. While route one and two are our most popular routes riders of these routes still have numerous times a day to utilize the services. The other times we removed were data-driven to have minimal impact to our riders. These changes are temporary and in response to labor shortages realized by nearly every industry across the country"" Becker said.

Becker said Metro has lost 51 operators since January 2020 and is now short 40 to 45 drivers.

She added Metro did not replace many operators who were lost due to attrition after the spring of 2020 due to reduced demand caused by the pandemic.

But now that Metro has restored many of its services Becker said officials hiring more operators is a top priority.

The starting wage for Metro RTA bus operators is $16.58 an hour. After five years operators earn the top rate of $30.14 an hour.

""Being a professional bus operator for Metro RTA is a highly skilled trade and it takes a special type of person who is willing to work a challenging schedule including nights weekends and holidays; enjoys being with diverse groups of people; and has a deep understanding of the complexities of operating a large vehicle on the roads in and around Summit County"" Becker said.

A Bill Gates-backed private-public fund is preparing to invest in clean-tech projects worth as much as $15bn in the US EU and UK aiming to subsidise technologies at scale to help countries reach net zero emissions.

Breakthrough Energy Catalyst which has raised $1.5bn in private capital from philanthropies and companies will invest in four key areas: direct air capture green hydrogen aviation fuel and energy storage technologies.

BEC managing director Jonah Goldman told the Financial Times that the fund would mobilise as much as $15bn or ten times the initial investment by using innovative financial structures and partnership agreements.

“We are last-mile financing and so we will be the most risky capital in there” Goldman says. “We’re really trying to demonstrate which of the technological pathways are going to be most effective.”

The fund is part of the Breakthrough Energy group started by the billionaire founder of Microsoft in 2015. Its Breakthrough Energy Ventures arm provides venture capital to green tech start-ups and includes among its board and investors other prominent business founders such as Mukesh Ambani Jeff Bezos Masayoshi Son and Sir Chris Hohn.

The new BEC fund will provide three types of capital — philanthropic donations sub-market equity investments and product offtake agreements — to fund large projects that would not otherwise be financially viable.

Its focus will be on creating markets for the green products and technologies and bringing down the cost of production for materials such as green steel and green hydrogen. This has drawn the interest of steel group ArcelorMittal and carmaker GM among the initial corporate backers.

There has been a big increase in private and philanthropic investment in clean tech since the beginning of the pandemic according to Professor Richard Templer director of innovation at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London.

“This is patient capital it is large capital” said Templer. “In the past venture capitalists would just say this is an engineering project it is not for us . . .”. But that is changing and new funding models are being developed he said.

One of the goals of BEC — which does not expect to generate normal financial returns — is to reduce the “green premium” for products such as sustainable aviation fuel. The green premium refers to the additional cost of a green product compared with its non-sustainable counterpart such as regular jet fuel.

One example could be a refinery for sustainable aviation fuel said Goldman where the technology is proven but the economics have not supported large-scale production. American Airlines is among the corporates that have contributed to the fund.

“There’s six different ways to do sustainable aviation fuel and we know they all work and they all have different challenges” said Goldman.

“We just need to build a bunch of them to see where we’re able to get the green premium reductions through things like engineering learning.”

Several governments have lent their support to the fund including the US Department of Energy the UK and the EU where it has a $1bn partnership with the European Commission.

In the unusual structure BEC-backed projects will be partly financed through long-term offtake agreements from customers willing to pay for sustainable products — contracts for green steel or for sustainable aviation fuel for example.

“These projects are huge projects that are going to require lots of capital” said Goldman.

“We know you can do it. You just need to see if you can do it at scale in an economic way” said Goldman. “That’s what all these things have in common. They all need the intervention to be able to get them to this next stage of commercial demonstration and actually start building markets.”

They're big batteries.,"Joe Biden is a self-professed “car guy.” As of late he’s become an electric car guy. And he wants his fellow Americans to be electric car people too. Transportation is responsible for 29 percent of all US greenhouse gas emissions and Biden’s ambitious climate policy which aims to create a net-zero economy in the US by 2050 partially hinges on Americans switching from gas- to electric-powered cars and trucks.

But Biden is running into roadblocks. While the bipartisan infrastructure bill he signed into law in November included funding to build half a million EV chargers across the nation the Build Back Better bill that would have included thousands of dollars in tax credits to help Americans buy electric cars is currently stalled in the Senate as Democrats try to find a compromise that satisfies Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) who has refused to sign it in its current form. Another challenge is how Americans feel about EVs compared to traditional cars: A 2021 Pew Research Center report found that 51 percent of US adults oppose a proposal to phase out production of gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

So what will it take to convince more people to embrace EVs? One answer might be for everyone to rethink what EVs actually are. Most Americans including Biden talk about electric vehicles solely as modes of transport — which is understandable given they have motors and wheels and get us around. But they are so much more than cars: they’re batteries and batteries have uses far beyond transport. Done right integrating EVs into American society could help prevent power blackouts stabilize the US’s crumbling electric grid and make solar and wind energy more reliable sources of power for more people. The first step is to stop thinking about electric vehicles as cars that happen to be powered by batteries and instead see them as batteries that happen to be inside cars.

Getting there won’t be easy. “This sort of perception issue can be a challenge because it’s really a paradigm shift” said Sam Houston a senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists a science-focused nonprofit based in Massachusetts. Historically vehicles have mostly had a singular use in American society: to get people and goods from one place to another. Outside of ride-sharing cars only serve their owners. Most gas-powered cars spend the majority of the day sitting idle while we are at home or work. But electric cars can do a lot when they’re not moving.

“What we need to get to is not just thinking about vehicles for transportation and a grid to support those vehicles but sort of a mutually beneficial relationship between grids and vehicles” Houston told Recode. As an example she pointed to renewable energy: One of the biggest challenges to integrating renewable energy into the grid is that it’s unpredictable. Sometimes there may be too much wind and solar energy and there’s no good way to store the excess. Instead extra renewable energy often goes to waste untapped. Electric vehicles Houston said could be a solution to this problem.

A car left at a charger in an office parking lot during the workday for example can optimize its charging schedule so that most or all of the power used to charge the car comes from renewable sources making the most of clean energy that might otherwise go wasted.

EVs can also be useful to the grid even if there’s no clean energy available. Utility engineers are continually making adjustments to the amount of power flowing through the grid to ensure electricity is being generated and delivered at a consistent frequency. Too little power generation to meet demand is one of the most obvious reasons for blackouts but too much power is just as big an issue. Electric vehicles could act like sponges in those situations explained Kyri Baker an assistant professor of engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder and a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

“If you have a bunch of EVs just sitting in a parking lot they can charge or stop charging in order to make small minute adjustments in the supply and demand balance to maintain frequency” Baker told Recode. Instead of simply charging their batteries to full as soon as they’re plugged in cars that are sitting at chargers for extended periods of time can wait to charge until the grid needs help getting rid of excess energy or they can reserve a portion of their batteries for helping with frequency regulation.

That’s just the beginning. One of the most ambitious uses of EV batteries comes from a concept called bidirectional charging or sending electricity back out of an EV to charge things ranging from power tools at construction sites to entire homes during blackouts.

This is particularly alluring in an era of more frequent and more severe blackouts caused by extreme weather: EV owners could conceivably get power at home during blackouts by plugging their car into a charger in their home — and this would eliminate the need for the sometimes deadly carbon monoxide-spewing diesel generators many people currently rely on.

Electric vehicle manufacturers are starting to use this idea as a selling point. Volkswagen’s electric vehicles will support bidirectional charging starting this year and Ford’s upcoming F-150 Lightning an electric version of the country’s most popular pickup truck is designed to be able to power an entire home for up to three days. An early ad for the F-150 Lightning released about three months after a series of winter storms in Texas knocked out power for millions and killed hundreds across the state in 2021 showed off the truck’s credentials: It can “help build your house” the ad’s narrator said “and if need be power that house.”

The marketing seems to be working; as of December nearly 200000 people had preordered the F-150 Lightning. “Ten years ago I never would have thought that Ford would have put out an electric F-150 and I would have also never predicted how many people would have preordered it especially in rural and conservative areas” said Baker. “Climate change is hitting everywhere in the US and so whether you believe in the science behind it or not you want to protect your family. Having a large battery that can be a backup generator is just one way to do that.”

Not every carmaker is as open to bidirectional charging as Ford and Volkswagen though. The batteries in electric vehicles are larger versions of the lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops and they degrade over time just as the batteries in our phones do — which means the range of an EV will reduce over time. Most electric vehicles come with battery warranties that are voided if the batteries are discharged to power something else in part because constantly charging and discharging a battery can make it degrade faster.

Baker isn’t quite as worried about degradation as some others in the industry. “Every time I have these conversations with people about bidirectional charging the pushback is always that it’ll degrade the battery” Baker told Recode. “But if you take a look at how often people in the US replace their cars I don’t think that’s going to be a roadblock. In terms of the car’s lifespan I feel like we’re blowing this out of proportion.” Americans tend to keep their cars for 12 years on average and electric vehicles often enter the used car market long before their batteries see major degradation.

And batteries can still be useful even if they’re too degraded for use in cars. Houston told Recode they tend to be considered too degraded once they can only hold about 80 percent of the original capacity which is still a significant amount of energy. “We really need to figure out the reuse and recycling angle for after the vehicle is done and the battery may have a lot of capacity left” Houston said.

One possible solution — and another reason to see EVs as more than vehicles — is that old EV batteries can be removed from cars and used to store solar and wind power. This idea is already seeing some traction: A startup called B2U Storage Solutions has set up an energy storage facility in California that stores enough energy in an array of 160 used Nissan Leaf batteries to power more than 90 homes a day. And Hyundai is partnering with a solar energy developer and a utility company serving San Antonio Texas to set up a similar facility.

The obvious next step Baker says is to solve the degradation and recycling problems at the same time by setting up processes that would allow EV owners to easily swap out their old batteries in much the same way you can replace the battery in your phone. Those degraded batteries could then be sent to energy storage facilities like the one in California.

On a technical level repurposing EV batteries for non-transport uses is fairly easy to set up explained Mike Jacobs a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The same cable that delivers energy to an EV can be used to draw energy out of the battery and use it to power a home. But it’s more complicated when it comes to energy policy and logistics in the US. Most homes aren’t wired for receiving backup power in blackouts — Ford’s own website includes the caveat that backup power would only work “when home is properly equipped” with a switch that disconnects the house from the grid. And just as many parts of the US power grid aren’t set up to integrate solar and wind power into regular operations it’s not equipped to draw on energy from electric cars when needed.

The main problem Jacobs told Recode is that utility companies have historically had a monopoly on energy generation in the country and they’re unwilling to let go of their literal and metaphorical power. “It really comes down to the enthusiasm of the utility to sort it out” Jacobs said. “And whether there’s any value for them to spend the time on it.” Profit-wise there doesn’t seem to be a reason why a utility would want to do that.

One of the starkest examples of the hold utilities have over energy generation in the US comes from solar panels Baker told Recode. For the safety of their linesmen utilities set up the circuits in most homes to simply shut down in a blackout even if backup power is available. “If you have rooftop solar chances are during a grid outage your rooftop solar won’t be able to power your house” Baker said. “This is a huge issue because people buy solar thinking they’re going to power their houses during an outage.” To make rooftop solar — and backup power from EVs — work during a blackout Baker explained homeowners would have to wire their panels and EV charger on a separate circuit from the energy provided by the utility which is a costly proposition that also undoes the benefits of integrating EV batteries into the grid.

But we don’t have to make a choice between the grid and backup power from EV batteries: They can coexist and effectively integrating them could have a significant impact on emissions. “The technology is here” said Houston. “It’s a matter of breaking down the policy and administrative barriers.”

Breaking down those barriers would help create a paradigm shift in how we think about electricity generation just as using our cars as batteries would be a paradigm shift. Electric vehicles are by no means a magic fix to our climate woes — there are plenty of sources of greenhouse gas emissions outside of cars and a reduction in transportation emissions will only go so far if our EVs get their energy from fossil fuel-powered plants. But their potential stretches far beyond their wheels and more Americans recognizing that could mean more will decide to make the switch to electric. Saving our planet is going to require big bold changes; buying a battery that just so happens to provide transportation is the rare tangible contribution regular folks can make to help solve the climate crisis.

“And in reality” said Jacobs “when we’re talking about giving up fossil fuels this all counts.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbGVhcm5pbmdlbmdsaXNoLnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2Evc29ueS1leHBsb3Jlcy1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItYnVzaW5lc3MtcHJlc2VudHMtbmV3LXZlaGljbGUtbW9kZWwvNjM4NTM4Mi5odG1s0gFzaHR0cHM6Ly9sZWFybmluZ2VuZ2xpc2gudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NvbnktZXhwbG9yZXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLWJ1c2luZXNzLXByZXNlbnRzLW5ldy12ZWhpY2xlLW1vZGVsLzYzODUzODIuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sony Explores Electric Car Business Presents New Vehicle Model,"

Japan’s Sony Group says it plans to launch a company this spring to explore entering the electric vehicle (EV) market.

Sony’s president and chairman Kenichiro Yoshida announced the plans Wednesday in the United States. He was speaking at the start of the CES technology conference in Las Vegas Nevada.

The new company called Sony Mobility Inc. also aims “to make the best use of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics technologies” Sony said in a statement. It will seek to “help realize a world where everyone can live in harmony with robots on a daily basis” the statement added.

Sony said its imaging sensing and entertainment technologies put the company in a good position “to redefine mobility” Yoshida said. Such technologies are expected to play an important part in the operations of self-driving vehicles.

During his presentation Yoshida introduced a new electric vehicle model called the VISION-S 02. He said the vehicle is based on the same technology as the VISION-S 01 a model presented at the CES conference in 2020.

Sony said it started road testing the VISION-S 01 in Europe in December 2020. And it has carried out tests on the vehicle’s imaging sensing and safety systems. The company has the same plans for its VISION-S 02.

Yoshida told reporters the company sees mobility as an ""entertainment space"" where passengers can choose individualized entertainment and connect using 5G. 5G is the next generation of high-speed wireless technology.

Many large automobile manufacturers worldwide are investing heavily in electric vehicle technology. American-based electric car maker Tesla has risen to become the world's most valuable automobile company. In Japan Toyota Motor Corporation announced in December it planned to invest $70 billion to electrify its automobiles by 2030.

Many investors also expect iPhone maker Apple to launch an electric vehicle within the next few years.

Meanwhile a U.S. company based in Michigan said this week that it had tested a version of a new battery. The device was able to power a vehicle for 1210 kilometers on a single charge. The test was carried out in a Tesla Model S vehicle.

The company Our Next Energy (ONE) says it plans to begin producing batteries with a similar ability by late 2023.

ONE’s chief executive Mujeeb Ijaz told Reuters news agency “We plan to build (batteries) in North America and believe it can be done economically.”

The company has worked to develop a long-distance battery that uses safer and more sustainable materials. The batteries are designed to contain more energy in a smaller less costly space.

Ijaz has 30 years of industry experience in developing battery systems for electric cars. He formerly led such projects for Apple and battery maker A123 Systems.

He said the company aims to remove in-demand metals such as nickel and cobalt from its batteries without losing energy density. “We aim to re-invent battery chemistry as well as the cell architecture” to be able to reach 1210 kilometers of distance between charges Ijaz told Reuters.

G.M. and Ford closed one factory after another — sometimes for months on end — because of a shortage of computer chips leaving dealer lots bare and sending car prices zooming. Yet Tesla racked up record sales quarter after quarter and ended the year having sold nearly twice as many vehicles as it did in 2020 unhindered by an industrywide crisis.

Tesla’s ability to conjure up critical components has a greater significance than one year’s car sales. It suggests that the company and possibly other young electric car businesses could threaten the dominance of giants like Volkswagen and G.M. sooner and more forcefully than most industry executives and policymakers realize. That would help the effort to reduce the emissions that are causing climate change by displacing more gasoline-powered cars sooner. But it could hurt the millions of workers thousands of suppliers and numerous local and national governments that rely on traditional auto production for jobs business and tax revenue.

Tesla and its enigmatic chief executive Elon Musk have said little about how the carmaker ran circles around the rest of the auto industry. Now it’s becoming clear that the company simply had a superior command of technology and its own supply chain. Tesla appeared to better forecast demand than businesses that produce many more cars than it does. Other automakers were surprised by how quickly the car market recovered from a steep drop early in the pandemic and had simply not ordered enough chips and parts fast enough.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZW5lcmd5ZGlnaXRhbC5jb20vcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS9sYXJnZXN0LXVzLXJlbmV3YWJsZS1lbmVyZ3ktcHJvamVjdC1hbmQtcnVubmluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Largest US renewable energy project up and running,"A major renewable energy project - billed as the largest in American history - is now up and running in central New Mexico.

Pattern Energy Group has begun commercial operation of its Western Spirit Wind power projects which comprises four wind power facilities totaling more than 1050MW located in Guadalupe Lincoln and Torrance Counties.

US Senator Martin Heinrich said Western Spirit connects rural communities in central New Mexico to local customers and other major energy markets beyond state borders. ""This project literally changed the map of our state's energy landscape allowing New Mexico to help power our nation with clean electrons"" he said.

Western Spirit Wind is a groundbreaking megaproject that demonstrates large-scale renewables can be developed and built in the US said Mike Garland CEO of Pattern Energy.

""These projects create significant job opportunities and local economic investments. Western Spirit brought over 1100 construction jobs to New Mexico generated local spending tax revenue and landowner payments in a remote area of New Mexico and is now delivering enough renewable energy to meet the electricity needs of more than 900000 Americans"" he said.

""The collaboration of our teams of workers around the state shows what can be achieved – building the largest single-phase wind project in US history in less than one year – a truly remarkable achievement. This is just the beginning for New Mexico – Pattern Energy has committed to $6 billion in upcoming wind energy and related infrastructure projects in the state over the next decade. Together we are building a cleaner and more sustainable future in New Mexico.""

The four wind power facilities utilise a total of 377 GE wind turbines ranging from 2.3 to 2.8 MW. The GE turbines utilise various tower heights to optimise the wind capture at each facility.

Western Spirit Wind was developed by Pattern Energy and Blattner Energy served as the construction contractor.

The wind project and accompanying transmission line involved more than 1100 workers on-site during the 15-month construction period including heavy equipment operators electricians laborers and others. Going forward more than 50 workers will operate and maintain the Western Spirit Wind facilities in New Mexico.

Western Spirit Wind will have far-reaching economic benefits for the local area and is projected to provide an estimated $3 million per year for the three counties and two school districts in the project area. Stable long-term funding directly contributes to improved quality of education services roads and first responder capabilities for the entire community.

Western Spirit Wind will provide clean renewable energy to California and New Mexico through long-term power purchase agreements with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power San José Clean Energy East Bay Community Energy California Choice Energy Authority and member cities and international energy company Uniper Global Commodities. Western Spirit Wind will also provide power to New Mexico municipalities including Los Alamos Department of Public Utilities through the Uniper Global Commodities power purchase agreement.

The wind power generated by Western Spirit Wind has a complementary generation profile to solar and typically delivers power around the clock. The power will provide resource diversification to western energy markets to help meet customer demand during the crucial early evening hours when demand is high but otherwise available renewable energy supply is typically low.

Last month Pattern Energy and the New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority (RETA) announced the completion of the Western Spirit Transmission line enabling the suite of Western Spirit Wind projects to be connected to the grid.

The 155-mile 345 kV transmission line developed jointly by Pattern Energy and RETA is delivering wind power from Western Spirit Wind in central New Mexico to the electric grid managed by Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) near Albuquerque. PNM owns and will operate the transmission line.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMi8wMS8wOS9hZnRlci13YXJuaW5nLWFuZC1mLXJhdGluZy1mcm9tLWJiYi1lbGVjdHJpYy1zY29vdGVyLWUtYmlrZS1jb21wYW55LWdvdHJheC1yZXNwb25kcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After warning and 'F' rating from BBB electric scooter & e-bike company GoTrax responds,"We’ve all heard it: “Supply chain issues”. It’s one of the main reasons for disruptions to so many industries across the spectrum. And at a time when micromobility products such as electric bikes and e-scooters are taking off like wildfire many companies are coming under fire for their slow shipping and slower responses to customer complaints. But while several companies have battled with angry consumer sentiment one has drawn more ire than anyone else: GoTrax.

It got so bad that the Better Business Bureau issued a rare public warning last month informing consumers that it was flagging GoTrax and giving the company an “F” rating.

The complaints weren’t just about slow shipping that has affected much of the industry but also included defective products and warranty issues as well.

To be fair GoTrax is known as a budget company and so their electric scooters and e-bikes prioritize affordable prices over higher quality manufacturing. But even for a budget company the complaints were stacking up much higher than anywhere else.

The BBB said they began investigating GoTrax “after receiving hundreds of complaints from customers in 41 states across the United States and Canada.”

That’s…. not good.

To figure out what went so wrong and to hear what they planned to do about it I spoke directly with the company.

And to their credit they bared all.

GoTrax’s Marketing Director Jeff Lawrence discussed the issues in detail with me. He explained that they had been monitoring their slipping reviews but hadn’t realized that the BBB score has dropped to an “F” rating until the bureau issued its public warning.

As Jeff continued:

As we were planning for 2022 it was evident to our management that to continue to separate GoTrax from the other electric scooter brands we had to improve our service. We categorized our BBB complaints and these were the main issues: 1. Issue with the product – especially outside of 90 day warranty period 2. Issue of slow or unreachable customer service 3. Future – What GoTrax customers can expect

He then discussed the plan developed by the company to address each of the concerns.

Product reliability concerns

Beginning with product reliability and warranty issues GoTrax has decided to increase its warranty period from 90 to 180 days.

Quality standards are also going up which the company says is evidenced by its product return rate dropping by over 50% recently.

Jeff said that can be attributed to two things. First GoTrax has worked to improve its manufacturing process from using higher quality components such as battery connectors hardware and wiring to implementing third-party QC that inspects the factory’s work on site. Secondly GoTrax has begun selling less of its entry-level models and more of its higher-priced yet higher-quality models such as the GMax and G4. Those scooters range from $599-$799 as compared to GoTrax’s cheapest $349 scooters.

Our G4 and GMAX ultra are extremely popular with the lowest return rate. In our Facebook group (not run by GoTrax but run by actual riders) you can find posts of people resetting the odometer two or three times. It resets at 1000 miles. That’s extremely impressive for a $599-$799 e-scooter.

Jeff explained that GoTrax will also have a new series of electric scooters which will debut in February that were developed using customer feedback to further improve the design.

Improving customer service

For many GoTrax scooter owners customer service has become the biggest complaint against the company. And Jeff says GoTrax is now keenly aware of that shortcoming.

“This is the issue that we definitely see as a failure on our part and have taken the most action to correct to have the best year ever for GoTrax and its riders.”

Jeff explained that one of the company’s biggest issues during the pandemic was staffing-related.

To help GoTrax is now supplementing its internal customer service team with an additional third party support service that is trained by GoTrax staff and works directly with the team. Back in January of 2021 the GoTrax support team had dropped to a low point of just four people. One year later that team has grown to 29. Jeff says that has helped them drop their average ticket response time to under 12 hours.

The company is also transitioning its top customer service agents to phone support this week which Jeff explains took a longer training period for the product knowledge required to deal with the wide range of e-scooters and e-bikes offered by GoTrax.

GoTrax is now actively monitoring its BBB complaints and has been able to reach out to customers on all complaints filed in 2021 though Jeff explained that this is difficult becuase the BBB sometimes supplies very little contact information. That can make it tricky for GoTrax to match the complaints to their customer database. A quick check of the BBB page shows that many of those complaints have now been marked as resolved by the customers. GoTrax says it is still working to resolve the remainder of the complaints.

Jeff explained that GoTrax has hired a new customer service manager who previously ran an Apple remote service team and has hired a new team lead for the phone support team who previously managed phone support at Dyson. Jeff suggested that if anyone has a complaint that has not been resolved they can reach out directly to GoTrax’s customer service manager at Jonathan@gotrax.com.

GoTrax had previously held a 1-star rating based on reviews on its BBB page but has since increased to just shy of 4-stars with a current 3.94/5 review score. The BBB’s grade of “F” still stands but Jeff says that that GoTrax is committing itself to achieve an “A” rating and a review score of 4.5/5 by the end of 2022.

Improving the customer experience

Looking forward GoTrax is now working hard to ensure that customers received a much better experience than they have in the past.

Jeff laid out what customers can expect right now:

14 days to test a new scooter or return it if not satisfied.

6 months of warranty coverage free optional paid 1-2 year warranty plan from Mulberry.

Lifetime of support troubleshooting and help with parts plus constantly updated product guides.

Looking to the future GoTrax will implement these features by May of 2022:

Opening a service center in Dallas Texas to repair scooters under warranty and offer affordable repairs for out-of-warranty scooters. The team is apparently already hired and is working on preparing the new service center.

An increased effort to source parts and keep them well stocked despite current supply chain issues. The company is also sending more replacement parts up front with new models so owners already have parts if they should become necessary.

A potential increase in warranty to 1 year on higher-end models and new 2022 models.

As Jeff continued:

From the ownership to the employees our biggest focus this year is to provide more value to our customers. We want every GoTrax customer to feel confident that 1) You will get a 100% working scooter 2) if you do have any issues you can always reach us Monday – Friday and 3) Whether it’s brand new within 6 months or after the warranty we always have a solution for our customers to get riding again.

Electrek’s Take

Bad reviews are eventually part of running a business. You can’t please everyone. Every week my inbox is flooded with people telling me why X company is the worst in the world because Y happened and the e-bike/e-scooter brand must be imploding because it didn’t give them Z. I don’t think I’ve heard of a single micromobility company that doesn’t have support complaints floating around the internet. And it’s worse than ever now because of the surging demand combined with tightened supply. It’s a perfect storm.

But GoTrax was in a league of its own when it came to bad reviews. While I used to get emails fairly equally for most companies the GoTrax complaints started flowing in faster and more fervently than ever. Something was obviously up and I knew it was time to push the company for explanations.

I’m actually impressed with how GoTrax took responsibility and said “We messed up. Here’s how we are trying to make it right for current customers with issues and here’s how we are trying to prevent this from happening in the future.”

That doesn’t absolve them of poor practices. And this kind of insight certainly sheds light on what happened. Four people on customer service? Wow. Large companies like Rad Power Bikes have literally hundreds of people working the phone lines and email/chat support.

But I’m glad to see that GoTrax is making real improvements where it counts: namely on product reliability and support. The best solution is to make your stuff break less. But since some things will always break effective service is a necessity.

So I’m cautiously optimistic that GoTrax will be able to achieve its goals and take care of its commitments to customers. But time will tell. As will their BBB rating."

View the current offers here.

The floodwaters from the remains of Hurricane Ida ended up christening my move to New York City last August.

Pulling up stakes in Texas to start afresh in Brooklyn I found an apartment on Zillow that seemed like a smoking deal: right in the lively Bed-Stuy neighborhood recently renovated and surprisingly affordable.

The catch was that the bedroom was in the basement — something I later discovered was actually illegal.

""No big deal"" I thought when the realtor showed me the apartment. ""At least it will be dark when I sleep."" Within days I would realize what an awful mistake I had made.

The deluge

After signing the lease I bought a mattress a dresser a bed frame and other apartment essentials on Amazon with my American Express® Gold Card.

The only thing left to do was to fly back to Houston grab my car and embark on the long drive across the country. During the multiday road trip I was giddy thinking about how much fun living in New York would surely be.

Mere hours away from Brooklyn however my newsfeed started to buzz about the remnants of Hurricane Ida leaving a path of destruction across the Northeast. Minutes later a rapid succession of text messages blew up my phone.

From my new landlord: ""Hey I hate to be the bearer of bad news here. …"" I held my breath. Could something have gone wrong with the lease? ""... But your bedroom is flooding. There is about four inches of water so far. It came from the street so you're probably going to need new stuff.""

The message concluded with the frowny face water and shoulder shrug emojis.

Translation: Welcome to New York. Just so you know this is your problem and I am not going to do anything about it.

Amex to the rescue

I resigned myself to sleeping on an air mattress in the kitchen until my landlord remediated the bedroom. (Spoiler alert: He never did.)

Thankfully a colleague at The Points Guy knew that I have an Amex Gold Card and that the card carries purchase protection that should theoretically insure my purchases against damages from natural disasters.

(Photo by John Gribben for The Points Guy)

In addition to covering natural disaster-related damages Amex's purchase protection also covers items that are stolen or damaged. The card's coverage extends up to 90 days after purchase and $10000 per item (and up to $50000 per eligible card per calendar year). However its natural disaster protection is only up to $500 per covered event so that would be the number to which I was limited.

Once I started the claims process it was surprisingly straightforward proving once again why American Express has such a sterling customer service reputation.

Thanks to the card's policy Amex covered $500 of my losses from Ida — enough to hire a lawyer to help me break my lease and move out of the water-logged apartment.

I tend to focus on the Amex Gold Card's flashier benefits like up to $120 annually in Uber cash for rides and Uber Eats orders in the U.S.; up to $120 in annual statement credits toward dining with Grubhub The Cheesecake Factory Goldbelly Wine.com Milk Bar and select Shake Shack locations and earning 4 Membership Rewards points per dollar on dining at restaurants and at U.S. supermarkets on up to $25000 in purchases per calendar year (then 1 point per dollar) 3 points per dollar on airfare booked directly with airlines or through Amex Travel and 1 point per dollar on other purchases. Enrollment required for select benefits.

However the natural disaster purchase protection the card afforded me really drove home how valuable the card's benefits can be and why it was worth paying the $250 annual fee (see rates and fees).

Coverage terms and tips

Luckily my purchases were covered under pretty clear-cut circumstances. However for others with this card or other Amex products that also offer purchase protections the issuer's definition of natural disasters can include fires earthquakes storms freezes and floods.

When such mishaps occur you'll need to take the following steps to make a purchase protection claim:

Confirm that you actually used an eligible Amex card to purchase the goods in question and that the purchases were made within the past 90 days. If you did not use your Amex to purchase the damaged stuff unfortunately you're not eligible for reimbursement.

If you did not use your Amex to purchase the damaged stuff unfortunately you're not eligible for reimbursement. Call American Express within 30 days of the natural disaster but ideally as soon as possible to inform them that you plan to file a natural disaster claim. The U.S. number is 1-800-322-1277. You can also call collect at 1-303-273-6498. Once you speak to a representative they will send you a claims form within 15 days. Alternatively you can file the claim completely online but I preferred talking to an Amex representative on the phone to fully convey the urgency of the situation.

If possible hire an adjuster to assess your damages . Adjusters usually charge 5-15% of the reimbursement amount. While this step will make your claim stronger Amex does not require it since the maximum amount for reimbursement is not a huge sum ($500). I did not hire an adjuster but my claim would have been processed more quickly if I had.

Potential snags

Since I didn't have photos or a statement from an adjuster my claim took longer than it might otherwise have to process.

Amex never outright rejected my claim but I received an email from the company two weeks after first submitting the paperwork saying that it required more information to move forward. After another phone call (mercifully without more than a minute or two of hold time) the first representative escalated the case to his supervisor.

I explained the situation in detail to the supervisor who had read the news about Ida's damage in New York and was sympathetic to my plight. He assured me that he would personally review my case and apprise me of his decision.

Two weeks later I checked my Amex portal and saw that $500 had been credited to my account.

Bottom line

Although using a rewards card for purchases can be a great way to rack up points or miles for your next trip sometimes the most valuable benefit a card can offer is purchase protection that covers your items against theft damage — and as I discovered natural disasters.

My Amex Gold Card was a lifesaver after the storm waterlogged items I'd purchased for my new apartment. I only wish the coverage cap had been higher. Still the $500 I was reimbursed was enough to get me back on my feet ... and into a better living situation.

It never hurts to double check your cards to see which ones offer the best purchase protection. Make sure to save your receipts whether digital or physical.

If something does happen to your purchase be prepared to accurately describe what happened in your claim report and take photos of the damage. The busy work including time on the phone should not take more than a couple of hours and claims usually process within a few weeks.

In my experience Amex fully delivered on its reputation for unrivaled customer service.

If you knew what to look for that is.

The strength of a PGA Tour field can be a moving target. You could have the exact same 156 players in a tournament for two consecutive years but the second year might seem stronger based on major championship victories or other tournament wins in the previous 12 months. Or you could have pretty much the same field in consecutive years but the addition of one or two players can vault the second year to higher status in the eyes of fans.

In the case of the 2022 American Express which does have a strong field both reasons are completely valid.

Consider for instance Patrick Cantlay. The UCLA graduate and former No.1 amateur player had three PGA Tour wins when he teed off in La Quinta in 2021. He nearly won that tournament with a stellar 61 in the final round. But he went on to double his tour wins total to six with a brilliant 2020-2021 season and won the PGA Tour Player of the Year award. He returns to The American Express in two weeks but now his presence adds something a little special to the field.

That might not be true of Phil Mickelson who added his allure to the 2021 American Express an allure that includes being host of the event a World Golf Hall of Famer and one of the most popular players in history. Yes Mickelson won the 2021 PGA Championship in a historic victory at the age of 50 but Mickelson would have been just as big a draw at the 2022 tournament without that PGA Championship win. But that major victory Mickelson’s sixth overall meant the tournament knew it was assured of having at least one reigning major champion in its 2022 field.

Major winners in the field

Then came the Jon Rahm victory at the U.S. Open. Rahm had committed to play the 2021 American Express but pulled out when he felt something not quite right in a gym session just before the tournament. A past winner of The American Express fans could hope that Rahm would return to La Quinta in 2022 and this time bring a U.S. Open title to the event. That would be two of the four major champions in the field.

All of that has indeed played out for the tournament. Rahm is back with his major title Mickelson brings a current major title to the tournament and Cantlay is the PGA Tour player of the year and the Tour Championship winner. Any tournament on the PGA Tour would love to have that as a core to build on two of the top five players in the world rankings and one of the game’s all-time greats.

Another measure of a field is how many of the top 50 players in the world are entered and again that can be a moving target. A player could be 60th last year and played his way up to 48th this year and somehow that changes the perception of a field without changing the names at all.

As of now 13 of the top 50 players are in the field one more than the 2021 American Express offered. But defending champion Kim is 53rd at the moment so somehow he counts as an asset to the field as the defending champion but not as a top-50 player.

Jason Day’s ranking is 126th but it wasn’t that long ago he seemed to be contending for every major championship he played. Would fans rather have him in the field for the first time – he works on his game in the winter in the desert but has never played in The American Express – or a more nameless player ranked in the top 90 or so in the world?

And so The American Express has its strong field. Perhaps it won’t be as strong as the Farmers Insurance event in San Diego the next week or even the Abu Dhabi tournament or the DP World Tour played the same weekend. But it’s a field that tournament officials can be delighted about and a field that will sell tickets.

In this comprehensive insight for The Fintech Times Gergo Varga SEON‘s Senior Content Manager discusses the avenues issuers can pursue to protect both their consumers and their reputation in the face of more sophisticated card-not-present attacks.

Varga has been fighting online fraud since 2009 at various companies – even co-founding his own anti-fraud startup. He’s the author of the Fraud Prevention Guide for Dummies – SEON Special edition. He uses his industry knowledge to keep marketing sharp communicating between the different departments to understand what’s happening on the frontlines of fraud detection.

Virtual cards are on the rise. According to Juniper Research they are expected to grow by 363 per cent in the next five years to $6.8trillion in 2026 – more than 3.5-times the revenue of 2021’s already impressive $1.9trillion.

But let’s set the record straight: There is more than one type of card that is referred to as a “virtual card”. Some use this term for virtual debit cards issued by companies such as Revolut Skrill and Wise and linked to existing funds. Others include prepaid bank cards by major issuers or even gift cards managed online. And as iCard points out there are also virtual credit cards in the mix. Following the more widely accepted definition I will use “virtual card” here to refer to any non-physical card as they share several characteristics benefits and shortcomings when it comes to security.

Virtual Cards: The Basics

In their simplest form these are non-physical payment cards issued by banks or fintechs delivering convenience in CNP (card not present) transactions as well as NFC payments.

From there whether it’s going to be a credit or debit card or even a prepaid card depends on the type of credit it is linked to. By virtue of being digital and online these have allowed for additional innovation compared to their physical counterparts. What’s more these cards can be multi-use or single-use with the latter generally considered safer.

In reality it is no longer only startups like Wise and Currenxie who have been issuing virtual card numbers. It wasn’t long until big players joined in including Wells Fargo with its digital wallet and virtual card(s) combination option and major card issuers such as American Express and Mastercard. Plus we are increasingly seeing startups partner up with established players in the sector such as the collaboration between Extend and American Express.

We have also seen combination “hybrid” cards from several issuers which primarily exist as virtual cards but can provide the consumer with a physical card as well. As these are primarily virtual they come with the same benefits and shortcomings as virtual cards.

Virtual Card Security: Fraudsters Will Adapt

As they are a fintech-adjacent innovation the benefits of virtual cards have (rightfully) been touted and celebrated. For instance they allow for faster onboarding and ease of use and better spending oversight for individuals and businesses alike.

But while their convenience is unquestionable for everyone involved from consumers to a business issuing cards for its employees and to fintechs themselves the safety aspect of virtual credit and debit cards is less clear-cut. The short version is: While they address some of the more persistent problems with traditional legacy payment cards they introduce a host of new considerations and shortcomings.

The vast majority of card fraud taking place is CNP fraud at 79 per cent in the EU vs 15 per cent for POS payments and 6 per cent for ATM card fraud per Merchant Savvy. This amounts to almost €1.5/$1.7billion in 2018 alone. Worldwide it’s set to reach $36.22billion in 2022.

Card not present fraud encompasses all fraudulent transactions conducted where the card’s physical presence is not required. Importantly this does not only include online sales but also mobile app sales telephone transactions skimming and testing as explained in a SEON breakdown of CNP fraud. Because the presence of a card is not required criminals will steal or buy “fullz” online – comprised of the card number CVV expiry date billing address and cardholder number and proceed to use it in various schemes.

Innovation Can Mean New Pain Points

Certainly some of the innovations introduced by virtual cards add ways to mitigate against such CNP fraud. For example Visa provides the capability for dynamically generated ever-changing CVV2 confirmation numbers for more security. This is done via an app and changes the way the CVV number traditionally works: from something known to anyone who can see the back of the card to an MFA factor for additional security.

Another feature that can contribute to fraud prevention is the fact that virtual cards can be set to automatically expire after a specific amount of money has been spent – similarly to how a gift card works even if it’s a virtual debit or even a credit card.

However at the same time those conveniences that allow for real-life payments using virtual cards have drawn the attention of criminals. The innovation brought upon by NFC payment apps combined with gift cards is taken advantage of by fraudsters opening up brand new avenues. With digital wallets you can fill them up with stolen virtual cards and use them to purchase items in store. For all intents and purposes the result functions as a physical card.

One cannot overstress that virtual cards can give consumers a sense of false complacency because of how they are marketed or regarded by the general public – with the above just one of several examples. Virtual card fraud is real and harms issuers payment processors merchants the economy as well as consumers themselves.

Takeovers Are Made More Dangerous

One new attack vector for fraudsters is account takeover (ATO). With a legacy card you make sure you didn’t lose it – or cancel right away if you do. With a virtual card in addition to making sure its details are not intercepted copied or stolen one has to safeguard the account used to generate the card and on which the card resides.

There are hundreds of examples of this including Payoneer and Porte taking the form of a mobile app or a web platform. No matter the specifics if someone manages to hack into your account they have access to those funds or spending potential. Depending on the user settings and platform configuration the customer might not get notified about it which means leaving a live card in criminals’ hands for longer.

For merchants such attacks come with chargeback requests which take resources to process while they can be equally damaging for payment processors and card issuers – who have their reputation on the line too especially when they are startups

ATO attacks don’t stop at hacking into a customer’s Revolut Wise or traditional bank account. Increasingly over the past decade we have observed the trend to invite customers to store their card details on their e-shop and platform accounts mobile wallets web browsers etc. Although explicit permission is required this is opt-out in some locales and opt-in in others meaning some consumers will not realise it is happening.

A fraudster hacking into someone’s Amazon account may not be able to view the complete number of a stored card but they could still set up a reshipping scheme using those cards to order merchandise they can resell – or even attempt to crack the missing details to use the card elsewhere. It seems that Amazon in particular is well aware of how attractive it is to criminals with a white hat hacking event in June 2021 paying out $832135 to specialists who found new vulnerabilities for the ecommerce giant to patch. Social media and online message boards are rife with consumer and merchant complaints about hacked Amazon accounts.

Besides open banking through API calls introduced to Europe in 2016 through the PSD2 Payment Services Directive and more recently 2021 in the USA adds to the safety concern. Through these APIs access to banking data linked to virtual cards and other products is granted to third-party applications each of which is one more account to be hacked. For example Tally is an app that consolidates consumers’ payment cards. A criminal who successfully guesses or intercepts someone’s credentials and logs into this account will not just harm the consumer but every party involved in that transaction: merchant processor merchant’s bank issuer post-purchase payment provider…

Single-Use Virtual Payment Cards

Meanwhile we have also seen the phenomenon of single-use virtual payment cards. Depending on the provider this can either mean a card that is literally used once or a pre-loaded card that expires once the money runs out and is non-reloadable – for example the Virtual Single option by ePayService. This measure seeks to ensure that even if a card’s fullz do get stolen the criminal won’t be able to take advantage of them.

Yet there are two main attack paths here. The first is the aforementioned account takeover attack. Since it is a fintech app generating these single-use cards from a consumer’s account access to this account will give the criminal more to take advantage of than the theft of one physical card.

Secondly however this type of setup facilitates brute force BIN attacks where a criminal will use software to generate a large number of potential virtual card numbers. They will then test these at various online stores to find some that work in order to use them in earnest in their schemes. They can choose to attack a specific card issuer in particular so any fintech whose applications generate single-use virtual payment cards (as well as easily generate multi-use ones) can fall victim – resulting in loss of revenue resources consumer trust and reputation.

Preventing Virtual Card Fraud

Just like with traditional cards the impact of virtual card fraud is felt by several stakeholders rather than just the consumer and as a result measures will both benefit everyone and should be taken by everyone in the transaction chain. It should be noted that the most common means of stealing account credentials is phishing which is also the most common type of cybercrime reported in the US topping the list of incidents reported to IC3 in 2020 with 241342 cases. Second came non-payment/non-delivery at less than half the cases.

Beyond educating consumers and employees on online safety fintechs involved in virtual card issuing processing and payments have a variety of tools at their disposal when coming face to face with potential cybercriminals.

Once it is understood that virtual cards do not remove risk altogether each organisation can look at its specific needs and assess those tools that are most useful as well as their configuration. For example:

Advanced fingerprinting : Gathers a wealth of data points about a user attempting an action (e.g. requesting a new card or logging into an account) related to their configuration and device ultimately allowing us to find hidden connections between users.

: Gathers a wealth of data points about a user attempting an action (e.g. requesting a new card or logging into an account) related to their configuration and device ultimately allowing us to find hidden connections between users. Behaviour analysis and velocity rules : Examines a user’s behaviour and also compares it to their previous sessions. For example a cursor moving in a completely straight line over multiple screens is probably programmed rather than the result of someone moving a computer mouse – which can hint at a fraudster’s tool.

: Examines a user’s behaviour and also compares it to their previous sessions. For example a cursor moving in a completely straight line over multiple screens is probably programmed rather than the result of someone moving a computer mouse – which can hint at a fraudster’s tool. Reverse email and phone lookup : Sources OSINT (open-source intelligence) data linked to the user-provided given email address and phone number to assess whether they are who they claim to be.

Machine learning: Historical incidents are studied by machine learning algorithms to calculate the ideal configuration of the above tools for each organisation’s needs.

Often vendors will consolidate some or all of the above into a comprehensive solution while some have pre-set industry rules that allow for faster implementation – for example payment processors or lenders. These are frequently updated to address the ever-changing fraud landscape.

Go Forth and Innovate – But Stay Vigilant

So where do we stand with virtual cards? There’s no question that the convenience and increased security many of them have introduced are much appreciated as is the departure from cumbersome traditional products that don’t work for everyone.

But it is also imperative to stress that despite this innovation security risks have not been eliminated and some new ones have been introduced. Anyone involved with virtual cards from those who issue them to those who process them and even those who use them ought to keep this in mind and take appropriate precautions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9kZWFscy9zYW4tZnJhbmNpc2NvLXVuZGVyLTEwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deal Alert: Fly to San Francisco for as low as $78 round-trip,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

Summary

“We also have to work though sort of the dark side if you will… if we're going to be successful. That's the world these folks operate in and so it's going to be vital for US to use any means at our disposal basically to achieve our objective.”

– US Vice President Dick Cheney September 16 2001[2]

Two decades after the attacks of September 11 2001 and the arrival of the first terrorism suspects at Guantánamo Bay on January 11 2002 many Americans may not recall details of the systematic abuses carried out by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and US military against hundreds if not thousands of Muslims detained as part of what President George W. Bush swiftly declared a global “War on Terror.” Yet for many people in countries outside the United States memories of the US government’s brutal treatment of detained Muslims remain potent. And some abuses continue handing a recruitment card to Islamist armed groups and lowering the bar for treatment of terrorism suspects worldwide.

With the participation of at least 54 governments the CIA secretly and extrajudicially transferred at least 119 foreign Muslims from one foreign country to another for incommunicado detention and harsh interrogation at various CIA black sites. At least 39 of the men were subjected to “waterboarding” “walling” “rectal feeding” – a form of rape – and other forms of torture.[3] The US military also held thousands of foreign Muslim security detainees and prisoners-of-war – including some women and boys – at its detention centers abroad including Abu Ghraib in Iraq Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and its naval base at Guantánamo and also subjected many to physical and psychological abuse.[4]

As of January 6 2022 the US was still detaining 39 of the nearly 800 men and boys it brought to Guantánamo from 2002 to 2008. Twenty-seven of those who remain have never been charged.[5] Many lack adequate medical care and even access to their medical records making the prison a living legacy of the rights violations spawned by 9/11.[6] The military commission system created to prosecute suspects at Guantánamo is fundamentally flawed. As a result the five prisoners accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks have yet to be brought to trial depriving them of due process and the survivors and the families of the nearly 3000 people who died in the attacks of their right to justice.[7]

Popular culture has often glossed over the cruelty and failures of these measures. For example the 2012 blockbuster movie Zero Dark Thirty and a 2019 “interrogation” exhibit at the International Spy Museum in Washington DC – only partially revised after an outcry by human rights activists and lawmakers – trivialized the abuses inflicted on suspects and suggested erroneously that the torture worked.[8]

Today even when the US decries unlawful practices abroad it appears to have lost the moral authority that might compel other countries to curb them. Moreover although President Barack Obama declared an end to secret detention and torture upon taking office in 2009 cruel and unlawful US counterterrorism practices adopted in response to 9/11 continue to this day as do their repercussions.

No US government officials have been held accountable for creating authorizing or implementing the CIA’s secret detention and torture programs. All but a heavily redacted summary of the landmark 2014 US Senate Intelligence Committee report on the covert CIA program (the “Torture Report”) remains classified. The portions that have been released make clear that the torture was as useless in producing actionable intelligence as it was brutal.[9] Like Presidents Obama and Donald J. Trump before him President Joseph R. Biden has shown no appetite for releasing the Torture Report much less criminally investigating the architects of the Rendition Detention and Interrogation (RDI) program or other post-September 11 abuses. Biden also opposes allowing the International Criminal Court to include abuses by US nationals in its investigation on grave human rights crimes in Afghanistan.

Abroad the US has continued abusive practices against terrorism suspects including transferring them to countries that torture and in at least some cases unlawfully detaining them at US-run sites abroad or at sea. Although such US detention-related counterterrorism violations have dramatically decreased Washington has replaced capture with kill conducting air strikes – often with armed drones that have killed thousands of civilians including outside recognized battlefields. Its counterterrorism campaign has spread to 85 countries with scant transparency or oversight.[10]

Meanwhile some US allies in the fight against armed groups like Al Qaeda the Islamic State (ISIS) and Boko Haram are carrying out torture and other crimes against terrorism suspects including children and detaining them inhumanely and in many cases indefinitely. Some allies have executed suspects following flawed trials.

This paper assesses the massive costs of US extraordinary renditions unlawful detentions and torture after September 11 – including to the victims and suspects to US taxpayers and to US moral authority and counterterrorism efforts worldwide ultimately jeopardizing universal human rights protections for everyone. It argues that significant counterterrorism reforms including closing the prison at Guantánamo strengthening measures to protect civilians from death and harm increasing transparency and accountability for the crimes the US has committed and addressing religious and racial biases are critical steps toward mitigating the damage.

The Taliban’s return to power and the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 will test the US government’s legal rationale for indefinite law-of-war detentions at Guantánamo as well as the Biden administration’s commitment to adopting a more rights-respecting approach to counterterrorism. Thus far Biden administration actions raise sobering questions about its commitment to ending the so-called “War on Terror.” Measures of concern that we outline below include the Justice Department’s willingness to side-step critical legal questions on habeas rights for the men held at Guantánamo and to block certain testimony related to CIA torture and Biden’s apparent intent to continue using lethal force outside recognized war zones with drone strikes and special forces raids euphemistically rebranded as “over the horizon” operations.[11]

Key Recommendations

Biden should take bold steps to repair the damage from abusive US interrogations and detentions starting with the closure of the US prison at Guantánamo. Among other measures the President should release the Torture Report and authorize the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to hold abusers to account. Biden should increase transparency and accountability for other crimes and violations perpetrated in the name of countering terrorism including unlawful air strikes and raids that kill and injure civilians both in and out of recognized war zones. He should officially apologize and provide redress to victims. Anything less not only inadequately addresses the suffering and death wrought by the US but also risks perpetuating cycles of violence by fueling the narrative of groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda that the West is at war with Islam.

Torture and the Global “War on Terror”

On September 11 2001 coordinated strikes by Al Qaeda members who hijacked four airliners killed nearly 3000 people surpassing Pearl Harbor as the deadliest attack on US soil.[12] Most of the dead were from the US but more than 300 were from 84 other countries. The death toll continues to rise among first responders and attack survivors.[13] On September 16 President George W. Bush declared a “crusade” a “war on terrorism” – a term he swiftly amended to a “War on Terror” – against Al Qaeda and all terrorist groups unleashing a series of events that lowered the bar for human rights protections around the world.[14]

On September 17 Bush issued a secret memo empowering the CIA to covertly capture and detain individuals ""posing a continuing serious threat of violence or death to US persons and interests or planning terrorist activities.”[15] A day later Bush signed into law the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed by Congress four days earlier. The AUMF granted the executive near-limitless and indefinite power to wage war against any “nations organizations or persons” linked to the attacks – a power that Bush as well as his successors Donald J. Trump and Barack Obama used as a blank check to wage a war without boundaries against groups such as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS).[16] Three weeks after enacting the AUMF the US led a coalition that invaded Afghanistan to rout out Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and his forces after the ruling Taliban refused to hand him over to the US.[17] On January 11 2002 the first 20 men to be imprisoned at Guantánamo were flown to the base aboard a US military plane. In March 2003 a US-led coalition invaded Iraq in what Bush justified in part as a mission to “end [Iraqi leader] Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism.”[18]

Renditions Detentions and Interrogations

The memo signed by Bush days after the 9/11 attacks led to the Rendition Detention and Interrogation RDI program under which the CIA and at the agency’s behest US allies covertly detained at least 119 Muslim terrorism suspects whom they had captured or abducted in Pakistan Afghanistan and other foreign countries.[19] Often aided by foreign security agents the CIA held or transferred the detainees to undisclosed prisons known as “black sites” that it operated in countries including Afghanistan Lithuania Romania Poland and Thailand in an apparent attempt to keep them outside the reach of US and international law. The CIA also secretly held prisoners inside US-run military prisons including Guantánamo. A number of black sites or prisons holding the detainees were run by other foreign security services including in Afghanistan Egypt Jordan and Morocco. The prisoners were held incommunicado in cruel inhuman or deeply degrading conditions for months or years.[20]

In addition the CIA subjected at least 39 of these men to torture and other ill-treatment that it euphemistically referred to as “enhanced interrogation techniques” according to the Senate Torture Report.[21] These included forcing the detained men to maintain painful stress positions for hours submerging their heads in water to the point of near suffocation (“waterboarding”) denying them sleep for days “walling” (slamming a detainee’s head into what was supposed to be a flexible wall) sensory deprivation sexual assault including “rectal feeding” (forcing pureed food into a detainee’s anus a procedure that has no nutritional or medical value) forced nudity and psychological abuse including threats of rape and other violence against them and their family members.[22] At least nine FBI agents were temporarily transferred to the CIA to participate in the interrogations according to information that became public in November 2021.[23]

The CIA also tortured opponents of then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi before sending them back to Libya where they were abused anew according to accounts by former detainees and documents from the CIA and United Kingdom’s Secret Intelligence Service (MI6).[24] They also kidnapped an Egyptian cleric and sent him to Cairo where he alleges he was repeatedly tortured and raped.[25]

At least 54 governments participated to varying degrees in the RDI program according to a comprehensive 2012 Open Society Foundations report. In addition to hosting CIA black sites forms of assistance included detaining interrogating or abusing the prisoners permitting the use of airspace and airports for CIA flights that secretly transferred the detainees across borders and sharing intelligence.[26]

The US military also held thousands of foreign Muslim security detainees and Iraqi prisoners-of-war at detention centers it controlled abroad. The CIA operated black sites or had access to some of the detainees in these prisons as well including at Guantánamo and in sections of Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan and Abu Ghraib in Iraq. Most of the prisoners were men but the CIA or US military also detained women and boys some of whom were reportedly among those sexually abused.[27]

From 2002 to 2005 the peak years of the US detention and torture program at least 17 people died wholly or partly from abuse while in the custody of the CIA or US military in Afghanistan or the CIA and US or British forces in Iraq.[28] Nine men died at Guantánamo seven from what the US military said were suicides and two from natural causes.[29] The military called three deaths on June 10 2006 a group suicide but others have alleged they were homicides.[30] Lawyers and family members of the others said they took their own lives in despair over indefinite confinement and abusive conditions.[31]

Many of those who survived remain physically or psychologically scarred. In a 2016 investigation The New York Times found that at least half of the 39 people known to have been subjected to CIA torture in the wake of 9/11 including many who are now free continued to suffer from conditions such as depression post-traumatic stress disorder paranoia or psychosis. Former detainees also described permanent headaches as well as nightmares and other sleep disturbances.[32]

Bush administration officials deliberately sought to circumvent domestic and international legal prohibitions on torture – actions that warrant criminal investigations.[33] In 2002 the CIA even sought advance promises from the Justice Department’s Criminal Division that it would not prosecute its planned “aggressive interrogation” of one detainee.[34] When the Criminal Division refused the request the CIA turned to another Justice Department division the Office of Legal Counsel which obligingly issued two memos advising that interrogation techniques only constituted torture under domestic or international law if they inflicted pain “equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure impairment of bodily function or even death.”[35]

By 2003 the late John Rizzo then CIA acting general counsel and a torture program architect was sufficiently confident of Office of Legal Counsel cover that he brushed aside concerns from a colleague that an undisclosed form of “pressure” during interrogation might violate the Geneva Conventions a series of treaties providing minimum standards for humane treatment of civilians prisoners of war and soldiers who are otherwise unable to fight. The US is among the 196 countries that have ratified the Geneva Conventions.[36] The Office of Legal Counsel “has demonstrated an ingenious ability to interpret over under and around” the Geneva Conventions the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment “and other pesky little international obligations” Rizzo wrote in a subsequently declassified memo.[37]

Abuses at Guantánamo

Around the world Guantánamo remains one of the most enduring symbols of the injustice abuse and disregard for the rule of law that the US unleashed in response to the 9/11 attacks. Since January 11 2002 the US has held at least 780 foreign Muslim males there 15 of them boys at the time of their capture. The US military continues to detain 39 men rounded up in the wake of 9/11 at Guantánamo.[38] As of January 2 2022 27 of them had never been charged.[39]

Most of the detainees were handed over to the US in the aftermath of 9/11 by Pakistan or the Northern Alliance a coalition of anti-Taliban militias in Afghanistan.[40] Bush’s Vice President Dick Cheney called the Guantánamo detainees “the worst of the worst.”[41] But according to Jane Mayer’s The Dark Side Maj. Gen. (ret.) Michael Dunlavey a former operational commander at Guantánamo estimated that at least half the prisoners were held by mistake.[42] A Seton Hall University Law School study concludes that at least 55 percent of the prisoners held at Guantánamo never engaged in any hostile acts against the US and only 8 percent had any association with Al Qaeda.[43] Many allege that they were taken into custody in return for bounties based on false evidence.[44]

The late Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld infamously labeled the first men and boys to be sent to Guantánamo “unlawful combatants” who “do not have any rights under the Geneva Convention.”[45] By holding these foreigners abroad the Bush administration hoped to avoid US jurisdiction and law prompting legal challenges that resulted in landmark if imperfect rebukes by the Supreme Court.[46]

Torture and other Inhumane Treatment

During the Bush presidency the US military subjected the prisoners to torture and other ill-treatment that included placing them in stress positions holding them in extended solitary confinement threatening them with torture and death siccing attack dogs on them depriving them of sleep and exposing them for prolonged periods to extreme heat cold and noise.[47]

Many of the men transferred to Guantánamo – including more than half of those who remain – had already spent extended periods in secret CIA black sites.[48] One black site which CIA agents nicknamed “Strawberry Fields” because detainees could conceivably remain there “forever” was actually at Guantánamo adjacent to the main prison compound.[49] (The CIA secretly placed four men it considered to be among its highest-value detainees including two 9/11 suspects in Strawberry Fields in 2003 after subjecting them to torture at other black sites. Six months later the agency secretly flew the four men back to farther-flung black sites hoping to evade a Supreme Court ruling that would give prisoners at Guantánamo access to lawyers. In 2006 after media exposed the black site network the men were again flown to Guantánamo and placed in the main prison compound where they remain.[50])

Failure to Close Guantánamo

Immediately after taking office Obama promised to close the prison at Guantánamo within one year but backed down following opposition from Congress and failed to pursue executive actions that could have bypassed congressional funding freezes on transferring prisoners to the US for prosecution in federal courts.[51]

Trump did not fulfill his campaign vow to “load up [Guantánamo] with some bad dudes.”[52] Nevertheless he promptly reversed his predecessor’s order to close the prison at Guantánamo failed to transfer any of the five men who had been cleared for release by the Obama administration and only cleared one additional detainee for release.[53]

Just weeks after taking office President Joseph R. Biden initiated a review of operations at Guantánamo with the aim of closing the prison before his term ends.[54] However as with his approach to lethal targeting his administration’s actions thus far raise the prospect that Biden will default to the status quo of flawed trials and indefinite detentions.

The day after Biden’s inauguration the Pentagon sought charges against three men held at Guantánamo whom it alleged were implicated in two sets of bombings in Indonesia – of Bali nightclubs in 2002 and a J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta in 2003 – suggesting prosecutions at Guantánamo would continue.[55] The Biden administration also cleared eight men for transfer bringing to 13 the number of detainees remaining at Guantánamo despite being approved to leave three of them more than a decade ago.[56] However as of January 2 2022 it had only transferred one man a Moroccan who had spent 19 years at Guantánamo without charge and had been cleared to leave in 2016.[57] At time of writing the Department of Defense was building a second courtroom for military commission trials at Guantánamo suggesting that the Biden administration has no plans to shut down operations there any time soon.[58]

Due Process Violations

The Guantánamo detainees have been denied due process rights and redress for abuses. More than six years passed before the US Supreme Court in Boumediene v. Bush (2008) affirmed that the constitutional right of detained people to challenge the lawfulness of their detention applied to the men at Guantánamo striking down amendments to the federal statute to eliminate habeas jurisdiction for any “enemy combatant” in US custody.[59] However the Supreme Court did not articulate a standard of review beyond directing lower courts to provide a “meaningful” opportunity for petitioners to challenge the basis for their detention.[60] Although lower US district courts granted many Guantánamo detainees habeas relief a federal appeals court reversed nearly all but one of those decisions that came before it and imposed a standard of review that made it virtually impossible for detainees to win their cases.[61] In a closely watched case the full federal appeals court heard oral arguments in September 2021 on the question of “meaningful” review.[62]

The 10 men at Guantánamo who have been criminally charged include the five alleged September 11 co-conspirators all of whom were tortured. They also include three men accused of links to the Bali and Jakarta bombings in 2002 and 2003.

The 27 men held without charge include Abu Zubaydah the first “ghost prisoner” who during four and a half years in CIA black sites before his transfer to Guantánamo was waterboarded 83 times held naked and in stress positions deprived of sleep confined in small coffin-like boxes deprived of solid food and physically assaulted.[63] The US has argued that releasing Zubaydah would constitute too great a risk to national security.[64] The two other men still held at Guantánamo are serving sentences after being convicted in flawed military commission system created for prisoners prosecuted there.[65]

Bush authorized the creation of the military commission system at Guantánamo in November 2001 to try “certain non-citizens in the war against terrorism.”[66] Despite subsequent reforms including by Congress the commissions remain fundamentally broken.[67] Among their many flagrant due process violations the commissions have deprived defense counsel of the means to prepare an effective defense prevented the accused from seeing all evidence introduced against them and failed to adequately guarantee that information obtained via torture or ill-treatment would not be used as evidence. They have been plagued by recurrent allegations of government interference including eavesdropping on confidential client-attorney conversations.[68] Such irregularities would be grounds for dismissal in a US federal court.

The pre-trial hearings at the military commission for the five men charged in connection with the 9/11 attacks have dragged on for 13 years plagued by due process violations and prosecution efforts to use evidence derived from torture.[69] Presiding military judges have come and gone and many were unqualified to oversee capital cases although the prosecution continues to seek the death penalty for all five men.[70] The three men accused of connections to the Indonesia attacks were arraigned before a military commission only in August 2021 18 years after they were apprehended in proceedings marred by translation problems as well as defense allegations that the accused were tortured.[71]

In 2013 a pre-trial hearing in the 9/11 case was disrupted when a red censorship light unexpectedly flashed and the audio feed to the courtroom’s gallery was abruptly cut without advance notice to – much less permission from – the judge.[72] The unilateral cut-off was later traced to the CIA. In 2020 defense counsel in the 9/11 case accused the CIA of using a monitoring device in the courtroom to direct the prosecution not exclusively to prevent spills of classified information. The defense lawyers only discovered the device accidentally as the judge had approved it without their knowledge in an ex parte session with the prosecution.[73]

In another example defense counsel inadvertently learned in 2016 that the judge in the 9/11 case had approved also in an ex parte session with the prosecution the destruction of a CIA black site where prisoners had been tortured as well as evidence inside it. The defense was under the impression that the judge had granted its request to block the site’s destruction.[74]

In 2020 the prosecution in the 9/11 case invoked national security privilege to block the defense from questioning James Mitchell the psychologist who designed the CIA’s so-called “enhanced interrogation techniques” with his partner Bruce Jessen about portions of a book he published on the RDI program even though the CIA had cleared that material for publication years earlier.[75]

In October 2021 the graphic testimony of detainee Majid Khan about his torture at the hands of the CIA in three black sites in the early 2000s was so harrowing that a jury of US military officials took the extraordinary move of writing a hand-written rebuke to the US government calling Khan’s treatment “a stain on the moral fiber of America.” The letter from seven of the eight jurors urged clemency for Khan even though he had pleaded guilty to terrorism-related charges including serving as an Al Qaeda courier.[76]

Although the Biden administration has sought to curb some of the prosecution abuses it has stopped short of robust reform. As of January 2 2022 prosecutors had not fully retracted a motion they made the previous March that led the judge in the USS Cole case to rule that under certain conditions a judge could consider statements obtained through torture in pretrial proceedings. (In September a Pentagon appeals panel overturned the judge’s ruling regarding the case in question but did not resolve the broader issue of whether prosecutors can use evidence obtained through torture. The defendant’s lawyers then filed a petition in a US federal appeals court asking it to bar prosecutors and the military commission from any consideration of use of torture-tainted evidence. That case was pending at time of writing.)[77] Also of deep concern the Biden administration in another legal challenge involving a prisoner held since 2004 without charge has reportedly evaded the question of whether the US Constitution’s guarantee of due process rights applies to foreign detainees at Guantánamo.[78]

In a case heard in October 2021 by the US Supreme Court the Justice Department under Biden has sought to bar Mitchell and Jessen from testifying about the CIA torture of detainee Zubaydah. The testimony would be used in an investigation by the Polish government into the complicity of its nationals in abuse at a CIA black site in Poland. US prosecutors have argued that the testimony would reveal “state secrets” even though as noted above both Mitchell and Jessen had previously testified about supervising “enhanced interrogation” Mitchell had written a book about it and details of Zubaydah’s torture have been widely reported in media.[79]

Medical Abuse

Beyond due process violations the men held at Guantánamo continue to be subjected to abuse including sporadic force-feeding during hunger strikes and medical neglect even as their health needs become increasingly complex as they age.[80] Many of the men who were tortured still suffer physically and psychologically. Yet their medical records lack details of their trauma histories contributing to misdiagnoses and incorrect treatments and the prison does not offer them torture rehabilitation services according to a 2019 report by Physicians for Human Rights and the Center for Victims of Torture. Furthermore the detention commander can override medical recommendations and in some cases prosecution interests have trumped medical interests “as with a detainee who was forced to attend court proceedings on a gurney writhing in pain while recovering from surgery” the report found. Many of the men do not have access to their own medical records and even when they do significant portions are often classified.[81]

Continuing Outcry over Detentions

Protests over the government’s failure to close the prison at Guantánamo continue both in and outside the government.

In February 2021 eight independent UN human rights experts and 111 nongovernmental organizations marked the 19th anniversary of the opening of the Guantánamo Bay prison by calling on Biden to close the detention center and end indefinite military detention there without delay.[82] “Guantánamo embodies the fact that for nearly two decades following the September 11 2001 attacks the US government has viewed communities of color – citizens and non-citizens alike – through a security threat lens to devastating consequences” the organizations wrote. “This is not a problem of the past. Guantánamo continues to cause escalating and profound damage to the men who still languish there and the approach it exemplifies continues to fuel and justify bigotry stereotyping and stigma. Guantánamo entrenches racial divisions and racism more broadly and risks facilitating additional rights violations.”[83]

In the past year nearly 100 members of both houses of Congress have urged Biden to close the prison. Guantánamo is “a symbol of lawlessness and human rights abuses” 24 senators wrote the president in April.[84] The prison’s continued operation is “a fundamental betrayal of our values” that “undermines our ability to advocate for human rights and the rule of law” 75 representatives wrote in August.[85] During a rare congressional hearing in December on Guantánamo eight Democratic senators a retired military commander and 9/11 victims’ relatives expressed frustration over the Biden administration’s stalled efforts. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) the panel’s chairman said he was dismayed that “this hearing is even necessary.” The Biden administration declined to even send a witness to testify.[86]

Abuses Beyond Guantánamo

US counterterrorism practices have changed dramatically since Bush left office but remain deeply problematic and in many cases unlawful. Although the CIA torture program ended with the Bush presidency the US has continued to engage to some degree since then in unlawful counterterrorism-related detentions interrogations or transfers to countries that torture. At the same time Washington has replaced capture with kill conducting air strikes often with armed drones that have killed thousands of civilians including outside recognized battlefields. The US counterterrorism campaign has spread to 85 countries with scant transparency or oversight.[87]

Lethal Targeting and Air Wars

One of the most dramatic developments since Bush left office is the ascent of lethal targeting of alleged terrorism suspects both in and outside of recognized war zones. The CIA and US military have carried out thousands of attacks against alleged members of Al Qaeda and so-called “associated forces” in countries including Pakistan Somalia and Yemen often with armed aerial drones and in some cases with special forces.

While the US insists that the overwhelming majority of its drone strikes and other lethal targeting operations are lawful and conducted with utmost care and precision it has failed to provide the transparency that would help impartial observers assess such claims. Independent estimates of civilian deaths from lethal counterterrorism strikes outside recognized war zones range from the high hundreds to the low 2000s.[88]

Bush began the lethal targeting program but it was Obama who embraced it carrying out 563 strikes during his two terms nearly 10 times the number as his predecessor.[89] “Turns out I’m really good at killing people” Obama reportedly told aides in a quiet voice when assessing his achievements and compromises in 2011.[90] Yet reports that many of these strikes appeared to have unlawfully killed civilians abounded during his presidency.[91] Trump further ramped up the lethal attacks while scaling back Obama’s already insufficient safeguards.[92] In promising first steps President Biden during his first 11 months in office dramatically curtailed drone strikes and apparent civilian casualties.[93] He has also initiated a review of US lethal targeting policy as part of a broader assessment of ways to mitigate civilian harm during counterterrorism operations.[94] However he does not appear to be contemplating an end to lethal targeting based on his vow to conduct “over-the-horizon” responses to perceived terrorist threats by relying primarily on drone strikes and occasional special forces operations in areas where the US is not fighting a conventional ground war.[95]

The targeted killing of terrorism suspects outside situations of armed conflict violates international human rights law unless the suspect poses an imminent threat to life and using lethal force is a last resort.[96] The laws of armed conflict in contrast permit deadly attacks on enemy combatants. But even then opposing parties to the conflict must take all feasible steps to minimize civilian harm.

Notwithstanding the use of precision bombs and drones the US-led military campaigns against ISIS in Iraq and Syria and the Taliban and an ISIS branch in Afghanistan also appear to have unlawfully killed far more civilians than the Pentagon has acknowledged and with insufficient accountability transparency or redress. A series of New York Times investigations has provided some of the most compelling evidence. In its most sweeping findings published in December 2021 and drawing from research including 1300 pages of Pentagon documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act litigation The New York Times alleged that since 2014 these air wars show a pattern of deeply flawed intelligence and rushed imprecise targeting resulting in the deaths of thousands of civilians many of them children.[97]

These findings bolstered a New York Times investigation from 2017 which found that one in five US-led coalition strikes against ISIS in Iraq during the Obama presidency resulted in civilian death. That rate is 31 times higher than that acknowledged by the coalition which said 89 of its more than 14000 airstrikes in Iraq resulted in civilian deaths or about one of every 157 strikes.[98]

Under Trump’s watch a covert US special force bombed dozens of women and children huddled in the open air then bombed fleeing survivors during the battle of Baghuz that toppled ISIS’s last holdout in Syria in 2019 a New York Times investigation revealed in November 2021. The coordinated strikes reportedly killed about 80 people making it one of the largest civilian casualty tolls of the war against ISIS. The US military stalled reviews of this apparent war crime and US-led coalition forces literally buried key evidence bulldozing the site.[99] Weeks after The New York Times report Biden’s defense secretary ordered a review of the strike and cover-up but by the military itself despite calls for an independent assessment.[100]

On August 29 2021 the penultimate day of the US pullout from Afghanistan the US military carried out a drone strike in Kabul that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff initially hailed as a “righteous” attack that appeared to have thwarted an imminent bombing by the Islamic State affiliate ISIS-Khorasan. But days later following yet another exposé by The New York Times the Pentagon acknowledged that the strike was a “tragic mistake” that instead killed 10 Afghan civilians including seven children and an employee of a US-based aid organization.[101] Compounding concern the US military’s review of the botched strike remains classified. A one-page fact sheet on its findings asserts there is no basis for criminal proceedings although it does not preclude the chain of command taking corrective measures and assessing accountability “as appropriate.”[102] In December the Pentagon announced that none of the US military personnel involved in the strike would face any form of punishment.[103]

Unlawful Detentions Transfers Harsh Interrogations

Obama upon taking office immediately issued an executive order to end US secret detention and torture.[104] But he did not revoke CIA powers to temporarily detain suspects and transfer them to other countries for interrogation or prosecution. Instead he pledged to ensure that their treatment was humane.[105] While no evidence has emerged since then that the US has reprised the horrific programs of the Bush presidency deeply disturbing cases or allegations of abusive practices under Obama and Trump continue to surface as well as one that carried into the Biden presidency.

Afghanistan

Many of the detention-related violations that continued after the Bush presidency took place in Afghanistan. In 2011 more than two years after Obama declared an end to torture and secret detention his administration confirmed that terrorism suspects in Afghanistan were being secretly detained and interrogated for up to nine weeks without access to a court or counsel at several “temporary” detention centers run by the US military’s elite Joint Special Operations Command including one at Bagram air base. Former detainees alleged they were forced to strip upon arrival and held in solitary confinement in windowless often excessively cold rooms with 24-hour lighting and were denied contact with lawyers and family members.[106]

BuzzFeed News revealed in 2016 that for at least 16 months in 2009 and 2010 the US military subjected at least 58 detainees to “separation” a procedure under which prisoners were held incommunicado from anyone except personnel such as US guards interrogators and medics for up to 30 days at a time. The practice could amount to inhumane treatment in and of itself. At least 23 times US personnel combined “separation” with other problematic tactics to induce detainees to talk according to US military documents obtained by BuzzFeed News. The US military blacked out the information it provided BuzzFeed News on the additional tactics it used. According to its official intelligence-gathering manual[107] interrogators may couple “separation” with techniques such as sleep restrictions and “Fear Up” – preying on detainees’ existing fears.[108]

Under Obama US forces also handed over prisoners they captured to Afghan detention centers where the detainees were systematically tortured. Among other methods captors subjected detainees to electric shocks hung them by their wrists beat them with cables or sticks removed their toenails twisted and wrenched their genitals and threatened them with sexual abuse.[109] Moreover the CIA also continued to recruit equip train and deploy Afghan paramilitary forces who summarily executed civilians during night raids forcibly disappeared detainees and attacked healthcare facilities for allegedly treating insurgent fighters among other grave crimes with no accountability – a practice that continued during the Trump presidency.[110]

Africa

The Obama administration engaged in unlawful practices elsewhere including in Africa. In 2009 and 2010 Nigerian officials held an Ethiopian Al Qaeda suspect for four months during which time he was interrogated first by a US “dirty” team that ignored his Miranda rights then by a “clean” team of US agents.[111] According to a diplomatic cable US officials pressured Nigerian authorities to detain Ahmed.[112] The US then brought the suspect Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed to New York where he pled guilty to terrorism-related charges in a federal court.[113]

In 2011 two Swedes and a U.K. citizen with ties to Somalia were arrested by Eritrean authorities in Djibouti where US interrogators were among those who questioned them for two months without charge. The men were then secretly indicted in absentia by a US federal grand jury and flown by the FBI to New York where they were convicted in 2016 of terrorism-related charges.[114]

In 2014 The Nation reported that CIA agents also regularly interrogated Al Shabab suspects in a basement prison in Somalia and kept Somali intelligence agents there on the agency payroll. The detainees included men illegally handed over to Somalia from neighboring Kenya including in at least one case based on intelligence provided by the US the report said. Former detainees told The Nation the prisoners were held in filthy insect-infested windowless cells that they were never allowed outdoors and that some prisoners had been held without charge or trial for months or years.[115]

In separate operations in 2011 2013 and 2014 US forces also apprehended three foreign men – one in international waters off Somalia and two in Libya – and secretly detained them for extended periods aboard military ships interrogating them for intelligence purposes before separate US law enforcement teams read them their Miranda rights and re-interrogated them for prosecution on terrorism-related charges. This two-tiered approach circumvented longstanding US criminal and military procedural protections against government abuse incommunicado detention and torture.[116] In the first case a team of Federal Bureau of Investigation CIA and Defense Department personnel seized secretly detained and interrogated a Somali Al Qaeda suspect for more than two months aboard a US Navy ship for intelligence purposes.[117]

Notably the US has extended this flawed dual-interrogation strategy to its “war on drugs” detaining people it apprehends at sea on suspicion of drug smuggling for weeks or even months aboard ships dubbed “floating Guantánamos” before they are arraigned in domestic courts.[118] In 2017 for example the US Coast Guard kidnapped and forcibly disappeared four Jamaican fisherman and kept them chained to the decks of four of its ships incommunicado for over a month.[119]

As recently as July 2021 a British citizen who had been held without charge since 2019 in Somalia claimed that his Somali captors had subjected him to hooding sensory deprivation and waterboarding and that he was questioned between torture sessions by two people with American accents who refused to disclose their identities. The man said he believed his torturers wanted him to cooperate with the CIA. He also said he was questioned by the FBI as recently as June 2021.[120]

Iraq

The Trump administration also carried out unlawful renditions from northeast Syria to authorities in neighboring Iraq despite the Iraqi government’s well-documented record of torture and due process violations of terrorism suspects.[121] In 2017 and 2018 the US forcibly transferred at least 30 foreign ISIS suspects to Iraq. Two of the men alleged that after their transfer Iraq’s Counter Terrorism Service beat them held them in stress positions and applied electric shocks to their genitals.[122]

The US military in 2017 and 2018 unlawfully held a US citizen in Iraq without charge for more than a year on suspicion of membership in ISIS. For the first four months the man known only as “John Doe” was held in secret with no access to an attorney. After multiple court interventions by the American Civil Liberties Union including one to stop the US from sending the man to Syria where his life was at risk a federal court ordered the man’s voluntary release to an undisclosed third country.[123]

In 2020 the Trump administration threatened to transfer two notorious British ISIS suspects to authorities in Iraq if the U.K. government did not promptly agree to let them be prosecuted in the US.[124] The two men part of an ISIS quartet of U.K. nationals implicated in summary executions known as “The Beatles” were being held by the US military in Syria and Iraq. Britain’s highest court two months later authorized the two suspects’ transfer to the US for prosecution in return for diplomatic assurances that the US would forgo the death penalty.[125] One of the defendants pled guilty in September 2021 to helping torture and kill hostages and faces life without parole.[126]

Violations of International and Domestic Law

Despite Bush administration protestations to the contrary the US program of extraordinary renditions secret detentions and torture following 9/11 brazenly flouted international and US law. The detentions without charge and other abuses at Guantánamo as well as many counterterrorism operations in other countries also violate these laws and several appear to be war crimes.

International Legal Standards

The US is party to several international treaties that prohibit under all circumstances torture and other cruel inhuman and degrading treatment. They include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which prohibits any limitations on the rights to life and protection against torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment under any circumstances even during states of emergency.[127] The ICCPR also prohibits arbitrary and indefinite detention without charge in violation of due process.[128] Prolonged incommunicado detention such as that at Guantánamo Abu Ghraib and other US-controlled detention centers amounts to torture or other cruel inhuman and degrading treatment.[129]

The Convention against Torture to which the US is also party sets forth that “no exceptional circumstances whatsoever” including war or the threat of war may be invoked as a justification for torture.[130] The convention also prohibits transferring anyone to another country where there are substantial grounds to believe they face the risk of torture.[131] It provides that any statement made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings.[132]

Moreover the convention obligates countries that are parties to either submit cases of torture for prosecution or extradite torture suspects. It also grants countries universal jurisdiction allowing domestic judicial authorities to prosecute torture suspects even if they are not their citizens or are not accused of committing torture on their territory.[133] This provision alone should have compelled successive US administrations to open meaningful criminal investigations at the highest levels into the US military and CIA use of torture and ill-treatment of detainees around the world.

International humanitarian law or the laws of war provide for the detention of prisoners-of-war and civilians who pose an imperative security risk. In addition during non-international armed conflicts such as the civil war in Afghanistan or other fighting between states and non-state armed groups individuals who take up arms or are otherwise involved in rebel activity may be detained and prosecuted in accordance with domestic laws. However the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 to which the US is party entitle anyone detained during armed conflict to basic protections including against torture and other ill-treatment.[134] Common Article 3 to all four conventions explicitly extends protections against murder mutilation torture cruel humiliating and degrading treatment and fair trial violations to members of non-state groups.[135] The treatment of those the US apprehended in connection to the armed conflict in Afghanistan violated the provisions on humane treatment under Common Article 3 and customary international humanitarian law. The treatment of those the US apprehended in Iraq also violated the Third Geneva Convention which states that prisoners of war must be humanely treated at all times.[136]

But the Bush administration fought Geneva Convention protections for foreign detainees all the way up to the US Supreme Court. More than four years passed before the Supreme Court affirmed in 2006 in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that Common Article 3 applies to the US conflict with Al Qaeda. The court also found that the structure of the military commissions created to try detainees at Guantánamo violated both the fair trial standards of Common Article 3 and the domestic Uniform Code of Military Justice and was unconstitutional.[137]

The US is seeking the death penalty for the five men charged in connection to the 9/11 attacks. International human rights law prohibits capital punishment following convictions in flawed proceedings.[138]

The US military and CIA counterterrorism strikes during situations of armed conflict have in many cases violated the laws of war. These laws permit attacks on enemy combatants such as members of armed groups and other military objectives but strictly prohibit attacks on civilians and civilian structures. Not all attacks that cause civilian deaths or injuries violate the laws of war – only those that target civilians do not discriminate between civilians and combatants or cause expected civilian loss excessive to the anticipated military gain. Parties to a conflict must take all feasible steps to minimize civilian harm.[139] Governments have an obligation to investigate both serious violations and grave breaches of the laws of war and prosecute those responsible.[140]

Outside situations of armed conflict governments have even greater obligations to protect human life. International human rights law allows law enforcement to use lethal force only as a last resort such as when there is an imminent risk to human life and capture is not feasible.[141]

Domestic Law

The rights and protections in such international treaties are also enshrined in the US Constitution and domestic law. The Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution prohibit cruel and unusual punishments and due process violations. The Federal Anti-Torture Statute of 1994 enacted to comply with the Convention against Torture extends US federal jurisdiction over acts of torture committed abroad when the alleged offender is a US national or is found within the US irrespective of the nationality of the victim or the alleged offender.[142] The War Crimes Act of 1996 criminalizes grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions if either the victim or the perpetrator is a US national or a member of the US armed forces. Convicted war criminals can be punished with life imprisonment or death.

The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 bars the use of cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment against any person in US custody.[143] An amendment to the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (known as the McCain-Feinstein Amendment) aims to protect against US torture and other ill-treatment of detainees by restricting interrogation techniques to those contained in the US Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations the government’s important albeit inadequate guidelines for the US military and CIA on lawful interrogation techniques.[144] The amendment also requires timely access by the International Committee of the Red Cross to detainees in US custody.[145]

Scant Accountability for Torture

The US government has failed to hold accountable the key architects of post-9/11 unlawful renditions detentions and torture despite clear and compelling evidence that warrants criminal investigations of former Bush and top members of his administration among others.[146] Although some efforts abroad are notable they remain insufficient.

Bare-Bones US Investigations

The Obama administration only investigated the CIA for torture and other abuse probing more than 100 cases but ultimately declining to bring any charges.[147] The administration limited its investigations to instances in which interrogators exceeded legal authorizations disregarding that the authorizations themselves were unlawful.[148]

For example the Obama Justice Department declined to bring charges against any CIA officials for deliberately destroying 92 videotapes in 2005 that contained direct evidence of torture.[149] It also declined to prosecute anyone for the deaths of two men in CIA custody after brutal interrogations in 2002 and 2003.[150] One of those men Gul Rahman froze to death in November 2002 in a CIA black site dubbed “The Salt Pit” near Bagram in Afghanistan. Rahman died after his captors left him shackled to a cement wall in near-freezing temperatures naked from the waist down. In the preceding days CIA interrogators had kept him awake for 48 hours blasted him with noise immersed him in complete darkness and isolation and doused him with cold water among other abuses.[151] In fact rather than prosecuting those officers responsible for Rahman’s death four months later the CIA bestowed a “cash award” of $2500 to the officer who had ordered his shackling for his “consistently superior work.”[152] The CIA promoted or gave bonuses to several other staff members who participated in the torture program.[153]

The other case involved Manadel al-Jamadi who died in 2003 at Abu Ghraib. US military and CIA interrogators subjected al-Jamadi to “blunt force trauma” that broke five of his ribs then suspended him from a barred window by his wrists naked from the waist down with a sandbag on his head where after a half-hour he slumped over and stopped responding. Upon realizing al-Jamadi was dead his captors packed his corpse in ice wrapped it in plastic stuck an intravenous drip into his arm and pretended he was on life support as they wheeled him out.[154] US Army reservists posed for photographs with his ice-packed corpse smiling with thumbs up.[155] In both the Rahman and al-Jamadi cases the Justice Department claimed astonishingly that “the admissible evidence would not be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.”[156]

Only small numbers of lower-level participants in US military abuse have faced justice. Of the 27 soldiers and officers against whom US Army investigators had recommended criminal charges for the torture and in two cases deaths of Bagram detainees only 15 were prosecuted in 2004 and 2005. Of these only six were convicted – five in guilty pleas and one at trial. The most severe punishment was five months in a military prison.[157]

Following the release in 2004 by the “60 Minutes” television program of some of the hundreds of photos documenting the rampant abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib 11 US soldiers were prosecuted and convicted in military trials including two who posed with al-Jamadi’s corpse.[158] But the higher-ranked officers who knew of the abuses and the private military contractors who also participated evaded justice.[159]

In 2017 the psychologists Jessen and Mitchell settled a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union paying an undisclosed sum to two torture victims and the family of Rahman.[160]

Rather than investigating and prosecuting government officials who participated in or advocated torture Trump promoted some of them. Those he promoted include Gina Haspel his second CIA director who reportedly oversaw torture at the CIA’s first black site in Thailand and played a key role in destroying the videotaped evidence of torture.[161] Michael Pompeo Trump’s second Secretary of State and first CIA director as a member of Congress defended the torture program as “within the law.”[162] During his confirmation hearings for CIA director Pompeo acknowledged that “enhanced interrogation techniques” were illegal under the 2015 McCain-Feinstein Amendment but not that they also violated US and international law at the time the Bush administration authorized them and the CIA used them.[163] Trump in 2018 nominated Marshall Billingslea to oversee the State Department’s human rights work although as a Bush administration official he had advocated harsher interrogation methods for men detained at Guantánamo.[164] After the Senate deadlocked over Billingslea’s nomination at least in part because of his record on torture Trump appointed him to a position not requiring Senate approval.[165]

Nine years after the release of the heavily redacted summary of the 6700-page Torture Report – less than one-tenth of the total text – Biden has shown no more inclination than his two predecessors to release the full contents.[166] His administration has also deflected questions on CIA abuse from the UN Committee Against Torture the body that monitors countries’ compliance with the Convention Against Torture. “[F]or reasons of privacy the United States is not in a position to disclose the information sought with regard to Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) detained persons rendered to other countries” reads a US submission to the committee from September 2021.[167]

Keeping the report classified prevents the public from fully understanding the torture program shields the identities of the torturers impedes the ability of torture victims to access medical records relating to their abuse and further prolongs arguments over national security classifications during pre-trial hearings at Guantánamo.

Insufficient Accountability Abroad

Several other countries have provided compensation to former detainees held by the CIA or the US military in cases where their own authorities also committed wrongdoing or have prosecuted some of those implicated in these abuses. Though foreign countries have done more than the US their responses – most court-ordered – have also in many cases been insufficient.[168]

Significantly the European Court of Human Rights has found that five European countries – Macedonia Poland Italy Romania and Lithuania – violated provisions in the European Convention on Human Rights by collaborating with the CIA’s RDI program. The violations included the prohibition on torture and ill-treatment and the right to liberty and security. The court ordered the countries to pay damages to their 20 known victims.[169]

The U.K. has paid more than $28.8 million USD to Iraqi victims to settle complaints linked to numerous well-documented war crimes and other abuses that it committed as a partner in the US-led invasion of Iraq.[170] However the U.K. has only prosecuted its military forces for one of these crimes the beating to death of Basra hotel receptionist Basa Mousa in British custody.[171] The U.K. government shelved an independent inquiry into its forces’ involvement in post-9/11 extraordinary renditions and torture.[172] It also shut down the principal investigation team into alleged crimes by U.K. forces in Iraq before it had completed its work following pressure from some media and members of parliament.[173]

In 2017 Canada apologized and paid $10.5 million CA ($8.1 million USD) in damages to Omar Khadr a former child solder who was 15 when US forces captured him in 2002 during a firefight in Afghanistan.[174] Khadr who was severely wounded was held for three months at Bagram and for a decade at Guantánamo during which time he alleges that he was brutally tortured.[175] In 2010 Canada’s Supreme Court found that Khadr’s rights were violated when Canadian intelligence officials interrogated him at Guantánamo.[176]

In 2009 and 2012 Italy convicted a total of 25 alleged CIA agents and one US Air Force colonel for the kidnapping in Milan of an Egyptian cleric known as Abu Omar who was then handed over to Egypt via Germany and allegedly tortured for four years while held without trial.[177] Because the convictions were in absentia none of the Americans convicted served prison time.[178]

International Criminal Court

Both the Trump and Biden administrations have sought to thwart any accountability for international crimes by US forces before the International Criminal Court (ICC). In 2020 Trump imposed unprecedented sanctions on ICC staff including the prosecutor at the time after the court’s judges authorized an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in connection with the conflict in Afghanistan that could have included abuses by US nationals.[179] In April the Biden administration lifted the US sanctions against the court’s members but made clear it continued to oppose the court’s jurisdiction over US nationals and personnel in Afghanistan.[180] In a move castigated by critics as capitulation to political pressure from Washington the new ICC prosecutor Karim Khan announced in September that he had sought permission from one of the court’s pre-trial chambers to proceed with the investigation but that he intended to focus only on grave crimes allegedly committed by the Taliban and ISIS-K and “deprioritize” those allegedly committed by the US military CIA and forces of the former Afghan government.[181] Khan’s action risks not only perpetuating impunity for apparent US war crimes but also undermining the already fragile legitimacy of the ICC the world’s only permanent court entrusted with prosecuting the most serious international crimes including war crimes and crimes against humanity.

As a court of last resort the ICC can only intervene in cases where a state is unable or unwilling to carry out investigations and prosecutions. Only if the US were to change course and genuinely seek criminal accountability for the grave abuses committed by the US military CIA and contractors in relation to the Afghanistan conflict would it be in a position to legitimately challenge the ICC jurisdiction in those cases.[182]

Costs at Home and Abroad

The corrosive repercussions of the Bush-era detention and interrogation abuses continue to this day both at home and abroad. They have cost US taxpayers trillions of dollars and militarized police responses at home. They have robbed victims of 9/11 and other extremist armed attacks of justice and shattered the lives of foreign men who were brutally detained for years without charge. They have given cover to foreign governments to carry out their own unlawful detention and torture with impunity and to dismiss US human rights diplomacy as hypocrisy. They have shaken the foundations of the international human rights system jeopardized the safety of US citizens abroad and handed a propaganda tool to armed groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS.

Domestic Costs

The “War on Terror” has cost US taxpayers trillions of dollars and the detention component has easily run into the billions. Because much information on US unlawful detention and interrogation is classified the true cost of those practices to taxpayers remains elusive. Nevertheless a few studies underscore the enormous sums involved.

US taxpayers are spending $540 million a year just to detain prisoners at Guantánamo which comes to nearly $13 million annually per prisoner according to a 2019 investigation by The New York Times.[183] This estimate includes the cost of nearly 2000 guards health care for aging detainees whose medical needs are complicated by the abuse they suffered in CIA black sites or in Guantánamo itself and the military commissions. The true costs could be far higher as the estimate does not include classified expenses such as the CIA presence at the base.

By 2018 the “War on Terror” had cost US taxpayers nearly $3 trillion according to a study by the Stimson Center think tank.[184] Brown University’s Costs of War project the publisher of this paper in September 2021 estimated the figure to be more than $5.84 trillion or $8 trillion counting estimated future care for veterans through 2050.[185] The studies do not include breakdowns for detentions abroad.

While outside the scope of this paper the fallout on the domestic criminal justice system has also been extensive. Across the US the September 11 attacks ushered in warrantless surveillance allowing the government to obtain citizens’ most sensitive data without any suspicion of wrongdoing.[186] They spurred further militarized approaches to policing and religious racial and ethnic profiling in predominantly Muslim Black and brown communities.[187] They also ushered in abusive investigations prosecutions and detention conditions for Muslim American terrorism suspects.

A 2014 report by Human Rights Watch found a pattern of sting operations against Muslim Americans that facilitated or invented targets’ willingness to act imposed unnecessarily restrictive detention conditions – including prolonged solitary confinement and curtailed pretrial communications that possibly impeded suspects’ ability to assist in their own defense – and resulted in excessive prison sentences. These practices “have alienated the very communities the government relies on most to report possible terrorist threats and diverted resources from other more effective ways of responding to the threat of terrorism” Human Rights Watch said.[188]

No Justice for September 11 Victims and Families

The US government’s reliance on deeply flawed military commissions along with other due process failures has not only violated the rights of the men held at Guantánamo. It also has deprived survivors of the 9/11 attacks and families of the dead of their right to justice. While the 9/11 case remains mired in pretrial hearings with the latest judge saying the actual trial will not commence until at least late 2022 US federal courts have prosecuted hundreds of defendants on terrorism-related charges including in complex and high-profile cases such as the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993.[189] To be sure terrorism-related prosecutions in US federal court have their share of flaws.[190] But had the September 11 defendants been prosecuted in federal court from the start their trials almost certainly would have concluded years ago.

Survivors and family members of 9/11 victims struggle even to have their day in court in pretrial proceedings. Seats are limited at the small courthouse at Guantánamo so survivors and relatives of the dead must enter a lottery to attend a hearing in person. Their only other option is to watch the proceedings through closed circuit television channels at a small number of US military bases or at the Pentagon. While some relatives of 9/11 victims laud the military commissions others have expressed frustration at the delays and others still including some members of the group 9/11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows have said that the problematic proceedings contribute to their anguish.[191]

“What has slowly been revealed – year after year – is the lack of care and foresight invested in getting this right” the group’s co-founder Colleen Kelly whose brother was killed on 9/11 told us. “There’s an emotional and psychological cost to the lack of accountability and the use of a military commission system that has lost all legitimacy.… But the biggest cost I suspect is occurring in ways we are not yet aware of – what happens to a nation's collective conscience and moral compass when those responsible for horrific wrongdoing are never held accountable? This slow erosion of justice is eating away at our soul and my heart.”[192]

Elizabeth Miller whose father was killed on 9/11 said the torture of defendants left her doubtful that justice can ever be served. “Losing my father was a traumatic experience” she said “but the actions that the US has taken following 9/11 that’s the wound that will never heal.”[193]

Leila Murphy whose father was killed on 9/11 said she became upset attending pre-trial hearings at Guantánamo because the prosecution team repeatedly told her and the other family members in attendance that they were fighting for her rights as a victim yet did not consult her on their strategy – including their pursuit of the death penalty which she opposes on principle. “Being there as a victim really hits home that nobody is actually advancing your interests” she said. Instead she said she felt her name was “used” to “justify acts that you have no relationship with or control over and don’t want to happen.”[194]

The use of military commissions and other due process failures have stalled accountability for other mass-casualty attacks as well. For example nearly a decade has passed since the arraignment of a man held at Guantánamo who is accused in the bombing of the USS Cole that killed 17 US sailors off the coast of Yemen in 2000.[195]

Under pressure from families of 9/11 victims and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers Biden in September ordered the FBI and other relevant government agencies to release within six months long-classified documents relating to the attacks.[196] The families and members of Congress have said they believe the documents will detail connections between the government of Saudi Arabia and the 19 alleged hijackers 15 of whom were Saudi.[197] The first released document from 2016 shows a closer relationship than had been previously disclosed between the hijackers and two Saudis including one with diplomatic status but does not directly link those attackers to the Saudi government.[198] Biden’s move while welcome is only one modest step toward closing the post-9/11 accountability and transparency gaps.

Costs to US Influence and the International Human Rights System

The US unlawful renditions detentions and interrogations since 9/11 and its failure to end impunity for these crimes undermine the very human rights principles that Washington historically championed and that Obama and Biden pledged to re-embrace. These practices also threaten the international treaties and monitoring bodies that the US was deeply involved in creating in the aftermath of World War II with the aim of upholding rights for everyone. By flouting the Geneva Convention prohibitions on inhumane treatment of prisoners and unlawfully attacking civilians expanding the so-called War on Terror to groups that did not exist at the time of 9/11 and to areas far from any recognized battlefield circumventing minimum due process standards enshrined in the ICCPR equivocating on consideration of torture-tainted evidence despite the Convention Against Torture’s clear prohibition on its use in proceedings failing to respond to questions from the Committee Against Torture on CIA abuse and bullying the International Criminal Court rather than genuinely investigating grave abuses abroad by its own military and intelligence agents the US has made it easier for other countries to deflect international condemnation of their own serious human rights violations.

Of course many countries practiced abhorrent detention and brutal interrogation and flouted international legal standards and institutions long before 9/11. But by institutionalizing these practices over three successive presidencies the US has signaled to the rest of the world and to its own security and intelligence services that the universal rights it purports to champion are dispensable when countering Islamist armed groups.

Not surprisingly this has undercut the US government’s credibility when it calls out other countries for carrying out their own abuses.

“The devil preaches!” wrote the editor-in-chief of state-owned Al-Ahram Egypt’s largest daily in a 2010 editorial excoriating the Obama administration for urging greater freedoms in the Arab world while failing to close Guantánamo.[199] Fast-forward to the Biden presidency and Al-Ahram was still promoting that narrative. “At a time when the US directed accusations against Egypt” a pro-government member of parliament wrote in an Al-Ahram column “it ignores the countless violations in Iraq Afghanistan Abu Ghraib prison Guantanamo Bay and others!”[200]

In June 2021 following a meeting with Biden Russian President Vladimir Putin deflected a media question about Russia’s human rights record by raising the continuing US operation of the prison at Guantánamo.[201]

Cuba has also jumped on abuse at Guantánamo to deflect US criticism of Cuban rights abuses including its persecution of political prisoners. “There is one place in Cuba where torture occurs” read the headline of a column in the official Communist Party mouthpiece Granma following the graphic testimony of Guantánamo detainee Majid Khan in October on his torture in CIA black sites years earlier. “The country that threatens Cuba… has no moral authority to demand anything from anyone. Do as I say and not as I do – a saying that seems fit the empire’s actions perfectly.”[202]

China has long used the so-called War on Terror and the detention of 22 Muslim Uyghurs from Xinjiang province at Guantánamo to justify its mass surveillance internment and indoctrination program against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims which Human Rights Watch has found to be crimes against humanity.[203] In 2019 Shohrat Zakir the official overseeing camps unlawfully detaining as many as 1 million Uyghurs in Xinjiang similarly criticized US legislation calling for the camps’ closure as hypocritical in light of US counterterrorism measures and detentions at Guantánamo.[204]

Post-9/11 Abuses by US Security Allies

Many of the countries that carry out enforced disappearances unlawful indefinite detentions torture and fundamentally flawed trials in the name of national security are close US counterterrorism allies. While in some cases the US has sought to curb these abuses often to little avail in others it has shown a willingness to overlook them.

Mass Detentions and Flawed Trials

In northeast Syria the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces which partnered with the US-led International Coalition Against ISIS to rout ISIS from its so-called caliphate has for more than 2.5 years held about 45000 foreign ISIS suspects and family members in deeply degrading life-threatening and in many cases inhumane conditions with no access to courts to challenge the legality and necessity of their detention. Most of the foreigners are Iraqi while nearly 14000 others are men women and children from nearly 60 countries as far flung as Australia Canada France Egypt Morocco South Africa Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia and the U.K. Of the non-Iraqi foreigners nearly 12000 are women and children held in locked camps while the rest are men and boys held in severely overcrowded prisons.[205] Only a few countries including Russia Kazakhstan Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have brought home significant numbers of detainees.[206] While there are no allegations that the detaining forces are conducting abuses of the kind that blighted the Bush presidency the inaction of countries whose nationals are held in northeast Syria risks creating a Guantánamo 2.0 with an exponentially larger number of detainees most of them children. Allies have for the most part ignored repeated calls by Washington for them to repatriate their nationals. Few have taken up the US military’s offers to help them do so.[207]

In Iraq more than 50000 people were detained as of September 2021 for links to ISIS or other terrorism-related charges and half were sentenced to death according to the country’s Ministry of Justice.[208] At least 20000 were detained since 2013.[209] The prisoners reportedly include more than 700 foreigners.[210] Many defendants were reportedly detained because their names appeared on inaccurate wanted lists or because they were family members of listed suspects.[211] The detainees include more than 900 children.[212] At least 280 of those convicted of terrorism had been executed as of January 2021.[213]

Many defendants have been convicted of membership in or support for ISIS rather than for specific crimes.[214] Not one has been convicted of grave international crimes for example for the mass conversions sexual enslavement and killings of Yezidis which amount to war crimes and may be crimes against humanity or part of a genocide.[215]

Defendants are often held incommunicado in inhuman conditions.[216] Defense lawyers’ access to their clients’ case files is severely restricted.[217] Convictions are largely based on secret testimony or confessions.[218] The courts can convict children as young as nine years old.[219]

Judges have routinely handed out life sentences or even the death penalty to lower-level foot soldiers or cooks mechanics and cleaners.[220] They have been observed issuing such sentences without first considering defendants’ testimony that their confessions were extracted through torture or that their affiliation with ISIS was involuntary or even their only way to survive in areas the group controlled.[221] Iraq has not prosecuted widely reported war crimes by Iraq armed forces and allied militia.[222]

Nigeria has held at least 6500 Boko Haram suspects in military prisons some for up to nine years without charge.[223] The security forces also detained more than 3600 children for months or years for alleged Boko Haram ties. The children were held incommunicado and often without charge in severely overcrowded and squalid detention centers and have alleged that they were beaten and lacked enough food. Half of the children reportedly were released in 2019 and 2020.[224]

After years of inaction the Nigerian authorities prosecuted more than 1660 alleged Boko Haram members in three mass trials in 2017 and 2018 resulting in approximately 360 convictions. Most of the other cases were dismissed for lack of evidence and scores were adjourned. Sentences ranged from 3 to 60 years in prison.[225] The government has repeatedly postponed further prosecutions.

Federal High Court judges conducted the mass trials but in makeshift courts on a remote military base making them inaccessible to victims and family members. Defendants described being held incommunicado in overcrowded military barracks for months or years without charge. They said torture was widespread and that some prisoners were dying of hunger thirst and inadequate medical care.[226]

Most of those convicted were lower-level suspects found guilty of membership or providing non-violent support to Boko Haram for acts such as repairing vehicles washing clothes supplying food or failing to provide the government with information about the group despite the risks of reprisal.[227]

The courts lacked official interpreters and many defendants did not see a lawyer until the day of the trial.[228] Convictions were based solely on coerced confessions.[229] Proceedings lasted mere minutes.[230] Most charges lacked specific details and judges at times failed to consider whether the accused had joined or supported Boko Haram involuntarily.[231] The courts ordered most of the defendants whose cases were dismissed to nevertheless undergo “rehabilitation” despite the lack of evidence against them.[232] Only 10 members of the Nigerian military reportedly have been prosecuted for serious counterterrorism-related offenses.[233]

Nigerian soldiers and security agents have carried out rape and other acts of sexual violence against women and children detained for links to Boko Haram including many who were abducted by the group with no accountability. Soldiers reportedly have demanded sex from the women in exchange for food soap and other necessities and the promise of freedom.[234]

In Somalia intelligence agencies have held children incommunicado beaten or threatened them forced them to sign confessions and denied them lawyers during trial if they suspect them of links to Al Shabab even when the group abducted the children and forced them to fight.[235]

Egypt’s systematic counterterrorism abuses include mass detention and torture of civil society members in squalid prisons in the name of countering the Muslim Brotherhood a group Egypt brands as terrorist; apparent extrajudicial executions disguised as shootouts with Muslim Brotherhood “terrorists”; war crimes against inhabitants of North Sinai home to an ISIS affiliate; and executions of defendants following flawed mass terrorism trials.[236]

The Egyptian government’s dismissal of basic rights extended to its abuse of a visiting American man whom its security forces arrested in 2013 apparently by mistake in a crackdown on an anti-government sit-in. Despite repeated appeals from Washington to release the man Egypt held him for more than five years without trial. A year after his conviction on bogus charges in a flawed mass trial the man died in an Egyptian prison in 2020 after going on hunger strike.[237]

Abuses of Former Guantánamo Detainees

Despite diplomatic assurances between Washington and receiving governments for humane treatment many foreign authorities have abused the men whom the US transferred to third countries or their countries of nationality after detaining them for years without charge at Guantánamo.[238]

At least 19 men – one Russian and 18 Yemenis – whom the US ostensibly transferred for “rehabilitation” to the United Arab Emirates between 2015 and 2017 have told family members that the Emiratis detained them without charge in undisclosed locations. The Yemeni men even said they preferred returning to Guantánamo to remaining in the UAE.[239] In 2021 the UAE transferred the 18 Yemenis to their war-torn homeland apparently against their will.[240] One of the men reportedly was so severely traumatized he did not recognize family members and once home fled only to be kidnapped by the Houthis an armed group fighting UAE-backed forces in Yemen.[241] The remaining man held by the UAE a Muslim Tartar and former soldier and ballet dancer who fled Russia for fear of persecution reportedly faces forcible repatriation to Russia despite grave risks of abuse there.[242]

In 2021 several UN independent human rights experts called on the UAE to not forcibly repatriate the Russian and Yemeni detainees noting that that they face “a risk of torture and ill-treatment” in their countries of origin.[243]

Men repatriated from Guantánamo have also been treated harshly by authorities in their countries of nationality. Mohamedou Ould Slahi of Mauritania for example was repatriated from Guantánamo in 2016 after the US held him for more than 14 years without charge. Under reported pressure from the US Mauritania for three years refused to provide Slahi with a passport he had sought to travel abroad for medical treatment.[244] Slahi suffered from back pain resulting from an operation at Guantánamo.[245]

Few Consequences for Allies’ Abuses

Successive US presidents since 9/11 have further lowered the bar for other countries by making tepid attempts at best to impose consequences for counterterrorism allies’ abuses. The US continues to provide well over $1 billion annually in aid to Egypt nearly all of it security assistance and senior officials have largely refrained from robust condemnations of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi although he has ushered in the country’s worst human rights abuses in decades. In September 2021 the Biden administration froze $130 million in aid until Egypt meets certain – undisclosed – human rights benchmarks far short of the freeze of up to $300 million that Congress had approved.[246]

In contrast to the Trump White House the Biden administration has called out Saudi Arabia on its deplorable human rights record which also includes unlawful detentions and torture of activists and others falsely labeled terrorism suspects and flawed mass terrorism trials and executions.[247] Notably it also has temporarily frozen a large sale of offensive weapons to Riyadh over human rights concerns. But in November it approved $650 million in missiles and missile launchers to the kingdom for “defensive purposes.”[248] Moreover the US has sidestepped calls for sanctions against the de facto Saudi leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman notwithstanding a US intelligence assessment that he approved the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.[249]

Torture as a Boon to Armed Extremist Groups

Islamist armed groups have also profited from US abuses since 9/11 making these practices not only unconscionable and unlawful but also counterproductive. ISIS has used these abuses as a propaganda tool to both lure recruits and justify its own abhorrent acts for example by putting hostages from the US and other countries in orange jumpsuits such as those worn by prisoners at Guantánamo before executing them.[250]

As a group of US security intelligence and interrogation professionals wrote in a joint statement upon the release of the Torture Report summary torture can “serve as a foundational theme for recruiting campaigns designed to attract others to violent extremism” and “invites reciprocity” by armed groups holding US captives. For those being subjected to abuse “[t]orture and other forms of abusive or coercive techniques often serves to strengthen an individual’s resolve to resist [and] deepen his commitment to a cause” they said.[251]

To be sure a range of reasons many unrelated to US acts or policies have compelled people to join armed groups such as Al Qaeda ISIS Boko Haram and Al Shabab. But abuses by US forces have undoubtedly fueled grievances within marginalized Muslim communities and contributed to the Islamist armed extremist narrative that the US and its Western allies are waging a crusade against Muslims.[252]

“Perceived US abuses of and lack of due process for detainees at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay” remains “a key driver” of foreign terrorist fighters to Iraq and is “undermining international confidence in the United States' ability to conduct an effective war on terrorism that remains true to American values” a confidential US diplomatic cable warned as far back as 2006.[253]

Torture is also ineffective prompting its victims to say anything even if it is false to get their torturers to stop the pain.[254] As the declassified summary of the Torture Report notes at no time did the CIA’s coercive interrogation techniques produce intelligence of an imminent threat. Rather according to the CIA’s own memos those held in CIA black sites in response to 9/11 who provided significant accurate intelligence did so prior to or without having been subjected to “enhanced interrogation techniques.” Conversely multiple CIA detainees fabricated information under and following torture resulting in faulty intelligence including on critical issues such as terrorist threats.[255]

Recommendations

It is not too late for the US to mitigate some of the damage from its unlawful detentions torture and other violations of the rights of both victims and suspects. The Biden administration should promptly implement measures aimed at ending crimes and violations perpetrated under the rubric of the War on Terror including unlawful air strikes and raids that kill or injure civilians both in and out of recognized war zones. Those reforms should include increasing transparency and accountability when operations go awry.

Biden should stand firm on his vow to close the US prison at Guantánamo and end the deeply flawed military commissions system. He should send the prisoners who cannot be prosecuted home – or to third countries should repatriation present risks of torture or other ill-treatment. The president should press Congress to lift the ban on transferring the rest to the US for prosecution in federal courts without using torture-tainted evidence and for those convicted to serve their sentences in federal prisons.

If he cannot garner sufficient support from Congress Biden should use his executive authority to empower the Justice Department to pursue plea agreements in federal courts through videoconferencing if necessary. In addition Biden should declassify the RDI program as well as the entire Torture Report redacting only what is strictly necessary to protect national security to help provide a full public accounting. Biden should provide redress and rehabilitative services for victims. The President should also acknowledge wrongdoing and apologize to victims of torture and other unlawful practices.

Furthermore Biden should direct the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to conduct a thorough independent and credible investigation into US government detention practices and interrogation methods since 9/11 with an eye toward prosecutions. The investigation should examine the role of US officials no matter their position or rank who participated in authorized ordered or had command responsibility for torture or ill-treatment and other unlawful detention practices including enforced disappearance and rendition to torture.

The US Congress should create an independent impartial commission to investigate enforced disappearances extraordinary renditions torture and other abuses of detainees in US custody since 9/11. Such a commission should hold hearings have full subpoena power compel the production of evidence and have authority to recommend appointing a special prosecutor to investigate possible criminal offenses if the attorney general has not yet opened such an investigation.

Judicial authorities in other countries should exercise universal jurisdiction or other forms of jurisdiction as provided under international and domestic law to prosecute nationals from the US or elsewhere alleged to be involved in serious international crimes against detainees since 9/11. Governments that participated in the RDI program should also ensure impartial and independent criminal investigations into the roles of their own nationals and prosecute those implicated in crimes.

Unless it conducts genuine investigations domestically the US should encourage inclusion of abuses by US nationals in the International Criminal Court’s investigation of grave crimes in Afghanistan.

While these steps will be politically challenging they are the only option should the US wish to uphold the rule of law and its proclaimed values and protect fundamental rights including the right to life. The only victors in maintaining the status quo are governments seeking justification for unlawful practices in the name of security and groups like Al Qaeda ISIS and their offshoots which point to US abuses to underscore their narrative that the West is at war with Islam.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3dvcmxkLXZhcGVycy1hbGxpYW5jZS1zbGFtcy1jaWdhcmV0dGVzLWJpZy1icml0aXNoLWFtZXJpY2FuLXRvYmFjY28taXMtc2VjcmV0bHktYmVoaW5kLWl00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World Vapers Alliance Slams Cigarettes. Big British American Tobacco Is Secretly Behind It.,"A pro-vaping group says it wants to save your life. Cigarettes they remind us can kill you. But smokers may be surprised who’s behind that message.

“The World Vapers’ Alliance amplifies the voice of passionate vapers around the world and empowers them to make a difference for their communities” reads the homepage for the WVA whose logo is revolutionary pastiche—a left fist clenching a vape pen. “Back vaping. Beat smoking” the page urges.

As for the people who want you to make the switch the site says that its alliance “includes groups representing vapers—our partners—as well as individual vapers from around the world.”

And while the WVA provides a list of those partners one key name is missing: the world’s largest tobacco company.

According to sources and internal documents British American Tobacco has played a central and hands-on role in orchestrating directing and funding the World Vapers’ Alliance—a seemingly grassroots lobbying group designed to recruit pro-vaping advocates around the world under an anti-smoking guise.

To do so the company teamed up with its European public affairs firm and a U.S.-based “dark money” non-profit with financial roots in the murky world of right-wing billionaires. And they have all gone to extraordinary lengths to keep the company’s involvement under wraps.

The other groups have also created distance from the WVA. The PR firm Red Flag appears only in the page’s privacy policy as “maintaining” the page “on behalf of the World Vapers’ Alliance.” The policy page also mentions the dark money group—a libertarian organization headquartered in Virginia called the Consumer Choice Center—and claims that the WVA is “supported by” the CCC. (The truth is that those two entities are much closer but more on that later.)

And while that page alludes to Red Flag’s “affiliated companies”—with which it can share personal information and user metadata including information “to target marketing communications and advertising”—the British American Tobacco name doesn’t appear anywhere.

Emails obtained by The Daily Beast however show discussions last year between a new subcontractor Red Flag and CCC acknowledging BAT’s hands-on role in the WVA—as well as efforts to cover up that involvement.

In one email an employee for the subcontractor mentions BAT’s involvement with the social media ad strategy.

“We outlined the ideas we think that are needed to solve the above problem as well as ensure that we make sure we hit the goals laid out to the British American Tobacco Company” the subcontractor wrote.

In response a Red Flag employee tells the subcontractor—with no CCC employees on this email—that “we don’t mention BAT in correspondence with CCC on this campaign.”

“Our bad this falls into the learning on the job piece” the employee wrote.

Two sources who worked on these campaigns speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of professional backlash confirmed to The Daily Beast that BAT was intimately involved in the WVA. The company “ran the show” and had provided significant funding they said pegging the scope of the project in the millions.

These people also confirmed that the cigarette giant was never to be mentioned by name in correspondence and that communications with BAT officials were to take place in calls only.

BAT also contributed considerable human resources to the effort the two people said describing several strategy calls with company officials. The corporate official running point they said was Marcin Wiktorwitz the BAT’s global head of campaigns who had regular contact with the outside groups.

The WVA has placed Facebook ads around the world but rarely under its own name and definitely not under the name of British American Tobacco which the two sources claim played a key role in orchestrating monitoring and funding those ads. All social media ads went through Wiktorwitz for review they said and he received ad reports directly.

The Facebook ad library only lists four WVA ad campaigns from Aug. and Sept. 2020. (The social media platform apparently removed two of them for violating its terms of service.)

The CCC was also hesitant about having its name pinned to those ads emails show.

One CCC representative wrote that the group is “usually flagged by Facebook as Political or Social Issues Ads and that sometimes can become a problem” noting that some countries did not permit the U.S.-based nonprofit to run political ads. The representative advised that ad copy can be changed to “make our political views less evident for the [Facebook] AI.”

The emails also show that both Red Flag and the CCC were “nervous” about the payment. The CCC did not want to be labeled as the Facebook advertiser and Red Flag was jittery about the amount spent—too much money might compromise its grassroots image.

They appear to have gotten their wish. The Facebook ad library does not list any pro-vape ads from CCC and hardly any from the WVA. But WVA partner groups in Poland and Australia both paid for ads in fall 2020.

Documents obtained by The Daily Beast also show that the WVA acknowledged internally that it was presenting a false outward image. An overview of its on-the-ground strategy in the Netherlands states that the group was engineering “seemingly organic letters.”

“Our team will be carrying several variations of stationary in size color style in order to obtain a wide array of seemingly organic letters from all supporters. We will then quality control these letters and schedule them to be sent to the targets in a frequency that the campaign dictates” the document says.

The key purpose of the BAT-backed campaign according to the emails was to get individuals to pressure their member of Parliament (in some cases the European Parliament) to roll back regulations. Specifically the group is concerned about bans on vaping flavors health warnings as well as tax and price regulations according to the website.

In addition to the digital efforts the WVA also sponsored a “Vape Bus Tour 2021” featuring a van with a pink boxing glove attached to the roof.

This lobbying effort was first detailed in a November investigation from French outlet Le Monde which explored the connections between big tobacco the WVA the CCC and the funding. That investigation pointed to an old donor connection between BAT and CCC—which CCC discloses in a corner of its website—but did not produce evidence of BAT’s direct involvement.

Asked for comment a BAT spokesperson provided a statement acknowledging that the company supported organizations that share its goal of “tobacco harm reduction.”

“Tobacco harm reduction underpins our purpose to build A Better Tomorrow by reducing the health impact of our business. Like many other companies we support organisations that contribute to the debate on issues that are important to our consumers in particular tobacco harm reduction” the statement said.

The statement did not mention the World Vapers’ Alliance by name. Asked why BAT would not want its involvement with WVA to be publicly known—if the group’s goals did indeed so closely comport with the cigarette company’s “purpose”—the spokesperson did not reply.

The WVA website is thick with anti-smoking messaging.

The first thing that the WVA website shows viewers is a video featuring this warning: “Smoking is the leading cause of preventable cancer and cancer death.”

The next panel on the site reads “Back vaping. Beat smoking” which appears to be a favored tagline.

“Vaping can save 200 million lives” that panel continues. “2021 is the year we can take this opportunity or lose it forever. We need to act NOW.” The sprawling site features testimonials literature and a spate of research supporting various positive aspects of vaping. (One study is from the WVA/CCC.)

Notably the group acknowledges that it is not a good idea for non-smokers to take up vaping something pointed out in much of the research it provides. Instead most of that research as well as blog entries push the health gains of trading smoking for vaping.

And while a knives-out anti-smoking mission may seem contradictory for a major tobacco company it is consistent with BAT’s corporate strategy.

Of course BAT has shown no desire to pull the plug on its booming cigarette business. The multinational has a current market cap of nearly $90 billion according to Bloomberg and counts among its holdings U.S.-based R.J. Reynolds makers of Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.

But while BAT acknowledges that it’s good to give up smoking the company doesn’t want to give up its nicotine delivery business—or tobacco. So instead of urging smokers to quit it urges them to start vaping.

The “Tobacco” page of the BAT website says “the only ways” to avoid “the well-known health risks” of smoking are “to not start or to quit smoking.” But the next sentence dismisses quitting: “For those who still smoke we encourage them to switch to scientifically substantiated reduced risk alternatives” the website says.

The company and the WVA prefers the phrase “tobacco harm reduction.” (Several pages on the BAT site also echo the copy deployed by WVA.) After all BAT markets cigarette alternatives such as glo a device that heats compatible (read: BAT-made) tobacco sticks instead of combusting cigarettes. In the United States BAT sells Camel Snus smokeless products as well as vape systems Velo and Vuse—the first vape system to get regulatory approval in the states.

In a fine-print disclaimer BAT acknowledges “these products are not risk free and are addictive” and “no reduced-risk claims will be made as to these products without agency clearance.”

The multinational wants to build on that ground-floor space in the growing worldwide vape market which in terms of regulation appears to be a less friendly space than in the United States specifically.

Today BAT along with other tobacco and e-cigarette companies is locked in a battle with global regulators. Some countries have banned vape products outright and many have imposed taxes and restricted flavors—which anti-vaping advocates say appeal to non-smokers and young people who could then get addicted to nicotine and take up smoking. (Or keep on vaping and paying for the privilege.)

This battle space is of course familiar territory for cigarette manufacturers. In response the company has adopted a familiar strategy enlisting help from an experienced anti-regulatory nonprofit network to craft a fake grassroots “astroturf” lobbying pressure campaign.

The World Vapers’ Alliance is the embodiment of that movement.

And while the WVA is fairly clear about what it does it is not clear about how it does it; the group does not mention that the major tobacco interests backing it stand to benefit handsomely from its mission.

But the WVA is also not clear about what it is.

The site does not say whether the organization is a for-profit business a nonprofit a trade organization or some other loose affiliation of advocacy groups. It certainly strives to give the appearance of the latter. All but one of the partner organizations listed on the site are vaping advocacy and “tobacco harm reduction” groups in countries around the world from Taiwan to Uganda to Poland.

But there’s a notable exception: The United States is not represented.

There’s also one notable exception among that spray of vaping advocacy group logos: The CCC which appears crammed into the third of four levels.

And that group is the clue to the WVA’s organizational status—which is predictably and purposefully complex.

If you want to give the WVA money click the “donate” button on the site and you get swept over to the CCC website. That page informs readers that the Consumer Choice Center is a nonprofit registered in the United States under the IRS code as a 501(c)4 social welfare group—meaning it does not have to disclose its donors.

And those donors are important—and familiar.

Public records show that the CCC launched in 2017 as a project of another nonprofit called Students for Liberty an anti-regulation libertarian-leaning youth group which has received heavy funding from billionaire Charles Koch.

Students for Liberty a 501(c)3 nonprofit which also operates internationally has received substantial financial support from a number of other influential conservative groups including the Koch-linked Institute for Humane Studies the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation—co-founded by a member of the John Birch Society—and the Ken W. Davis Foundation. Even more money has poured in through Donors Trust an outfit favored by the Kochs and other right-of-center one-percenters to funnel money anonymously to their favored nonprofits.

Further funding for Students for Liberty has arrived via the Atlas Network which a 2016 academic paper characterized as a “strategic ally of the tobacco industry” and which has received extensive grants from cigarette giant Philip Morris.

The Le Monde investigation noted that the Kochs have a long history of coordinating and cooperating with the nicotine business to pursue their shared anti-government aims. Anti-regulatory think tanks began taking that same “astroturf” approach to promote vaping as far back as the Obama administration.

The Kochs also have direct financial interests in the e-cig business. Koch Industries owns Phillips-Medisize a major contracted manufacturer of JUUL the dominant e-cig brand in the US.

And in late 2019 the Consumer Choice Center spun off from Students for Liberty and received its own 501(c)4 tax-exempt status IRS documents show. Students for Liberty made the official announcement the following year.

Still the CCC has yet to file its own financial disclosures with the IRS and it appears the group has not obtained permission to solicit funds separate from Students for Liberty in their shared home state of Virginia where government records show they still share the same name.

Notably the CCC also shares its name with another group: In May 2021 the CCC filed a fictitious name certificate with the Virginia secretary of state—for the World Vapers’ Alliance.

It appears that far beyond simply supporting the WVA the CCC is the WVA. And going by the Virginia nonprofit registry the CCC is in at least one official sense the same organization as Students for Liberty.

The nested structure perplexed nonprofit tax law experts who also pointed out that the secretive corporate ties could depending on the extent of the involvement raise legal concerns about the groups’ tax status.

Phil Hackney an expert in tax exempt organizations at University of Pittsburgh Law School said he was not familiar with an organizational structure like this.

“It seems like it could create problems for the c(3) group [Students for Liberty]. Since they are not a social welfare organization it would seem like they would have to keep scrupulous track of their separate activities. That is uncommon” Hackney said.

Lloyd Mayer nonprofit law expert at the University of Notre Dame School of Law said that the setup and its corporate ties reminded him of another Koch-fueled effort the American Legislative Exchange Council which consulted with private entities in drafting model legislation to pass to lawmakers.

“This seems like a specialized version of ALEC of anti-regulation groups using judo-type legal moves which is savvy” Mayer told The Daily Beast.

“ If they’re not getting a charitable donation here the only reason to do it this way is to hide the source of the money. ” — Lloyd Mayer University of Notre Dame Law School

But BAT’s role put a wrinkle in their analysis.

“I find the international activity really interesting. You’d love to know why a U.S. group is doing this sort of thing” Hackney said.

“Going out to essentially advertise and make the business of vaping better seems a little questionable for a social welfare group and more like business-related activity” he added noting that when credit counseling nonprofits had credit card companies supporting them it called into question their tax status. “While this seems more in for-profit interests than social activity it’s hard to say for sure.”

As for helping BAT cover its tracks Mayer wondered “Why do it this way?”

“If they’re not getting a charitable donation here the only reason to do it this way is to hide the source of the money. It only really just benefits the company” he said. “Nothing in IRS code prevents [the CCC] from receiving foreign contributions or operating overseas but if the corporate interests are too closely tied they may lose their tax status.”

Both experts also said that the CCC clearly should have filed its returns and disclosed its donors by now and that it was baiting an IRS penalty if it had not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMDYvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9sYXdyZW5jZS1uLWJyb29rcy1kZWFkLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lawrence N.

(New York) – Twenty years after Guantánamo Bay detention operations commenced on January 11 2002 a new report assesses the massive costs of US unlawful transfers secret detention and torture after the September 11 2001 attacks. The report from the Costs of War Project at Brown University’s Watson Institute and Human Rights Watch outlines how these abuses trample on the rights of victims and suspects create a burden to US taxpayers and damage counterterrorism efforts worldwide ultimately jeopardizing universal human rights protections for everyone.

Legacy of the “Dark Side” The Costs of Unlawful US Detentions and Interrogations Post-9/11

“Around the world Guantánamo remains one of the most enduring symbols of the injustice abuse and disregard for the rule of law that the US unleashed in response to the 9/11 attacks” said Letta Tayler an associate Crisis and Conflict director at Human Rights Watch and the report’s co-author. “The US government’s reliance on deeply flawed military commissions along with other due process failures has not only violated the rights of the men held at Guantánamo. It also has deprived survivors of the September 11 attacks and families of the dead of their right to justice.”

The report notes that:

The US has held no one accountable for the CIA orchestrating a system of undisclosed “black sites” throughout the world in which it secretly detained at least 119 Muslim men and tortured at least 39.

The US has largely resisted accountability for abuses at its military prisons in Afghanistan and Iraq where it detained thousands of Muslims including several women and boys and at Guantánamo Bay Cuba.

The US military is still detaining 39 Muslim men at Guantánamo 27 of them without criminal charges and judicial proceedings are so flawed that none of the five 9/11 suspects have been brought to trial. The prisoners are among at least 780 foreign Muslim men and boys whom the US has held at Guantánamo since January 11 2002.

The US has spent more than $5.48 trillion on the “War on Terror” including $540 million a year just to detain prisoners at Guantánamo.

While unlawful US detentions have gradually ebbed civilian deaths and injuries from US-led strikes in the “War on Terror” skyrocketed under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald J. Trump also without accountability.

The “extraordinary renditions” (unlawful transfers from one country to another) secret detentions and torture have damaged the international human rights system Tayler and her co-author Elisa Epstein said. By committing abuses with impunity the US has made it easier for countries such as Russia Egypt and China to criticize Washington and deflect international condemnation of their own human rights violations.

US counterterrorism partners have replicated the Guantánamo model by detaining thousands of people in dire conditions in Iraq northeast Syria Nigeria Egypt and elsewhere for alleged terrorism offenses. Those detained often without charge or trial include civil society members suspects’ relatives and children who are victims of armed groups.

The report also cites instances in which unlawful rendition and detention and torture have undermined US security goals. The Islamic State (ISIS) and other armed groups have used US abuses as a propaganda tool to lure recruits and bolster their narrative that Washington and its Western allies are waging a crusade against Muslims.

The authors call on the Biden administration to close the Guantánamo prison and enact significant legal and policy reforms to end further abuses. Reforms should include far greater transparency about crimes that US forces committed and accountability at the highest levels as well as robust efforts to address religious racial and ethnic bias in counterterrorism efforts.

“This report lays out a comprehensive assessment of the many unconscionable costs of US torture and illegal detentions and renditions of Muslims over the past 20 years since 9/11” said Stephanie Savell co-director of the Costs of War Project. “This is a moral failure of epic proportions a stain on the nation’s human rights record a strategic blunder and an abhorrent perpetuation of Islamophobia and racism.”

Building on SOM’s tradition of innovative engineering the design for a bank’s new headquarters incorporates a distinctive external diagrid that significantly reduces solar gain. Inside responsive solar shading technology and natural airflow enhance staff wellbeing.



Skidmore Owings & Merrill (SOM) has completed a 158-meter-tall 33-story tower located on the edge of a public park at the center of one of Shenzhen’s key business districts that responds to the region’s tropical climate through a series of biophilic and sustainable design solutions. The firm was commissioned by Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank in 2012 to design a new headquarters that balances the bank’s vision for the future alongside its history as a rural credit union.



The tower’s facade is defined by an external diagrid which serves as both the building’s structure as well as an important solar shading element. At its base the diagrid widens to create framed openings and views to the surrounding park and Qianhai Bay a short walk from the building.



“We’re always exploring opportunities to synthesize inventive engineering solutions with architectural design. The Rural Commercial Bank Headquarters gave us the chance to incorporate a diagrid—similar to an exoskeleton—that pulls the structure to the exterior and effectively suspends the tower within to create column-free workspaces” explains Scott Duncan SOM Design Partner.



Drawing upon principles from feng shui in which water and wealth are intrinsically linked the lobby is encircled by a reflecting pool and features a rippling wall of water adjacent to the main entrance. A 15 meter high “rain curtain” with droplets of water that cascade down small translucent filaments lines the lobby’s ultra transparent glass walls. On hot summer days these water features provide an evaporative cooling effect for the entire building. Above suspended lighting fixtures mimic droplets of rain and the lobby’s marble walls shift from a textured to honed finish to evoke water’s effect on stone.



Three essential elements—earth water and air—figure prominently in the building features from the multistory rain curtain in the main lobby to the striated marble cladding the tower’s elevator core and to the natural ventilation system that brings fresh air into common areas and office spaces. Reflecting pools grey granite paving and seating areas and arrays of trees and ground cover define the main entrance spaces and small gardens at the base of the tower. This tactile experience at ground level transitions and becomes more atmospheric as one progresses up the tower to the open floor plans and “floating” diagrid above. At the crown of the tower operable walls and an outdoor deck blur distinctions between indoor and outdoor spaces.



Two vertical atria span the height of the tower. On each floor employees can use louvers to open and close vents accessing fresh air from the atria. This allows the building to “breathe” when Shenzhen’s climate is pleasant filling the entire building with fresh air so tenants can enjoy the same air inside as they do outside. By functioning like airways in a body and cycling fresh air throughout the building these features generate significant savings in environmental and energy efficiency. This system prioritizes tenant comfort and wellbeing to a degree typically unheard of in office environments. Interior spaces are defined by a minimal glass perimeter wall and a daylight-responsive shading system. A communicating stairway runs the height of the tower fostering connectivity and collaboration among coworkers.



The tower is LEED Platinum and is targeting China Green Star certification.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzA5L2RpbW9ucy1zb24taW4tbGF3LWNhdWdodC1pbi0yMW0tZGlzcHV0ZS1iZXR3ZWVuLWFwb2xsby1vaWwtZXhlYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dimon's son-in-law caught in $21M dispute between Apollo oil exec,"Jamie Dimon’s son-in-law has been caught up in an ugly dispute with a Texas-based energy executive who has accused him along with private-equity giant Apollo Global Management of orchestrating a scheme to stiff the oil-and-gas driller out of his stake in the lucrative company he built.

Joey Romeo — a Princeton-educated buyout executive who married his Harvard Business School sweetheart Julia Dimon in 2011 — is part of a group of Apollo execs accused of luring Varun Mishra into a partnership that eventually turned sour with Mishra alleging he got cheated out of $21 million according to an explosive arbitration claim Mishra filed last month.

5 Julia Dimon and Joey Romeo have been together since their days at Harvard Business School. Facebook

After tapping Mishra’s expertise on natural gas and petroleum to build an energy business Romeo and other Apollo executives allegedly pushed him out as CEO — a coup that came shortly after Mishra raised questions about millions of dollars that Romeo had ordered be charged to the company’s expense accounts according to the filing.

5 Varun Mishra has expertise in the energy business.

People close to Apollo denied that any expenses paid by Varun’s company were inappropriate.

The spat offers a rare glimpse inside not only the rough-and-tumble world of private-equity deals but also the business of family members of the billionaire boss of JPMorgan Chase who have mostly kept a low profile.

Romeo now in his late 30s owns a $7 million 3825-square-foot unit in a Park Avenue luxury tower. Located two floors below the legendary banking tycoon the spread is the former home of iconic furniture designer Vladimir Kagan property records show.

Aside from a few wedding snaps on social media one of the few publicly available photos of Romeo surfaced in a controversial December 2013 Christmas card in which Dimon and his family romped around their palatial apartment hitting tennis balls. In one shot Romeo was caught leaping barefoot over furniture.

Romeo has been at Apollo since 2013 — and was brought on board at the urging of the late legendary JPMorgan dealmaker Jimmy Lee according to sources. Before Apollo Romeo had been an associate at GE Capital’s Energy Financial Services business.

“Jimmy called a lot of people to say ‘Hire Joey’” a source with knowledge of Apollo told The Post. “Joey did not go through the normal recruitment process.”

5 Joey Romeo (middle) appears on a 2013 Dimon family Christmas card.

MIshra meanwhile claims that Romeo got snooty and sarcastic as their business relationship steadily went south.

“Joseph Romeo can be described as a person who constantly belittles you” Mishra a 41-year-old Indian immigrant who came to the US as a student said in a written statement to The Post. “Without knowing me — or my immigration history — he commented on me that ‘Isn’t it too easy for you all to make money?’”

Romeo who is named as a defendant in the arbitration claim along with Apollo and other various current and former employees at the firm didn’t respond to The Post’s request for comment.

An Apollo spokesman told The Post that Mishra was “disgruntled” and that he had been fired “for cause.” The spokesman added that Mishra had engaged six different sets of lawyers and filed a previous arbitration demand “which he voluntarily withdrew.”

“We strongly support our team and categorically reject Mr. Mishra’s false defamatory and constantly changing allegations” the Apollo spokesman said.

Mishra told The Post he withdrew a previous arbitration claim because he believed it gave him a better chance to settle with Apollo. After that settlement fell apart Mishra said he filed the current one.

5 Joey Romeo and Julia Dimon married in 2011.

According to Mishra’s claim Apollo executives approached him in 2015 to offer at least $400 million to build out a business that would eventually become American Petroleum Partners. Under the agreement Mishra would contribute Pennsylvania wells he’d amassed and serve as CEO on an H1-B visa while Apollo would provide the capital for expansion.

But the next year Apollo and Romeo pulled the rug out from under Mishra axing a deal for APP to acquire a major natural gas fracking company for $360 million — only to turn around and scoop up the company through another firm in which some Apollo principals were “likely direct or indirect beneficiaries” according to arbitration papers.

Despite allegedly getting shortchanged by Apollo on the fracking deal Mishra had already committed his wells to the APP venture according to the complaint.

By that time Mishra told The Post he noticed Romeo had been approving expenses for Apollo executives’ limousines and other high-end travel to be paid for out of American Petroleum. According to Mishra’s suit Romeo was siphoning “multiple millions of dollars” out of Mishra’s business to pad the accounts of Apollo and its affiliates.

Mishra alleges that Romeo had directed Collin King then APP’s chief financial officer to “make substantial payments to Apollo without Mishra’s knowledge or approval.”

“Before he was fired to my knowledge he never alleged that the company reimbursed expenses — to Apollo or anyone else — that were not 100% legitimate company expenses” King who now works for APP’s successor company High Road Resources told The Post. “Romeo never directed me to approve any inappropriate expenses and I never did so.”

Mishra and his attorney both told The Post that he had indeed raised the issue of inappropriate expenses with King and with Romeo directly.

Mishra claims he rang alarm bells bringing it to Romeo’s supervisor’s attention but his protests blew up in his face. On Nov. 7 2019 Romeo traveled to Canonsburg Pa. with his boss Olivia Wassenaar to confront Mishra. They demanded he resign and accept a “paltry” payout — saying otherwise “he would be terminated for cause” the filing claims.

Mishra refused noting in his arbitration filing that he’d never been reprimanded or warned — let alone disciplined — for his performance as APP’s president and CEO nor had he received any written notice of any violations of his employment agreement.

The allegations come as Apollo is under a consent decree from 2016 after the Securities and Exchange Commission said an Apollo senior partner improperly charged expenses to certain company-run funds. If Mishra’s claims are found to have merit they could trigger another SEC probe of Apollo’s practices sources told The Post.

Ernest Badway a partner at law firm Fox Rothschild said the optics of the allegations “look awful” but added that they’re not necessarily illegal. “Sadly it would be misallocating expenses” if Apollo partners charged travel and other outlays to APP instead of the firm itself Badway said.

“The SEC has started investigations with much less than this” he said. Still Badway said SEC regulators will focus on who was potentially harmed by Romeo and Apollo’s alleged actions; if investors didn’t suffer any losses — and only Mishra did — regulators might be less apt to probe the situation.

Meanwhile Apollo sold APP’s assets in 2020 to Quantum Energy Partners-owned Tug Hill Operating for around $30 million the arbitration claim alleges. In May of last year Quantum sold its assets — including the former APP’s — to Premier Natural Resources for $6 billion the claim alleges.

(NEXSTAR) – Federal officials have identified 50 U.S. airports that will have “buffer zones” when wireless companies turn on 5G service in a few weeks. The services will use frequencies in a radio spectrum called the C-band which has caused concerns because it could impact flight operations.

After requests from both a major airline trade group — Airlines for America — and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Stephen Dickson head of the Federal Aviation Administration AT&T and Verizon recently delayed rolling out the new 5G service.

Airlines for America told the Federal Communications Commission that using C-band 5G near dozens of airports could interfere with devices that measure an airplane’s height above the ground. Buttigieg and Dickson warned that without a delay there would be an “unacceptable disruption” to aviation because flights would be canceled or diverted to other cities to avoid potential risks to air safety.

Friday the Federal Aviation Administration released a list of 50 airports nationwide that will have buffer zones when 5G is rolled out by wireless carriers later this month. The buffer zones are intended to reduce the risk of airplane instruments like an altimeter which measures the craft’s altitude being affected by potential interference.

Altimeters are crucial to flights making low-visibility landings. According to the FAA aircraft will be required to have an altimeter “that has been proven to be accurate and reliable in the U.S. 5G C-band environment.”

The list of airports that will have 5G buffer zones includes those in New York Dallas Chicago San Francisco Miami and Las Vegas. Airports were selected based on traffic volume the number of low-visibility days and geographic location. These buffer zones will only protect the last 20 seconds of flight according to the FAA.

Many airports are not currently affected by 5G. For those airports not on the list the FAA says it does “not necessarily” mean low-visibility flights cannot occur. In some cases like Denver International Airport 5G is not yet being deployed. With others the FAA says the 5G towers are far enough away to create a natural buffer.

Wireless carriers now plan to turn on the 5G C-band service on January 19.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcnRmb3Jkc2hpcmVtZXJjdXJ5LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvaGVydGZvcmRzaGlyZS1uZXdzL2FtZXJpY2FuLWxpdmluZy1oZXJ0Zm9yZHNoaXJlLWJhZmZsZWQtdWstNjQ1NjAwNdIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcnRmb3Jkc2hpcmVtZXJjdXJ5LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvaGVydGZvcmRzaGlyZS1uZXdzL2FtZXJpY2FuLWxpdmluZy1oZXJ0Zm9yZHNoaXJlLWJhZmZsZWQtdWstNjQ1NjAwNS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American living in Hertfordshire baffled as to why UK supermarkets have clock towers,"An American living in Hertfordshire was puzzled by a quirk that he seems to believe all UK supermarkets have.

He shared his confusion on social media with a clip featuring Tesco Extra in Hatfield which has a tower with a clock.

TikTok star Peter @swfinds has dedicated the account to asking fun questions about life in the UK.

This time the American asked his account's followers for enlightenment around an apparently unique feat of British culture the Daily Star reports.

They asked: “Can someone please tell me why all UK grocery stores have towers with small clocks on them?

And it's prompted some brutal answers.

One person mocked: “They all double up as a church and at 9am on Sunday you must go to pray on aisle 3.”

Another user voiced: “In Britain it is considered highly offensive to enter a supermarket between 4:35pm and 4:45pm. So we need to tell the time.”

Someone else said: “Sorry we are all trained from a very young age not to let the secret out.”

Despite the American being trolled many others left pondering the same thought about clock towers attached to shops.

Education providers OpenLearn state on their website: “Frequently clock towers that stand alone were built in the Victorian or Edwardian periods. They were not simply supposed to be attractive though.

“Some were sponsored by commercial firms and served as a giant advertisement for their wares; others may have been put up by local authorities or by public donations to celebrate national or local events.

“Many are attached to buildings but many stand alone serving as a centre point to town centres or standing in public gardens as ornaments.”

Former Moss Bluff Fire Department Chief Michael Kuk can still remember the smell of burning tar as he watched the roof of Sam Houston High School melt before his eyes.

“It’s hard to believe it’s been 40 years” he said while scanning through a scrapbook of 35mm four-by-six prints of the Jan. 11 1982 fire. “That day I was supposed to have a surprise party for my 33rd birthday. I had begun suspecting something because firefighters from the overnight shift were still hanging around and everyone was in a festive mood at the station.”

The mood didn’t last long.

“It was the coldest day of the year only 18 degrees” Kuk said. “The water works district superintendent had come to the fire station that morning and said ‘Chief if there are any fires today and they’re bad your people need to call me because I’ll have to shut valves to make sure you have enough water to fight it.’ ”

Moss Bluff at the time had only one water tank and that day it was half-full.

The superintendent gave Kuk his home phone number — “cell phones weren’t invented at the time” he said — and bid him good day.

Kuk said the Sam Houston Jones Parkway station — which continues to serve as the main fire station in Moss Bluff — had a shell rock surface driveway at the time that lead up to the building.

“You could hear the shuffling of the shell everywhere when someone drove up and my captain heard the sound that morning — it was about 11:30 a.m. at that point — and so I came out of my office and they told me ‘We’ll go get the medical gear while you go see what the emergency is.’ So here comes this woman at the door all out of breath and she said ‘My God y’all do you know the high school is on fire?’ ”

He when said he stepped outside he could see the smoke a block away.

“Twenty-four out of our 25-person staff came everybody showed up” he said. “Three minutes into the fire I called mutual aid. I had to. They came as far as Jennings to help us. We had no water. There was one hydrant in front of the school and two more about 2000 feet away in opposite directions. Lake Charles hooked on to the eastern one and Sulphur hooked on to the far west one to bring more water to fight the fire. We didn’t even have enough water to control the pitch of the fire.”

The school was L-shaped with a main entrance library principal’s office secretary’s office band room classrooms and a science lab.

“The roof was flat and it was a big wide-open air space” he said. “Everything was wood — a wood-sided school wood framed and the roof was actually pea and gravel basically small rock on tar. The heat was unreal.”

He said his team tried to create what is called a trench cut in which firefighters cut a 3-by-5-foot wide trench in hopes when flames approach a natural ventilation would fight the fire with what little water stream they had.

It didn’t work.

“Every time we got on the roof it was too dangerous” he said. “It was spongy and little pockets of flame would pop up through the hot tar. I called them little fire devils.”

Kuk who had been fire chief for seven years at that point said he couldn’t risk having his team climb up there.

Ultimately the firefighters were unable to stop the fire because they ran out of water at about 4:30 p.m. Kuk said.

“If we would have had the water we could have literally deluged the school with water with two 500-gallon deck guns. They’re big water guns and it could have stopped it. We were lucky to get 300 gallons a minute.”

He said they were able to intersect hose steams to save the offices which in turn preserved all the school records.

“That was a big accomplishment because databases back then didn’t exist.”

Kuk said the fire was so hot and so large that pine straw from a wooded area behind the school caught fire and burned the jackets surrounding the team’s fire hoses.

“Firefighters had to turn around and put out the fires on the hoses so they could keep going” he said. “It was pretty crazy. It was bitter cold that day and nobody was used to being outside that long in 18-degree weather but no one took a break that day.”

After the team got the fire under control they formed a watch line 24 hours a day for five days letting the school’s ruins burn themselves out.

“We put water where we could but what a shame.”

He said the state fire marshal’s office investigation took 30 days and the results were shocking.

“The state fire marshal’s office found that every Bunsen burner — there were 16 or 18 of them — in the chemistry lab was turned in the on position” Kuk said. “By having all that natural gas in the building it was a blow torch.”

He said it’s a miracle no one was injured that day.

“It was a school day but classes had been canceled because it was too cold in the classroom for the students.”

Kuk said one memory that sticks out from the fire is the line of students who gathered outside the school as the flames burned.

“They just stood there in a line crying” he said. “Their school was burning. It was very emotional for them.”

Kuk said he plays keyboards in a few Cajun bands in the area — his stage name is “Chief of the Keyboards” — and even 40 years later he continues to bump into people when he’s out performing who bring up the school fire.

“One thing good that came out of that fire was that it gave a lot of muscle to the water works district to where their board kind of woke up and realized they needed to put in more fire hydrants especially with the booming of the community” he said. “Then the Police Jury adopted an ordinance that all new subdivisions would have fire hydrants no less than 1000 feet apart. It’s nice that something good came out of something so horrible.”",,,,,,

Although two new SPAC rumors have popped up since the market closed on Friday and both involve a well-known name in the SPAC space.

Akili Interactive: A company that specializes in technology-based cognitive therapies could be the first SPAC deal of the year according to a rumor reported by Bloomberg. Social Capital Suvretta Holdings Corp 1 (NASDAQ:DNAA) is nearing a deal with Akili Interactive that could value the prescription digital medicine company at $800 million.

Akili offers digital therapeutics using “captivating action video-game experiences.” Digital therapeutics have been shows to improve attention from children who suffer from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder according to the report.

Akili is targeting treatments for autism spectrum disorder major depressive disorder and multiple sclerosis.

Investors in Akili Interactives include Bailie Gifford Temasek Holdings Shire Neuberger Berman and Amgen Ventures an investment arm from Amgen Inc (NASDAQ:AMGN).

Akili was valued at $410 million in a May funding round.

Social Capital Suvretta Holdings Corp I is one of four biotech themed SPACs launched by well-known SPAC sponsor Chamath Palihapitiya in 2021.

ProKidney: Medical technology company ProKidney could be valued at $1 billion in a rumored SPAC deal with Social Capital Suvretta Holdings Corp III (NASDAQ:DNAC). A rumor from Bloomberg said a deal could be announced in the coming week.

ProKidney was started by Pablo Legorreta the founder and CEO of Royalty Pharma (NASDAQ:RPRX). The company is working on a technology to restore kidney function. The technology uses a patient’s own cells for the treatment.

The company’s website underscores the 100000 people on the kidney transplant list that start dialysis each year a number which grows by 10% a year. Thirteen people die a day while waiting on the kidney transplant list according to the website.

“We aspire to cure kidney disease not manage kidney failure” the company’s website says. ProKidney is conducting multiple Phase 2 clinical trials for its REACT product according to the company.

It's one of four biotech-themed SPACs launched by Palihapitiya in 2021.

Why It’s Important: The list of SPACs outstanding that are searching for deals continues to rise and is outpacing the number of deals announced each week.

No deals have been announced in 2022 through the first week of trading.

Palihapitiya who has completed numerous SPAC deals and been a PIPE investor on deals last announced a SPAC merger for one of his Social Capital SPACs at the beginning of 2021.

The SPAC merger that brought SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) public in 2021 was the first announced deal of last year when it was announced on Jan. 7 2021.

Palihapitiya SPACs were often well received by the market when announced and two rumored deals from his biotech SPACs could put the spotlight on SPACs early in 2022.

Investors could also turn to the other two outstanding biotech SPACs from Palihapitiya and Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp IV (NYSE:IPOD) and Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp VII (NYSE:IPOF) which have traded near or below net asset value for many months.

Shane O’Connor had been missing since Thursday with the Gardaí launching an appeal for his whereabouts. The 17-year-old was missing from Newbridge County Kildare and was last seen on Friday morning in the Tallaght Dublin 24 area the Gardaí said. In the appeal which was reissued on Friday officers said they were concerned for his welfare.

At the time the singer had posted heartfelt messages on social media asking her son to contact her. “Shane your life is precious. God didn’t chisel that beautiful smile on your beautiful face for nothing” she tweeted.

“My world would collapse without you. You are my heart. Please don’t stop it from beating. Please don’t harm yourself. Go to the Gardai and let’s get you to hospital.

“This is a message for my son Shane. Shane it’s not funny any more all this going missing. You are scaring the crap out of me. Could you please do the right thing and present yourself at a Gardai station. If you are with Shane please call the Gardai for his safety.”

The Gardaí have confirmed that the search for the 17-year-old has ended. “Following the recovery of a body in the Bray area of Wicklow on Friday 7 January 2022 a missing person appeal in respect of Shane O’Connor 17 years has been stood down” a spokesperson told the Irish Mirror.

The musician was sent messages of condolences on social media with Cáit O’Riordan formerly of the Pogues tweeting: “I’m so sorry Sinéad.”

Something needed to be done and fast. What was worse is that the Mac-Microsoft wars were about to heat up.

The introduction of the Mac II in 1987 improved the company’s fortunes for a time making it a “Wall Street darling” once again. At this time they were shipping a whopping 50000 Macs a month.

The turn of the new decade however had other plans for Apple. PC clones flooded the home computer market with the vast majority running Windows 3.0 — this was not good for Apple.

Apple devised and released their highly successful series of PowerBooks in 1991 which would give them a mild reprieve. Sculley eventually lost interest in Apple and was relieved of his position by the Board of Directors in 1993.

When I unpack it I get a brief flash of filing into the room at the Moscone Center in San Francisco that was already synonymous with Apple Computer Inc. keynotes. I remember sitting to the left of the stage watching Steve Jobs walking out to the bass rumble of a James Brown bop. I remember putting on what I thought of as my game brain — trying to think like a skeptic not the wide-eyed Apple fanboy I was underneath. Reporters knew they had to resist the ""reality distortion field"" that Jobs was famous for erecting around shiny Apple products that wouldn't last long (Apple Cube anyone?) with a big assist from his keynote cheering section. So I would try to see the much-ballyhooed iPhone if it was actually called that for what it really was.

And then I remember that game brain being utterly defeated.

With every innovation Jobs unveiled on this marvelous new ""multi-touch"" device it became more and more clear that the phone game had been utterly changed; we were witnessing a leap forward at least as great as that of the original Macintosh. The question in 2007 as in 1984 was: would enough people buy this product to make a difference? My final uncompressed memory of that day at Macworld was making my own purchase decision. The iPhone only came in $499 4GB and $599 8GB versions and would only launch on the Cingular network. So I wouldn’t be ditching my 160GB iPod for one any time soon even if I could get out of the two-year Verizon contract on my Palm Treo smartphone. (Because yes that’s what we called phones with tiny physical keyboards back then.)

Watching that keynote again in its entirety 15 years later on my sixth model of iPhone what jumps out is how innocent everyone in that room was — Jobs included. In early 2007 even the great visionary himself couldn’t foresee the wild weird future of developer-driven iPhone apps. They were called ""widgets"" back then and there was only one outside developer Google. Not even Google CEO Eric Schmidt bounding on stage to shake Jobs’ hand had a clue that the two companies would soon be locked in fierce competition over a vast new touchscreen market. Twice Jobs mentions how much of the iPhone has been patented so perhaps he did anticipate a lawsuit like the one that dragged on for years with Samsung. But nobody foresaw the rise of Twitter Facebook or the vast circus of disinformation and division that would soon fill these supremely easy-to-use screens.

But that's just the tip of the iPhone iceberg. All sorts of intriguing historical notes jump out from a rewatch of this famous keynote in 2022 starting with one that has nothing to do with the iPhone at all.

Oh the rivalry!

In an Android vs. iPhone world it's hard to recall that Apple once defined itself primarily in opposition to Microsoft. But most of the first 20 iPhone-free minutes of the keynote are filled with deft stinging swipes at Apple's giant Seattle rival — so much so that you kind of want to grab the popcorn. A Microsoft executive Jim Allchin is called out by name for saying he'd prefer to buy a Mac if he wasn't at Microsoft. The launch of the Zune a would-be iPod competitor now most famous for its cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2  is demolished in a single pie chart. A new Mac vs. PC ad where the PC (John Hodgman) has to go in for major surgery to have Vista installed is debuted. ""If I don’t make it"" Hodgman tells the Mac ""I want you to have all my peripherals."" Peripherals? How very 2007.

Oh the humor!

What the iPhone wasn't: Jobs shows off his sense of humor. Credit: Karl Mondon / Contra Costa Times via Getty Images

Now that it is on top of the world and chasing a $3 trillion market capitalization Apple doesn't go after rivals by name anymore. The opening chunks of Tim Cook's keynotes are taken up by less popular products (even I an Apple Watch owner snooze through the Apple Watch segment) rather than the entertaining battle of a tech underdog hungry for relevance. So it's refreshing to re-experience the sly sense of humor that Jobs displays throughout this keynote — one that both stood in opposition to his reputation as a hardass and complemented it by poking fun at himself.

One of those self-deprecating digs stood out to me at the time. I'd recently moved from being a writer at Time where Jobs would actually call me to pitch stories to being an editor at sister publication Business 2.0 where Jobs wouldn't even allow Apple ads to be placed (despite some of those ads having quotes from my reviews in them). The reason? Jobs was pissed at a Business 2.0 cover story years earlier for speculating on what an iPhone might one day look like and blacklisted the publication. So when Jobs put up a fake iPhone image — an iPod with a rotary dial on it basically — I found myself laughing harder than most.

Oh the name!

On a rewatch in 2022 it seems bizarre that Jobs pauses a moment before introducing the name of the iPhone. Didn’t we already suspect that's what it was going to be called? We did but we also knew that another Silicon Valley company Cisco had the trademark on the name. Jobs was being more than a little honey badger-ish (to use an anachronistic meme) by publicly naming his device the iPhone; Cisco would file a lawsuit against Apple for using the name two days later. A settlement with undisclosed terms would be reached in February 2007 and in June Cisco would license another name it owned to Apple: iOS.

Oh the OS?

In the absence of the iOS name it's jarring at 15 years' distance to see Jobs say ""iPhone runs OS X"" the Mac operating system with ""real desktop class applications."" It’s true that the iPhone OS and Mac OS X share a kernel but they were and still are fundamentally incompatible. Anyone expecting to run their OS X apps on the iPhone would soon be disappointed.

Oh your daughter.

The iPod stood astride the world in early 2007; so much so that Jobs' first job was to sell the iPhone as a larger-screen version of the famous music and video machine. He accomplished this with the help of a playlist of ""favorites"" on shuffle. Perhaps this genuinely was his favorite music or perhaps like the Mac iPhoto app slideshow he'd claimed earlier to have made himself (featuring models on a day out at Mammoth) it was in fact put together for him.

Regardless it’s notable that the first song played in public on an iPhone selected at random was ""Daughters"" by John Meyer (a friend of Jobs' and a Macworld veteran who would end the keynote with a live performance). Jobs clicked away from the song pretty quickly. Now that we have the autobiography of Lisa Brennan-Jobs  the daughter he denied for many years and had a complicated relationship with until the very end of his life we can see why. ""Fathers be good to your daughters"" was not a lyric that really filtered through in the Jobs household.

Oh the dinosaurs …

Apple and Google were about to find themselves on top of the world thanks largely to the iPhone's introduction. The two other companies on stage that day did not fare so well. ""You can't think about the internet without thinking about Yahoo"" Jobs said introducing Yahoo co-founder and CEO Jerry Yang. To which many 2022 denizens would be forgiven for responding: Ya-who?

Sure the media brand still exists having been purchased by Verizon in 2017 for $4.5 billion. But that's a fraction of what the company was worth when the iPhone launched; a year after he was on-stage with Jobs Yang would turn down a $44.6 billion offer from Microsoft. Both Yahoo and Microsoft would struggle to stay relevant thereafter; not even offering free email to compete with Gmail in 2007 nor buying Tumblr for $1 billion under former Googler Marissa Mayer in 2013 would help Yahoo survive in its original form.

The other dinosaur on stage that day: Stan Sigman CEO of Cingular Wireless a company he had just sold to AT&T. Speaking haltingly from cue cards Sigman was the epitome of the old-school CEO from an era where media presence wasn't everything. He would retire later that year leaving the iPhone exclusively in AT&T's hands until the Verizon version launched two years later.

Apple had flipped the wireless industry's business model on its head.

By then Apple had flipped the wireless industry's business model on its head; the makers of handsets and handset software would be in charge of our brave new world not the providers of networks on which they ran.

Oh how easy we were to please!

It's quite a delight to see the audience gasp at ""pinching"" and ""zooming"" on a smartphone screen for the first time. Or to hear cheers for a 3.5 inch display size which would seem minuscule today. (The smallest iPhone now sold by Apple the SE has a 4.7-inch screen with displays running as large as 6.7 inches in the iPhone 13 Pro Max.) Jobs is delighted to show off the utterly un-optimized New York Times front page on the Safari browser; these days we'd run screaming from such a tiny text-filled mess.

SEE ALSO: The size and price of every iPhone ever released

And when Jobs introduces ""visual voicemail"" it takes a second to remember that he's not talking about the automatic transcript version in today's iOS; merely being able to choose which voicemail to listen to first was enough to wow the inhabitants of 2007. (For younger iPhone users a ""voicemail"" is like when you leave someone a voice memo in iMessage but for some reason you decide to do it after ""calling"" their ""number"" in the phone app.)

Oh no 'one more thing?'

A surprise at the end became so traditional at Jobs' keynotes that he would forever be associated with the catchphrase ""one more thing."" But he didn't use it in 2007 despite having two mics to drop: Firstly the fact that Apple was officially changing its name (from Apple Computer Inc. to Apple Inc. a prescient change for the iPhone era) and secondly a John Meyer performance. Instead Jobs calls the musician's appearance ""a really special treat."" Little did he know that a decade and a half later the keynote itself — indeed the very idea of a Steve Jobs keynote — would become more iconic than the beloved singer ever was.

I’ve taken the last few weeks to unwind and ensure that my 2022 hot takes are as scorching as possible or at least as prescient as possible. This week we’re talking about what I’m sure could be one of Apple’s biggest scandals of the decade thus far: the itty bitty AirTag.

You can get this in your inbox every Saturday morning from the newsletter page and follow my tweets @lucasmtny.

the big thing

AirTags are a very useful product from Apple that pretty much function exactly as advertised.

Unfortunately that’s the problem.

There’s been a fair bit of controversy lately around how Apple rolled these out and how even though these are great devices to keep track of your keys they can also easily be abused to stalk someone. This isn’t a purely theoretical issue either it’s already happening.

It’s not a particularly unique scenario where technology can be used for good and bad purposes — just think about the decades-long conversation around encryption — that said I have a feeling that this is a scenario where Apple is going to lose and it’s going to be more embarrassing than any misstep in recent memory.

Apple has arranged so much of their wearable product marketing over the last few years on how their devices function in edge use cases. The Apple Watch’s last several generations have focused on health tracking features that could help identify rare conditions or help users in a life-threatening situation. TV commercials have documented the individual stories of users who have found the Apple Watch to be a life-saving tool. With AirTags there’s potential for some of that same good but there’s also much more downside. In the next year we’re undoubtedly going to see examples of AirTags being used in nefarious ways that bundled together serve as the antithesis of one of these Apple Watch commercials. It may end up being a product defined by its gross shortcomings.

Apple has made its own post-launch efforts to tighten up how AirTags that don’t belong to a certain user can be detected but these notifications have proven buggy and have often waited far too long to alert users. Add in the fact that Apple has seemed to treat Android integration as an afterthought not a necessary partnership in order to ship a device like this and Apple’s incompetence looks a bit more severe.

I highly doubt that Apple is going to be able to design their way out of this problem. Regardless of what they ship on iOS to backtrack issues Android’s fractured ecosystem means that safeguards won’t reach an awful lot of people who could be targeted.

For a nascent product category with such PR liability potential it’s hard to see how Apple justifies continuing to sell AirTags. It’s a unique error from Apple in that the company delivered exactly what they initially promised but failed to consider the full scope of that initial promise’s direct consequences.

other things

Here are a few stories this week I think you should take a closer look at:

Elizabeth Holmes convicted on 4 of 11 counts

At long last the trial of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes reached a resolution. Now we wait for sentencing as well as further guidance on whether Holmes will be retried for several of the counts that the jury could not reach a verdict on. “Holmes was found guilty of conspiring to defraud investors as well as defrauding investors from the DeVos family hedge fund manager Brian Grossman and former estate and trust attorney Dan Mosely. She was not found guilty of charges related to defrauding patients” my colleague Amanda reported.

Google infringed on Sonos tech trade court rules

Google’s smart speakers infringed on key patents held by Sonos a U.S. regulator ruled this week and the company will no longer be allowed to import the infringing products which are manufactured in China. Google has already begun rolling out design changes which it hopes will interrupt its ability to sell its smart speaker devices. Sonos has seen its early lead in the smart speaker war dissipate as tech giants have thrown their weight around but the smaller hardware company isn’t shrinking away.

A smaller quieter CES

The Omicron wave stopped the TechCrunch team from making our way to Las Vegas to check out the latest gadgets at the Consumer Electronics Show but we were at the show in spirit and watching along with countless livestreams. While it was certainly a more low-key year there were still plenty of wild gadgets this year. Here are some of the best ones we saw.

added things

Some of my favorite reads from our TechCrunch+ subscription service this week:

How startups can prevent tech debt from piling up

“…Favoring a short-term plan to get a faster go-to-market option is not always bad provided the business has a backup plan to deliver well-designed code that would simplify future iterations and innovations. But for startups reworking is difficult as deadlines and resource crunch prevent developers from producing clean and perfect code. Startups prioritize short-term plans and focus more on adding functionalities to achieve milestones sign up marquee customers or raise funding. This roadmap shuffling and disregard for the long-term view trigger tech debt…”

5 growth marketing predictions for 2022

“…It’s been a crazy year in growth marketing what with the meteoric rise of TikTok radical iOS privacy shifts and a staggering $240 billion poured into U.S. startups as of September 30. All of this new money has meant heavier investments in growth marketing throughout 2021. The heavier investments have occurred during uncertain times with startups scrambling to find ways to measure iOS conversions and unlock TikTok as a new channel…”

3 things founders need to know about M&A

“…M&A is particularly beneficial for startups that struggle to scale operationally because they essentially buy cash flow revenue and other companies’ traffic meaning startups grab a bigger share of their markets. They’re also a good way for startups to find consolidate and experiment with their value proposition. The problem though is that most founders don’t know how to get started with M&A and resign themselves to the shadows of bigger players. But mergers are accessible and advantageous to businesses of all sizes…”

In 2021 the median pay for employees was $68254 Apple said adding it had selected a new median employee for comparison due to changes in hiring and compensation.

The median pay in 2020 was $57783 and the pay ratio was 256 times Cook's salary.

The iPhone maker has benefited from strong demand over the past two years as consumers working from home splurged on upgrades. Apple's revenue rose more than 30% to $365.82 billion for its fiscal 2021 and its shares briefly crossed $3 trillion in market capitalization this year.

Cook whose salary remained at $3 million received $82.3 million in stock awards $12 million for hitting Apple's targets and $1.4 million for air travel 401(k) plan insurance premiums and others.

In total he earned $98.7 million compared with $14.8 million in 2020.

Cook took the helm in August 2011 after the company's co-founder Steve Jobs stepped down months before his demise. The stock has surged over 1000% since Cook took charge.

In September Cook received 333987 restricted stock units in his first stock grant since 2011 as part of a long-term equity plan. He will be eligible to receive additional units in 2023.

Cook told Fortune magazine in 2015 that he plans to donate his wealth to charity.

CEOs in the United States were paid 351 times more than the typical worker in 2020 a report by the Economic Policy Institute showed while the compensation of top CEOs grew roughly 60% faster than the stock market from 1978 to 2020 eclipsing the slow 18% growth in a typical worker's annual pay.

University of Illinois has a plan,"Unless a coal-fired power plant in southwestern Illinois manages to make dramatic reductions in its carbon emissions it will be forced to close within the next 23 years.

Kevin O'Brien director of the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center at the University of Illinois has been working on designing a plan to capture carbon at Prairie State Energy Campus the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in Illinois according to federal data. In 2020 the plant's stacks sent forth nearly 12 million tons of the heat-trapping gases that contribute to devastating climate change.

The state's new clean energy law the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act requires Prairie State Energy Campus to be 100% carbon-free by the end of 2045. It mandates a 45% reduction by Jan. 1 2035. If the company falls short it must retire one or more units or further reduce emissions by 45% by mid-2038.

The stacks spew water carbon dioxide and nitrogen with carbon dioxide making up about 10 to 12% of emissions.

If Prairie State succeeds it could save hundreds of jobs as Illinois phases out fossil fuel energy over the next 23 years. Employees at Prairie State are banking on it.

Dustin Wathen a manager for both the plant and the surface coal mine at the Prairie State campus says he has to be able to answer three questions for his employees: Do they need to start looking for a job now? How is Prairie State going to try to sustain their jobs? What happens if they might be forced to change jobs?

""What would be most helpful is we keep this plant running"" said Wathen who oversees 20 employees and several contractors.

To produce the Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) study the university partnered with three private companies: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America Inc. Kiewit Corporation and Sargent and Lundy. The effort began in February 2020 and was completed December 31 2021.

Prairie State didn't say if it will put the plan in place but said additional work would be needed if it does.

""Analysis of the results of the FEED study are ongoing and while the FEED study provides many of the necessary elements for advancing carbon capture additional engineering work financial evaluation and state and federal regulatory/legislative initiatives are still necessary"" Prairie State spokeswoman Alyssa Harre said in an email.

Rather than sending the polluting gas up the stacks new technology would pull off the gases and pipe them to a capture facility where the carbon dioxide would be separated from the nitrogen. The nitrogen would be routed back to the stack and emitted while the carbon dioxide would be contained. The current plan O'Brien said is to ""inject it geologically"" and store it underground. It could also potentially be used to grow algae for animal feed soil enhancers or biofuel.

The technology could redirect up to 90 or 95% of the carbon dioxide emissions.

The engineering design will be used at a cement plant in Ste. Genevieve Missouri through a U.S. Department of Energy grant the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. The plant might use a design that turns the gas into liquid which would be injected deep underground below a layer of impenetrable rock.

Watch now: How some Illinois elected officials are venturing into podcasts Every legislative caucus under the Illinois Capitol dome now has some sort of audio presence as they seek to reach constituents through one of the fastest growing digital mediums in the United States.

Underground sequestering has been used at the Archer Daniels Midland ethanol plant in Decatur using millions in federal tax dollars. But the project hadn't met its goals as of late 2020 according to a review by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting. The ADM facility was the second heaviest emitter of carbon dioxide in Illinois in 2020 at about 4.5 million tons.

It's unclear if storing carbon dioxide underground might work at Prairie State or if it will use the university's plan at all. If it did it would become a ""major workforce development"" opportunity O'Brien said.

There's a business incentive for capturing carbon O'Brien said. Tax credits can amount to $50 per ton captured and the value of those credits could increase.

""That financial piece has made it very attractive to retrofit these facilities"" O'Brien said. ""They realize that under the current atmosphere they're really going to need to explore that if they're going to want to remain long term.""

The Department of Energy has also taken an interest in the potential at Prairie State O'Brien said.

A grant from the department helped pay for the $14.7 million engineering design project and Prairie State chipped in $3.75 million.

Prairie State argues its plant already uses technology that makes it one of the most efficient facilities with some of the lowest polluting emissions compared to other plants but it will have to do much more if it wants to remain open under Illinois law. O'Brien says there are ways to make it happen.

""Taking an existing asset and trying to utilize that asset even more is a critical factor in terms of moving forward"" O'Brien said.

Recently she launched her firm that was awarded $3.7 million in funding from the MacArthur Foundation Ford Foundation Kapor Center Open Society Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation.

Her company is an independent artificial intelligence research institute that will concentrate on the harmful outcomes technology has on marginalized groups who encounter inordinate effects from AI structures but lack the access to govern its development as reported by The Washington Post.

In 2020 Google let go of Gebru when she published academic papers denouncing the tech giant’s AI’s work on large language models that help retrieve answers to controversial search inquiries.

Gebru founded Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR) with the intent to “document harms and develop a vision for AI applications that can have a positive impact on the same groups” according to the Post.

“I’ve been frustrated for a long time about the incentive structures that we have in place and how none of them seem to be appropriate for the kind of work I want to do” Gebru said.

Gebru’s DAIR will join forces with smaller independent institutes like Data and Society Algorithmic Justice League and Data for Black Lives. She aims for DAIR to influence AI policies and practices of Big Tech companies like Google. Her expertise will be monumental in leading the charge to alter AI applications especially with facial recognition software that has shown extreme bias against people of color.

In 2019 Gebru notified Google they lacked non-English expertise in technology when detecting malicious online comments. She recalls upper management rejecting her suggestions and claimed there was “sufficient expertise” with international users.

Gebru seeks to assist communities abused by reckless AI practices through DAIR by “experiment with a way to reward pay or acknowledge research subjects.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kYXktcmVsaXZlLWZhbW91cy0ybmQtMjYtMTg1OTQwNDIxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ON THIS DAY: Relive the famous '2nd & 26' national championship-winning play,"ON THIS DAY: Relive the famous ‘2nd & 26’ national championship-winning play

Four years ago on this day in 2018 the Alabama Crimson Tide won the College Football Playoff national championship over the Georgia Bulldogs in Atlanta. The game had a storybook ending full of memorable moments.

None more memorable than the play that ended the game.

At halftime down 13-0 Nick Saban decided to bench starting quarterback Jalen Hurts and put in true freshman Tua Tagovailoa. A comeback ensued.

When the game went into overtime the Bulldogs kicked a field goal. When the Crimson Tide got the ball Tagovailoa took a 16-yard sack. Alabama’s kicking woes were at its peak and it was now second down with 26 yards to go to get the first down.

What happened next is history.

Tagovailoa launched the ball deep into the arms of another true freshman future Heisman-winning wide receiver DeVonta Smith.

Michael Lang the co-creator and organizer of Woodstock has died following a battle with cancer according to a family spokesperson. He was 77.

Lang had been diagnosed with a rare form of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma per a statement obtained by PEOPLE. The famed concert promoter died at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City on Saturday.

In addition to the original Woodstock Music and Art Fair in 1969 Lang helped create and organize follow-up events Woodstock '94 and Woodstock '99.

Lang also attempted to hold Woodstock 50 in 2019 in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first festival but plans for the event did not come to fruition.

Lang grew up in Brooklyn according to Variety and briefly attended New York University before dropping out in 1967 per Deadline. He then ventured to Miami where he cultivated his career as a concert promoter.

Among the first festivals Lang helped organize was the 1968 Miami Pop Festival which featured major artists such as Jimi Hendrix Frank Zappa and John Lee Hooker.

Lang later moved to Woodstock N.Y. where he helped form and execute the idea for one of the most iconic music festivals in history. More than 400000 people reportedly attended the event hosted at a farm in Bethel N.Y. owned by Max Yasgur between Aug. 15 and Aug. 18 in 1969.

The late concert promoter did the same with Woodstock '94 which was held to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the first Woodstock event and the more controversial Woodstock '99.

In 2019 Lang planned to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the original Woodstock festival with a similar event featuring modern artists like Miley Cyrus JAY-Z The Killers The Black Keys and Chance the Rapper in addition to classic Woodstock artists such as Santana and Grateful Dead offshoot Dead & Company featuring John Mayer.

Paris has always been about independence. In an interview with Harper’s Bazaar she said “I’ve always wanted to kind of break off and do my own thing just ’cause I feel I enjoy independence very much.”

Along with that we can’t help but stare at her tattoos. Now the American Horror Story star has at least 50 known tattoos scattered around her body. She has at least nine dedicated to her late father some dedicated to some of her favorite musical artists spiritual tats musical ones and one of our favorites being “Faith Trust and Pixie Dust” — which is a reference to the pet name her father gave her Tinker Bell. She said in an interview with Rolling Stone per People “He’s brought me nothing but joy. So why not have constant reminders of joy?”

And Did This Ending Satisfy You? (Grade It!),"Warning: The following contains spoilers for the series finale of Dexter: New Blood.

Dexter‘s last hour is finally upon us.

More from TVLine

Heading into the series finale Harrison and Dexter are closer than ever before… almost as close as Angela is to tying our boy Dex to Matt Caldwell’s murder. With Kurt officially out of the way it all comes down to Iron Lake’s chief of police. Did Dexter go down for offing Matt? Did Angela actually capture the elusive Bay Harbor Butcher? Let’s dive right into this explosive emotional and jam-packed finale to find out.

Angela listens to Molly’s notes on Iron Lake. “Dark secrets lurk behind Iron Lake” the podcaster says in the recording “and the more I do the deep dive the more I come up with.” (And she doesn’t even know the half of it.) The Chief of Police puts out an official APB for the missing Molly as Dexter walks around the remains of his torched home. He comments on how many “good folks” there are in the town all of whom are helping “Mr. Serial Killer and son.” But he knows if he’s going to teach Harrison the code it can’t be there.

Dexter tells Harrison they’ll likely be moving but the kid is skeptical of leaving his friends so soon. They decide to head somewhere warmer perhaps Los Angeles since a big city will give them plenty of fodder to appease their dark passengers. As they drive away from their former home Angela finds Matt Caldwell’s titanium screw in the rubble.

—

Before dinner Angela sends the kids out for groceries. When Dexter goes in for a hug she pulls a gun on him. The jig is finally up as Logan storms in and cuffs him. Dexter is officially under arrest for Matt’s murder… but not Kurt’s.

Angela begins her questioning and when he’s asked to state his name he says “Jim Lindsay” before copping to being Dexter Morgan. She tells him they never identified the second person in the woods with Matt then pulls out the screw she found which was used to repair the fracture Matt suffered after his boating accident. She also reveals the note she received that points to Dexter as the murderer.

Dexter New Blood Finale Episode 10

She admits it’s possible it could’ve been done in self-defense but she knows Dexter burned the body. Titanium doesn’t melt after all. Dexter tells her Kurt lied about Matt being in New York then stripped the cabin apartment the day after Dexter and Molly were there. Maybe Kurt killed Matt and is framing Dexter for the job as revenge for getting Kurt arrested he offers.

Logan tells Angela that Dexter’s story seems plausible which means it could seem plausible to a jury. He senses she’s not telling him everything but she says she can’t say a thing until she’s positive.

When Harrison finally gets to see Dexter Dad tells him it has nothing to do with Kurt and that Harrison is safe. He’s sure he can get out of it and they’ll be on the road in just a couple days. “We’ll get through this” Dexter tells him. “The world needs us.”

Angela dials Angel Batista and tells him they’ve had some deaths that resemble the victims of the Bay Harbor Butcher. She asks him about Sgt. Doakes. Batista tells her that his ex-wife (the dearly departed Maria LaGuerta) had a theory that it was Dexter Morgan. But according to him Dexter’s long gone. She forwards him a photo of Dex and Angela in happier times. Ang asks if Batista ever caught Maria’s murderer but of course he didn’t. With that Batista says he’s heading her way and bringing all of his files with him.

Angela questions Dexter again. She says he might get away with Matt’s murder but she’ll stake her career and family on the fact that he’s a murderer. She’s got one word for him: ketamine. She shows him a photo of Jasper and says the guy had the drug in his system. Then she shows him photos of the Bay Harbor Butcher’s victims who shared the same wheel marks and ketamine in their systems. She tells him she knows he’s the Butcher. The next day he’ll be arraigned for Matt’s murder which may or may not stick. Then he’ll be reunited with his old pal Batista. He’ll be extradited back to Florida where he’ll stand on trial for the Butcher killings. And Florida’s a state with the death penalty.

Dexter New Blood Finale Episode 10

Dexter asks her to turn off the camera. She obliges. “You were right about Kurt Caldwell” he says. “I can prove it.” He reveals that Kurt had been active for 25 years and gives her the exact location of Kurt’s hatch. Inside is the proof she’s always been searching for.

In his jail cell Dexter is haunted by Debra who says Angela’s never going to let go of this. Dexter asks Logan for some water and when the guy brings it Dex grabs him and smashes his head against the cell bars. He demands the keys but when Logan tries to pull out his gun Dexter snaps his neck. He calls Harrison and tells his son to meet him where they found the white deer. It’s time to go. NOW.

Angela arrives to the cabin and traipses through Kurt’s corridor where all of his trophies are kept. She finds EVERYONE she spent her entire career searching for. She crawls up the hatch to radio Logan only Dexter has Logan’s walkie and car. She then radios Teddy and tells him to get her all of the backup in the goddamn world. When Teddy says he hasn’t heard from Logan in a while Angela KNOWS. She races to the station and finds the poor guy’s dead body outside the now-empty jail cell.

When Dexter meets Harrison in the woods the boy questions whose blood is all over him. Harrison realizes Dex called from Logan’s phone and puts two and two together. “There was no other way” Dexter assures him but Harrison doesn’t take kindly to the news. “It was the only way I could get back to you” Dad says. Harrison however is pissed. His feelings of abandonment rush back to the surface. “I want” Dexter pauses. “I need to be with you.” Harrison says Dexter needs to turn himself in but Dexter replies that he’ll get the death penalty. “Maybe you deserve it” the boy responds.

Dexter New Blood Finale Episode 10

Dexter tells Harrison that he doesn’t have to come but Dexter’s gotta go. As he walks away Harrison pulls out his rifle and aims it directly at his father. He blames Dexter for what happened to his mom and his Aunt Deb. “You’re right” Dex tells the teen. He apologizes for everything he’s done to him. “You deserve better. A better life. A better father.” Then Dexter reminds his son to take the safety off. With tears in his eyes Dexter knows it’s the only way out. He coaches the boy through taking the shot and after a loud POP Dexter collapses and dies in the snow. “You did good” he mutters to the boy as Deb massages his hand.

Angela shows up and screams at Harrison to drop the rifle. Harrison holds his hands out assuming she’s going to cuff him. Instead she gives him cash and tells him to take the truck head to the highway and never come back. She hugs him tightly and sends him on his way.

In the truck Harrison finds a letter that Dexter wrote Hannah telling her that he was alive and that he’d give anything to see them again. The letter continues: He wanted his child to live a life without fear so he could share his gifts with the world. But he knew with him around a normal life for Harrison wouldn’t have been possible. “Unless Harrison shows any dark tendencies I beg you. Let me die so my son can live.”

As a string of police cars blaze toward Iron Lake Harrison drives away.

Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co's robust brokerage segment continues to drive revenue growth.

Strategic acquisitions bolster the company's service offerings and geographic reach.

Global economic volatility and competitive pressures present ongoing challenges.

Technological advancements and ESG initiatives offer pathways for future growth.

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) a leading global insurance brokerage and consulting firm filed its 10-Q on May 1 2024 revealing key financial and operational data. The company's primary revenue streams stem from its brokerage segment with significant contributions from its corporate segment including clean energy investment and other investment income. The United States remains AJG's largest market complemented by substantial operations in Australia Bermuda Canada the Caribbean New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats as presented in the recent SEC filings providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of AJG's market position and potential investment value.

Decoding Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Robust Brokerage Segment: AJG's brokerage segment is a cornerstone of its financial stability consistently generating the majority of the company's revenue. This strength is underpinned by a diverse client base ranging from middle-market entities to individuals and a wide array of insurance products. The segment's success is driven by AJG's ability to negotiate favorable terms with insurance companies reflecting its strong market position and negotiation leverage.

Strategic Acquisitions: AJG has a proven track record of successful acquisitions such as Willis Re Buck and Cadence Insurance which have expanded its service offerings and geographic footprint. These strategic moves not only enhance AJG's revenue streams but also provide cross-selling opportunities and access to new markets contributing to the company's growth and competitive advantage.

Financial Performance: The company's financial health is solid with the latest 10-Q filing indicating a healthy balance sheet. AJG's revenue and net income figures underscore its financial resilience and operational efficiency which are critical in maintaining investor confidence and supporting strategic initiatives.

Weaknesses

Integration Risks: While AJG's acquisition strategy is a strength it also poses integration risks. The assimilation of large acquisitions requires significant resources and management attention and there is always the potential for unforeseen liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or compliance violations. These risks could lead to financial strain and distract from core business operations.

Story continues

Dependence on Economic Conditions: AJG's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Factors such as high inflation increased interest rates and geopolitical instability can impact the insurance industry's risk-taking capacity and client demand for AJG's services. Economic downturns could lead to reduced revenues and pressure on profit margins.

Competition and Market Pressures: The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive with constant pressure from both established players and new entrants. AJG must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share which requires ongoing investment in technology and talent retention.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: AJG has the opportunity to leverage technology data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance client services and internal efficiencies. By investing in technology-based solutions AJG can differentiate itself from competitors and offer value-added services to its clients.

ESG Initiatives: There is a growing emphasis on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world. AJG can capitalize on this trend by integrating ESG considerations into its service offerings and operations potentially attracting clients who prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.

Emerging Markets: AJG can expand its presence in emerging markets where insurance penetration is typically lower and growth prospects are higher. By establishing a foothold in these regions AJG can diversify its revenue base and tap into new client segments.

Threats

Global Economic Volatility: AJG operates in a global environment that is subject to economic and geopolitical volatility. Events such as recessions political unrest or trade wars can disrupt markets and negatively impact AJG's operations and financial performance.

Regulatory Changes: The insurance industry is heavily regulated and changes in laws or enforcement policies can have significant implications for AJG's business model. Compliance with new regulations can be costly and time-consuming potentially affecting profitability.

Cybersecurity Risks: As a company that relies on data and technology AJG is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. A significant data breach or cyber-attack could damage the company's reputation result in financial losses and lead to legal and regulatory consequences.

In conclusion Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) exhibits a strong market position with a robust brokerage segment and a strategic approach to acquisitions. However the company must navigate integration risks economic dependencies and competitive pressures. Opportunities in technology ESG initiatives and emerging markets present avenues for growth while global economic volatility regulatory changes and cybersecurity risks pose significant threats. AJG's forward-looking strategies including leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge and ensuring long-term success.

Cette année à cause des restrictions sanitaires liées à la pandémie de COVID-19 le public n'est pas de la partie mais la grande salle des fêtes de la petite ville du Vaucluse ne manque pas de vie : une dizaine de personnes s'activent entre les trois longues tablées servant de présentoirs aux pâtisseries reines du mois de janvier.

Vainqueur du prix du meilleur gâteau des rois un an plus tôt Frédéric Portigliatti place chaque dessert sur une balance s'assurant qu'ils correspondent au cahier des charges du concours.

Un malencontreux gâteau a déjà été éliminé pour ne pas avoir un poids compris entre 340 et 450 g. Sa farce et sa parure de fruits confits ses airs de couronne n’ont pas suffi à le garder en lice.

Après la pesée le jury constitué d’un professionnel et d’un amateur aux papilles expertes déguste les réalisations des 25 artisans et des 13 apprentis concourant à la 13e édition de l'Épiphanie du Vaucluse organisée par le Groupement des artisans boulangers et pâtissiers.

En France deux grandes écoles s'affrontent selon les régions : la galette de pâte feuilletée fourrée ou non de frangipane et le gâteau des rois provençal brioche garnie de fruits confits.

À Apt même si le concours récompense les deux catégories on donne la préférence à la brioche car en Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur ""on suit la tradition"" certifie Laurent Chaisse un des organisateurs.

Il précise qu'""une bonne brioche est aérée. Elle doit avoir bien levé et donc son jour n’est pas trop apparent. Si les fruits confits ont macéré dans l’alcool c'est un autre monde"".

Frédéric Portigliatti confirme également l’importance de la garniture réalisée souvent avec ""du melon ou des écorces d'orange"".

Cette année les artisans ont innové ""avec de l'angélique (une plante vivace) très locale. L’ananas et le kiwi (confits) sont également tendances en ce moment"" glisse Sylvain Girardeau commercial d’Apt union entreprise spécialiste en fruits confits qui en produit 10.000 tonnes par an.

""Lien social""

Fête chrétienne qui tombe le premier dimanche de janvier l'Épiphanie ou fête des Rois célèbre la visite des Rois Mages à l'enfant Jésus. Ce jour-là on partage la galette à l'intérieur duquel se cache une fève ou une figurine de céramique. Le chanceux qui la trouve devient ""roi"" ou ""reine"".

""On ne mange pas simplement un gâteau"" explique Jean-Pierre Poulain sociologue de l’alimentation au CNRS à propos de l'engouement toujours vivace pour cette pâtisserie ancienne.

""C’est une tradition qui forme un rituel et crée du lien social. Celui qui est roi doit faire un contre-don ce qui conduit à un autre partage. On parle aussi d’insertion au sein d’un groupe avec la main innocente celle du plus jeune qui distribue les parts"" ajoute-t-il.

Raisons pour lesquelles la consommation de gâteaux des rois dans le Vaucluse ne semble pas avoir baissé malgré la hausse de 30% du prix du beurre entre septembre et décembre 2021 selon le Centre national interprofessionnel de l’économie laitière (Cniel).

La saison représente pour certains professionnels ""30% de leur chiffre d’affaires rien que le mois de janvier"" précise Thierry Despeisse président du Groupement professionnel des artisans boulangers pâtissiers du Vaucluse.

Remporter un concours représente un coup de pouce. Le vainqueur de l'édition 2021 Frédéric Portigliatti a ainsi gagné des clients originaires ""des Bouches-du-Rhône mais aussi du Japon"".

Cette année dans la catégorie ""gâteau des rois"" le pâtissier Denis Petit et son apprenti Mathis Vincent de Coustellet dans le Luberon ont remporté le premier prix.

Dans une chronique diffusée à la télévision sur la chaîne Esport3 ce dernier a dévoilé ce qu’il assure être les plus gros salaires du club. Et c’est Gerard Piqué qui tient le haut de la liste assure le journaliste avec un salaire de 28 millions d’euros bruts par an. Il serait suivi de Sergio Busquets 23 millions d’euros et Jordi Alba 20 millions d’euros.

Des chiffres qui ont fait bondir Gerard Piqué lequel a partagé sur Twitter une capture d’écran de son compte en banque. Ce dernier affiche la coquette somme de 23 millions d’euros.

“Ces gens payés par la télévision publique pour défendre leurs amis… Voici 50 % de mon salaire perçu au 30 décembre. Respecte-toi un peu” commente Gerard Piqué visiblement agacé. Selon le calcul du défenseur son salaire s’approcherait donc plutôt des 46 millions d’euros.

Il a d’ailleurs pu compter sur le soutien du FC Barcelone qui a réagi dans un communiqué en démentant les chiffres donnés par Lluis Canut.

“Les montants mentionnés sont erronés et ne sont pas conformes à la réalité. L’information n’a en aucun cas été fournie par le club et son origine est inconnue” précise le club.

Valentino Rossi a maintenant les idées claires et une organisation identifiée dans ses écuries évoluant sous son blason VR46. Il est le propriétaire en titre et les rôles ont été attribués dans toutes les strates d’une aventure qui a son investisseur lui assurant la stabilité : l’enseigne italienne Mooney. Le plus dur reste maintenant à faire et il s’agit de concrétiser sur la piste. En MotoGP on laissera sans doute un peu de temps au temps. Mais en Moto2 Celestino Vietti est d’ores et déjà appelé à prendre ses responsabilités…

Une posture que le désormais patron Valentino Rossi exige presque en ne tarissant pas d’éloges sur son jeune compatriote : « à mon avis c’est un pilote très rapide avec un grand talent ». Mais le Doctor ajoute aussi : « le changement de classe lui a donné plus d’ennuis que je ne l’avais imaginé. Après tout il était l’un des meilleurs pilotes de Moto3. Au début il a eu de gros problèmes mais en fin de la saison il est revenu comme s’il avait appris à contrôler la machine Moto2. Cela a pris du temps mais c’est très fort maintenant ».

Il est exact que le parcours de Vietti a été en dents de scie. À la douzième place finale du Championnat du monde il a non seulement été éclipsé par l’octuple vainqueur de la saison Raul Fernandez mais a également pris du retard sur Ai Ogura au classement des rookies. Avec les positions 4 6 et 4 lors des trois dernières courses Vietti a cependant confirmé sa tendance à la hausse dans le final.

Valentino Rossi : “Vietti a un caractère parfois difficile“

Une progression sur laquelle se base Vale pour pronostiquer ceci sur Speedweek : « je pense qu’il peut se battre pour des victoires au cours de la saison à venir nous l’espérons. Il est très talentueux et vous pouvez le voir lorsque nous nous entraînons ensemble. Il est très fort. Son caractère est parfois un peu difficile mais en termes de talent et de vitesse il est définitivement bon dans ce domaine » a souligné Rossi.

L’équipe de course Mooney VR46 alignera Celestino Vietti 20 ans dans le championnat du monde Moto2 en 2022 aux côtés du nouveau venu Niccolò Antonelli. Côté organisation Luca Brivio a été promu team manager et Roberto Locatelli a été confirmé comme entraîneur des pilotes. Jairo Carriles dirigera l’équipe technique de Vietti et Danilo Angeli sera le chef d’équipe d’Antonelli."

An Israeli official also confirmed the negotiations had stalled and described them as being in “crisis.”

For months the negotiations aimed at achieving a cease-fire and a release of hostages have made little progress but signs the two sides were coming closer to an agreement appeared over the last week. Israel backed off some of its long-held demands and a top Hamas official said the group was studying the latest Israeli offer with a “positive spirit.”

But the setback over the weekend meant Palestinians living in miserable conditions in Gaza would not experience an imminent reprieve and the families of hostages held by militants would have to wait longer for the freedom of their loved ones.

The main obstacle in the talks was the duration of a cease-fire with Hamas demanding it be permanent and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel expressing openness to only a temporary halt in the fighting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3BhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDUvcGVyc29uLWRpZXMtZHVyaW5nLW9oaW8tc3RhdGUtZ3JhZHVhdGlvbi1hZnRlci1mYWxsLWZyb20tc3RhZGl1bS83MzU3OTIyNTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ohio State death during graduation after person falls from stadium,"One person has died after falling from the Ohio Stadium during Ohio State University's graduation ceremony on Sunday.

Warren Buffett walks the floor ahead of the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha Nebraska on May 3 2024. David A. Grogen | CNBC

Warren Buffett spoke candidly to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Saturday about a future when he's no longer there to lead the sprawling conglomerate he built appearing solemn at times as he pondered his advanced age and reflected on his late friend and business partner Charlie Munger. The death of Munger last year brought the question of succession to the forefront of many investors' minds at this year's shareholders meeting. At times Buffett who's about to turn 94 in August seemed to mull over his own mortality even as he said he was feeling fine to continue running the business. He spoke from the dais at Omaha's CHI Health Center where the meeting was held with his lieutenants Greg Abel Berkshire Hathaway Energy chairman and Buffett's heir apparent as well as Ajit Jain vice chairman of insurance operations. ""We'll see how the next management plays the game out at Berkshire [but] fortunately you don't have too long to wait on that"" Buffett said. ""I feel fine but I know a little about actuarial tables.""

""I shouldn't be taking on any four-year employment contracts like several people are doing in this world at an age when you can't be quite that sure where you're going to be in four years"" he added. Berkshire's future The Oracle of Omaha provided more clarity than he'd had in the past on the leadership structure at Berkshire going forward disclosing for example that Abel will have final say when it comes to the conglomerate's investing decisions. ""I would leave the capital allocation to Greg and he understands businesses extremely well"" Buffett said Saturday. ""If you understand businesses you'll understand common stocks.""

Abel in turn reassured investors that the culture at Berkshire will remain the same as well as attract new people going forward. ""I think we have a very special company at Berkshire"" he said adding ""that's not going to change."" Berkshire's architect Munger's absence was felt deeply by many investors at this year's shareholder meeting. The business titan was known for his sharp wit and wisdom and over the decades had drawn uproarious laughter from the crowd with his many humorous asides. Some of those zingers and insights were highlighted in a video tribute at the start of this year's meeting. At the 2015 meeting for example he observed ""Warren if people weren't so often wrong we wouldn't be so rich."" As the lights of the arena came on at the conclusion of the short movie some tens of thousands of investors got to their feet for a standing ovation.

SEATTLE — Starbucks' original store at Pike Place Market in Seattle is closed after it was reportedly vandalized Friday night.

The Seattle Police Department is investigating the vandalism according to Starbucks. The company said the store was closed and all employees and customers were safe.



Cell phone video from Friday night captured some of the damage. In the video you can see the front window of the store vandalized.

Police have not shared the details of the vandalism but a portion of the storefront was boarded up. A handful of firefighters and police officers responded to the incident.

The Seattle Fire Department said a fire is under investigation.



""I came a long way for nothing” David Kikau said. “But it's okay I understand.""

Kikau is visiting from Hawaii. He said he was invested in seeing the iconic Seattle staple.

""In Hawaii we have Starbucks and we hang out there” Kikau said. “Study there we meet there and I bought stocks in it a while ago and I always wanted to see where it started.""



Workers were on-site throughout the weekend telling onlookers the store was closed and didn’t know when it would reopen.

Like many others from out of town Sheila Ordaz made her way to the coffee shop only to find disappointment.



""We actually came to see the original Starbucks and unfortunately it's not open"" said Ordaz who visited from Texas. ""This is Seattle so it's kind of sad I love Starbucks.""

A spokesperson with Starbucks sent KIN 5 a statement regarding the closure and vandalism. Saying in part:

""Fortunately the store was closed and all partners (employees) and customers are safe.

1912 Pike Place is our original store where so much connection and kindness has taken place for more than half a century. We will reopen - for our customers our partners and our community - very soon.""

it’s still unclear what the extent of the damage is. Officials said there was a fire Friday night at the store that is still under investigation.

KING 5 reached out to the Seattle Police Department for more information on the vandalism but has yet to hear back.

The store opened in 1971 and has since become a popular tourist attraction in Seattle.

The Integrated Logistics System – Supply or ILS-S has the answer.



ILS-S is a modern Logistics Information Technology Defense Business System capability that supports Department of the Air Force active-duty Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve operations as well as the other military services and their missions depending on where they are located.



ILS-S is also a financial data feeder system that provides LogIT support in the functional area of Department of the Air Force base-level supply and materiel management.



Its functions include ordering receiving storage distribution tracking disposition and movement of supplies organizational account management weapon system spares support cataloging computing stock levels mobility warranty management financial reporting inventory control point supply point contractor-provided weapon system support aircraft engine and missile maintenance hazardous material management communications security management and mobile technology.



The system is a modern elastic secure U.S. Air Force Cloud One Amazon Web Services GovCloud application with 120 interface agreements with 46 systems to support 18000 end users and over 100000 consumers of ILS-S information at 250 military installations.

ILS-S tracks over 35 million assets valued at $18 billion; assets that are optimally distributed and stored across 1.7 million warehouse locations. ILS-S also provides inventory control of 230000 assets in deployable air transportable containers to support contingencies and special operations.



“We track almost every asset the Department of the Air Force uses” said Staff Sgt. Gabriel Fox a member of the Business and Enterprise Systems (BES) Directorate’s ILS-S Capability Delivery Team (CDT) which is responsible for operating and maintaining ILS-S. “Everything from dog food weapons radar parts vehicles aircraft clothing items and paper.”



ILS-S has multiple modern features and business rules (programming) to track and manage a wide array of DAF assets to include the following:



Automatic Sourcing provides event-based real-time identification of the best enterprise source to satisfy an order ensuring the right decision is made with automated fulfillment.



Excess Redistribution leveraging automatic sourcing infrastructure and realizing over $1 billion in costs avoidance by identifying already purchased DAF assets.



Real-time Enterprise Asset Visibility spanning the retail and wholesale supply chains presenting total asset visibility in a single comprehensive view.



Nuclear Weapons-Related Material enterprise management & asset tracking.



High Priority Orders Management provides infrastructure to ensure mission critical weapons systems remain operational and can be extended to other mission areas.



Mobility Management providing chemical biological radiological and nuclear gear management.



Enterprise Orders Management provides real-time management and visibility across the logistics enterprise.



Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness compliant system with the ability to apply FIAR readiness to additional capabilities.



Proven ability to subsume enterprise systems including high priority order management mobility shelf life and readiness spares for non-airborne assets.



Defense Logistics Management Standards compliant with the ability to transform non-compliant enterprise data into compliant DLMS transactions.



To “Delight the User” and support a diverse and dynamic mission operations tempo ILS-S is available 24x7 365 a year. ILS-S processes over 10 million transactions daily to include over 1.5 million orders.



Scott Hunter the ILS-S senior functional manager said the system is similar to the inventory programs used at auto parts stores. All the stores are connected by the same application and that enables the employees to check inventory and parts compatibility at any store at any time. ILS-S offers the Air Force a similar capability across the Total Force enterprise.



This was all made possible by the efforts of the CDT contractor industry partners and a variety of service providers who worked to transform the ILS-S into a modern open systems standard Java application operating in an elastic secure cloud environment said James Harbison lead engineer for the ILS-S CDT. The system has also saved money and will continue to do so.

“We reduced our annual infrastructure hosting costs $25 million annually and in FY 2022 we’ll drive down infrastructure costs even further by employing reserved instances in our cloud environment” said Hunter.



To successfully operate innovate and integrate in a cloud environment the ILS-S CDT it’s industry partners and BES service provider teammates have leveraged multiple modern computing and software development concepts to include the following:



Agile and a responsive and ever-improving delivery model emphasizing warfighter collaboration to deliver monthly production releases to support business needs.



Development Security Operations pipeline with security scanning automated infrastructure provisioning and patching and monitoring.



Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery pipeline with the ability to deploy from development through production in a fully automated fashion in less than one hour integrating multiple active development and test baselines.



Open source makes up the majority of the ILS-S code base reducing the total cost of ownership and by using industry leading Spring and Apache products enhances both stability while minimizing learning curves for new developers.



Mobile cross platform solution using Progressive Web Application (PWA) technology and a native tablet presence supporting robust mobile application delivery.



Enterprise connectivity provides military network interoperability enabling over 46 systems to connect with ILS-S across a wide array of protocols minimizing external system integration efforts.



Proven modernization methodology using a “wrap and adapt” model minimizing risk during modernization by decoupling end user and system interfaces from the effort of modernizing the legacy system.



Automated Testing with over 17000 automated functional end-to-end tests using a framework that enables non-technical personnel to develop robust tests.



“ILS-S has been blessed with exceptional contractor industry partnerships that enabled us to leverage modern software lifecycle concepts and tools that in the hands of our high-performing contractor development and functional supply subject matter expert teams really changed how we operate” said Jerard Campbell ILS-S Acquisitions and Operations Capability delivery manager. “Our release velocity is high. We recently successfully delivered our 42 consecutive monthly release 22 of those while we’ve been in a COVID-19 induced 100% work-from-home environment but just as important we’ve demonstrated the ability to ‘pivot’ as higher priority customer requirements change. We want more of the goodness agility and flexibility can offer in our future support contracts.”



The present success of ILS-S is only the beginning.



“Our goal as a digital Air and Space Force is to continuously innovate not only ILS-S but all of our enterprise logistics systems by adopting new technologies that will amplify our mission readiness while driving down operational costs” said Herbert H. Hunter Jr. Business and Enterprise Systems Directorate’s Enterprise Logistics Readiness portfolio manager.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8va3Rhci5jb20vc3RvcnkvNDgzMjY4MC9oZXJlLWFyZS10aXBzLWZvci1zd2l0Y2hpbmcteW91ci1lbWFpbC1mcm9tLWNveC10by1nbWFpbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here are tips for switching your email from Cox to Gmail,"Q: I’m trying to switch from a Cox email address that always seems to have some sort of issue to a Gmail account and need help figuring out how to get all my contacts to make the change on their end too.

A: It’s been obvious for a couple of years that Cox isn’t really interested in being an email service provider which has led to lots of service related issues and complaints.

Changing an email address can be as disruptive if not more so than changing your personal phone number but in this case it’s to your benefit in the long run.

Not only do you need to update all of your online accounts with your new email address you have to go through the lengthy process of making sure that your contacts know that you have changed addresses as well.

Time Limits If You Cancel

As long as you aren’t disconnecting your Internet service your cox email address will continue to work which is important.

If you are trying to cancel your service with Cox you will lose your email account after their 90-day grace period so planning your switch becomes much more critical.

The best case scenario is to keep your Cox email account as long as possible so you can periodically check to see if important messages are still being sent to your old address or to remind you to update important online accounts with your new email address.

Setup Auto Forwarding

There are a couple of ways to start getting your Cox email messages in Gmail but I’d recommend that you use the ‘Auto Forward’ option via the Cox interface instead of setting Gmail to check your Cox account as that seems to be one of the problematic issues we see.

To set this up sign into your Cox email account via their webmail interface and click on the gear icon in the upper right corner and choose ‘Settings’.

Look for the ‘Inbox’ menu and click on the arrow to the left to open the options that include ‘Auto Forward’.

Click the ‘Enable’ box and type your new Gmail address into the box below.

If you click on the option to ‘Keep a copy of the message’ every message that gets forwarded to Gmail will also remain in your Cox email account.

This can be a helpful fallback but it will also mean that you need to periodically go back to the webmail interface to get rid of old messages to keep it from becoming full.

Update Your Signature

If you use Cox to auto forward your messages whenever you reply via your Gmail account the recipient will see that it’s coming from the new Gmail address.

Many email systems are setup to automatically add an address whenever the user replies to a message which can help get your new address into your contact’s address books.

Another way is to alert all your contacts of the change is by updating your signature in Gmail with a request such as “Please replace my XXXX@cox.net with my new XXXX@Gmail.com address in your address book”.

If you decide to send a mass email announcement out to a large number of contacts make sure you put all of the addresses in the BCC section to avoid exposing everyone’s email addresses to each other.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdpbmRvd3NjbHViLmNvbS9ob3ctdG8tYmF0Y2gtZWRpdC1leGlmLWRhdGEtb2YtaW1hZ2VzLWluLXdpbmRvd3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Batch Edit EXIF Metadata of Images with Batch EXIF Editor software for Windows 11/10,"This article talks about how you can batch edit EXIF metadata of images using Batch EXIF Editor software on Windows 11/10.

Labels get a lot of attention for how they look. However oftentimes they’re more than just a pretty face. When labels and packaging provide functionality – or incorporate an exchange of data – they are considered “smart.”



Used as an umbrella term for packaging that uses technology to transcend product identification and decoration smart labels include those that utilize RFID NFC QR codes or other applications that can transmit information. End-uses for smart labels run the gamut and to name just a few brand owners are finding success in improving food and pharmaceutical safety logistics accuracy and enhancing a brand’s story.



Smart labels are a growing segment of the industry. In 2020 the global smart labels market size was $8085.8 million and it is expected to reach $22850 million by the end of 2027 with a CAGR of 16.0% from 2021-to 2027 according to Valuates Reports a market research firm.



Factors driving the growth of the smart labels market include benefits such as the need to reduce food wastage through tracking the quantity of each product enhanced food safety by tracking movement throughout the supply chain and the need to prevent counterfeit foods. All are expected to continue to drive the growth of the smart labels market the firm reports.



With regard to reducing food waste and improving food safety these labels can trace the freshness of the product and then make this information visible to customers and suppliers. As a result steps can be taken throughout the supply chain to prevent wastage.



Smart labels are also playing a vital role in the marketing and advertising of consumer products. This in turn is expected to further fuel market growth Valuates Reports says. These labels add a functional element to packaging by providing a unique digital identity for everyday products that can be used to connect supply chains optimize inventory and create a unique consumer experience.



“The use of smart labels on food packaging is becoming increasingly popular among manufacturers” according to Valuates Reports. “A growing market trend is customers’ growing interest in the ethical credentials and health benefits of food and beverages. With the increased information capacity of smart labels more data about the health and ethics of food and beverages can be presented.”



Valuates Reports shares additional information regarding smart label market projections: Based on type the RFID segment is expected to be the most lucrative while based on application the retail segment is expected to be the most lucrative. The retail industry uses RFID technology and it now accounts for the highest number of smart label and tag volume.



Based on region Asia Pacific is expected to be the most profitable due to an increase in potential startups an increase in disposable income an increase in urbanization and industrialization and overall growth in the retail and health and pharmaceutical industries.

Getting smart with UPM Raflatac L&NW caught up with Scott Conrad senior product manager UPM Raflatac Americas to discuss smart labels their role in the narrow web market and their outlook for the future.



L&NW: What makes a label “smart” and what are the benefits of smart labels?

Scott Conrad (SC): To me smart labels are any label that offers functionality to the packaging outside of normal branding or informational labeling. This could be anything from a label displaying a QR code a tamper-evident security label to peel-reseal functionality. Benefits of smart labeling will vary based on which type of smart label you encounter. For example a QR code could be used to provide a link to additional nutritional or sustainability information regarding a food product to the consumer. An intact tamper-evident label would let that same customer know that no one has tampered with their food item between the production facility and their table. Both of these functions – in their own way – lead to higher brand impact and customer satisfaction.



L&NW: Are there any notable trends in the smart labeling space? What types of smart labels are experiencing growth?

SC: A big growth area of smart labeling is with food safety and sustainability. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic consumers are more aware than ever of the impact food safety plays in the health and well-being of their family. Consumers want to know the food they are consuming has not been tampered with from the time it left the restaurant or packaging facility until it reaches their table.

Something as simple as a tamper-evident closure seal on food packaging goes a long way to making customers satisfied in these cases. Consumers are also becoming more and more concerned with sustainability. QR codes linked to sustainable sourcing and food production information are increasingly popular with brands. QR codes are a great way for companies to document carbon footprint data of their packaging and product. This information is becoming important to a new generation of consumers.



L&NW: What are some end-use markets that are a good fit for smart labels? Are there certain smart label end-use applications gaining popularity?

SC: Food packaging is one of the largest end-use segments for smart labels within the UPM Raflatac portfolio. QR codes on various labels are becoming more and more common.



L&NW: What does the future hold for smart labels?

SC: I believe we will continue to see the adoption of smart labeling throughout the packaging industry and most notably the food industry. The biggest area for growth will be in the tamper-evident and security space.

The Covid-19 pandemic saw a huge growth in utilization of third-party restaurant delivery services. While restaurants are back open delivery services continue to see a much higher utilization rate than they did before the pandemic. More and more consumers are starting to see pressure sensitive labels on the outside of the bag box or container of delivered food. These closure tabs add dual functionality that benefits the restaurants delivery drivers and most importantly the consumers. The labels not only seal the bag but also offer a sense of security to the consumer knowing their food has not been touched since it left the restaurant.

Brand security is also a very bright spot for the future of smart labeling. More than ever we are seeing the consumer goods market flooded with knock-offs and replicas. A label containing a hologram or other security features is a great way for brands to protect their goods and give customers a sense of security knowing they purchased a genuine product.

Schreiner MediPharm’s enhanced Smart Blister Wallet Schreiner MediPharm the Germany-based developer of innovative functional labels for the healthcare industry recently launched an enhanced version of its Smart Blister Wallet which allows pharmaceutical manufacturers to automatically track clinical trial compliance. The solution is now available with up to 64 cavities – double the previous maximum.



Compliance with prescribed medications is crucial for the success of a therapy – especially in the case of clinical trials. Digital tools such as Medication Adherence Monitoring allow pharmaceutical manufacturers to track compliance of their trial participants automatically. With its original 32-cavity Smart Blister Wallet Schreiner MediPharm provided innovative digital support. Now the series has been enhanced to include a 64-cavity version whose doses like its predecessor can be individually tracked.



The Smart Blister Wallet can be implemented for all blister designs as well as for two- or multiple-fold blisters. This prolongs the period of time during which the wallet can be used and enables extended integration of several dosage strengths. Schreiner MediPharm supplies the cardboard box including the integrated conductive tracks and printed circuit board to the pharmaceutical manufacturer or contract manufacturing organization (CMO) which can process the smart packaging as it would a typical blister package.



For patients and healthcare professionals the extendable version of the Smart Blister Wallet is as convenient to use as its 32-cavity counterpart affording easy push-through removal of tablets and simple NFC-based data reading at a single point on the wallet regardless of the number of blister cards it contains.



The benefits for clinical research are obvious. For instance the digital Smart Blister Wallet delivers enhanced and more reliable data quality reduces trial failure rates due to non-adherence helps reduce trial periods and costs and accelerates approval and time to market for new drugs. The smart wallets also enable more efficient processes by eliminating manual tasks such as by-hand documentation and pill counting.

Smart Security Covectra a specialist in track-and-trace solutions was recently issued US Patent Number 11295126 by the United States patent Office (USPTO) for its StellaGuard security labeling device. StellaGuard is both a smart label as well as a security label that offers a dual layer of protection – both overt and covert technology – in a single label.



According to Covectra StellaGuard is the only security device in the market that enables the consumer direct access to confirm authenticity of a product either at the point of purchase or prior to purchase.

“StellaGuard is a game-changer for brands looking for a highly secure anti-counterfeiting technology to serialize products” explains Ron Ducharme vice president at Covectra. “Unlike current technologies StellaGuard is singular in nature – each security labeling device is uniquely protected. Counterfeiters count on static images that continuously repeat which are easy to reproduce. Each StellaGuard label has a non-reproducible film that combines both a covert feature of holographic “stars” that create a random non-repeatable three-dimensional pattern as well as an overt feature of a randomly serialized QR code. A simple scanning of the QR code by the consumer using the StellaGuard mobile app can immediately authenticate the product.”

Dual-Frequency RFID Inlay Avery Dennison has launched another addition to its expanding dual-frequency (DF) range of RFID inlays which provides combined NFC (HF) and RAIN RFID (UHF) functionality for cost-effective item-level tagging in a slimmed-down form factor.



The new AD Slim DF EM4425 tag is designed for logistics medical and industrial use cases while also offering customer engagement features. Based on Avery Dennison’s successful Dual Frequency product line the inlay combines excellent performance with a unique dual-frequency capability. Operating in both HF and UHF RFID frequency ranges it delivers significant cost advantages compared to using two separate single-frequency inlays.



Dual-frequency provides shared memory functionality which allows both UHF and HF protocols to update product information in real time. This enables all-in-one solutions for inventory management and product authentication allowing for a consistent customer experience regardless of channel.



Customers can use the inlay’s RAIN RFID technology to establish a cost-effective inventory and supply chain management system. The extended read ranges of UHF enable opportunities in warehouse management tracking valuable goods and returnable transport item use cases. In tandem the NFC technology powered by atma.io from Avery Dennison’s connected product cloud can be utilized for further product information inspection validation or providing end user-facing information such as user manuals assembly instructions CO2 footprint details Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) instructions and more.



The combination of the AD Slim DF inlay with atma.io can help customers combat product counterfeits and protect brand equity by enabling different stakeholders in the supply chain to authenticate products along the journey. Additionally end users can easily and securely authenticate products post-purchase to support returns and re-commerce by simply tapping their NFC enabled smartphones on the product with the AD Slim DF inlay.



“AD Slim meets the needs for a wide range of medical and industrial item-level use cases. Our latest dual frequency inlays are highly cost-efficient unlocking RFID value for inventory management applications while enabling brands to combat counterfeits and deliver specific consumer experiences. Powered by atma.io companies can benefit from complete visibility of their items from source to consumer and beyond” says Max Winograd VP connected products at Avery Dennison Smartrac.



The AD Slim DF EM4425 tag has a compact form factor (2.921"" x 0.421"") which can be easily converted into end-application usage and is available in wet delivery format.



This inlay comes with EM Microelectronic’s echo-V IC which is equipped with 2048 bits of fully shared user memory accessible via both UHF RFID and HF frequencies enabling the use of widely available readers (NFC-enabled smartphones) as supplements to dedicated UHF RFID or HF reader infrastructures.



“The AD Slim DF is an ideal option for deploying the unique benefits of our em|echo-V combined RAIN RFID – NFC chips enabling a complete integration of the end-user experience with the supply chain” states Pierre Muller RFID BU leader at EM Microelectronic. “We are excited about the cooperation with Avery Dennison building on our decades-long partnership to drive market innovation.” The majority of Avery Dennison Smartrac inlays are compliant with ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management and ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management which ensure a reliable and RFID product.",,,,,,,,,,,,

New Delhi: Oil prices settled lower on Friday as the market weighed supply concerns from the unrest in Kazakhstan and outages in Libya against a U.S. jobs report that missed expectations and its potential impact on Federal Reserve policy.Brent crude settled down 24 cents or 0.3% to $81.75 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 56 cents or 0.7% at $78.90 a barrel.Brent and WTI were on track for gains of about 5% in the first week of the year with prices at their highest since late November spurred on by the supply concerns.""Employment data injected a question mark into where we are going from here and Omicron fears have crept back into the market"" said John Kilduff a partner at Again Capital Management.In Kazakhstan's main city Almaty security forces appeared to be in control of the streets and the president said constitutional order had mostly been restored a day after Russia sent troops to put down an uprising.The protests began in Kazakhstan's oil-rich western regions after state price caps on butane and propane were removed on New Year's Day.Production at Kazakhstan's top oilfield Tengiz was reduced on Thursday its operator Chevron Corp said as some contractors disrupted train lines in support of protests taking place across the central Asian country.Production in Libya has dropped to 729000 barrels per day from a high of 1.3 million bpd last year partly due to pipeline maintenance work.A barrel of oil for delivery in March was selling at a discount of as much as 70 cents to a barrel for delivery in February the highest since November.Both benchmarks were up $1 earlier in the session but oil along with stock markets and the dollar came under pressure after U.S. employment figures missed expectations.U.S. employment in the country increased less than expected in December amid worker shortages and job gains could remain moderate in the near term as spiralling COVID-19 infections disrupt economic activity.Meanwhile supply additions from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  Russia and allies - together called OPEC+ - are not keeping up with demand growth. OPEC 's output in December rose by 70000 bpd from the previous month versus the 253000 bpd increase allowed under the OPEC+ supply deal which restored output slashed in 2020 when demand collapsed under COVID-19 lockdowns.Government data this week also showed that crude inventories in the United States the world's top consumer have fallen for six consecutive weeks by the end of the year to their lowest since September.Extreme frigid weather in North Dakota and Alberta is also expected to hurt production in the region and led operators to shut the 590000 bpd Keystone Pipeline for a short period of time earlier in the week.U.S. oil rigs rose one to 481 this week their highest since April 2020 energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said in its closely followed report.While the Omicron coronavirus variant is rapidly taking hold demand-side concerns are easing amid rising evidence that it is less severe than previous variants.""The concerns about a massive slump in oil demand have faded now that it has become clear that Omicron leads to milder forms of the disease than previous variants of the virus meaning that massive mobility restrictions are not likely"" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.",,,,,,,,,

Here's what we know about these idols.

BTS’ fate was to be the biggest boy band in the world. In 7Fates: CHAKHO created by HYBE Suga appears as a producer while Jungkook appears as the main vocalist. Here’s what we know about this webtoon and Jungkook and Suga’s highly-anticipated collaboration.

BTS-themed webtoon ‘7Fates: CHAKHO’ features production by Suga and vocals by Jungkook

Suga is the mastermind behind songs like “Interlude: Shadow” and “Trivia: Seesaw” also performing on well-known tracks like “Butter” alongside RM Jin J-Hope V Jimin and Jungkook. Outside of his work as BTS’ rapper and a solo artist Suga produces music for BTS and other musicians.

Even during an interview with Jimmy Fallon the rapper shared even if he wasn’t in BTS he would probably still be a songwriter or producer. During an interview with GQ Suga was asked which part of himself is the most important — “Suga” of BTS solo artist “Agust D” and commercial producer “BY SUGA.”

“All three are me” Suga said. “They each take up a third of myself and one isn’t more reflective of me than another. I simply give people a choice. These three sides of myself are incredibly different so I’m giving people a choice to see me as they want.”

It makes sense that when HYBE Corporation (formerly BigHit Entertainment) created a webtoon series 7Fates: CHAKHO the soundtrack was produced by Suga and performed by Jungkook.

Suga and Jungkook collaborated on songs by BTS

ARMYs first saw these idols collaborating during season 2 of BTS In The Soop. Although it wasn’t clear at the time fans now assume that they were creating 7FATES’ music. However this wouldn’t be the first time Suga and Jungkook collaborated.

According to BTS Fandom Suga and Jungkook functioned as songwriters for BTS’ song “Magic Shop.” They both wrote and performed the Be (Deluxe Edition) tracks “Skit” and “Telepathy.”

Of course both Jungkook and Suga appeared as dancers for songs like “Boy With Luv” “Permission to Dance” “Black Swan” and “On.” RM and J-Hope also function as two songwriters for the K-pop group.

What is ‘7Fates: CHAKHO’ about?

According to Pinkvilla 7Fates: CHAKHO is an “urban fantasy story inspired by the Joseon Dynasty’s tiger-hunting officers called chakhogapsa.” It features seven characters set to rid their community of “monsters.”

Suga and Jungkook’s collaboration for 7Fates wouldn’t be the first time a BTS member worked on a series soundtrack as V’s “Christmas Tree” was included in the “Original Television Soundtrack” for Our Beloved Summer.

BTS sub-units collaborated on the BTS World Soundtrack released with their mobile game. A cover of “Dynamite” appeared in the Netflix original series Emily In Paris. “Friends” by V and Jimin was included in Marvel’s Eternals.

The 7Fates: CHAKHO soundtrack is expected to debut on most major music streaming platforms. 7Fates: CHAKHO premieres on Jan. 15 2022 and will be available via Webtoon.com.",,,,,,

It came in the form of Proton (XPR) a blockchain cryptocurrency token.

Congress chartered the First Bank in 1791. Located on 3rd Street within Philadelphia’s Independence National Historical Park the corporation was dissolved when its charter expired in 1811.

However the building constructed in 1796 remains. Now the Independence Historical Trust is hoping to give the First Bank renewed purpose.

The Independence Historical Trust is a nonprofit dating back nearly 50 years. As official philanthropic partner of the Independence National Historical Park its original mission was to prepare for the nation’s bicentennial.

These days the Trust’s mission is to raise money for projects supporting educational services within the Independence National Historical Park. To that end Trust Executive Director Thomas Caramanico said the goal is to reopen the building as a museum.

“The bank is a beautiful picturesque building. But it’s in need of repair and it’s underutilized” said Caramanico. The Trust began fundraising for the restoration in 2017.

The biggest windfall from individuals came through benefactors Denise Foderaro and Frank Quattrone. They offered a $1 million challenge grant.

Using these funds and others the Trust has already hired architects and planners to refurbish the First Bank. The plan is to begin construction in 2023 and finish by 2026 for America’s 250th birthday.

But the most unusual donation came from Metallicus Inc. a firm focused on the crypto industry. Caramanico called it “a proposal so revolutionary that we think Alexander Hamilton himself would approve.”

“This is the first gift of its kind to our organization and it seems fitting that we would be receiving it for the First Bank project” said Caramanico. “It’s a wonderful example of the new technology the new financial system supporting the history of the original financial system.”

Based in San Francisco Metallicus offers an app called Metal Pay for trading cryptocurrency. CEO and Co-Founder Marshall Hayner transferred the funds on the First Bank’s front steps using his smartphone.

“We feel a little bit like those founding fathers of finance working to create the next generation of banking — a new system based on blockchain technology and the evolving ways in which we see send and use money” said Hayner. “We are honored to contribute to the preservation of the First Bank of the United States as a token of what banking means to the free world.”

“We feel a little bit like those founding fathers of finance working to create the next generation of banking — a new system based on blockchain technology and the evolving ways in which we see send and use money.”

Connecting the First Bank and Metallicus is Lee Woolley. He serves as Vice Chairman for the Independence Historical Trust and is a senior executive at Metallicus.

Cynthia MacLeod Superintendent of the Independence National Historical Park thanked Hayner and Woolley for their work in facilitating the crypto contribution.

“The donation the trust will accept this morning will enable the project to move closer to our goal and we are so close” said MacLeod. “People who have marveled at the stunning exterior of this building can also be amazed by its magnificent interior and learn about the financial foundation of our country.”

Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) attended the transfer as a guest speaker and noted the donation has “terrific symbolism.” For Toomey the contribution serves as an example of how the country’s understanding of money has changed over time.

“And so here we have in the form of a cryptocurrency donation to this almost ancient bank a real meaningful contribution to our country’s history” said Toomey “but also a symbolic reminder of the evolution of money in our society — an evolution that is going to continue and that the federal government is going to have to figure out how to come to terms with as technology never rests.”

If your mother enjoys the outdoors and appreciates the delicate beauty of birds what better gift is there than a bird bath? More specifically a solar-powered bird bath fountain. It only needs a little bit of sun exposure before it begins blasting water into the air giving all of your flying friends a chance to wash off that sky dust.

(For even more ideas check out our roundups of the best Mother's Day gifts for every budget and the best last-minute Mother's Day gifts to shop now.)

Why is this a good deal? 💰

At over 30% off this matches the best price we've seen this year. It's also one of the most affordable options on all of Amazon with most other fountains starting at $17 and going up from there.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Running water makes for an attractive feature in any space and this fountain pump will spray water high into the air using nothing but solar power. You don't need to plug it in anywhere; just place it in the bird bath and after about three seconds it will begin spraying water. It doesn't store energy so it may be somewhat less effective on cloudy days.

There are also six different nozzles that you can swap out for different water patterns so you can mix things up from time to time. If you keep it in the middle of a properly-sized bird bath you won't lose a lot of water over the sides. It will minimize the amount of refilling you have to do. That said you should clean it every so often to prevent the pump lines from clogging — the company suggests doing so at least once a week.

Splish splash they were takin' a bath! Mom will enjoy the feathered fun this bird bath will bring to her garden. (Amazon)

What reviewers say 💬

With over 7900 five-star reviews a lot of fans have added this touch of whimsy to their birdbath.

Pros 👍

Despite concerns over sun exposure fans say this fountain works well even with indirect light. ""I have a bird bath with a shallow basin and only 1/2 day of direct sunlight. My concern was that I did not want to have stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes. This solar fountain pump works great. It even works at lower capacity using only reflected light when the bird bath is in a shadowy part of the day.""

Another bird-watcher said ""This little thing is beautiful. It aerates the water and the birds love it.""

It isn't limited just to bird baths either. ""I bought it for my neighbor's koi pond but he put it in his pool. It sprays water about 3 feet in the air. He loves it.""

Cons 👎

One fan said it can be a little noisy. ""I love them! I have one in my front and back garden. Only downside is they make a sputtering noise when they’re not in full sun.""

Another shopper warned that it might actually be too powerful. ""I found that they have too much power for my small birdbath. I put a half-inch square of electrical tape over one of the solar collectors and wait and watch. If the spray is too strong I put another piece on. it usually takes three pieces.""

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLnVzbmV3cy5jb20vd2VsbG5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZG8taWNlLWJhdGhzLXdvcmstZm9yLXJlY292ZXJ50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Do Ice Baths Work for Recovery? | U.S.,"Getty Images

You’ve probably seen athletes or other fitness trendsetters on social media taking an ice bath or tried one yourself to reap the benefits of the potential health benefits including faster recovery increased metabolism and reduced stress.

“People want to try (an ice bath) usually for three reasons: the physical benefits the mental benefits or because it’s trendy and they want to know what the hype is about” says Alex Corbett a physical therapist with BreakThrough Physical Therapy with locations throughout North Carolina.

But is that bone-chilling dip worth the purported benefits?



Key Takeaways:

Ice baths also called cold water immersion involve plunging part or most of your body into cold icy water.

Studies have shown that ice baths have the potential to increase fat loss reduce inflammation improve mood and speed recovery.

Cold water immersion isn’t for everybody and it is possible to experience frostbite or hypothermia if your water is too cold or you stay in for too long.

What Is an Ice Bath?

An ice bath is a planned exposure to cold water. It can be water made cold by ice or it can be water in lakes or oceans that’s seasonally cold. In the latter example it may be called a cold plunge. Some people even partake in charity cold plunges or ring in the new year with an icy cold shock.

An ice bath temperature is typically below 60 degrees Fahrenheit and often ranges from 50 to 59 degrees. Sometimes people may want their ice bath temperature to be even lower.

Ice baths are different from cryotherapy which involve exposure to very cold air (typically -220 to -240 degrees). However cryotherapy doesn't involve any submersion in water.



Ice Bath Benefits

Fans of ice baths claim that they have several potential benefits including:



Quicker recovery after intense exercise and reduced muscle soreness.

Fat burning by stimulating the body’s production of brown fat

Improved circulation

Improved mood focus and stress relief

Reduced inflammation and pain

A 2023 analysis of 20 studies published in Frontiers of Physiology concluded that cold water immersion performed immediately after exercise could help lower muscle soreness and speed up fatigue recovery. However despite their initial benefits for muscle recovery some research has found that ice baths can actually reduce muscle strength and growth over time Corbett says.

While an ice bath can increase your metabolism and help with fat burning you’re not likely to see overnight benefits with just one ice bath session. Studies have noted that while researchers have seen decreases in body fat in people who take cold plunges much more research is needed to recommend ice baths for weight loss.

Beyond physical health benefits ice baths can also give your mental wellness a boost.

“Ice baths make people feel refreshed and invigorated leading to a sense of overall well-being” says Dr. Yoshua Quinones a board-certified internist with the Medical Offices of Manhattan in New York and a contributor to the website Lab Finder.



Dangers of Ice Baths

Before you take the plunge it's important to first consider some of the potential dangers of ice baths.

These include:



Frostbite. This is more of a risk if you stay in an ice bath for too long.

This is more of a risk if you stay in an ice bath for too long. Hypothermia. This occurs when the body loses heat faster than it can create heat and can cause confusion shivering and – in severe cases – organ failure.

This occurs when the body loses heat faster than it can create heat and can cause confusion shivering and – in severe cases – organ failure. Cold shock. Sudden immersion in cold water can cause increased blood pressure heart rate and breathing which increases the risk of drowning. This is due to blood vessels contracting when your body is exposed to cold. People who have cardiovascular issues are at higher risk for experiencing this type of response to cold.

Because of the potential dangers of hypothermia or cold shock make sure there's someone else keeping an eye on you while you plunge into the cold no matter how experienced you are with cold temperatures.



Who Shouldn’t Take an Ice Bath

For most healthy people it’s OK to try an ice bath. However you’ll want to avoid an ice bath or check first with a health care provider if you have:



An open wound or infection. An ice bath could slow healing.

An ice bath could slow healing. Cardiovascular disease . Immersing yourself in cold water will likely raise your blood pressure and heart rate.

Immersing yourself in cold water will likely raise your blood pressure and heart rate. Peripheral neuropathy. A type of nerve damage that may cause tingling and numbness this condition is often associated with diabetes.

A type of nerve damage that may cause tingling and numbness this condition is often associated with diabetes. Raynaud’s disease. An ice bath could make your condition worse.

An ice bath could make your condition worse. Respiratory issues. Cold water immersion may cause breathing problems.

Cold water immersion may cause breathing problems. Uncontrolled high blood pressure. Increased blood pressure can occur during an ice bath.

You should also check with a healthcare provider or avoid ice baths if you are pregnant or hypersensitive to cold.

Ice Bath Tips

If you’re ready to take the plunge with an ice bath keep these tips in mind:



Plan to have someone with you or someone nearby who can help in case you need help during the ice bath.

Start gradually as you would with an exercise routine. Don’t go too cold or for too long during your first time.

Aim for water that’s uncomfortably cold but still feels safe.

Less is more. A few minutes is good but more than 30 minutes is too long.

Listen to your body. Exit if you feel dizzy or uncomfortable.

Plan to warm yourself up gradually after exiting an ice bath.

Don’t take any medication that might impair you before an ice bath.

Stay hydrated after an ice bath.

Additionally consider when is the best time to do an ice bath and how often you'll incorporate it into your routine.

“If you’re using it for muscle soreness then doing an ice bath after exercise is the optimal timing. Ten minutes post-exercise may help with delayed onset muscle soreness” says Dr. Justin Mullner a primary care sports medicine physician for adults and children with Orlando Health Jewett Orthopedic Institute in Orlando Florida.

For general mental health benefits like mood and focus you can do an ice bath three to four minutes at a time a couple of times a week for its benefits he adds.

Ice Bath Alternatives

If you want the benefits of an ice bath but can’t fathom immersing yourself in that frigid water you still may be able to obtain some of the same benefits in other ways:

The post has received more than 30000 likes. (Mainichi/Naoya Sugio)

TOKYO -- On April 28 an X (formerly Twitter) user wrote a post declaring ""I really don't like to take baths"" and went on to introduce dry shampoos as an alternative. The post garnered over 30000 likes and was soon being quoted with the tag phrase ""bath cancellation community."" The phrase spread so quickly that it appeared on X's trending topics list.

While many users joined in with products and tips to help avoid taking a bath others took to the platform to condemn them with posts including ""This is just filthy"" and ""The smell will be so bad it'll bother other people.""

Then on about April 30 a new tag phrase began to appear in quotes and reposts: ""depression bath cancellation community."" Some users noticed that in the original wave of posts people who just didn't like baths were being lumped in with people who couldn't bathe because of depression and began to speak out: ""It's not about hating baths or dirtiness"" and ""It's really a shame that the phrase (bath cancellation community) spread without the word 'depression' in it.""

That started a new online back and forth with some saying things like ""Don't be a baby"" and ""At the very least get in the bath every day."" On the other side people with experience with depression posted messages like ""People with mental illness can't take a bath or do housework or anything else. People should have enough imagination to think about why (some people) can't get in the bath.""

A survey by the nonprofit group Community Mental Health and Welfare Bonding Organization of people with mental health issues showed that half of the 190 respondents found it ""very difficult to take a bath."" The answer topped the list of daily life problems connected to mental illness beating ""I can't tidy up"" (44%) and ""I have a weak bladder"" (43%).

Organization chief Ken Utagawa himself has a condition called schizoaffective disorder meaning he has symptoms of schizophrenia plus mood disorders and depression. He told the Mainichi Shimbun ""The first thing that people who get depression have trouble with is bathing. Anyone who's experienced (depression) has felt this. I understood (from the recent social media furor) that basically not many people know this and I was shocked.""

Utagawa himself said he spent about a year without the will to take a bath with the longest period without bathing stretching to two weeks. ""During the really painful times all I wanted to do was sleep. Of course I didn't want to eat and even going to the bathroom was hard. Taking baths was just not high on the priority list for staying alive.""

People with mental illness were being talked about online in the same breath as those who just didn't like to take baths or felt bathing was too much fuss. Utagawa reflected ""I've always liked baths. During normal periods I have never once thought that getting in the tub was too much trouble. But being unable to summon the energy for basic everyday tasks -- that's depression. I want people to stop making fun of others by just focusing on baths.""

According to psychiatrist Yuichiro Kasuga head of the Fuchu Kokoro clinic in Fuchu Tokyo when depression causes a decline in brain function it can lead to reduced motivation and increased feelings of fatigue. Even knowing something is necessary everyday activities become challenging. Particularly in bathing with its multiple steps including undressing washing your body and hair and then drying your hair it's ""easy to get discouraged due to the decrease in cognitive function which makes it hard to organize these actions.""

So is feeling ""bothered by bathing"" a sign of mental distress? While Kasuga stated that ""not wanting to bathe doesn't necessarily mean depression"" he advised ""There may be a fatigue buildup. If you're unable to complete tasks like tidying up and bathing you should seek medical advice.""

Even if someone feels they've recovered from their depression there can still be times when they can't bring themselves to take a bath. Kasuga cautions ""It's a state where you want to but can't do it. Please don't pressure people in this situation to bathe or do things like that.""

If you borrow to buy a home chances are good your mortgage will be your largest monthly payment and the biggest debt you take on over the course of your life. You'll also be committing to making payments for a long time.

That's why it can be frustrating to see lots of conflicting mortgage advice out there.

Warren Buffett and Dave Ramsey don't agree about mortgages

Some financial experts such as Dave Ramsey urge people to take out the smallest possible loan for the shortest possible period of time -- or even to avoid borrowing altogether and to pay cash for a home.

Others however take an opposite approach. In fact billionaire investor Warren Buffett has called a 30-year mortgage ""the best instrument in the world."" He personally took out a 30-year mortgage when he purchased his home although he could've easily avoided doing so and advises most home buyers to do the same. Here's why he's right.

Buffett's approach to mortgage loans is better than Ramsey's

Buffett's advice about mortgage loans makes a lot more sense than Ramsey's. That's because Buffett fully understands there's an opportunity cost associated with paying cash for a home -- or even taking out a shorter-term mortgage with higher monthly payments. Ramsey seems to ignore this fact when he warns buyers to steer clear of a 30-year mortgage instead opting for a shorter repayment term with higher monthly payments or no loan at all.

When Buffett bought his home for $150000 in 1971 he indicated he put around $30000 down on the property and borrowed the rest. The reason: ""I thought I could probably do better with the money than have it be an all equity purchase of the house.""

Buffett ended up buying shares of Berkshire Hathaway with the money he could have used to purchase the home. As a result he ended up turning the $110000 or $120000 that he'd have paid in cash for the home into a whopping $750 million because Berkshire shares have gone up so much in value.

You don't have to be Buffett to get good returns

Now it's unlikely that most people will see the type of return on investment that Buffett did by buying Berkshire shares. But it is reasonable to assume most people could get a better return by investing than by paying cash for a home even if they aren't expert investors. Investing in an S&P 500 index fund could produce average annual returns of around 10% over time which is well above even an expensive mortgage at 4% or 5%.

By tying up your money in a home as Ramsey suggests you miss out on the chance to do other things with it that could have a greater impact on your net worth. That's true whether you make a large down payment pay cash for a home or opt for a 15-year loan with much higher monthly payments.

And as Buffett points out you also have the ability to make your mortgage even cheaper by refinancing if rates go down. ""It's a one-way renegotiation. It is an incredibly attractive instrument for the homeowner and you've got a one-way bet.""

For all these reasons you should listen to Buffett rather than Ramsey. If you're buying a home a 30-year mortgage is the best way to do it.

A historic opportunity to potentially save thousands on your mortgage

Chances are interest rates won't stay put at multi-decade lows for much longer. That's why taking action today is crucial whether you're wanting to refinance and cut your mortgage payment or you're ready to pull the trigger on a new home purchase.

Our expert recommends this company to find a low rate - and in fact he used them himself to refi (twice!).

Warren Buffett might have billions of dollars to his name but unlike other celebrities and financial gurus he prefers to live life simply for the most part.

The investing icon practices what he preaches when it comes to financial discipline saving and paying off debt.

Buffett gave an early warning last May about today’s higher prices when he told a livestream audience of over 28 million during Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting that ""substantial inflation"" was already hitting businesses.

When one of the world's most successful investors raises concerns about rising prices it’s probably a good time to apply some well-tested strategies to tighten your belt. Here are nine ways Buffett's frugality can help you save and spend wisely.

1. He lives in the same home he bought back in 1958

TEDizen / Flickr

While most billionaires bulk up on expensive real estate Buffett originally paid $31500 for his Omaha Nebraska home — that’s about $289000 in today’s dollars — and he’s lived there for over 60 years.

His home is by no means tiny however. The 6570-square-foot five-bedroom house has had plenty of renovations and additions over the decades and is worth about $1 million today. It’s also protected by fences and security cameras and most likely has a good homeowners insurance policy as well.

Buffett has no plans to move out calling the house “the third best investment I ever made” in a 2010 letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders.

2. He rarely takes out loans

Buffett’s one-and-only mortgage was on a vacation home in Laguna Beach California that he purchased in 1971 although he certainly had the cash to afford the $150000-listed seaside property.

He told CNBC that he took out the 30-year mortgage loan because “I thought I could probably do better with the money than have it be an all-equity purchase of the house.” He decided to use the extra cash on hand for shares in Berkshire Hathaway — the company that brought him billions.

Buffett's point about not locking up capital still resonates. And if you own your home you have options to free up some of your capital by refinancing quickly at today's historically low rates before they rise this year as forecasters expect. A switch may save you thousands of dollars a year.

3. He buys breakfast cheap

@BusinessInsider / Twitter

While Buffett could simply have a personal chef cook him a gourmet breakfast he often grabs Mickey D’s on his way to work. He says he doesn’t like to spend more than $3.17 on his morning meal.

“When I’m not feeling quite so prosperous I might go with the $2.61 which is two sausage patties and then I put them together and pour myself a Coke” he says in HBO's 2017 documentary Becoming Warren Buffett. He continues: “$3.17 is a bacon egg and cheese biscuit but the market’s down this morning so I’ll pass up the $3.17 and go with the $2.95.”

Story continues

Instead of going out for meals or buying a latte from Starbucks every day make your own lunches and coffee. And when you buy online you might be able to get a better deal with some help comparison shopping.

4. He buys marked-down cars

Many billionaires and millionaires keep a collection of flashy sports cars and vintage models in their garages but Buffett allegedly prefers fixed-up automobiles that he can acquire at reduced prices.

He upgraded from his 2006 Cadillac DTS to a Cadillac XTS for just $45000 in 2014. ""The truth is I only drive about 3500 miles a year so I will buy a new car very infrequently” he told Forbes.

Whether you opt for a brand-new car or a slightly used model emulate Buffett by spending within your limit. That means you won’t want to go for the first loan you spot and should look around for better deals. A good habit is to do a quick check of auto insurance rates every six months.

5. He doesn’t splurge on brands

freeimage4life / Flickr

Buffett doesn’t much care for designer suits or the latest iPhone model — he relied on his $20 flip-phone for years before swapping it out for the Apple smartphone in 2020.

Buffett avoids unnecessary spending and once said “Do not save what is left after spending but spend what is left after saving.”

Park your funds in a high-yield savings account or in a diversified investing portfolio so the money can grow over time. Set aside your extra cash for an emergency fund or retirement instead of blowing it all on nonessential purchases.

6. He doesn’t invest with borrowed money (anymore)

Freedomz / Shutterstock

“I’ve never borrowed a significant amount of money in my life. Never. Never will. I’ve got no interest in it” he told students at Notre Dame in 1991.

Although a young Buffett once borrowed 25% of his net wealth to buy shares he warns investors against repeating the same mistake.

Even skilled stock traders will tell you borrowing to invest can be risky. And there’s no real need with investing apps that allow you to start with a small amount of money like one that lets you invest your ""spare change"".

7. He does what he loves

Financial Freedom / YouTube

Buffett credits some of his success to his passion for investing. “You have to love something to do well at it” he says urging people to take the jobs they love instead of positions that look good on your resume.

Even if you can’t quit your full-time job to focus on the things you truly enjoy you can certainly find the time for some affordable hobbies. Buffett himself enjoys card games and playing the ukulele.

And if you’re looking for a way to boost your income capitalize on your skills and hobbies and set up your own side hustle.

8. He finds creative ways to save

When Buffett’s first child was born he converted a dresser drawer into a bassinet. For his second he borrowed a crib.

“If you buy things you don’t need you will soon sell things you need” the billionaire says.

Take a good hard look at your finances and figure out where you can cut down on. Get yourself a library card and borrow books and movies instead of purchasing them. Or try a budgeting app to monitor your spending habits.

9. He uses cash not credit

fongbeerredhot / Shutterstock

While most of us prefer the convenience of a credit card for our everyday purchases Buffett uses hard cash.

He told Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in 2019 that he uses cash “98% of the time. If I’m in a restaurant I’ll always pay cash. It’s just easier.” While the method may sound a bit old school relying less on your credit card can help prevent spending money you don’t have.

Using most of your available credit and falling behind on your monthly payments damages your credit score. If you’re struggling to pay off your credit card debt you might want to consider bundling it up into a debt consolidation loan with a lower interest rate.

Hoping to pursue his new love interest Pilgrim finds himself having to confront all of Flowers' seven previous partners engaging them in comical battles.

BBY,Best Buy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzA4L21pbm9yaXR5LXByaXZpbGVnZS1pcy1ub3ctbW9yZS1jb21tb24tdGhhbi13aGl0ZS1wcml2aWxlZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Minority privilege' is now more common than 'white privilege',"The left is furious about “white privilege.” And while it’s true white people have benefited from major advantages over time it’s a concept that is rapidly fading — especially now as the reverse is coming true. Minorities are increasingly becoming privileged while growing numbers of white people face discrimination.

Diversity initiatives have been around for years but over the past year and a half innumerable companies and corporations have ramped up their efforts with the goal of “diversifying” their workforce. Tech giant Facebook for example has committed to half of its employees coming from “underrepresented communities” (i.e. black Native American and Hispanic) by 2023. Best Buy is hiring one person of color for every three new hires over the next five years. United Airlines has promised that at least half of the pilots they will train in the next decade will be women and “people of color” (currently only 13 percent of pilots are people of color).

In May Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot suddenly declared she will only give interviews to “journalists of color” — something that would be an impeachable offense if the situation was reversed (only giving interviews to “white journalists”).

The push to promote people of color has become so pervasive that the most objective scientific institutions have seemingly become captive to woke ideology. For example the NIH and CDC use taxpayer dollars to incentivize biomedical research labs to hire ethnic minorities because “research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams” — without quoting or citing any actual research.

Minorities are now even advantaged when seeking medical treatment. Last week the New York City and state departments of health authorized life-saving antiviral treatment for COVID-19 for everyone belonging to a “non-white race or Hispanic/Latino ethnicity” regardless of risk factors but for whites only those with risk factors are allowed it. The DOH cites its rationale as: “longstanding systemic health and social inequities have contributed to an increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.”

Meanwhile the rise of minority advantage has come with a parallel war on whiteness especially in academia. In June the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association — “one of the world’s most respected publications in psychoanalysis” — printed a peer-reviewed paper entitled “On Having Whiteness.” The abstract of the paper describes “whiteness” as a “malignant parasitic-like condition” requiring “effective treatment consist[ing] of a combination of psychic and social-historical interventions.” It adds “there is not yet a permanent cure.” There are real accredited university courses that instruct anti-white racism: “Race Theory & the Problem of Whiteness” (Arizona State University) and “Abolition of Whiteness” (Hunter College).

Institutionalized anti-white bigotry has escalated to genocidal rhetoric. As Bari Weiss revealed in her recent Substack piece Yale University hosted a lecture by Dr. Aruna Khilanani this year about the “The Psychopathic Problem of the White Mind” where the speaker revealed her fantasies to kill white people. Other than university administrators later saying the lecture was found to have “tone and content antithetical to the values of the school” the backlash was tempered. While social media erupted and Khilanani’s Manhattan-based practice is now closed for unknown reasons she still has her license. One can only imagine the riotous demonstrations that would have reverberated across the country had Yale hosted a talk about “The Psychopathic Problem of the Black Mind.”

The upshot is that pro-minority bias is not only permitted but socially incentivized. Employers professors and administrators are lauded for implementing radical diversity initiatives. As minorities are preferentially hired across the board and given a host of other benefits by way of their genetic lottery we must fundamentally reframe our discourse surrounding race relations.

While “white privilege” may still exist in some margins of society it no longer reflects the progressive era we live in.

Our latest roundup of the best tech deals we can find is headed up by a range of bargains on digital Nintendo Switch games. The Mario maker is running a sweeping ""New Year Sale"" over at its online eShop  with many of the more notable discounts duplicated at third-party retailers such as Amazon Walmart  and Humble . While the sales don't include price cuts on some of the most popular Switch games—there's nothing for Zelda Animal Crossing  or Mario Kart here—the discounts still cover a variety of titles we like and have previously recommended here at Ars.

We've curated a list of standout deals from the sale below but among the highlights the delightfully mischievous Untitled Goose Game is down to $10  while the Switch port of the breezy and charming puzzler Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is down to $28 Clubhouse Games  which collects 51 innocently fun mini-games that span various methods of play is also on sale for $28 . Several ports of easy recommendations are discounted as well including near-universally acclaimed RPGs Disco Elysium The Witcher 3  and Divinity: Original Sin 2  the gorgeous Tetris Effect  and the chaotic first-person shooter Doom Eternal . Plus there are a handful of deals on smaller-scale indies we've highlighted in past guides including the moody action-adventure game Olija  the comedic and genre-shifting side-scroller The Messenger  and the satisfying roguelite Dead Cells

Now many of the multiplatform games on sale here can often be had for less on other devices and Nintendo still charges a bit more than we'd like for years-old first-party games in particular. (Games like Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze and Super Mario Maker 2 would ideally be available for $40 by default these days not just when they're on sale.) Nevertheless if you're willing to pay the usual Nintendo premium for the Switch's portability all of the deals we've curated are well below their typical street prices and the majority of them are either at the lowest price we've tracked for the Switch or at least very close.

Also of note: if you don't have eShop gift credit already you might be better off buying with a digital code from a third-party retailer when applicable since you'll get the full amount of ""Gold Points""—Nintendo's reward currency for purchasing eShop games which you can then use toward future purchases—even if you've paid less at Amazon Target or the like. Either way though if you recently picked up a new Switch over the holidays and need things to play there are a few good opportunities to stock up here. Nintendo says the sale will last through January 16.

How does the Starfrit Pump'n'Slice Chopper work?

Think of this Starfrit chopper as your ticket to evenly-sliced fruit and vegetables every time. It features a unique design that uses a high efficiency spring pump and adjustable blades that result in 0.5 to 0.8mm thick slices.

It's a safer alternative to a traditional mandoline since your fingers don't end up anywhere this chopper's blades. All blades are safely enclosed inside the machine so all you have to do is set your desired thickness insert your food into the chute and press down on the pump to achieve perfectly sized slices.

Use this chopper on vegetables and fruits like potatoes peppers beets carrots zucchini sweet potato apples and more. It's also suitable for deli meats and cheese if you're looking for a quick way to slice and dice.

What shoppers have to say

As a coveted Amazon's Choice product the Starfrit Pump'n'Slice is a must-have gadget for any chef that's looking to streamline their kitchen. It's also earned a 4.5-star average rating from more than 1100 Amazon reviews.

""Most safe mandolin on [the] market"" raved one reviewer.

Reviewers have added that while this gadget does take the work out of slicing foods into strips and is ""safe for kids"" it's not ideal if you're hoping to finely chop and dice.

""Dicing was not my favourite"" admitted one reviewer who shared that it may be ""quicker to do it by hand.""

Verdict

Despite some of its drawbacks reviewers agree that the Starfrit Pump'n'Slice is a worthwhile investment at just $20. It's been called a ""good product for the elderly"" for kids or for those with limited mobility since it's a safe and speedy way to chop foods.

Reviewers do note that while it's great at slicing it won't entirely replace all the knives in your kitchen when it comes to easily chopping and mincing.

Jack Matthews and Sean Galvin both touched down in the second half adding to an earlier penalty try as Mark McHugh’s men triumphed 22-7 at the Palace Grounds.

It was always going to be a tough ask for Division 1B side Armagh who were hoping to avenge a 20-17 defeat to Lansdowne from the 2020 edition of the Energia-sponsored All-Ireland competition.

Young out-half Peter Hastie landed a penalty in very wet conditions before Lansdowne’s robust pack forced a penalty try to take the visitors into a 10-0 half-time lead.

Two tries in a 12-minute spell at the start of the second half effectively settled the issue. Scrum half Matthews crossed in the corner before replacement Galvin rounded off a surging attack that began with a quick tap in Lansdowne’s 22.

Armagh replacement Matthew Hooks deservedly hit back with a seven-pointer but there was no stopping Lansdowne as they set up a final against Young Munster who advanced after Covid-19 forced Ballina to call off their game.

Lansdowne have a long and proud history with the Bateman Cup winning the inaugural event 100 years ago and further titles in 1929 1930 1931 and 2018.

The headquarters club were also crowned joint winners with Cork Constitution in 2020 following the initial outbreak of Covid.

Young Munster’s only Bateman Cup success was back in 1928 when they beat Lansdowne 6-3 in the decider. The clubs are currently third and second respectively in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League.

They played out one of the games of the domestic season so far at Irish Rugby HQ in October a Conor Hayes hat-trick of tries inspiring a 24-20 success for the Cookies against McHugh’s charges.

Railway Union reached the Energia Women’s All-Ireland Cup semi-finals with Aoife Doyle touching down twice in their 24-14 win over close rivals Blackrock College.

John Cronin’s side burst out of the blocks in their first game of the New Year Ireland international Doyle crossing in the corner before adding a well-taken intercept effort in the eighth minute.

Doyle playing in the centre or the wing looks in excellent form heading towards the Women’s Six Nations. She scored seven tries in the league before

The Limerick flyer used a neat sidestep to score her opener against ‘Rock. She then sprinted clear from her own 22 after intercepting a Jackie Shiels pass making it 12-0.

Up-and-coming prop Amanda McQuade added Railway’s third try for a 17-0 half-time lead surging over from a Deirdre Roberts delivery.

However Blackrock turning around with a big wind behind them were much improved after the break and clawed their way back.

Two quick-fire tries brought them right back into contention recent Ireland cap Maeve Óg O’Leary brilliantly breaking past three defenders for the first of them after good initial work by Maggie Boylan and the supporting Natasja Behan.

Replacement Caoimhe Molloy crashed over to make it a three-point game but Railway’s swift response through Kate McCarthy who was sprung from the bench sealed their passage through to the last-four.

Here’s What You Need to Remember: Cheap 747s converted to carry long-range cruise missiles and shorter-range munitions alike already have the endurance needed for continent-spanning missions.

During the Cold War Boeing developed plans to load a 747 with as many as 72 air-launched cruise missiles to serve as a long-range arsenal ship capable of wiping out targets from hundreds of miles away. The design dubbed the 747 Cruise Missile Carrier Aircraft (CMCA) could have been an extremely cost-effective alternative to America’s current fleet of heavy-payload bombers in a wide variety of mission sets.

Ultimately the 747 CMCA never made it off the drawing board with the Reagan administration pulling the B-1 program out of mothballs and the B-2 entering service shortly thereafter–but it may be time the United States revisited the idea of leveraging these or similarly capable commercial airframes for more than just ferrying cargo and passengers.

Why Pack a 747 With Cruise Missiles?

On June 30 1977 President Jimmy Carter announced that he was canceling development on America’s B-1 bomber program citing the program’s cost overruns and advancing ballistic missile technology for the decision. The bomber would eventually find new life under the Reagan administration eventually resulting in the B-1B Lancer that remains in service today. Northrop Grumman’s B-2 Spirit sometimes referred to as America’s “stealth bomber” also entered service in the ’80s placing America’s strategic bombing capabilities right back at the top of the global military heap.

But for a short window of time the United States seemed to be in need of a heavy-payload aircraft that had enough endurance to cross entire oceans to engage enemy targets. Some believed converting an existing commercial platform to carry the recently-developed AGM-86 air-launched cruise missiles made the most sense from an economic standpoint and Boeing’s 747 seemed like just the right aircraft for the job.

Boeing’s 747 first took to the skies in 1969. Initially designed to compete for an Air Force cargo transport contract (which it lost to Lockheed’s C-5 Galaxy) it found renewed purpose as the first commercial airliner ever to be called a “jumbo jet” and “jumbo” was an apt description. The 747 was a massive aircraft for its day and the largest civilian aircraft in the world at the time. The original 747 fuselage stretched 225 feet and carried a vertical tail that stood as tall as a six-story building. It had more square footage in its wings alone than you can find in an entire basketball court and just one of the 747’s wings was 30 times heavier than Boeing’s entire first aircraft launched just 53 years prior.

Boeing developed the aircraft incredibly quickly–in under 16 months by their own accounting but the effort was positively monumental nonetheless. Some 50000 employees had a hand in the 747 program. More than 75000 engineering drawings were produced accounting for some six million parts and over 171 miles of wiring. In order to ensure the aircraft design was extremely efficient it spent more than 15000 hours in the wind tunnel and then another 1500 hours of flight testing.

Incredible as the aircraft was however it was also a serious gamble. Boeing struggled to finance the completion of its development eventually borrowing more than $2 billion (roughly $14.9 billion in today’s money) to get it across the finish line. If the aircraft were to fail to find a market it would have meant ruin for the company.

It may have been with that in mind that plans for the 747 CMCA began to form. Boeing knew the Air Force might be interested in an aircraft with a range of nearly 6000 miles and the ability to carry nearly 77000 pounds of ordnance so they set to work on just such a proposal in 1980. If they were successful it would mean selling their expensive new design in both commercial and military markets for cargo personnel and as an arsenal ship.

The 747 CMCA

Boeing started with a 747-200C which was a convertible airliner with a nose cargo door that could be opened to remove the seats and leave the interior empty as well as to bring large payloads on board.

The 747 Cruise Missile Carrier Aircraft would leverage the new AGM-86 air-launched cruise missile which was developed for exactly this sort of application though in a different aircraft. By the 1970s the B-52 was already looking pretty long in the tooth and the AGM-86 had been designed specifically to increase its survivability by engaging targets from ranges that could exceed 1500 miles–well outside the reach of Soviet surface-to-air missiles.

But while the B-52 could carry 20 of these 21′ cruise missiles the 747 CMCA could carry a whopping 72.

The weapons would be carried within the 747 fuselage on nine rotary launchers each loaded with eight AGM-86 cruise missiles. The missiles would be fired one at a time from the side door near the rear of the aircraft with each rotary launcher sliding back into firing position as needed. Although the missiles were ejected one at a time Boeing’s design was meant to be able to launch them in quick succession.

These missiles would leverage a satellite data link to receive target information while the 747 was airborne or target information could be relayed from a command and control team stationed just behind the cockpit of the aircraft in the area usually reserved for 1st class passengers.

As a result the 747 CMCA would have been able to deploy more cruise missiles than three B-52s combined each with independent targets within hundreds of miles of one another. But impressive as that may be it was the potential cost savings that made the missile-packing 747 seem like a very viable option.

Cheaper Than Any Bomber

The B-1B Lancer that would ultimately eliminate the need for the 747 CMCA can carry a comparable payload to the 747 and its sweep-wing design and powerful General Electric F101-GE-102 afterburning turbofan engines make it both fast and extremely maneuverable for a bomber carrying so much firepower you can use school busses as a unit of measurement. But it’s also incredibly expensive at around $61000 per hour to fly. The B-52 is a bit pricier at about $70000 per hour. The stealth B-2 Spirit crushes those figures with a jaw-dropping $130159 per hour.

But a modern 747 rings in at just about $25000 per hour.

A large part of what makes America’s bombers so pricey to operate is the size of their respective fleets. The Air Force operates some 62 B-1Bs 76 B-52s and just 20 B-2s. With so few of each of these planes in existence parts tend to be very pricey–and they keep getting pricier as all three of these bombers continue to age. Conversely more than 1500 747s have been built with supply lines and maintenance infrastructure already established the world over. That means it’s not just cheaper to buy parts for the 747 it’s cheaper to get them on the aircraft that need them.

As Tyler Rogoway pointed out way back in 2014 a 747 carrying 72 cruise missiles would have been extremely handy over Afghanistan throughout the past 20 years of conflict. With its low operating cost great endurance and massive payload the 747 CMCA could have been an air support powerhouse in the uncontested airspace over Afghanistan as well as in other conflict-ridden areas like Iraq and Syria. If the aircraft had been put into service and converted to carry JDAMs of varying sizes along with small-diameter bombs over the years the number of individual targets it could engage increases from 72 to literally hundreds. And all at a fraction of the cost of America’s current bomber options.

Could We See a Resurgence of the CMCA Concept?

Today both the B-1B Lancer and the B-2 Spirit are slated to retire in favor of America’s forthcoming stealth bomber the B-21 Raider. The B-21 promises to offer incredibly advanced stealth technology and the same global strike capabilities we’ve come to expect from bombers like the Raider’s predecessor the B-2. There is a significant catch however: The B-21 Raider is going to be quite a bit smaller than the B-2 limiting its payload capabilities to around 30000 pounds. That’s not terribly far off from the B-2’s 40000-pound limit but it’s less than half of the supersonic B-1B’s 75000 capacity.

While the B-21 will likely be more economical than the B-2 thanks to newer technology and fresher airframes there’s no denying that operating stealth aircraft is expensive. This understanding is part of what prompted the Air Force to purchase new non-stealth F-15EXs which offer nearly three times the lifespan at less than half the cost per operating hour than the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. While Northrop and the Air Force both claim the B-21 program is steaming ahead on schedule and without any serious snags just how much it costs to fly remains to be seen.

The United States is no longer conducting combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq but as the nation shifts back toward an era of great power competition it seems unlikely that America’s days of conducting combat operations in uncontested airspace are over. Much like the last Cold War the simmering tensions between the U.S. and China are unlikely to boil over into open war any time soon. This time it’s not just mutually assured nuclear destruction keeping the dogs of war at bay it’s also the promise of economic catastrophe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9jYW5hZGlhbi1wYWNpZmljLWJvZWluZy03NDctMjAwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Happened To Canadian Pacific Air Lines' Boeing 747-200s?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9jYW5hZGlhbi1wYWNpZmljLWJvZWluZy03NDctMjAwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JpcnRoLWJvZWluZy03MDctbm8tc2VjcmV0LWV2ZXJ5b25lLWtuZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The birth of the Boeing 707 was no secret - everyone knew!,"The birth of the Boeing 707 was no secret – everyone knew – but the lay media has continued to keep pedaling the myth that Boeing stole a march on its competitors by hiding the design under model number 367-80.

Another related myth was that Boeing had secret German aerodynamic wing designs and that also gave the company an edge. Again utter nonsense.

Certainly Boeing’s George Scharer was at Volkenrode in May 1945 and saw first hand German aerodynamic data but as noted the top-secret files were to be shared. The author has been to the Douglas archives and seen over 10 five-draw cabinets full of German aerodynamic data so that “secret” data was available to Douglas -and all other manufacturers – years before the advent of the 707 vs DC-8 competition.

In fact Douglas built many military fighters in the late 40s with swept wings and also built B-47s for Boeing at its Tulsa plant in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

Here is George’s letter to his Boeing colleagues.

In its annual report of 1952 Boeing announced under the headline “Jet Transport-Tanker Begun” that work has started on a jet transport prototype in the spring of that year.

It stated: “We are of the opinion that the company can build a prototype transport which will enable it to demonstrate to the military the principal characteristics of a combination tanker and jet transport and at the same time demonstrate to the commercial airlines the principal characteristics of a production airliner.”

It estimated the cost at $15 million.

That year Boeing reported sales of $739 million and a net profit of $14 million with a backlog at $1.6 billion so not exactly betting the company as many say.

Down the coast Douglas Aircraft Co. posted a profit of $10 million on sales of $522 million and held a backlog of $1.8 billion.

It stated in its annual report that it has spent $1 million of engineering work for a jet transport.

Just 12 months later in its 1953 annual report Boeing showed images of its 707 prototype under construction (below) announcing it would fly in the fall of 1954.

This is the first photo of the 707 shown in Boeing’s 1953 annual report

At Douglas despite soaring sales profits and backlog of $874 million $18 million and $2.2 billion respectively the company dithered saying that studies continued.

On May 14 1954 the prototype 707 dubbed the 367-80 was rolled out and flew on July 15 1954.

Douglas would not commit to its DC-8 for another full year and thus lost precious time in what would be the greatest sales race in aviation history.

And because it had not built a prototype and was playing catch up problems arose that were very costly to rectify damaged sales and also impaired its ability to compete with Boeing that swept all before it with the slightly smaller 720 and three-engine 727.

Although coming as a surprise it is not completely a new concept given Boeing’s previous experiments with hypersonic technology.

At a recent symposium Boeing demonstrated a new model of a possible reusable hypersonic aircraft. According to the company the design is an extension of concepts that were initially shown publicly four years ago and might have military and commercial applications such as a space launch.

Senior Editor Norris of Aviation Week spotted the model at the annual AIAA SciTech Forum and Exposition in San Diego California and shared photos of it on Twitter. So far there isn’t much concrete information available on the said model.

Earlier in 2018 Boeing had unveiled a notional hypersonic aircraft called Valkyrie. The new design was an iteration of the Valkyrie concept which was revealed at the 2018 SciTech Forum Norris tweeted. He described it as “an improved more realistic Mach 5 reusable air-breathing concept aimed at military and space launch tasks.”

The approved hypersonic speed limit is Mach 5 — five times the speed of sound.

Boeing previously has considered a reusable hypersonic platform for launching payloads into space as an alternative to standard space launch rockets.

In 2020 Australian firm Hypersonix and Boeing Research and Technology (BR&T) had agreed to perform research into a reusable space launch vehicle using the SPARTAN reusable scramjet as previously reported by Space Australia.

The US Defense Department too had resurrected Boeing’s chances for a near-term success in the hypersonic weapons market by allowing it to join a competition to produce a Mach 6 cruise missile and reviving a decade-old proposal based on dual-combustion ramjet technology.

Boeing’s Hypersonic Aircraft

The new hypersonic aircraft is very identical to the notional one that it showcased in 2018. However the difference is that the middle fuselage is flatter while the wings and twin tails are shorter.

Two engines underneath the fuselage have been repositioned now being enclosed behind two separate fairings rather than side-by-side.

It’s unclear what kind of engines Boeing will use to power this plane although the corporation has already experimented with innovative high-speed jet engines such as scramjets and “combined cycle” technologies. Traditional jet turbines are paired with ramjets or scramjets in a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) engine arrangement.

Boeing’s introduction of its hypersonic design in 2018 on which the recent one is based was perceived as a response to Lockheed Martin’s projected hypersonic military aircraft the SR-72 according to Interesting Engineering.

Boeing’s Hypersonic Prospects

The presentation of Boeing’s hypersonic aircraft model at the AIAA conference coincides with the US Air Force’s announcement of Project Mayhem.

The Mayhem hypersonic air vehicle program is expected to offer a modular experimental design that may be configured to carry one of two types of payloads for strike missions or a sensor package for conducting “responsive” intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance or ISR sorties as reported by the EurAsian Times.

Boeing of course has a long history of doing such designs for a variety of uses including high-speed airliners and military platforms. But Boeing isn’t the only company to consider a reusable hypersonic platform for launching payloads into space as a replacement for standard space launch rockets.

More details of this proposed aircraft will emerge as and when Boeing decides to share it officially in the public domain."

As you find promising listings it’s time to start touring them with your buyer’s agent. Find your most comfortable shoes because this may take a while.

Watching a show like “House Hunters” on HGTV — in which buyers tour just three homes for sale one of which is almost always over budget and then choose one to purchase — you may think the home search process could be tidily wrapped up in a weekend. But that’s not usually how it works in real life. (And by some accounts it’s not how it works for TV buyers either.) The average American home buyer reported touring nine homes over the course of an eight-week home search in 2020 according to the National Association of Realtors.

When it comes to home tours more is better. Touring homes for sale isn’t just about finding a home to buy — it’s one of the most important parts of your home buying education.

Every home you enter every yard you walk through every countertop you run your hand over — whether it makes your eyes bulge with envy or your nose crinkle in disapproval — provides you with more information about what features you value the most and what it costs to get them within the reality of your local housing market.

Some buyers do fall in love with the first or second home they see and are lucky enough to get an offer accepted right away. Most others though will spend weeks or even months homing in on the right choice. That’s time well spent: Each home you see will make you a more informed buyer. But still … 50 homes? Really? Well yes — and no.

How to tour homes

There may not even be 50 homes for sale in the community you’re targeting. However if you accept that a “home tour” doesn’t have to be a formal real estate showing with your real estate agent present and if you start early you can tour a lot more homes than you think.

Open houses

Once you’ve decided that you’d like to buy a home even if you’re not yet financially prepared start popping into open houses. They don’t have to be homes that you would consider buying or even homes you can afford — at this point it’s just field research. Take note of the price size location and condition of the home and whether that combination has resulted in a big eager crowd of hopeful buyers … or a quiet nearly empty house.

Dinner parties

Every home you step foot in from now on should be considered a “home tour.” Visiting your in-laws or stopping by a friend’s party? Time to tune your senses into things you might have overlooked in the past: Pay closer attention to details like the floor plan and finishes and make mental notes of qualities you like or don’t.

Ask these homeowners where they got the fixtures you like or how well their new flooring has held up. Find out whether they like living with the features you admire or if there are actually frustrating downsides to them. For example rustic rolling barn doors can be a stylish and space-saving way to close off a closet or powder room but some homeowners find that they jam easily or fall off their tracks making them less glamorous in everyday life.

Online tours

Increasingly home sellers are relying on virtual showings. Wherever possible this is something you should take advantage of.

An online 3-D tour is a great way to explore a home from afar and it can tell you a lot about its layout light and functionality. It can help you rule out homes that look appealing in well-staged photos but fail the “flow test” on a virtual walk-through — once you discover for example that the glamorously updated bathroom pictured in the listing is actually down a steep basement stairway not off the upstairs bedrooms as you had imagined.

However a virtual visit is usually a poor substitute for the full-sensory experience of visiting a home in person. You won’t hear the squeak of loose floorboards in a virtual tour for example or the rumble of trucks passing by on a busy road. You probably won’t notice the crumbling grout in the corner of the bathroom or be able to tell the difference between laminate and hardwood flooring. It’s impossible to detect a lingering odor of tobacco or musty mildew. And you won’t be able to get a literal feel for the texture of the countertops cabinets and other surfaces or the tug of a sticky closet door that’s a struggle to open.

So the best use of virtual tours is as a way to screen new listings — to determine which ones are worth the effort of an in-person visit and which ones you can skip.

Send your agent

Another way to make your home search more efficient is to let your real estate agent filter listings for you. Real estate agents often get a first look at new homes as they hit the market. If you’ve been working together for a while and communicating your tastes and preferences your agent will be able to tell you whether a new listing is worth your time or one you can safely ignore and why.

And if you can’t see a home in person — if you’re relocating from another area for example or simply crunched for time — your real estate agent may be able to tour the place for you using FaceTime or another video-calling service. In addition to getting your agent’s expert opinion that will allow you to ask questions in real time and zoom in on things you’d like a closer look at.

Have someone take a tour

If you make an offer remotely make sure your agent has toured the property on your behalf and that you trust their judgment. You can (and should) also try to see the home in person before you finalize the sale — during the home inspection for example.

Beware of buyer’s blur

All that said touring too many homes in short succession can create a whirlwind sensation — before long you can’t remember which house had the creepy basement and which one had the creepy neighbor.

Once you’re in the heat of your home search use the aforementioned strategies to try to limit the number of homes you formally tour to two or three serious contenders per week. Take lots of photos with your cellphone to remind yourself later of little details or issues that catch your eye. It can even be helpful to jot down some quick thoughts or record your first impressions in a short voice memo to yourself once you’re back in the car.

THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE AND THINGS YOU CAN’T

Learn to Recognize Possibility—and Its Limits

As you tour homes for sale try to look beyond the surface. Don’t get distracted by the decor—none of it will be there when you move in. If you can approach the homes you tour with a bit of vision you’ll have an edge over the many buyers who simply can’t mentally place themselves and their lives inside a drab or quirky home.

CAN

Cosmetics: Realtors beg their buyers not to get hung up on outdated fixtures tacky carpeting or purple walls. As long as it still functions properly virtually any cosmetic feature can be changed (or lived with until you have the money to upgrade). A simple coat of paint in particular is a cheap transformational DIY project. So try to use your imagination and look beyond the seller’s style.

Site grade: The way a home sits on its lot is an underappreciated trait. Ideally you want the yard to slope gently away from the structure on all sides so water drains away from the house not into it. If that’s not the case it’s usually easy enough for a landscaper to regrade the lot so you don’t risk ending up with a wet moldy basement. If the home is on a hill and no amount of regrading will help remedies like a French drain can still protect your basement from water infiltration.

Energy and efficiency: Don’t be afraid of a drafty old home. Adding insulation to the attic basement and walls can drastically improve energy efficiency and many states offer rebates or no-interest loans to help pay for it. Many homes can accommodate rooftop solar panels to produce renewable energy; if yours can’t it’s getting easier to sign up for a community solar plan or to select 100 percent renewable energy from your utility. If a home is heated with oil it’s possible to install an electric heat pump to reduce oil use.

Landscaping: Nature takes time but you can create the yard of your dreams through thoughtful planting and pruning if there’s enough room to do so. Don’t let an overgrown or unkempt yard deter you.

USUALLY CAN

Layout: It’s typically possible to knock down walls during a renovation to improve a floor plan’s flow but not always. If you have your heart set on opening up the kitchen to the living area ask a contractor or structural engineer to verify whether that will be possible or what your options are if it’s a load-bearing wall.

Square footage: It’s rarely easy or cheap to do—you can’t just buy square footage at the hardware store after all—but there’s often a way to squeeze some more living space out of a home if needed. That may mean finishing a basement dormering an attic or building an addition. Even adding a deck or patio can increase your usable space for a good portion of the year. Such solutions may not be an option in a condo unless there’s potential for a loft space for example. Even a single-family home may be maxed out if every nook and cranny has been updated and town zoning won’t allow you to expand the building’s footprint any closer to neighboring properties.

Foundation issues: It’s not always a sign of a major problem but a cracked or damaged foundation can definitely be a big concern for a buyer. But as any contractor will tell you “Anything can be fixed with enough money.” That’s not to say that you want to be the one to fix a damaged foundation! It could cost tens of thousands of dollars—or more—to address or could be a symptom of other costly problems. But even this most dreaded of home issues can generally be remedied if necessary.

CANNOT

Location: It is everything in real estate. Where that home sits is where it will stay and that will define your public school system your tax rate and even the air you breathe. Getting beyond the neighborhood into site specifics a corner lot offers lots of light and views—but it also means having less privacy and two sidewalks to shovel. A hilltop location is always nice but it may mean hiking uphill to get home or braving a slippery road in winter. And if it takes forty-five minutes to get downtown from your location that’s probably not going to change.

Acreage: You can add square footage by building an addition but only if there’s room on your lot to do so. Unless your neighbor’s home goes up for sale (and you somehow can afford to buy it) the size of your lot is what you’ve got.

Orientation: If you like waking up to morning light then look for a home with east-facing bedrooms. Love an afternoon glow in the living room or kitchen? Look for windows that face the south or southwest. If the garage takes up the entire south side of the home meanwhile you’re going to miss out on a lot of sunlight.

Elevation: While you can address your site grade to try to prevent a wet basement there’s no changing the elevation of your lot. Low-lying areas may be prone to flooding (and may require flood insurance as a mortgage condition) and as sea levels rise that risk will only intensify. It is possible though costly to elevate your home out of danger by raising the entire structure and all mechanical systems above the floodplain. But that won’t stop the road leading to your home from getting submerged during a storm surge along with much of the surrounding neighborhood.

Ceiling height: Homes built during frugal times such as the 1700s or the 1940s often have low ceilings that can feel a bit claustrophobic. Unless there’s a drop ceiling you can remove you’re generally stuck with the ceiling height you see. (Sometimes though it’s possible to strip the drywall or plaster and expose the ceiling joists—as well as any wiring and plumbing— adding a few more inches and a rustic industrial look overhead.)

NM Redevelopment a subsidiary of Boston real estate firm Bulfinch Companies Inc. partnered with Chicago-based investment management firm Harrison Street to buy the 94000-square-foot space last month according to records at the Middlesex County Registry of Deeds.

The building which features 18-foot-high ceilings and about 450 garaged parking spaces is currently assessed at $9.6 million according to Natick property records.

Developers are mum on what they plan to do with the property but they say its new use will cater to current market needs said Bulfinch Companies CEO Eric Schlager in a Dec. 17 press release.

“Bulfinch is excited to partner with Harrison Street and Brookfield Properties as we reposition this irreplaceable property to meet current market requirements” said Schlager. “This transaction is consistent with our mission to “Discover + Deliver” and we look forward to activating this unique asset and to further developing our strong partnership with the MetroWest community while creating value for our stakeholders.”

The sale closed on Dec. 16 in a deal brokered by Scott Black of Atlantic Retail after working through various issues including the building's change of use Black told the Daily News.

A spokesperson for Bulfinch said the company could not yet comment on what type of property is being developed at the location because it still needs to receive its special permit.

In May 2020 department store chain Neiman Marcus based in Dallas filed for bankruptcy. Though its Natick location was originally slated to close last year it will instead remain open through September. Bulfinch will serve as developer and property manager.

Bulfinch owns and manages about 3 million square feet of medical biotech and office assets according to its website. Some of its projects include:

Transforming a 25000-square-foot Allen Furniture Warehouse in Needham into a 75000-square-foot office building

Redeveloping a corporate building in Lexington into a 162119-square-foot office and lab building

Turning a four-story office building in Cambridge into a 63200-square-foot space to host office education and technology companies (the property is currently leased by Harvard University’s Information Technology Services Department)

Bulfinch and Harrison Street have partnered for several other projects including remaking the Atrium Mall in Chestnut Hill into the Life Time Center in 2012 a 286000- square-foot wellness and medical destination.

New York-based Brookfield Properties owns the Natick Mall which is the largest mall in New England by tenants and occupied square footage. But Neiman Marcus had owned its own building.

Neiman Marcus is one of several retailers to exit the mall over the last few years including Sears the American Girl store Brookstone Gymboree Lord & Taylor and Wayfair.

In 2018 Wegmans replaced the former J.C. Penney department store and Dave & Buster’s took over a portion of the former Sears store a year later. Level 99 took over another portion of Sears last year.

Exscientia and Sanofi agreed to collaborate to identify and select target projects by applying Exscientia’s personalized medicine platform. The platform is intended to enable a “patient-first” approach by integrating primary human tissue samples into early target and drug discovery research. Through that approach Exscientia reasons its researchers can integrate patient disease and clinically relevant data into decisions on potential new medicine candidates earlier in the process of drug creation.

In addition to target discovery Exscientia will lead small molecule drug design and lead optimization activities up to development candidate nomination. Sanofi will oversee preclinical and clinical development manufacturing and commercialization.

“Sanofi’s collaboration with Exscientia aims to transform how we discover and develop new small molecule medicines for cancer and immune-mediated diseases” Frank Nestle Sanofi’s global head of research and CSO said in a statement. “Application of sophisticated AI and machine learning methods will not only shorten drug discovery timelines but will also help to design higher quality and better targeted medicines for patients.”

The companies’ research collaboration and license agreement builds on a six-year relationship between Sanofi and Exscientia. They began partnering in 2016. A year later Sanofi and Exscientia signed a potentially €250 million ($302 million) collaboration and license option to discover bispecific small-molecule drugs against metabolic diseases. And in 2019 Sanofi in-licensed Exscientia’s bispecific small molecule candidate designed to target two distinct targets in inflammation and immunology.

In the latest collaboration Sanofi has agreed to pay Exscientia $100 million in upfront cash plus up to approximately $5.2 billion in payments tied to achieving research translational clinical development regulatory and commercial milestones.

Should Sanofi commercialize a therapeutic from the collaboration Exscientia will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on product sales ranging from high-single-digits to mid-teens and an option for clinical co-investment to increase the royalty rate up to 21% on net sales of co-funded products.

Exscientia said the $100 million upfront payment from Sanofi is expected to be reflected in its first-quarter 2022 results.

Last year Exscientia closed on $525 million in financing with the proceeds intended for advancing its pipeline through clinical trials as well as expanding its technology platform toward autonomous drug design. At the time Exscientia had completed a $225 million Series D round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 (SVF2). SoftBank also agreed to commit to Exscientia $300 million in equity from which the company can draw from at its discretion.

Tapping AI’s “full potential”

“Our expanded collaboration with Sanofi will utilize the breadth of our platform to test AI-designed drug candidates against patient tissue models potentially providing far better accuracy than conventional approaches such as mouse models” stated Andrew Hopkins DPhil Exscientia’s CEO and founder. “It is immensely exciting to collaborate with Sanofi with our goal of realizing the full potential of AI to deliver the next generation of cancer and immunology medicines.”

Exscientia’s platform uses patient tissue data to define optimal profiles for research improve experimental assessment during design and improve outcomes in a medical setting. Through an approach the company calls precision engineering at the molecular scale Exscientia aims to fulfill sophisticated design objectives for personalized therapies by applying advanced data acquisition machine learning and generative systems.

The platform combines precision information from viable patient tissue screened in Exscientia’s own laboratories with its CentaurAI systems with the goals of empowering target selection precision design and experiment as well as enhanced clinical assessment.

In January 2020 Exscientia joined collaboration partner Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma to announce what they said was the first AI-designed molecule into clinical study by launching a Phase I trial in Japan assessing their DSP-1181 as a treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder.

The companies have since brought two other AI-designed molecules into the clinic last year launching Phase I trials assessing EXS-21546 and DSP-0038. EXS-21546 is a peripherally-restricted and selective antagonist of the adenosine A2a receptor designed for anticancer immunotherapy combatting adenosine-related immunosuppressive effects through T-cell activation. DSP-0038 is an antagonist for the 5-HT2A receptor and agonist for the 5-HT1A receptor being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease psychosis.

Including the three candidates under clinical study with Sumitomo Dainippon Exscientia has built a pipeline of 26 programs including the first three AI-designed drug candidates to enter Phase I clinical trials:

Four immuno-oncology candidates—one each partnered with Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) Evotec and Rallybio; the other unpartnered.

Seven oncology candidates—four partnered with BMS one with China-based GT Apeiron one with Huadong Medicine and one unpartnered.

Six candidates in the “inflammation and immunity” category—two partnered with BMS two with EQRx one with Sanofi and the other unpartnered.

One drug each being developed in anti-infective (partnered with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) COVID-19 (CARE [Corona Accelerated R&D in Europe]) psychiatry (BlueOak Pharmaceuticals) unspecified rare disease (Rallybio) and respiratory indications (Bayer).

Seven additional programs in undisclosed indications all in early discovery phases with “various” undisclosed partners.

Three other “design-as-service” candidates for unspecified psychiatry indications—two being co-developed with Sumitomo Dainippon the other by a “confidential” partner.

In addition to its Oxford HQ Exscientia has offices in Miami Osaka Vienna and Dundee Scotland.

“Our AI-driven platform can be leveraged across drug discovery translational research and development with applications ranging from improving the precision medicine and quality of drug candidates to enriching for patient selection in clinical trials” Hopkins added. “When you consider the change this represents—testing candidates against actual human tissue years before a clinical trial—it’s transformative.”

Added Sanofi’s Nestle: “We look forward to deepening our work with Exscientia a leader in leveraging AI to modernize all aspects of drug discovery and development.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIyMDEwOTAwMDE2NNIBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjIwMTA5MDAwMTY0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SK becomes No. 2 shareholder of US Center for Breakthrough Medicines,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.koreaherald.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /view.php?ud=20220109000164 (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:997)'))) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIyMDEwOTAwMDE2NNIBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjIwMTA5MDAwMTY0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

But Norton 360 isn’t alone in this dubious endeavor: Avira antivirus — which has built a base of 500 million users worldwide largely by making the product free — was recently bought by the same company that owns Norton 360 and is introducing its customers to a service called Avira Crypto.

Founded in 2006 Avira Operations GmbH & Co. KG is a German multinational software company best known for their Avira Free Security (a.k.a. Avira Free Antivirus). In January 2021 Avira was acquired by Tempe Ariz.-based NortonLifeLock Inc. the same company that now owns Norton 360.

In 2017 the identity theft protection company LifeLock was acquired by Symantec Corp. which was renamed to NortonLifeLock in 2019. LifeLock is now included in the Norton 360 service; Avira offers users a similar service called Breach Monitor.

Like Norton 360 Avira comes with a cryptominer already installed but customers have to opt in to using the service that powers it. Avira’s FAQ on its cryptomining service is somewhat sparse. For example it doesn’t specify how much NortonLifeLock gets out of the deal (NortonLifeLock keeps 15 percent of any cryptocurrency mined by Norton Crypto).

“Avira Crypto allows you to use your computer’s idle time to mine the cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH)” the FAQ explains. “Since cryptomining requires a high level of processing power it is not suitable for users with an average computer. Even with compatible hardware mining cryptocurrencies on your own can be less rewarding. Your best option is to join a mining pool that shares their computer power to improve their chance of mining cryptocurrency. The rewards are then distributed evenly to all members in the pool.”

NortonLifeLock hasn’t yet responded to requests for comment so it’s unclear whether Avira uses the same cryptomining code as Norton Crypto. But there are clues that suggest that’s the case. NortonLifeLock announced Avira Crypto in late October 2021 but multiple other antivirus products have flagged Avira’s installer as malicious or unsafe for including a cryptominer as far back as Sept. 9 2021.

The above screenshot was taken on Virustotal.com a service owned by Google that scans submitted files against dozens of antivirus products. The detection report pictured was found by searching Virustotal for “ANvOptimusEnablementCuda” a function included in the Norton Crypto mining component “Ncrypt.exe.”

Some longtime Norton customers took to NortonLifeLock’s online forum to express horror at the prospect of their antivirus product installing coin-mining software regardless of whether the mining service was turned off by default.

“Norton should be DETECTING and killing off crypto mining hijacking not installing their own” reads a Dec. 28 thread on Norton’s forum titled “Absolutely furious.”

Others have charged that the crypto offering will end up costing customers more in electricity bills than they can ever hope to gain from letting their antivirus mine ETH. What’s more there are hefty fees involved in moving any ETH mined by Norton or Avira Crypto to an account that the user can cash out and many users apparently don’t understand they can’t cash out until they at least earn enough ETH to cover the fees.

In August 2021 NortonLifeLock said it had reached an agreement to acquire Avast another longtime free antivirus product that also claims to have around 500 million users. It remains to be seen whether Avast Crypto will be the next brilliant offering from NortonLifeLock.

As mentioned in this week’s story on Norton Crypto I get that participation in these cryptomining schemes is voluntary but much of that ultimately hinges on how these crypto programs are pitched and whether users really understand what they’re doing when they enable them. But what bugs me most is they will be introducing hundreds of millions of perhaps less savvy Internet users to the world of cryptocurrency which comes with its own set of unique security and privacy challenges that require users to “level up” their personal security practices in fairly significant ways.

Update Jan. 28 9:41 a.m.: I meant to add this sooner but not long after this story ran I heard from NortonLifeLock that the company only had 80 million customers and that my 500 million headline was incorrect.

“Your headline says that 500M Avira AV users were introduced to Cryptomining” NortonLifeLock wrote to KrebsOnSecurity. “However our company has approximately 80 million users globally. Additionally NortonLifeLock and Avast remain separate companies.”

I thought this was odd given that Avira’s homepage very clearly stated the company had 500 million users:

NortonLifeLock thanked me for the information and said it was removing all instances of that number from its Web properties. The company has yet to explain whether that 500 million number was ever anywhere close to reality and if so what happened to all those users.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H.

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

At universities and colleges across the country police are sweeping through encampments supporting Gaza trying to clear protesters from the grounds. But at Brown University’s encampment on the campus’s main green in the middle of Providence Rhode Island the biggest drama last Shabbat was that the candles would not stay lit.

This was more or less the calm atmosphere of Brown’s encampment for the six days it stood; it was not plagued by the antisemitism violence or arrests that have dominated headlines about schools including Columbia and the University of California Los Angeles. There were no clashes with counterprotesters and no police presence. The encampment’s daily schedule included tai chi and a talent show alongside teach-ins and rallies. People tossed frisbees next to the tents.

On Tuesday the protesting students at Brown reached an agreement with the university’s administration and voluntarily dismantled their encampment.

Life on the Ivy League campus wasn’t always so calm. In the wake of Oct. 7 61 students were arrested at various sit-ins. Some student groups celebrated Hamas’ massacre. People took pictures of Israeli students on campus and posted on anonymous social media with captions disparaging them as Zionists.

Fractures deepened after a Palestinian Brown undergraduate Hisham Awartani was shot in Burlington Vermont along with two other Palestinian friends; they were all wearing kaffiyehs. Brown-RISD Hillel put out a statement mourning the shooting but also castigating “a torrent of antisemitic hatred” online saying that Hillel’s “support for Israel and Zionist students is unassailable.”

Some Jewish and Israeli students who had previously been involved with Hillel broke ties calling the email “tone-deaf” and “a disgusting response to a hate crime.” At a vigil for Awartani a speaker said his blood was on the hands of Zionist students.

But around May’s encampment that vitriol seemed to have dissipated. Chants were focused on the activists’ demands — divestment not from Israel as a whole but from companies involved in the oppression of Palestinians — and not on broader statements about Zionism or Israel’s existence. Some of Brown’s most vocal Zionist students members of opposing campus group Brown Students for Israel said that they felt safe.

Students told me that the encampment chose not to chant “from the river to the sea” — common at most protests — because one student who was part of the tent group said it made them feel uncomfortable. (The chant did occur once on the encampment’s final day.)

What enabled this shift? And who planted the seeds for compromise on Brown’s central lawn?

I asked this question of many at Brown students faculty and rabbis and their answers all pointed to a willingness to cross ideological divides. Where protesters at other campuses adopted “do not engage” policies at Brown they kept talking.

“On the periphery of the encampment there were a number of students in conversation with one another some of which I think people might have imagined were unlikely pairs to be having conversations across political differences” said Jason Klein the rabbi for Jewish life in the chaplain’s office. “That’s something I think that Brown students can often do well.”

This isn’t of course to say that everyone approved of the encampment or agreed with its demands. Some students and staff at the Brown-RISD Hillel harshly criticize the campus environment. And many activists call for more extreme measures and more rigid stances — most students I spoke with mentioned more radical factions on campus that don’t fret over upsetting their peers.

But they no longer dominate at Brown.

The encampment maintained a middle ground of sorts in part due to a monthslong committed dialogue organized and run by students to talk through the toughest issues and feelings and try to understand each other.

And many students said that the relative calm and success of the protest was thanks in large part to the deep engagement of Jewish students in the campus’s activist movements.

Jews at the center

The first sit-in for divestment at Brown in November last year was composed entirely of Jewish students. In their first statement in the student newspaper The Brown Daily Herald the group mourned the murders on Oct. 7 and affirmed its “connection to the amorphous spiritual entity” of Israel but declared itself anti-Zionist.

Soon after they named themselves BrownU Jews for Ceasefire Now; many of its members were part of Brown’s encampment. JFCN as most on campus call it has organized protests or actions but also created an independent study course for those grappling with Judaism Jewish identity and Israel; organized dinners for Jews who clash over Israel; and invited other students to come and ask questions of its members promising to cast no judgment. It has also hosted weekly Shabbat services — including the one at the encampment — as well as holiday celebrations.

Maddie a senior with JFCN who spoke on condition that only her first name be used so as not to compromise her employment prospects in the Jewish professional world said the group hosts large Shabbat dinners and has created an “alternative ritual space” for Jews “who don’t want to feel like they’re praying to a flag.”

About 24% of Brown’s student body is Jewish and most of them according to Rabbi Joshua Bolton the head of the Brown-RISD Hillel “exist in a broad center and in fact they don’t necessarily feel represented by activists on either side of this issue.”

Nevertheless Jewish students comprise a significant portion — it’s not clear exactly how large — of pro-Palestinian activists on campus. Their deep engagement and leadership seems to have helped insulate the movement from becoming as divisive as on other campuses.

When an outside group from Providence came to the encampment and handed out flyers urging a global intifada over the weekend students pushed back saying that was not part of their messaging. They kept their chants focused on divestment and criticism of Brown’s leadership.

“The heavy Jewish presence in these pro-Palestine circles ensures that there will never be the extreme blatant antisemitism” said Ma’ayan Stutman-Shaw a first-year student who is not involved with the protests. “And it’s Jews who are really engaged with the Jewish community not Jews who picked up Judaism on Oct. 10 because they wanted to fight for Palestine — Jews who have been thinking about this constantly they are the ones who are leading this movement on campus.”

Of course much of the pro-Palestinian organizing has been led by non-Jewish students as well.

But much of the pushback to pro-Palestinian protests — concerns about antisemitism and what they see as calls to dismantle Israel — have come from Jewish students who are concerned about antisemitism or who have ties to Israel. And that’s where the leadership of Jewish student activists has come in.

“Jewish students are going to have a better understanding of what will trigger other Jewish students” said Asher Radziner a senior who has been leading conversations on campus.

A safety blanket

Many Jewish students I spoke to said the university encouraged conversations among students over Israel and the war but never convened any that students found inviting.

“It hasn’t really provided those spaces” said Eiden Spilker a senior involved with JFCN. “There just haven’t been contexts to engage in good faith.”

So instead students built their own.

Outside the encampment while it stood JFCN students — none of whom were camping on the green — had set up a dialogue space: a blanket and a painted canvas that said “Questions? Comments? Concerns? Come talk.”

Every day that the encampment stood at least two students sat there waiting for people to approach them. The group also facilitated conversations during a student hunger strike in February when 17 students fasted for eight days to protest the refusal of the Corporation of Brown University which governs the investment of Brown’s endowment to hear a proposal for divestment.

JFCN members said they are looking especially to engage with Jewish and Zionist students. Spilker whose father is a rabbi and whose mother is a cantor said JFCN understands where they’re coming from.

“We’ve been there and we’re in a position where we can empathize with that” he said. “It’s less about trying to convince people and more about hearing them and having dialogue and creating a space that ideally Hillel would’ve created but because of their ideology and current leadership have not been able to make.”

(“We are a home for every Jewish student” said Bolton the director of the campus Hillel when told of the criticism from some Jewish students. “That doesn’t mean that we’re a home for every type of program.”)

On blanket duty one recent morning Spilker greeted a student who introduced himself as Kareem not giving his last name and had questions. He asked about the use of the term genocide and the impact of divestment. Spilker thought before he spoke and then drew on theories he learned in classes he’d taken.

“I think it is a question of at which stage do you call it a genocide — is it just at the final stage of mass extermination?” he said.

“That’s a good point” Kareem responded. “I hadn’t heard that before that it’s a process.”

Spilker said he’s had all kinds of people come up to him at the blanket: students from the campus pro-Israel group students from settlements in the West Bank alumni faculty a local imam worried parents of prospective students who had just taken the campus tours that walked by the encampment multiple times a day.

“That was the main goal in setting this up. Like: We’re here to talk to you we’re not a threat to you” he said. “There are people who understand what we’re doing here or may not fully agree but appreciate what’s happening and appreciate that we’re opening up this space.”

Caught in the middle

One of those appreciative students is Stutman-Shaw. She doesn’t feel comfortable being part of the group but said she still agrees with much of what JFCN is doing on campus particularly its work to keep students talking to one another. Those efforts have “made me really proud to go to this school” she said.

At the same time the Jewish involvement in the protest movement has put Stutman-Shaw into a difficult position. JFCN hosts a Shabbat service each week with two options for prayer: a Reform service and a traditional-egalitarian one that uses traditional liturgy but doesn’t divide servicegoers by gender. It’s so popular that it can make it hard for Hillel to field a minyan for its own version of that service several students told me.

But JFCN’s homemade siddur doesn’t sit right with Stutman-Shaw. It has a disclaimer explaining that the word “Yisrael” in prayers doesn’t refer to the country of Israel but to the Jewish people and to the biblical parable in which Jacob wrestles with God. For Stutman-Shaw that’s not how she views her spirituality; when she prays to Yisrael she said she does think of the country and the time she’s spent there.

That means she often finds herself without her preferred mode of prayer; instead she usually attends the Orthodox minyan at Hillel.

“JFCN right now is the best egalitarian service that you can find on campus” she said citing the passion of the students involved. “Part of me feels really happy for that and part of me like that really breaks my heart because I feel like I can’t really be there fully in who I am.”

Stutman-Shaw is attempting to resuscitate the Brown chapter of J Street U which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel pro-peace pro-democracy Americans.” The chapter dissolved in the wake of Oct. 7 because the national organization had failed to call for a ceasefire. She hopes it will be a place where student can both condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza and support the existence of the state.

Still while she endeavors to build her own Jewish space on campus Stutman-Shaw said JFCN has been integral to the success of Brown’s pro-Palestinian movement.

“A lot of Israeli students were leading the protests a lot of Jewish students with connection to Israel” she said. “So they were really trying to emphasize the importance of diverse ideological dialogue.”

Dinners across disagreement

Stutman-Shaw has been attending an event called Dinners in Progress created by two other students who hold differing views on the conflict in the Middle East that seeks to bring groups of the not-likeminded students together to talk about Israel Gaza and the atmosphere on campus.

“For the first time since Oct. 7 I see the SJP president who happens to be Jewish and someone who is from the Gush talking about Israel” Stutman-Shaw said referring to the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a group of settlements in the West Bank. “And that’s so exciting.”

Radziner who is one of the co-founders said the dinners arose from the idea that “it would be great to have a dialogue space that wasn’t controlled by the university that wasn’t run by faculty or adults but run by students for students — not run by an organization like Hillel or even JFCN.”

The office of student life at Brown put him in touch with another student Zoey Fisher and gave them funding to buy dinner which is always a draw for college students.

In the three dinners so far a cohort of 14 Jewish students discussed their personal connections to Israel were able to express frustration with each other and dug deeply into their disagreements.

“It’s very easy for people who feel very strongly about something and want to act on it to get together and take action” Radziner said. “But often that comes at the expense of continued dialogue with people who disagree with you.”

The dinners he said “keep it going.”

‘I’ve had too many bad experiences’

Not everyone feels that the conversation has been quite so welcoming. Rabbi Joshua Bolton the director of the Brown-RISD Hillel critiqued what he saw as students holing up in “ideological fortresses.”

“Wisdom is revealed in places where we know very little where there’s vulnerability” Bolton said. “And so it would strike me that the opportunity before students at Brown is not to build an encampment that keeps everyone of a differing opinion out but really embrace the idea of let us go camping together in the wilderness.”

He blames the Brown faculty in part for building ideological fortresses and setting a bad example for students.

In many ways Hillel has been the target of the worst of the ire from protests. Bolton and the assistant director of the Hillel Molly Goldmeier received death threats several months ago.

“It’s just very hard for me to imagine what I’ve endured” he said “and there not being a major campus revolt on account of it.” he said. The campus he posits would be outraged had the head of the Brown Center for Students of Color received such threats.

“I think that kind of reflects where students are at right now” he added.

Teddy Horowitz a senior said he too feels unwelcome on campus because of his Zionism; he said he’d lost numerous friendships because of his love for Israel and his membership in the campus pro-Israel group Brown Students for Israel.

Horowitz largely agrees with the activists’ demands for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s occupation but is deeply concerned about antisemitism within the movement. He said the Brown SJP chapter had expressed admiration for Hamas and that he’s seen antisemitism rise on campus social media. He also saw no place to mourn Israelis murdered in the Oct. 7 attack because of the dominance of pro-Palestinian activism on campus.

Many of his activist classmates fall into two groups he said. “There are the Jews and students who think Oct. 7 was a victory and there’s the activists who are willing to put up with that” he said. “And I don’t want to deal with either group anymore; I’ve had too many bad experiences.”

Horowitz turned to the campus Hillel and Chabad where he found community with like-minded friends. But he remains discouraged by what he sees as echo chambers on campus.

To combat this he founded a new publication the Brown Jewish Journal. “When the Jewish Journal started one of the editors was an anti-Zionist and I was really suspicious of him at first” Horowitz recounted. But as they began to read and edit each other’s work that changed. “Now I really look forward to talking about Israel-Palestine with him” he said.

Horowitz who spoke to me in the days before protesters and the university struck an agreement to dismantle the encampment said the climate on campus had improved since the weeks after Oct. 7.

“I’m really pleasantly surprised with how well this protest is going” he said of the encampment. “Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that these people might be pretty chill.”

But he still feels “betrayed” by the campus community. “I love the outpouring of empathy for Palestinians — they need it!” he said. “I just wish some of the empathy was directed our way as well.”

A campus less divided than it looks

Every student I spoke to said they think even the groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on Israel actually well mostly agree.

“You’ll find a lot more in common with BSI members and JFCN members than either of them would ever admit” said Stutman-Shaw.

But they did admit it. When I spoke with them both BSI and JFCN members made the same point — that most of them agree on a lot of points including criticism of the Israeli government horror at the deaths of civilians in Gaza and a desire for a ceasefire.

Talking with students from across the campus’s Jewish community the divides largely came down to details — students who want a ceasefire but are uncomfortable with using terms such as “genocide” or “anti-Zionist.” Or students who are reluctant to try to find common ground or engage with students who reacted to Oct. 7 in a way that upset them.

But many of them on all sides are trying to push through their discomfort to understand each other even when it’s difficult.

“Movements are imperfect” Radziner said. “Once you understand that you’re all working towards the same goal with different ways of getting there it lets you start to not overlook but push through the parts that you disagree with or find challenging.”

That’s what Klein the rabbi in the chaplain’s office hopes will define Brown’s protest movement.

“I was really proud that these students were still really in it and trying to make it imperfect for everyone” he said. “Everyone gets to be uncomfortable everyone gets to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why do brown eggs cost more than white eggs? Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbG9jYWxwcm92LmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0dWRlbnRzLXdoby1mZWVsLWxpa2UtaGFtYXMtaXMtbm9ibGUtc2hvdWxkLWxlYXZlLWJyb3duLXNheXMtZG9ub3Itd2hvLWlz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire Donor Criticizes Brown's Deal With Protesters — Halts His Financial Support,"Billionaire Donor Criticizes Brown’s Deal With Protesters — Halts His Financial Support

A billionaire donor to Brown University said he is pausing his giving — due to the Ivy League institution’s deal with pro-Palestinian protesters.

“The real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht’s scathing criticism of his alma mater is the most immediate blowback against the school’s deal to end protests on campus” reported The New York Times.

“One of Brown University’s major donors the billionaire real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht on Friday sharply criticized the school’s agreement to hold a board vote on cutting investments tied to Israel calling it 'unconscionable' and saying he had 'paused' donations to the school” wrote the Times.

As GoLocal reported on April 30 ""The group had demanded that Brown divest the University’s investment from a group of defense industry corporations tied to Israel.

The Brown administration did not agree to the demands. Instead Brown President Christina Paxson’s administration committed that the Brown Corporation would consider such an action at its October meeting.”

Latest Protest Fallout

The Times writes ""Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on 'facts and moral clarity' as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.""

According to the Times Sternlicht said he had donated more than $20 million to Brown but would not give more for now.

“Dr. Paxson referred a request for comment to a spokesman for Brown who declined to comment directly instead sending a statement reading in part that 'there are few issues as contentious and deeply felt as those related to Israel'"" the Times reported.

“Mr. Sternlicht in his letter had pointed words for Dr. Paxson suggesting that she should be more critical of Hamas and willing to push out professors who engaged in hate speech” according to the Times. “As for the protesters formerly on the quadrangle Mr. Sternlicht wrote that students who ‘feel like Hamas is noble’ should leave Brown.”

GoLocal unveiled in November the details of the ties between Palestinian donors to Brown and the funding of a controversial professor.

The professor who those gifts supported is Beshara B Doumani the Mahmoud Darwish Professor of Palestinian Studies at Brown. He also simultaneously has served as the President of Birzeit University from 2021 to 2023 located in the Palestinian West Bank territory. His Brown University bio does not mention his role heading the Palestinian University but his Birzeit bio features his role at Brown.

When Doumani was named to the Presidency at Birzeit the American conservation publication the American Spectator wrote ""Palestine’s ‘Terrorist University’ Picks Ivy League Prof as New President."" Doumani is back teaching at Brown and has shared the stage speaking to students about the war along with Paxson.

“The blowback from Mr. Sternlicht who has described himself as a political independent and whose name is on a Brown residence hall shows how quickly the issue of divestment from Israel may vex universities. Until a week ago even discussing the subject was widely considered a nonstarter as it was sure to divide a large swath of students and faculty from many of the businesspeople whose donations fill university endowments” wrote the Times.

(Raul Roa / Los Angeles Times)

Scores of emaciated brown pelicans too weak to fly have been found on Southern California beaches in the last month and taken to an Orange County rescue center according to its director.

“We’re getting dozens of calls” Debbie McGuire executive director of the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach said on Saturday. “People are finding them in parking lots and their backyards.”

The rescued pelicans she said “are coming in at half their body weight. They are also very anemic.”

So far she said it’s unclear why the pelicans which feed on anchovies sardines and mackerel are suffering from malnutrition.

McGuire said that she contacted scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last week who told her that there was “plenty of bait out there” for the birds to feed on.

“We don’t know the cause” she said. “They are just all starving.”

Overwhelmed by the number of ailing birds the wildlife center has been erecting pup tents to use as pens she said.

In the last month the center has taken in 89 brown pelicans many of them quickly dying McGuire said. More than 30 have survived she said as the center warmed them under heat lamps and gave them fluids.

She said the center sent tissue samples from the birds to labs for testing.

A similar spike in the stranding of brown pelicans up and down the California coast occurred in the spring of 2022. The cause has not been found.

The California brown pelican was listed as an endangered species decades ago after the spread of the chemical DDT caused the shells of their eggs to thin. The eggs became so fragile that nesting mothers crushed them.

After DDT was banned the pelicans increased in number. The birds were removed from the endangered species list in 2009.

Wildlife officials say that anyone finding an ailing pelican should not touch or try to feed them. They urge people to instead call their local wildlife rehabilitation facilities. The Orange County center can be reached at (714) 374-5587.

The first-ever Las Vegas Super Bowl at Allegiant Stadium is more than two years away but organizers already have started planning what could be the largest single-event economic boom in the city’s history.

The host committee for the 2024 Super Bowl needs $60 million to prepare for the game and related festivities. On Tuesday the nonprofit will ask the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority board of directors for up to $40 million of that total. The other $20 million is expected to be collected through fundraising.

Representatives of the LVCVA which is funded largely by hotel room taxes declined comment until Tuesday’s meeting.

The Super Bowl host committee for last year’s game reported a total economic impact of $571.9 million and 4597 full- and part-time jobs for the Tampa Florida area when it hosted Super Bowl LV.

The $60 million in seed money for Super Bowl LVIII scheduled for Feb. 11 2024 is required by the NFL which has staged its championship game at several different cities around the country over the years.

The Super Bowl won’t be Las Vegas’ first partnership with the NFL. The LVCVA board of directors in February 2020 approved up to $2.4 million to host the NFL draft in Las Vegas. The city was to host the draft in April 2020 but the outbreak of COVID-19 postponed that party until this year.

The board also approved up to $1.75 million in July 2020 to host the 2022 Pro Bowl which will be played at Allegiant Stadium on Feb. 6.

It’s important to note that the host committee isn’t looking to spend money just for the game itself.

At least a week of festivities will lead up to the game including a Super Bowl Experience Fan Fest; a media center and media party for more than 6000 working members of the national and international press covering the week from Las Vegas; “Opening Night” and “NFL Honors” live television broadcasts; a live entertainment and concert series; sponsor activations; corporate hospitality events; and other activities that will drive tourism to the city and cast an international spotlight showcasing Las Vegas as the sports and entertainment capital of the world.

The NFL has penciled out $20.8 million for direct operating costs. Those include:

— $3.85 million in staff costs.

— $3 million in sponsorship fulfillment — collateral and promotional materials.

— $3 million toward public safety including police fire and emergency services.

— $2.7 million in advertising marketing and decor.

— $1.65 million for media public relations and hospitality.

— $1.6 million for other expenses like office space professional services and insurance.

— $5 million for contingencies.

There are event-related costs of $39.2 million. Those include:

— $17 million reimbursement to the NFL.

— $6 million in stadium costs.

— $2 million for hotels and meeting spaces.

— $2.5 million for parking and transportation.

— $2.2 million for Super Bowl events.

— $5 million for tickets and suites.

— $1.25 million for volunteers.

— $750000 for permits.

— $1.5 million for other expenses including practice facilities technology and an accreditation center.

— $1 million for contingencies.

The host committee chaired by Allegiant Travel Co. CEO Maury Gallagher will oversee the full-time temporary staff members who will be hired to execute Las Vegas’ obligations hosting Super Bowl LVIII. The LVCVA working with the host committee will serve as a liaison between the NFL resort and community stakeholders and local governmental agencies.

It’s clear that with a Super Bowl on the calendar the public’s significant investment in Allegiant Stadium will more than pay off within two years. By now everyone should know the facility isn’t just for the Raiders — although the NFL world’s eyes will be on Allegiant for Sunday’s prime-time do-or-die game between the Raiders and the Los Angeles Chargers.

Allegiant Stadium is the go-to venue for dozens of special events that help drive the valley’s economic prosperity.

FINAL: WIZARDS 102 | MAGIC 100

Behind a career night from Kyle Kuzma and a clutch showing from Bradley Beal the Wizards earned a hard-fought 102-100 win over the Magic on Sunday night in Orlando. Kuzma finished with a team-high 27 points to go along with 22 rebounds becoming the first Wizard to record a 20-20 game since Antawn Jamison in 2010.

Kuzma played the entire fourth quarter and scored 14 of his 27 points in the final frame. He now has 20-plus points in seven-consecutive games with double-digit rebounds in five of those seven.

“Kyle made some huge plays” Wizards head coach Wes Unseld Jr. said postgame. “He rebounded the ball exceptionally well tonight. We know he can make big shots. He’s made big shots for us all season. He’s staying in attack mode which is great.”

After Washington missed two of four free throws in the games closing seconds Orlando had a chance to win the game on the final possession but Beal extended and blocked a 3-point attempt by Gary Harris at the buzzer sealing the Wizards win.

“It was a tremendous play” Unseld Jr. said. “His athleticism to make a play like that is huge.”

With 20 points and seven assists Beal has now tallied 20-plus points and five-plus assist in each of his last nine games.

The Washington defense started the night strong holding Orlando to just three points in the first 4:25 of the game – and opened the game on an 13-3 run highlighted by a step-back corner 3-pointer from Beal. The Magic had an answer rattling off a 23-4 run late in the first quarter to nearly take a double-digit lead of their own.

Rui Hachimura who missed the Wizards’ first 39 games of the season made his 2021-22 debut on Sunday night checking in with 6:30 left in the first quarter. Hachimura finished the night with six points three rebounds and an assist in 14 minutes. He scored his first points of the night on a free throw with 7:41 left in the second quarter and his first field goal on a baseline dunk just over a minute later. Late in the third quarter Hachimura grabbed an offensive rebound off a Raul Neto miss and slammed home his second dunk of the night.

“I thought he did great” Unseld Jr. said of Hachimura. “He was aggressive. I think he gives you that physicality that we lack at times. His size his ability to play off the bounce.”

“It was great” Hachimura said postgame. “I’ve been waiting or this moment. I had to take a little time off but I’m so happy to be back on the court and playing with these guys. I missed the feeling. It was great.”

Mid-way through the third Daniel Gafford recorded a block on one end and got down the court to catch an alley-oop on the other to cap a 16-6 Wizards run to start the second half. Washington’s lead however did not last. Terrence Ross scored 16 of his 32 points in the third quarter shooting 7-7 (.1000) from the field in the third quarter alone to lead a Magic resurgence.

Down 77-69 in the opening minutes of the fourth Davis Bertans knocked down threes on back-to-back possessions before a driving bank shot by Kuzma cut the Orlando lead to 79-77. In a back-and-forth final few minutes Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope buried corner threes to set up the wild sequence in the final seconds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYmF5bmV3czkuY29tL2ZsL3RhbXBhL3dlYXRoZXIvMjAyMi8wMS8wOS9kaWQtZmxvcmlkYS1yZWdhaW4tdGl0bGUtZm9yLWxpZ2h0bmluZy1jYXBpdGFsLW9mLXUtcy3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida regains the title for lightning capital of the U.S.,"Florida regains its title as the lightning capital of the United States when it comes to strikes per square mile.

Vaisala the company that owns the National Lightning Data Network has issued its report on lightning strikes in 2021 for the U.S. and the world.

What You Need To Know Florida is the lightning capital of the United States



The state averaged 223 strikes per square mile in 2021



U.S. recorded lowest lightning fatality count on record



Florida observed four lightning deaths in 2021

In 2020 Oklahoma stole Florida's title as lightning capital when it came to the number of strikes per square kilometer. In 2021 Florida stole the title back.

Florida is once again the lightning capital of the United States based on strikes per square kilometer. The Sunshine State averaged 223 lightning events per square mile for the whole year.

Just east of Orlando Geneve is the new lightning capital of the state. The Big Econlockhatchee Wildlife Management area had 857 lightning strikes per square mile in 2021.

However when it comes down to what town specifically is considered the lightning capital in the U.S. Flatonia Texas wins the title for having the greatest number of lightning strikes. Located between Houston and San Antonio Flatonia recorded nearly 1000 strikes per square kilometer.

Here are the top nine lightning states based on strike density per square mile:

Florida Louisiana Texas Mississippi Oklahoma Missouri Illinois Kansas Arkansas

In 2020 Oklahoma took the title as the new lightning capital stealing it from Florida. But since last year was pretty inactive by Oklahoma storm standards the Sooner State dropped to fifth place in 2021.

What was the least active state for lightning in the U.S.? You probably could have guessed this one… Alaska!

The second least active state was Washington.

Globally Florida and the rest of the United States aren’t close to the top. When people say “Florida is the lightning capital of the world” I have to laugh and say no it isn’t even close.

Here are the top nine lightning countries based on strike density per square mile in 2021:

Singapore Macao (an independent city in China on the South China Sea) Brunei (Southeast Asia) The Democratic Republic of the Congo (Africa) Cambodia (Southeast Asia) El Salvador (Central America) Republic of the Congo (Africa) Cuba (Caribbean) Vietnam (Southeast Asia)

The most active day for lightning in the United States in 2021 was May 2. There was a multi-day severe weather outbreak in progress and more than four million strikes were recorded (and 88 tornadoes). May 2 had double the number of strikes as the next most active day in 2021 Aug. 10.

What is also interesting to note is the incredibly low fatality count in 2021. Even though one death is one too many 2021 had its fewest lightning deaths on record which began in 1940. That is far fewer than the 432 fatalities that were recorded in 1943.

Florida recorded four lightning deaths in 2021: two on the beach one on a golf course and another while a man was working on a roof.

Spectrum News would like to thank Chris Vagasky at Vaisala for this yearly report of interesting lightning information.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vdmlyZ2luaWFzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvYWNoL2tlaXRoLWdhaXRoZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Keith Gaither – Virginia Cavaliers Official Athletic Site,"Keith Gaither is in his second season at Virginia as the special teams coordinator and running backs coach.

In his first year with the Cavaliers he helped develop punter Daniel Sparks into an all-ACC selection after he led the league in punting average.

He spent the 2020 and 2021 seasons as the wide receivers coach at Army for head coach Jeff Monken. He previously worked at West Point as the wide receivers coach for the 2015 and 2016 seasons. He spent the 2019 campaign at Western Michigan.

The 2021 Army squad defeated Missouri 24-22 to win the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl to finish the season 9-4. The 2020 Army squad went 9-3 and made an appearance in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl. Cadet receivers averaged 20.55 yards per reception this season in the team’s run-oriented offense. Army’s 11 touchdown receptions in 2021 was the most since the 2015 season.

Prior to Western Michigan Gaither was the pass game coordinator and wide receivers coach at East Carolina (2017-18) where he was responsible for the instruction and teaching of all aspects of the wide receiver position in a multiple pro-style offense. In each of his two seasons the Pirates produced a first-team all-conference wide receiver in Trevon Brown.

During his first stint at Army (2015-16) Gaither directed the Black Knights’ receiving corps. His pass catchers stood fourth nationally in yards-per-reception with a 17.9 average in 2016 during Army’s successful 8-5 campaign which included a 21-17 win over Navy and a 38-31 overtime victory against North Texas in the Zaxby’s Heart of Dallas Bowl.

In his first year at West Point Gaither coached Edgar Poe and DeAndre Bell to notable performances. Poe produced a trio of 100-yard receiving games and caught six touchdown passes which was the most by a Black Knight since 2007 while Bell turned in career highs in receptions and yards as a senior.

Prior to Army Gaither was wide receivers coach at Ball State from 2011 to 2014 and helped guide the Cardinals to back-to-back bowl appearances in 2012 (Beef ‘O’ Brady’s) and 2013 (GoDaddy.com).

While in Muncie Gaither was responsible for a combined three All-Mid-American Conference first-team selections in 2012 and 2013 along with second-team and third-team All-MAC picks in 2014. One of his top pupils was current Carolina Panthers’ wide receiver Willie Snead who set BSU single-season receiving records in yardage (1516) catches (106) and touchdowns (15) in 2013.

Gaither also impacted his players off the field as Briggs Orsbon earned Capital One Academic All-America honors in 2011 while Connor Ryan was a Capital One Academic All-District choice a year later. Orsbon completed his career as only the second receiver in Ball State history to record over 200 career catches.

Before coming to Ball State Gaither had a two-year stint at his alma mater Elon in 2009 and 2010. He helped Terrell Hudgins establish 19 NCAA Southern Conference and Phoenix records and to a runner-up finish in the voting for the 2009 Walter Payton Award which formally recognizes the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) Player-of-the-Year. Additionally Gaither mentored All-American pass catcher and Baltimore Ravens draft pick Aaron Mellette while at Elon.

Gaither began his coaching career in 1997 as defensive backs coach at Greensboro (N.C.) College before moving to Tusculum (Tenn.) College for the 1998 and 1999 campaigns. Following a five-year run as an assistant at alma mater Thomasville (N.C.) High School Gaither returned to the college ranks as Winston-Salem State’s recruiting coordinator and defensive backs coach from 2005 to 2008.

A four-year starter and two-time all-region performer as a member of the Phoenix secondary Gaither earned his bachelor’s degree in sociology from Elon in 1997.

It's the third time in 47 years the dome has received a copper makeover this one at a cost of $870000.

And it comes just a decade after the last project which replaced a hail-damaged roof in time for the state centennial in 2012. Its comparatively short life was due to what state building officials believe was a flaw in its installation.

Copper sheathing was laid out on the dome and then sealed. During the gap between rolling out the copper panels and sealing them dust and other particles landed on the copper and got embedded in the metal said Megan Rose a spokesperson for the state Department of Administration.

That caused the copper to corrode turning it a dark black.

This time the copper was sealed inside a warehouse ""which makes a big difference in keeping the actual copper color"" she said.

The project wrapped up Dec. 31.

The copper was supplied by Western States Metal Roofing but whether its DNA can be traced to Arizona copper mines is difficult Rose said.

“Because it’s recycled copper we can’t tie it to a particular place"" she said.

The recycling continues with the copper that was removed in the fall. Rose said discussions are underway on how to reuse that material.

“We have opportunities to do something cool with it"" she said adding more details will come later.

Although the copper dome is an iconic part of the historic state Capitol it does not date from the Capitol's completion in 1900. For the first 75 years of its life the stone-constructed dome was painted copper according to state historical records.

In 1975 the Arizona Mining Association donated the material to create the first authentic copper dome.

Stacy Rubio who owns Western States Metal Roofing with her husband Mike said the new roof is more durable than its predecessor but would not predict how long it would last.

It's a ""rigid stout roof"" she said. ""I'm sure it's going to do a lot better than the last time.""

While exchanges or brokers only need to report “miscellaneous income” to the IRS your responsibility as a taxpayer doesn't end there. You’ll also need to report all of your capital gains and losses when you file your taxes.

The reports below aren’t official IRS forms — they’re generated by Coinbase and intended to help you get started with your own calculations.

Gain/loss report

As the name suggests your gain/loss report is a roundup of every transaction you made on Coinbase that resulted in a capital gain or loss like selling spending or converting crypto. Note: today Coinbase won’t report your gains or losses to the IRS.

Here’s a quick rundown of what you’ll see:

For each transaction for which we have a record Coinbase calculates your gain or loss by taking the proceeds you received and subtracting the cost basis (i.e. the price at which you originally bought or received your crypto).

Your gains or losses can either be long term (if you held your crypto for more than a year before selling or disposing of it) or short term (if you held it for less than a year).

Coinbase customers can manage their cost basis method in their tax center settings  where they can choose between a HIFO (highest in first out) LIFO (last in first out) and FIFO (first in first out). Whatever method you use can impact your return so make sure to consult a tax professional before choosing a strategy.

Your gain/loss report will only include transactions you made using your Coinbase account. It won’t include activity from other platforms or Coinbase products like Coinbase Wallet Coinbase Pro or Coinbase Prime.

If you sold crypto on Coinbase that was originally acquired outside of Coinbase (like if you traded crypto on a decentralized exchange) speak with your tax professional or use a tool like CryptoTaxCalculator or CoinTracker  since Coinbase won't have information about your cost basis.

If you use Coinbase you can sign in and download your gain/loss report using Coinbase Taxes for your records or upload it right into TurboTax whenever you’re ready to file.

Raw transaction report

If you or your CPA are up for the challenge of manually calculating gains you can use your raw transaction report to reconcile all of your gains and losses before filing your taxes. This report lists the cost basis of all of your transactions without their associated gains and losses."

Disease can have incredible impacts on the path of history. It can alter civilizations even destroy them. Sometimes its effects are less momentous though just as real.

Such was the case when an epidemic helped Vermont start to make its name in the world of winter sports.

An outbreak of smallpox the often-deadly disease struck Montreal in February 1885. As the disease spread city officials’ efforts to vaccinate the population and isolate the infected were met with protests and even rioting.

Vaccination opponents called doctors “charlatans” and claimed that the vaccines were intended to poison children. Montreal was supposed to host a winter carnival in February 1886 that would draw crowds of at least 25000 from Canada and the United States.

Still unable to contain the outbreak officials decided to cancel the carnival.

The crisis north of the border gave civic leaders in Burlington an opportunity. The city was in the grip not of a deadly disease but of a winter sports craze. Just the year before in 1885 a group of prominent area residents had banded together to form the Burlington Coasting Club.

“Coasting” was what today we would call “sliding” or “sledding.” Riders used anything from small sleds to giant “traverses” capable of carrying as many as 15 riders. The club’s goal was to promote a range of winter sports including “Coasting Toboggan Sliding Snow-Shoeing Ice Skating and Curling.”

Details about the club and its winter carnival are contained in an intriguing article by Betsy Beattie that appeared in the 1980s in Vermont History the journal of the Vermont Historical Society.

The club was founded in an attempt to legitimize a sport that some in town viewed as a public menace. “Coasters” frequented many Burlington streets taking advantage of the steep slopes down to Lake Champlain and often made their breakneck runs well after dark. City officials worried about the deep ruts the sleds left in the snow-covered roadways and feared that sleds would collide with pedestrians sleighs or one of the city’s new horse-drawn trolleys.

Their concerns were well founded. Only the large traverses had any real safety equipment and its efficacy was debatable at best. The traverses were sometimes equipped with a crude headlight and a gong to warn bystanders of their approach. The rest of their safety equipment consisted of hand and foot rails a steering mechanism and brakes though how quickly they could stop is unclear since the largest sleds could reach speeds of more than 60 miles per hour.

A coasting confession

During the winter of 1884-85 Mayor Urban Woodbury banned coasting on Burlington’s streets. In February 1885 the state’s attorney for Chittenden County declared he would prosecute anyone caught violating the ban. He failed to follow through on his threat just days later however when a local man admitted to the mayor that he had been coasting.

People were no doubt stunned that the person who confessed was Dr. William Seward Webb owner of a great estate in Shelburne son-in-law of the Vanderbilts and the cream of Chittenden County society.

We don’t know what motivated Webb to admit his complicity in this controversial sport. Perhaps as a leading citizen he was embarrassed that his behavior might set a bad example. Or maybe he thought the anti-coasting rules were silly and wanted the public to know that coasting was a sport if not of kings then of Webbs and their friends which was as near as Vermont came to royalty.

Large “traverse” sleds were used at Burlington’s winter carnival. Unlike toboggans and other sleds the traverses had a modicum of safety features including basic steering and braking systems. It’s unclear how effective the brakes were though because the sleds could reach speeds of 60 miles per hour. Photo courtesy of Silver Special Collections Library University of Vermont

Webb followed up his apology not by abandoning the sport but by formalizing it. He helped found the Burlington Coasting Club and became its president. The club’s other offices were filled by a University of Vermont professor a prominent lawyer and state senator a bank president and a leading manufacturer. Members of the business and professional class — lawyers storeowners and the like — made up the club’s membership. The high status of club members squelched any opposition from Burlington officialdom.

The coasting club set to work lining Main Street with torches to light the route at night and arranging for spotters to monitor the course and warn passersby of oncoming sleds. The club also built a toboggan slide at the junction of St. Paul and Howard streets and purchased toboggans for free use by members and rental by the general public.

To foster a club identity organizers required that while sledding members wear the club’s uniform which consisted of a red sash woolen tuque and a badge that depicted a toboggan with the club’s initials overlaid.

Five-day carnival

The next fall Burlington Coasting Club members began planning a gala event a five-day winter sports carnival to be held in February 1886. In addition to the predictable events of coasting and tobogganing organizers scheduled ice hockey games skating races and “a fancy skating tournament” at a newly created rink; ice boating sleighing and trotting races on the lake; fireworks; snowshoe races; a club dinner and a grand carnival ball.

The carnival was blessed with perfect weather. A warm spell that had threatened the event ended with colder weather and light snow. Winter sports enthusiasts who had been disappointed by cancellation of Montreal’s festival crowded into Burlington for the festivities.

“Burlington tonight is all one vast blaze of electric lights Chinese lanterns and houses illuminated as though they were on fire” reported one New York City paper. “The air resounds with revelry and fun the streets are literally jammed with people and the sport is wilder than anything ever seen in Montreal Orange or even Albany.”

The thrilling coast down Main Street became a major attraction; a reported 1000 riders an hour zoomed down the course.

Others flocked to the lakeshore to watch the iceboat and horse races or to skate on the rink which was lit at night by torches.

The carnival also featured what is believed to be the first-ever international ice hockey game. Playing on a rink set up between two docks on the Burlington waterfront the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association team beat the local Van Ness club team 3-0.

Burning bright — for one year

Burlington reveled in all the attention. The event seemed to signal the city’s entrance into the big time as luminaries from around the East Coast and Quebec turned up.

“(A) more brilliant assembly was never seen in Burlington hundreds of well-known society people from other cities joining in the promenades and dances and the beauty and chivalry of our own city being fully represented” gushed the Burlington Free Press.

The Boston Transcript reported that “the magnitude of its success surpasses even the Club’s wildest dreams. Burlington was made on purpose for a winter carnival.”

The festivities gave every indication of becoming a major annual event. The next year’s carnival also ran smoothly despite uncooperative weather. A thaw again hit just before the opening but this time didn’t lift in time. And though a decent crowd turned out the event somehow lacked the luster of its first year.

The Boston New York and Montreal socialites who made the first year so grand were mostly missing. Montreal’s smallpox epidemic had finally ended — though not before killing more than 3000 people in Montreal and another 3000 elsewhere in Quebec and leaving an estimated 13000 permanently scarred by the pox — and the city’s winter carnival in 1887 attracted much of the glitterati.

After that the Burlington Coasting Club couldn’t muster the enthusiasm to host another carnival. The events put heavy demands on club members’ time and if the event wasn’t going to match the glow of the first year they decided they had better things to do.

Membership dropped precipitously. Even Webb who had been so instrumental in starting the club seems to have lost interest and did little to help organize the 1887 event.

Coasting and tobogganing proved something of a fad. Within a few years the Burlington Coasting Club became defunct. If the club failed to establish a Burlington winter carnival as a major social event it had at least shown that Vermont could draw visitors in winter though it would take another half-century and the creation of ski areas to fulfill that promise.

The vessel will no longer be operating a Panama itinerary with a change of ports as the voyage is now ten days.

Carnival Legend Itinerary Adjusted

The Spirit-class cruise ship’s January 9 sailing out of Baltimore in Maryland has been modified. Carnival Cruise Line has informed booked guests on January 8 that the vessel’s voyage has been shortened and will no longer be sailing to some of the originally scheduled ports.

Carnival Legend was set to depart on a 14-day itinerary but the ship will now operate an adjusted 10-day voyage. The calls at Panama Costa Rica Jamaica and Grand Turk have been removed. The ship will return to Baltimore on January 19 2022 instead of the original date of January 23.

In a letter sent to guests the cruise line says “Given the rapidly evolving COVID-related circumstances around the world and in an abundance of caution it will be necessary to modify the itinerary of your cruise. The voyage will now operate as a 10-day cruise returning to Baltimore 4 days earlier on Wednesday January 19 2022.”

The ship will now only be sailing to three ports during the cruising including Carnival’s private island of Half Moon Cay in the Bahamas St. Maarten and Antigua. There will be a total of six days at sea.

The cruise line continues to say in the letter “Unfortunately this also means we will not be able to operate the Panama Canal itinerary you were expecting. We are truly sorry for this unexpected change of plans and trust you understand we are making this decision given our commitment to the safety of our guests crew and the communities we visit.”

Carnival Cruise Line has not detailed the specific reason for the modified itinerary but does mention Omicron and that ports could deny ships despite small numbers of COVID cases onboard.

The cruise line says “We are working closely with local health authorities in all ports on your cruise itinerary. Unfortunately the rapid spread of the Omicron variant may shape how they view even a small number of cases even when they are being managed with our rigorous protocols. We want you to know that local authorities at a destination could limit or deny the ship from entering the port.”

One possible reason is the limited resources at ports of call and the destinations needing to focus on dealing with their COVID situation. Carnival continues with “Some destinations have limited medical resources and are focused on managing their own local response to the variant. Should it be necessary to cancel any or multiple ports we will do our best to find alternative destinations. However if we are unsuccessful in doing so there will be no compensation for missed ports beyond a refund of any pre-purchased Carnival shore excursions.”

Impacted Guests

It’s a last-minute itinerary change with guests only being notified the day before departure. Likely many guests have already arrived in Baltimore in preparation for their cruise vacation including arranging any pre-cruise testing.

To make up for the change Carnival is offering guests a $300 onboard credit per stateroom which is in addition to any existing promotional credit that may already be on the account. The cruise line is also providing a 25% future cruise credit to all guests who are confirmed to be on the booking.

Carnival has provided a detailed breakdown of what guests will receive due to all the port changes and the onboard credit as follows:

You will receive a 4-day pro-rated reduction in your cruise fare which will be refunded to your original form of payment.

You will receive an onboard credit of $245.80 per person representing an adjustment of the taxes fees and port expenses.

Pre-paid gratuities and pre-purchased beverage and Wi-Fi packages will also be adjusted to reflect the shortened duration and refunded to the original form of payment.

Pre-purchased Carnival shore excursions for the cancelled ports will be refunded to your Sail & Sign account.

If guests no longer want to go ahead with the Carnival Legend sailing they can request a full refund in addition to the 25% future cruise credit that’s already being offered. With the call center experiencing long waiting times the cruise line tells guests to request a refund using an online form.

This news comes during a fluid time in the cruise industry. Multiple ships have already been denied at ports and Carnival Cruise Line is actively adapting its protocols and itineraries to make sure fun-filled cruises can continue.

Joel Pemberton was named Prime Minister and Clare Goble was crowned Duchess of Lark.

Joel Pemberton was born and raised in the small island town of Anacortes Washington. Growing up in a small town his dream was to have a small community-based business to provide goods and services through long-term relationships. He left Anacortes to attend college in British Columbia where he met his wife Chantel. After graduation they married and settled down back in northwest Washington and eventually on Fidalgo Island. Although living in the San Juan Islands was indeed amazing they were always drawn to the mountains. When they had an opportunity to relocate Joel’s practice as a financial advisor with Edward Jones to Whitefish 10 years ago they jumped on it. Their three children have been able to grow up on Big Mountain and in Glacier National Park and they all agree that the move was the best thing they ever did for the family.

Upon arrival in Whitefish Pemberton immediately got involved in the Rotary Club of Whitefish. He served as the Local Project Committee Chair for three years and took the lead on the Bakke Nature Preserve Project along with the City of Whitefish the Whitefish Community Foundation and other amazing Rotarians. Pemberton served as President of the Club in 2018-2019 and as Chairman of the RCW Charitable Fund Board in 2019-2021. Pemberton has also previously served on the Board of Directors for Flathead Industries. Joel and Chantel are regular volunteers at Whitefish Chamber of Commerce events and Whitefish Young Life serve at their church and Pemberton is Chairman of the Board for Absolute Ministries a new program that helps people break the cycle of rehab.

Pemberton says he is passionate about serving his clients at Edward Jones and making an impact in his community. He is also a “ski-junky” — enjoying both skiing and snowboarding as well as cross-country skiing. In the ""off-season"" (every season that’s not ski season) he enjoys mountain biking paddleboarding hiking golfing and camping with his family and friends as much as possible.



Clare Goble is a Whitefish native born and raised by her parents Jim and Mary Ellen Goble who are also both Whitefish born and bred.

She enjoys spending time with her two brothers Malcolm and Owen Goble who also still reside here in the Flathead Valley. After graduating from Whitefish High School in 1999 Clare attended college at Montana State University in Bozeman where she received a bachelor’s in education. After graduation and a short-term teaching job Goble made the decision to pursue her career in the restaurant industry; a decision made solely because she was not yet ready to give up the ski bum lifestyle.

Goble paid her way in Bozeman by waiting tables and slinging pizzas at MacKenzie River Pizza Company. That job grew in to multiple management roles and eventually to her current position at the Glacier Restaurant Group Corporate office as the Director of Training Development.

Goble enjoys time with her long-term boyfriend Ryan Brown. Together they enjoy skiing swimming and all things the Flathead has to offer. Most importantly they love simply spending time with friends and family.

An active member in the community Goble serves on the Whitefish Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors and is also a regional manager for multiple restaurants in downtown Whitefish.

The Whitefish Winter Carnival has been near and dear to the Goble family for decades. Year after year the family has welcomed friends into their home on Second Street for an open house. A tradition that will only become more meaningful now that Clare has been honored with the title of Duchess of Lark.

The Whitefish Winter Carnival continues through Feb. 5. Up next is the coronation of King Ullr LX and Queen of the Snows in downtown Whitefish on Jan. 15 followed by the carnival disco party the same evening.

He and his classmates would wait for their slices -- decorated with purple gold and green sugars -- eager to see which piece had a tiny plastic baby hidden inside. Whoever found it was responsible for bringing another king cake to school the next week and the cycle would continue through Carnival season right up until Mardi Gras.

""It was a really wonderful childhood memory and it's stuck with me to this day"" says Lee a chef born and raised in New Orleans.

Nearly every New Orleanian has a similar story. King cake is a treasured sweet and a beloved Carnival tradition.

And in New Orleans where Catholicism is still the predominant religion Twelfth Night celebrated on Jan. 6 holds deep significance. The date -- also known around the world as Epiphany or Three Kings Day -- marks the moment when the three Magi or kings reached the baby Jesus in Bethlehem. Celebrations vary but in New Orleans Twelfth Night is also the start of the pre-Lenten Carnival season a cycle of baking and eating king cakes with the arrival of many plastic babies.

Poppy Tooker an author in New Orleans says king cake dates back to ancient Rome and the Saturnalia Festival a celebration of the god Saturn.

""The tradition goes they bake the bean into the cake which really makes it sound like a king cake"" Tooker says. ""When Rome collapsed like so much in the Catholic Church in Europe they took these pagan customs and adapted them.""

King cakes are revered in New Orleans so much so that it's considered sacrilegious to eat one before Jan. 6. Until the 18th century king cake was largely eaten only on that day to signal the end of the Christmas season. In the early 1900s however some Carnival krewes (as parade organizers are known) like the Twelfth Night Revelers began to host balls where they served king cake selecting the ""king"" or ""queen"" based on which guest found the small trinket or fève hidden in the cake.

The New Orleans version of the cake which Tooker says was most likely developed by 18th-century French and Spanish colonists initially followed a basic structure: The oval-shaped pastries consisted of a brioche dough with hints of vanilla and were covered with colorful sugary crystals and stuffed with the fève initially a bean. In the 19th century porcelain dolls were the fève of choice; in the 20th century McKenzie's Pastry Shoppes a local chain that closed in 2001 became among the first commercial bakeries to use a plastic baby and others soon followed. Cakes also became sweeter and more Danish-like as king cakes became commercially popular.

""It is the emblematic dessert of the time"" food historian Lolis Eric Elie says.

Today the pastry has taken on a life of its own in New Orleans. Gambino's serves a Bavarian cream king cake and a praline-and-cream-cheese king cake among other varieties. Bywater Bakery has experimented with savory flavors offering cakes stuffed with boudin crawfish or spinach-and-artichoke dip. Haydel's Bakery's classic version is a popular favorite. And several bakeries like La Boulangerie and Croissant D'or serve galettes des rois.

""King cake season is this really communal experience that I think defines Mardi Gras New Orleans in general"" says Matt Haines the author of ""The Big Book of King Cake"" an archive of some of the city's tastiest cakes.

Dong Phuong Bakery in New Orleans East has embraced this idea. The Vietnamese bakery first started making the pastry in 2008 selling about 100 cakes for the entire season. Now it averages about 50000.

""We wanted to create an offering to the community"" says Linh Garza the bakery's president. ""But we wanted to adapt it to our community and our tastes.""

Garza's family opened the bakery in 1982 after immigrating as refugees to New Orleans. Dong Phuong became a culinary respite for the area's Vietnamese community. And Garza's mother Huong Tran eventually became the mastermind behind the bakery's king cake. The recipe opts for cream cheese icing and uses a flaky brioche dough offering more moisture than other versions and a remarkably fluffy bite. Tran who previously worked as a seamstress added deep slashes to her cakes.

José Castillo was 5 years old when his family arrived in New Orleans from Villanueva Honduras in 1981. After seeing the Three Kings Day tradition at school he came home and begged his mother Norma Castillo to buy him a king cake.

""She was like 'Really? We just arrived in this country!'""

At Norma's Sweets Bakery in the Mid-City -- Castillo manages this second location of his mother's bakery -- king cake has become an essential item. Filled with guava and cream cheese and covered in a light layer of icing Norma's cake plays with the power of subtle sweetness providing a crisp fruity bite for all who indulge.

""We wanted to give the community a little taste of the Latin product"" Castillo says of their use of guava filling. ""Guava is our strawberry in Honduras and we wanted to make something that allowed us to be part of the community but that reflected where we're from too.""

In the French Quarter Brennan's has found a pleasant intersection between simplicity and innovation. The storied restaurant started selling king cakes nationally in 2021 including a traditional take with notes of cinnamon and butter in every bite.

""It's really just a fun time for the city"" says Ralph Brennan an owner. ""We all have these incredible memories of eating our favorite king cake and participating in the parade and we want to be part of those memories for the next generation."""

AirlineRatings.com has named Air New Zealand as the safest airline in the world for 2022.

The organization publishes the top 20 list every year and ANZ beat out 2021's top carrier Australia-based Qantas.

Five US carriers made the list in 2022 though Southwest Airlines dropped off after ranking 13 last year.

AirlineRatings.com a source for airline safety and product reviews has revealed its top 20 safest carriers in the world for 2022 with five US airlines making the list.

Established in 2013 AirlineRatings.com is a trusted website that rates airline safety inflight products and COVID-19 compliance of 385 worldwide carriers on a unique seven-star scale. Every year AirlineRatings.com releases a list of the top safest airlines in the world and this year Air New Zealand snatched the title from Australia-based Qantas.

AirlineRatings.com editor-in-chief Geoffrey Thomas explained in a press release that ""there is very little between the top 20 they are all standouts.""

""Our top 20 safest airlines 2022 are always at the forefront of safety innovation operational excellence and the launching of new more advanced aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787.""

Air New Zealand is the safest airline in the world for 2022 according to AirlineRatings.com with carriers like Etihad Airways TAP Air Portugal Qatar Qantas Lufthansa and Finnair also making the list. Five US carriers also earned top spots including Alaska Airlines Delta Air Lines Hawaiian Airlines American Airlines and United Airlines.

According to Thomas ANZ earned the title because of its superb incident record number of technological innovations and cockpit advancements comprehensive pilot training and low fleet age which averages just 6.8 years.

AirlineRatings also said ANZ's pilots operate in harsh weather conditions and remote environments adding to the carrier's safety ranking. Moreover the airline excelled in COVID policies and practices.

""Air New Zealand has won countless awards and has a firm focus on safety and its customers and over the past 18 months COVID-19 has brought yet another new dimension to the challenges"" Thomas said.

According to the organization the 2022 awards were based on six factors including crashes in the past five years serious incidents over two years audits from aviation governing bodies government audits fleet age and COVID policies.

However Thomas clarified that all airlines experience incidents and that it is not always the fault of the carrier when things go wrong but sometimes rather the aircraft or engine manufacturer.

""It is the way the flight crew handles these incidents that determines a good airline from an unsafe one"" he said.

There were several ranking shifts in 2022 compared to 2021 most notably were Qantas losing its crown to Air New Zealand after a three-year winning streak Southwest Airlines falling out of the top 20 after ranking number 13 last year and TAP Air Portugal being named Europe's safest carrier after not making the list in 2021.

Although the Navy declared the technology operational on May 4 2021 the system has been in place on various US amphibious assault ships since 2016.

JPALS is an all-weather landing system on aircraft carriers equipped with real-time differential correction of the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal and augmented with a local area correction message transmitted to the user via secure means.

A pilot attempting the landing will get an accurate three-dimensional position by comparing the current GPS-derived position with the local correction signal via an Instrument Landing System (ILS)-style display. This makes the difficult landing maneuvers reliable easier and safer.

Ensuring Safe Landing

Landing a fighter jet on an aircraft carrier is a complex process which only a trained pilot can attempt. Fighter jets usually have to take a hard turn over the ocean to align directly with an aircraft carrier’s deck before descending upon their final “glide slope” landing approach.

The problems are magnified if there are high winds rough sea conditions or if it’s done in the darkness of the night.

Pilots follow a light on the carrier deck known as Fresnel lens to get an alignment as they reduce speed align the nose of the jet and lower onto the carrier deck.

If the lens is properly “centered” then pilots can approach for landing otherwise they may need to readjust for another pass. With JPALS the process has become much easier now as this system “integrates with shipboard air traffic control and landing system architectures” to facilitate precise landings according to the Navy.

The system has been developed by Raytheon Intelligence & Space an American multinational aerospace and defense conglomerate. The US Navy awarded Raytheon a $235 million contract for 23 units of the company’s JPALS system.

Raytheon claims JPALS can precisely guide aircraft onto the decks of carriers and amphibious assault ships in all weather including in fog and heavy rain. The system can help aircraft land on ships that are pitching and rolling in rough water up to Sea State 5 conditions which includes 1.8m (6ft)-tall waves.

“JPALS has reached a historic milestone which supports our requirement to deliver operate and maintain a navy with a focus on our core roles of sea control and power projection” Naval Airspace and Air Traffic Control Standards and Evaluation Agency director commander Jeff Dugard was reported as saying.

PMA-213 program manager captain Kevin Watkin said – “The achievement of JPALS IOC is a positive reflection on the hard work innovation and resilience from a dedicated team of government and industry professionals who have developed and fielded this critical capability to the warfighters.”

Besides the US Navy JPALS is also used by the US Marine Corps aboard the UK Royal Navy’s HMS Queen Elizabeth and is also installed on the ITS Cavour an Italian aircraft carrier the flagship of the Marina Militare to support their F-35 squadron.

Denis Donohue vice president of communications and airspace management systems at Raytheon Intelligence & Space said “The Cavour JPALS is the first system to be permanently installed on a foreign ship. JPALS will add significant mission capabilities for our international allies and partners who are flying the F-35.”

Key Features Of JPALS

Security: As the system is exclusively used by defense establishments so far security is of paramount importance. So the ground system utilizes a secure discrete data link only received by JPALS equipped aircraft.

Coverage: The total range of the system is 200NM (nautical mile). The surveillance system becomes operational from 60NM and the precision landing guidance starts at 10NM.

Accuracy: A single expeditionary JPALS can handle 50 simultaneous approaches to multiple touchdown points within a 20NM radius of the ground station.

Rapid deployment: Expeditionary JPALS system is portable. The system can be up and running in less than 90 minutes by only two personnel.

Versatility: It is designed for operations in all weather rugged terrain and austere environments.

Landing Aircraft On Carriers

The dangerous and high-risk process of landing jets on carriers at sea goes back many years. When the first F-35C ever landed onboard the USS Nimitz off the coast of California in 2014 a pilot explained carrier landing as a “controlled crash” meaning it involved some force and pressure as part of a small collision.

The system has been massively improved in more recent years through the advent of a series of innovations to include night-vision technology improved navigational avionics and in the case of the F-35 fighter jet a software program called Delta Flight Path.

This system brings computer automation to the landing process in order to greatly assist pilots as they try to stabilize upon approach.

What Are Russia & China Working On?

Russia is currently in the process of overhauling its aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov. The almost 30-year-old giant which has seen many ups and downs in its long lifetime is now being upgraded to match its US counterparts.

The overhaul and upgrade of Admiral Kuznetsov are expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. The avionics flight deck with the ski jump electric equipment and the power plant will be replaced. The carrier will also receive a new fully domestic takeoff and landing control system with the onboard airpower remaining the same.

China is also working on building its own aircraft carriers. Type 002 is the country’s first domestically produced aircraft carrier which was launched on April 26 2017. In February 2017 China started the construction of a Type 003 class aircraft carrier.

Type 003 will have a displacement of around 85000 tons and be approximately the size of the US Navy’s Ford-class ships. It was reported in early 2021 that the first ship would be launched in the same year with construction already started on a second ship in this class.

On November 10 2021 Bloomberg reported that “China is three to six months away from launching its third aircraft carrier” citing a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXR0aW1lcy5jb20vbG9naXN0aWNzL2ludGVncmF0ZWQtb2ZmZXJpbmdzLW1hc3NpdmUtY2FycmllcnMtdG8tYmVjb21lLWdpYW50cy0xMzA3NDI40gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RhdHRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbG9naXN0aWNzL2ludGVncmF0ZWQtb2ZmZXJpbmdzLW1hc3NpdmUtY2FycmllcnMtdG8tYmVjb21lLWdpYW50cy0xMzA3NDI4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Integrated Offerings - Massive Carriers To Become Giants,"BIG gets BIGGER. $10 billion deals in a span of days…and the result could change the dynamics of the supply chain/logistics industry globally.

Denmark-based A.P.Moller-Maersk (Maersk) has signed a $3.6 billion deal to acquire 100 percent shares of Hong Kong-based LF Logistics. The deal adds 223 warehouses to Maersk's existing portfolio taking the total number of facilities to 549 globally spread across 9.5 million square metres. The MSC Group is acquiring 100 percent of Bolloré Africa Logistics including all of the Bolloré Group's transport and logistics activities in Africa. The deal is based on an enterprise value net of minority interests of €5.7 billion. Bolloré Africa Logistics is among the biggest transport and logistics operators in Africa where it has a network with 250 subsidiaries and almost 21000 employees in 49 countries including 47 in Africa. Its operations include 16 container terminal concessions and three rail concessions in Africa: Sitarail Camrail and Benirail. Maersk had earlier signed an international freight supply chain management partnership with fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) behemoth Unilever w.e.f 2022. The four-year agreement will see the development and management of Unilever's International Control Tower Solution – an operational management solution which will consolidate the execution of its global ocean and air transport with the aim of enhancing visibility increasing efficiency and driving reductions in emissions across its operations. While the value of the partnership has not been disclosed the importance of the deal can be gauged from the following parameters: * Unilever products are used by 2.5 billion people every day.

* With 149000 employees Unilever generated sales of €50.7 billion in 2020.

* Maersk reported a 68 percent increase in Q3 revenue to $16.6 billion while EBIT was up almost five times to $ 5.9 billion on high freight rates in an exceptional market situation; and

*Maersk has maintained its 2021 profit outlook at the earlier estimate of $18 billion-$19 billion. ""With our focus on connecting and simplifying our customers' end-to-end supply chain worldwide we are looking beyond organic growth to achieve our vision as a global integrator"" said Vikash Agarwal Managing Director Maersk South Asia.

Integration continues among carriers Integration/consolidation in the logistics and supply chain sector continues unabated. Continuing its buying spree French carrier CMA CGM signed a deal with US-based Ingram Micro to buy most of its commerce & lifestyle activities (CLS) for an enterprise value of $3 billion. The deal includes Shipwire a cloud-based logistics technology platform and the company's technology forward logistics businesses in North America Europe Latin America and Asia-Pacific. The remaining portions of the existing CLS business will be retained by Ingram Micro. The acquired CLS business specialises in ecommerce contract logistics and omni-channel fulfilment. The business is expected to end 2021 with a revenue of $1.7 billion and employs 11500 worldwide across 59 warehouses. CMA CGM Air Cargo has ordered four A350F freighter aircraft and will increase CMA CGM's total Airbus fleet to nine aircraft including five A330-200F. With a carrying capacity of more than 100 metric tonnes and a range of nearly 9000 kilometres the A350F will enable us to strengthen our long-haul offer to better meet your needs"" says an official release. Maersk had earlier announced plans to acquire Senator International a global freight forwarding company with a strong air freight offering for $644illion. Maersk is also adding three leased cargo planes (B767-300) to be operational from 2022 and two new Boeing aircraft (B777F) to be deployed by 2024. Star Air – the internal air cargo operation established by Maersk in 1987 - will support Maersk's logistics offering. Senator brings a technology advantage with its Cargo Wise One core operating platform an easy-to-use system that will accelerate the integration with Maersk's Air and LCL (Less than Container Load) products. ""The two liner companies are seeking to control a larger part of the supply chain and expand their offering of air freight logistics to their customers"" said Peter Sand Chief Analyst Xeneta. ""This strategy of becoming more of a one-stop logistics provider with a door-to-door offering and not only port-to-port can be chased much more aggressively right now and next year as liners seek to spend the wind-fall profit to expand their footprint in global logistics. The simple idea behind is this: if you can carry the goods all the way you can optimise your in-house logistics and make more money from offering this service too.""





(""I expect to see a flurry of mid-sized and large-size acquisitions in the coming 18 months – as the window for the one-stop logistics provider strategy seems to be wide open during that time."" - Peter Sand Chief Analyst Xeneta)



Naveen Prakash Director Global Logistics Solutions India Pvt Ltd had this to say: ""Massive war chest of cash with billions of dollars of cash profit has to be utilised and it will be counter-productive if deployed in the same business. It will only ease up the higher freight situation in the long-term and liners want to delay the bull run as much as possible. "" So carriers are investing in new-age businesses that are more technologically-led like e-commerce supply chain management (SCM0 warehouse management (WMS) & digital forwarding; increasing portfolio in asset-based industries like trucking warehousing terminals; andoffering one-stop shop for global FMCGs fashion and chemical & pharma giants who have a global presence Prakash said.

""We have for instance added and improved our capabilities within customs services through the successful acquisition of KGH a well-established customs services provider in Europe and most recently through the acquisitions of Visible SCM B2C Europe and HUUB – all players within e-commerce logistics"" Agarwal said. ""We are now aiming to further enhance our air freight offering by acquiring Senator International a successful global freight forwarding company with Air freight at the core of its offering."" Our overall strategy is to be able to streamline our operations across the supply chain and including all transportation modes (air rail road and sea) Agarwal added. ""By having owned/controlled assets you can better cater for customers´ needs as you are able to offer them faster and more agile resilience and flexible end-to-end services. ""You hear us talk a lot about changing the conversations with customers – moving more towards long-term partnerships to manage their logistics creating meaningful value. Adding own controlled air freight to the conversation will help us to be able to tailor creative solutions for customers particularly in the current ever-changing market conditions. ""Maersk aims to become a considerable player in the global air cargo world. With this first step on our journey we will be roughly doubling our tonnage; however absolute tonnage is not our key driver. Our aim is to become a well-established global air freight provider with a network covering all continents and with top notch products needed by our customers.""

""Maersk aims to become a considerable player in the global air cargo world. With this first step on our journey we will be roughly doubling our tonnage; however absolute tonnage is not our key driver. Our aim is to become a well-established global air freight provider with a network covering all continents and with top notch products needed by our customers."" Impact of these moves on the logistics world﻿ So do these acquisitions mean smaller freight forwarders would be excluded and Maersk/CMA-CGM deal directly with beneficial cargo owners (BCOs)? ""Obviously as logistics is a truly global business any acquisition by the carriers must have a certain scale"" Sand said. ""This is why I expect to see a flurry of mid-sized and large-size acquisitions in the coming 18 months – as the window for the one-stop logistics provider strategy seems to be wide open during that time. Freight forwarders (FFs) of any size feel threatened by this carrier strategy – and rightly they should. As carriers are now entering FF-turf while telling FFs to stay out of ocean carrier business – game on. Carriers have always had a strong focus on BCOs – this will remain intact."" Economies of scale are always better Prakash added. ""Without naming the line I would say yes they want to replace mid-size and smaller forwarders as these companies need more human-to-human (H2H) interactions which is a big cost for these companies. Most of them are based out of Europe and employee expenses are the biggest costs. They also have to keep it uniform in other parts of the world to avoid disparity and employees migrating between various geographies. ""Dealing directly with BCOs also helps them get accurate predictions of cargo flow for a few quarters in advance. In some cases like large MNCs they can give plans for 3-5 years. Centralised billing for e.g. using blockchain can help the lines and clients to work in a more cost-efficient manner.""





(""Massive war chest of cash with billions of dollars of cash profit has to be utilised and it will be counter-productive if deployed in the same business."" - Naveen Prakash Director Global Logistics Solutions India Pvt Ltd) Vincent Clerc CEO Ocean and Logistics Maersk said recently in a video interview: ""If you look at the global supply chain today it is actually not a global supply chain. It is a collection of supply chains developed by customers based on the view that he has for his own needs. This is good in a way because it means that every customer or every company has been able to to structure their supply chain the way that they see fit but it also has a lot of impediments in a sense that the service providers that they depend on are really hamstrung by having to cope with a lot of different standards a lot of different models even though the need of the customer by and large aggregate into similar things. The cloud moment is really turning the paradigm and enabling improvement and leveraging capabilities of technology and scale by having actually the logistics provider take the initiatives to develop something that is better that is scalable. That's what I refer to as a cloud moment. .it's this change of paradigm where suddenly we can leverage scale at a completely different level than what we've been able to do so far.""

Here’s What You Need to Remember: Cheap 747s converted to carry long-range cruise missiles and shorter-range munitions alike already have the endurance needed for continent-spanning missions.

During the Cold War Boeing developed plans to load a 747 with as many as 72 air-launched cruise missiles to serve as a long-range arsenal ship capable of wiping out targets from hundreds of miles away. The design dubbed the 747 Cruise Missile Carrier Aircraft (CMCA) could have been an extremely cost-effective alternative to America’s current fleet of heavy-payload bombers in a wide variety of mission sets.

Ultimately the 747 CMCA never made it off the drawing board with the Reagan administration pulling the B-1 program out of mothballs and the B-2 entering service shortly thereafter–but it may be time the United States revisited the idea of leveraging these or similarly capable commercial airframes for more than just ferrying cargo and passengers.

Why Pack a 747 With Cruise Missiles?

On June 30 1977 President Jimmy Carter announced that he was canceling development on America’s B-1 bomber program citing the program’s cost overruns and advancing ballistic missile technology for the decision. The bomber would eventually find new life under the Reagan administration eventually resulting in the B-1B Lancer that remains in service today. Northrop Grumman’s B-2 Spirit sometimes referred to as America’s “stealth bomber” also entered service in the ’80s placing America’s strategic bombing capabilities right back at the top of the global military heap.

But for a short window of time the United States seemed to be in need of a heavy-payload aircraft that had enough endurance to cross entire oceans to engage enemy targets. Some believed converting an existing commercial platform to carry the recently-developed AGM-86 air-launched cruise missiles made the most sense from an economic standpoint and Boeing’s 747 seemed like just the right aircraft for the job.

Boeing’s 747 first took to the skies in 1969. Initially designed to compete for an Air Force cargo transport contract (which it lost to Lockheed’s C-5 Galaxy) it found renewed purpose as the first commercial airliner ever to be called a “jumbo jet” and “jumbo” was an apt description. The 747 was a massive aircraft for its day and the largest civilian aircraft in the world at the time. The original 747 fuselage stretched 225 feet and carried a vertical tail that stood as tall as a six-story building. It had more square footage in its wings alone than you can find in an entire basketball court and just one of the 747’s wings was 30 times heavier than Boeing’s entire first aircraft launched just 53 years prior.

Boeing developed the aircraft incredibly quickly–in under 16 months by their own accounting but the effort was positively monumental nonetheless. Some 50000 employees had a hand in the 747 program. More than 75000 engineering drawings were produced accounting for some six million parts and over 171 miles of wiring. In order to ensure the aircraft design was extremely efficient it spent more than 15000 hours in the wind tunnel and then another 1500 hours of flight testing.

Incredible as the aircraft was however it was also a serious gamble. Boeing struggled to finance the completion of its development eventually borrowing more than $2 billion (roughly $14.9 billion in today’s money) to get it across the finish line. If the aircraft were to fail to find a market it would have meant ruin for the company.

It may have been with that in mind that plans for the 747 CMCA began to form. Boeing knew the Air Force might be interested in an aircraft with a range of nearly 6000 miles and the ability to carry nearly 77000 pounds of ordnance so they set to work on just such a proposal in 1980. If they were successful it would mean selling their expensive new design in both commercial and military markets for cargo personnel and as an arsenal ship.

The 747 CMCA

Boeing started with a 747-200C which was a convertible airliner with a nose cargo door that could be opened to remove the seats and leave the interior empty as well as to bring large payloads on board.

The 747 Cruise Missile Carrier Aircraft would leverage the new AGM-86 air-launched cruise missile which was developed for exactly this sort of application though in a different aircraft. By the 1970s the B-52 was already looking pretty long in the tooth and the AGM-86 had been designed specifically to increase its survivability by engaging targets from ranges that could exceed 1500 miles–well outside the reach of Soviet surface-to-air missiles.

But while the B-52 could carry 20 of these 21′ cruise missiles the 747 CMCA could carry a whopping 72.

The weapons would be carried within the 747 fuselage on nine rotary launchers each loaded with eight AGM-86 cruise missiles. The missiles would be fired one at a time from the side door near the rear of the aircraft with each rotary launcher sliding back into firing position as needed. Although the missiles were ejected one at a time Boeing’s design was meant to be able to launch them in quick succession.

These missiles would leverage a satellite data link to receive target information while the 747 was airborne or target information could be relayed from a command and control team stationed just behind the cockpit of the aircraft in the area usually reserved for 1st class passengers.

As a result the 747 CMCA would have been able to deploy more cruise missiles than three B-52s combined each with independent targets within hundreds of miles of one another. But impressive as that may be it was the potential cost savings that made the missile-packing 747 seem like a very viable option.

Cheaper Than Any Bomber

The B-1B Lancer that would ultimately eliminate the need for the 747 CMCA can carry a comparable payload to the 747 and its sweep-wing design and powerful General Electric F101-GE-102 afterburning turbofan engines make it both fast and extremely maneuverable for a bomber carrying so much firepower you can use school busses as a unit of measurement. But it’s also incredibly expensive at around $61000 per hour to fly. The B-52 is a bit pricier at about $70000 per hour. The stealth B-2 Spirit crushes those figures with a jaw-dropping $130159 per hour.

But a modern 747 rings in at just about $25000 per hour.

A large part of what makes America’s bombers so pricey to operate is the size of their respective fleets. The Air Force operates some 62 B-1Bs 76 B-52s and just 20 B-2s. With so few of each of these planes in existence parts tend to be very pricey–and they keep getting pricier as all three of these bombers continue to age. Conversely more than 1500 747s have been built with supply lines and maintenance infrastructure already established the world over. That means it’s not just cheaper to buy parts for the 747 it’s cheaper to get them on the aircraft that need them.

As Tyler Rogoway pointed out way back in 2014 a 747 carrying 72 cruise missiles would have been extremely handy over Afghanistan throughout the past 20 years of conflict. With its low operating cost great endurance and massive payload the 747 CMCA could have been an air support powerhouse in the uncontested airspace over Afghanistan as well as in other conflict-ridden areas like Iraq and Syria. If the aircraft had been put into service and converted to carry JDAMs of varying sizes along with small-diameter bombs over the years the number of individual targets it could engage increases from 72 to literally hundreds. And all at a fraction of the cost of America’s current bomber options.

Could We See a Resurgence of the CMCA Concept?

Today both the B-1B Lancer and the B-2 Spirit are slated to retire in favor of America’s forthcoming stealth bomber the B-21 Raider. The B-21 promises to offer incredibly advanced stealth technology and the same global strike capabilities we’ve come to expect from bombers like the Raider’s predecessor the B-2. There is a significant catch however: The B-21 Raider is going to be quite a bit smaller than the B-2 limiting its payload capabilities to around 30000 pounds. That’s not terribly far off from the B-2’s 40000-pound limit but it’s less than half of the supersonic B-1B’s 75000 capacity.

While the B-21 will likely be more economical than the B-2 thanks to newer technology and fresher airframes there’s no denying that operating stealth aircraft is expensive. This understanding is part of what prompted the Air Force to purchase new non-stealth F-15EXs which offer nearly three times the lifespan at less than half the cost per operating hour than the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. While Northrop and the Air Force both claim the B-21 program is steaming ahead on schedule and without any serious snags just how much it costs to fly remains to be seen.

The United States is no longer conducting combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq but as the nation shifts back toward an era of great power competition it seems unlikely that America’s days of conducting combat operations in uncontested airspace are over. Much like the last Cold War the simmering tensions between the U.S. and China are unlikely to boil over into open war any time soon. This time it’s not just mutually assured nuclear destruction keeping the dogs of war at bay it’s also the promise of economic catastrophe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZGFsbGFzaW5ub3ZhdGVzLmNvbS9nb3Zlcm5vci1hYmJvdHQtYXBwb2ludHMtNS1ub3J0aC10ZXhhbnMtdG8tcHJpdmF0ZS1zZWN0b3ItYWR2aXNvcnktY291bmNpbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Governor Abbott Appoints 5 North Texans to Private Sector Advisory Council,"Governor Greg Abbott has appointed 11 members to the Private Sector Advisory Council which advises the governor on homeland security issues pertinent to the private sector.

The New Jersey Department of Agriculture has proposed treating approximately 5000 acres of residential and county-owned properties this year. The NJDA held an informational session in Ewing on Wednesday to outline its 2022 Aerial Gypsy Moth Suppression program the product of egg mass surveys that were conducted from August to December of 2021.

""The treatment program has proved very effective during the last several years and has significantly decreased the gypsy moth caterpillar populations across the state"" said New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas Fisher. ""By treating these areas now we can prevent this insect's spread and keep the populations at a minimal levels for the years to come.""

Less than 200 acres were recommended for treatment last year and no areas of the state were recommended for treatment in 2019 and 2020. Approximately 4000 acres of properties in Burlington Morris Passaic and Warren counties were flagged as problem areas in 2018 a reduction of about 80% compared to 2017.

""We have seen rapid population collapses since '89"" said Joe Zoltowski director of NJDA's division of plant industry.

Those collapses are not only due to effective treatment Zoltowski noted. Fungus in the soil which is more prominent following a wet spring can kill the caterpillars as well.

For 2022 the Department is recommending treatment in seven municipalities in Burlington County and Cape May County. But participation in the program is voluntary — if the towns agree treatments will take place in May and June according to NJDA.

Planes fly at treetop level to disperse the treatment Zoltowski said. NJDA and the Department of Environmental Protection use the biological insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis.

""We only spray when the caterpillars are very weak and small"" Zoltowski said. ""It has to be ingested by the caterpillar to affect them.""

An otherwise healthy tree can be killed by two to three consecutive years of significant defoliation caused by the gypsy moth caterpillar NJDA said. While gypsy moths prefer oak trees the caterpillars can be found feeding on almost any tree in the vicinity.

It costs nearly $2 billion a year in the U.S. to monitor and control the hungry insect. One recent study reveals a way to predict mating habits and develop a possible “insecticide” to stop reproduction comes from the European corn borer moth’s reproductive genes.

Researchers have identified a gene in moths that controls their sex lives. This gene sheds light on the evolution of changing sexual habits. Control of this gene could become a method of pest control thereby protecting crops from moths.

“This is the first moth species out of 160000 in which female signaling and male preference genes have both been identified. That provides us with complete information on the evolution of mate choice and a way to measure how closely these choices are linked to evolving traits and populations” says co-author Professor Astrid Groot of the University of Amsterdam in a statement.

There are two types of European corn borer called E and Z with sex mainly occurring only within each group in the wild. Groot helped identify the gene controlling the pheromone difference in E and Z females.

“That means we now know – at the molecular level – how chemical matchmaking aids in the formation of new species. Similar genetic changes to pheromone preference could help explain how tens of thousands of other moth species remain separate” explains corresponding author Erik Dopman a professor of biology in the School of Arts and Sciences at Tufts University.

The study follows the discovery of the blend of molecules the female emits to draw mates from miles away. Known as “assortative mating” a signal is sent by the female and must be preferred by males of the same species to safeguard the survival of the species. The gene expressed in the brain of the male and connected to its antennae produces a protein which enables him to smell the females’ pheromones chemical signals used to attract mates.

The researchers were able to determine anatomical differences in the male and link them to their attraction to E or Z females. These included the reach of olfactory sensory neurons into different parts of the moth brain. An analysis showed females can vary their signals. The gene named bab changes the male’s preference for a particular cocktail.

The European corn borer is the primary target for “Bt corn” one of the most successful genetically modified crops in the U.S. This crop expresses insecticidal proteins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. It is an effective control of the moth in the U.S. however corn borers in Canada are now evolving resistance to another variety.

“Our results can help to predict whether Bt resistance could spread from Nova Scotia to the Corn Belt of the U.S. or whether assortative mating could prevent or delay it. Bt corn has enabled a huge reduction in the use of chemical insecticides and it should be a high priority to preserve its ecological benefits as long as possible” adds co-author Dr. David Heckel of the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Germany.

Findings are published in the Journal Nature Communications.

Be it their wild creativity overblown mechanicals or straight-up ‘let’s cross our fingers and see if this works’ hopefulness they still to this day inspire customisers movie machines and factory designers the world over.

So to share my little obsession with you all I’ve put together a list of my Top 5 insane WWII bikes in no particular order for your wide-eyed enjoyment. Behold what can happen when you have a war to win government funding and a military boss who just won’t take ‘that’s an insane idea’ for an answer.

5. The Killinger & Freund Motorcycle (1938)

Immediately breaking my own rules this bike is not strictly a ‘battle motorcycle’. Instead the one-of-a-kind ‘Killinger & Freund’ motorcycle was discovered by the occupying American forces after the end of the war in 1945.

Originally handmade in 1938 the art deco bike’s development was halted thanks to WWII rather than ramped up. None-the-less the bike history has tied inextricably to the era and was spawned from the same ‘blue sky’ pre-war thinking that created many of the other bikes here.

Seemingly more of an exercise in engineering showmanship than a design meant to solve some urgent issue or challenge the bike’s entire powerplant was fitted into its front wheel. Yes you read that right.

And while this is handy in the fact that you can just swap wheels on the bike and off you go with a new engine it also makes for a myriad of design challenges—including how to supply fuel to the spinning engines power to the electrics and throttle control to the carbs.

Despite all these brain teasers the bike was reportedly fully operable and ended up being transported to the US where it still lives today. And while it lacks the hardware and off-road chops of the other bikes here it sure as hell isn’t running short of creativity. Just imagine if the idea had made it into post-war production?

4. The NSU Kettenkrad HK 101 (1944)

Who needs warhorses? Image via Motos of War.

Like a concept vehicle from a Captain America movie the NSU Kettenkrad or ‘Chain Wheel’ motorcycle (if you can still call it that) was developed late in the war by the Germans in an attempt to overcome the challenges of army motorcycles getting bogged in Europe’s wet muddy springs and autumns.

Weighing a rather incredible 1200 kgs (2600 lbs) the thing proved great in the mud but traded that advantage against a tendency to roll over on slopes and expose its passengers to gunfire in a way that a more nimble faster two-wheeled motorcycle simply wouldn’t.

Able to tow equipment and carry three soldiers it was powered by an Opel in-line four cylinder engine and was fitted with a 3-speed gearbox. With 36 hp it was capable of 70 kmh (43 mph) on road and about 45 km/h (30 mph) overland.

And while the examples shown here aren’t armed various other iterations were. A common addition was to place an MG 34 machine gun on the raised section between the driver and passengers. Would I like to own one? Hell yes. Would I want to rely on it in the heat of battle? Not on your life.

3. Böhmerland 600cc (1932)

Nicknamed the “Dachshund motorcycle” due to its length. Image via Motos of War.

Unlike the Kettenkrad the Böhmerland was a pre-war design from Czechoslovakia that managed to see some battle action in its twilight years—thanks in large part to its carrying capabilities and large capacity power plant. With space for four in sidecar guise the bike measured over three meters in length and could manage 120 kmph (75 mph) for riders who dared take the behemoth to such speeds.

Totally lacking in any cornering abilities the bike was very much a ‘point and shoot’ proposition in the sense that even the most gentle of corners were enough to force the bike to reduce its speed greatly to ensure it didn’t topple over.

‘Das dachshund motorrad ist komisch!’

This bike was more of an oddity that became useful to occupying German forces than an all-out war motorcycle. The Böhmerland (or ‘Bohemia’ in English) was actually produced in a military version but to say that it had any great impact on the outcome of the war would be rather overstating the bike’s abilities.

Other interesting facts about the bike include that its fuel line was over 2 meters long the total-loss oil system was seemingly designed to cover the riders with a thick coating of black gold and the front fork design was about as complex as your average V2 rocket. But for sheer steampunk weirdness nothing else comes close.

2. Moto Guzzi ‘Mulo Meccanico’ (1960)

The Italian Mechanic Mule. Image via Motos of War

Not to be outdone by Germans the Italians also had their fair share of battle wackiness as evidenced by the rather wonderful Moto Guzzi you see here. Designed to climb mountains and to replace mules which were traditionally used by Italian forces to get gear overland in the country’s mountainous north every second photo of the tricycle in action appears to show it climbing up a tree—for purposes that we can only speculate.

Maybe there were olive-picking intentions for the bike when it wasn’t being used in combat? Whatever the case it also cleverly demonstrated the bike’s nifty 3WD system.

The single front fork also transferred drive to the front wheel. Image via Moto Guzzi.

So with power supplied to all three wheels the bike was more than capable when it came to climbing over obstacles and the like. And with 20 years of development and engineering under its belt since WWII Moto Guzzi built the tricycle with an impressive six-speed transmission reverse gear switchable diff and even a torque split system that supplied 80% of the oomph to the rear wheel and the rest to the front.

Sadly the bike didn’t quite cut the mustard in the field and several riders reportedly died after the hefty machine rolled over on them in rough terrain. It would seem that even with 20 years of progress the Italian engineers still couldn’t better Germany’s flawed Kettenkrad design—but they sure went head-to-head with them when it came to the looks.

1. Moto-Chenille Mercier (1939)

A modern Mercier restoration. Image via Motos of War.

Developed from a long-term military interest in ‘semi-track’ vehicles globally since the 1920s the French René-Gillet company (often called the Harley-Davidson of France) were asked by the French military in the early ‘30s to test the viability of tank-tracked motorcycles in off-road conditions with any eye to awarding a military contract to the company. The result was the father of the bike you see here.

More of a traditional motorcycle with a tank-like sidecar grafted onto the original chassis it was still enough to keep the French army interested and wanting to see more. Too much red wine maybe?

The bastard child of a wheelbarrow and a caterpillar. Image via yesterdays.nl

Thus Moto-Chenille created this little wonder. Despite the beautiful JAP engine and undoubtedly cool design the actual cooling of the bike was handled by a unique system involving a fan and a pipe that was used to direct air where needed.

Reports hint at a healthy top speed and ease of use that was stifled by the highly temperamental caterpillar track system. It’s also noted that in a test against a standard French motorcycle of the time the Moto-Chenille was slower more thirsty and (rather surprisingly) less capable when it came time to traverse a muddy trench. But what the bike did really well was climb like a billy goat. Until its front track failed that is. C’est la vie.",,,

Ridderbusch who runs one of Minnesota's five largest electricity retailers says the frozen rates were made possible through energy conservation innovation and growing investments in solar energy throughout the eight-county service territory northwest of the Twin Cities.

The secret sauce includes: cost-saving rate options now chosen by 10% of customers which provides rebates for cutting demand during peak times and also saves Connexus money by shaving the peak demand most expensive wholesale power purchases; two-way automated metering infrastructure; and distribution-grid tools such as battery storage and voltage controls.

""This is a great way to start the year"" said Anoka County Commissioner Scott Schulte a businessman who represents Anoka Andover and Coon Rapids. ""Anoka County appreciates Connexus Energy's hard work to control costs while supplying such reliable service.""

Ridderbusch has a favorite slide which he displayed at a 2021 presentation to the Minnesota Renewable Energy Society which says: ""When we generate power from solar in our service territory it saves $30 per megawatt hour"" compared to the $85 per megawatt hour that Connexus pays to its power wholesaler Great River Energy.

""Our biggest opportunity for improvement now is to lower the cost of wholesale power purchased from Great River Energy (GRE)"" Ridderbusch wrote Connexus customers recently. ""Connexus works to maintain the lowest distribution cost in the state — a strength offset by the highest wholesale power costs.""

Therein lies the rub. Connexus is the largest of the cooperative customer-members that own and buy power from Great River.

""We are ahead of the game"" said Ridderbusch a Great River executive before he joined Connexus. ""We are an innovator and as a co-op we share what we do. GRE is a good reliable solution for most of its members. But we want a different arrangement. We have a contract through 2045. The contract never anticipated the innovation of today.""

Ramsey-based Connexus last summer announced plans to exit as a co-op member and become a customer that can negotiate rates. That also would free Connexus from a 5% limit on the amount of electricity it can generate independently from its own renewable-energy projects.

Maple Grove-based Great River has said it ""welcomes the conversation"" with Connexus.

""Great River and Connexus are working on a new contract that works for Connexus and doesn't harm our member-owner cooperatives"" said GRE spokeswoman Therese LaCanne.

Both parties express optimism that they can negotiate a satisfactory solution. Connexus owns about 20% of Great River which is owned by 28 co-op and other power retailers.

Great River is Minnesota's second largest electricity provider ultimately serving about 700000 Minnesota households and businesses. It is no slouch on renewables generating 30% of its power from wind a number expected to jump to 50% in 2030.

Still the Connexus board voted unanimously last year to end its membership in Great River.

Connexus says it pays for some GRE services that it doesn't need. For example in addition to investing in small-scale solar and high-tech conservation programs that are driven by consumer choice Connexus also has the scale and deep enough pockets to market on its own unlike smaller Great River co-ops Ridderbusch said last week.

Connexus has kept its rates flat over the last four years and also gets high marks from independent rating agencies for reliability. Yet it pays the same wholesale rates as other Great River members.

Ridderbusch believes he has the leverage to lower wholesale costs from Great River if ""more of our power is competitively sourced.""

And Ridderbusch said he believes Connexus can easily double the power it gets from small-scale solar projects very popular in its service territory that now generate enough juice to power 3700 homes at peak output as well as more battery storage.

""We want to do more on our own and buy more economical power from GRE"" Ridderbusch said.

Connexus was the only Great River member last summer to vote against the sale of Great River's huge Coal Creek power plant in North Dakota along with an accompanying high-voltage power line. Connexus said the sale to Rainbow Energy Center won't lead to as much savings as projected nor reduce greenhouse gases something disputed by GRE and Rainbow.

Great River had planned to close Coal Creek saying it couldn't sell the unprofitable power plant for even $1. But North Dakota government officials moved to save hundreds of jobs by arranging the Rainbow deal. On Thursday the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission voted in favor of the transmission line sale one of the last hurdles for the deal.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I am running to represent the people of Lee’s Summit City Council District 2. I do not like the direction that we’ve been headed. We need a fresh voice and perspective.

Across the Nation our cities are gradually slipping away. Police defunding pornography in our school libraries increased crime and drugs and businesses shutting down are all just a few of the problems we face and will continue to face.

We need leaders willing to work together to keep our city a desirable place to raise a family as well as bringing in new revenue streams. I am in a unique position to identify and understand the trials that families face daily. I also know the trials and obstacles that face the business community. I am confident that I can and will represent the concerns and needs of the citizens of my district and exceed their expectations.

When talking with District 2 citizens I hear these issues over and over. Economic Development the School board and increasing crime are very important issues. Government over-reach is also a large concern for people. I think government officials need to be held accountable by the people who elect them. It seems the direction that our city is going has been based on the desires of officials instead of the desires of the people they represent.

It would be my privilege and honor to represent District 2 as your Councilwoman in Lee’s Summit the city that I am proud to call my home.

My roots are simple—I grew up in poverty. I know what hard work is and how to get the job done with limited resources. I am grateful to our God because with faith hard work and determination we can overcome. Why? Because we live in America we can raise ourselves from poverty to prosperity.

My working career has ranged from being a stay-at-home mom a Real Estate agent International Manufacturing Procurement agent to a Senior Account Executive with C.H. Robinson Worldwide for the last eleven years. I have never forgotten where I came from and will always try to encourage people of what they are capable of and what they can achieve.

In our Nation many families have made tremendous sacrifices in the name of Freedom. My grandfather gave his life in WW II. My other grandfather served as a fighter pilot and my five uncles all served in wars from Korea to Vietnam. Patriotism is in my blood. I believe in God Family and Country.

I am a long-time member of Connection Point church. My charity work includes Bibles for the World Wounded Warriors Food for the Hungry Restoration House and the international fellowship of Christians and Jews. My husband and I just funded the construction of our second bomb shelter in Israel which we dedicated to our late son.

Ivey Joan Watson is on the mend after apparently suffering a foot injury.

The 3-year-old daughter of Jamie Lynn Spears and Jamie Watson went ""full throttle"" — a speed that landed her right in a foot brace.

On Saturday the 30-year-old mother of two shared a trio of photos of Ivey on Instagram showcasing the aftermath of her daughter's injury.

With Ivey dressed in a fluffy pink tutu and a pink and white tie dye sweatshirt Spears captioned the post: ""Don't let the pink tutu fool you she only has one mode and it's full throttle.""

In the first shot Ivey is shown from the abdomen down sporting a foot brace along with a band-aid on her right knee. The second and third snaps in the array show the tot sticking her tongue out though Spears strategically placed a green baseball cap sticker over her eyes.

Meanwhile Spears is gearing up for the release of her memoir Things I Should Have Said out on Jan. 18.

In November PEOPLE got an exclusive first-look and the actress finally reveals both the internal and external struggles she faced in 2007 when she became pregnant with her older daughter Maddie — whom she shares with ex Casey Aldridge — at just 16 years old.

New Delhi: Oil prices settled lower on Friday as the market weighed supply concerns from the unrest in Kazakhstan and outages in Libya against a U.S. jobs report that missed expectations and its potential impact on Federal Reserve policy.Brent crude settled down 24 cents or 0.3% to $81.75 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 56 cents or 0.7% at $78.90 a barrel.Brent and WTI were on track for gains of about 5% in the first week of the year with prices at their highest since late November spurred on by the supply concerns.""Employment data injected a question mark into where we are going from here and Omicron fears have crept back into the market"" said John Kilduff a partner at Again Capital Management.In Kazakhstan's main city Almaty security forces appeared to be in control of the streets and the president said constitutional order had mostly been restored a day after Russia sent troops to put down an uprising.The protests began in Kazakhstan's oil-rich western regions after state price caps on butane and propane were removed on New Year's Day.Production at Kazakhstan's top oilfield Tengiz was reduced on Thursday its operator Chevron Corp said as some contractors disrupted train lines in support of protests taking place across the central Asian country.Production in Libya has dropped to 729000 barrels per day from a high of 1.3 million bpd last year partly due to pipeline maintenance work.A barrel of oil for delivery in March was selling at a discount of as much as 70 cents to a barrel for delivery in February the highest since November.Both benchmarks were up $1 earlier in the session but oil along with stock markets and the dollar came under pressure after U.S. employment figures missed expectations.U.S. employment in the country increased less than expected in December amid worker shortages and job gains could remain moderate in the near term as spiralling COVID-19 infections disrupt economic activity.Meanwhile supply additions from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  Russia and allies - together called OPEC+ - are not keeping up with demand growth. OPEC 's output in December rose by 70000 bpd from the previous month versus the 253000 bpd increase allowed under the OPEC+ supply deal which restored output slashed in 2020 when demand collapsed under COVID-19 lockdowns.Government data this week also showed that crude inventories in the United States the world's top consumer have fallen for six consecutive weeks by the end of the year to their lowest since September.Extreme frigid weather in North Dakota and Alberta is also expected to hurt production in the region and led operators to shut the 590000 bpd Keystone Pipeline for a short period of time earlier in the week.U.S. oil rigs rose one to 481 this week their highest since April 2020 energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said in its closely followed report.While the Omicron coronavirus variant is rapidly taking hold demand-side concerns are easing amid rising evidence that it is less severe than previous variants.""The concerns about a massive slump in oil demand have faded now that it has become clear that Omicron leads to milder forms of the disease than previous variants of the virus meaning that massive mobility restrictions are not likely"" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9uaWNsZS5jby56dy9mb3JtZXItY2hldnJvbi10YWtlcy11cC1jb21tZW50YXJ5LWR1dHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Breaking news,"Mbulelo Mpofu Sports Reporter

(KOLN) - Lincoln Fire and Rescue responded to a fire at New Covenant Community Church on Saturday.

According to LFR a call for smoke showing from the church came in just before 3 a.m. When crews arrived they reported fire into the roof.

LFR said a lightning strike is suspected but not confirmed to be the cause of the fire.

According to the fire inspector’s initial estimate the fire caused $1.5 million in damage to the building with a large amount of the damage up in-between the roof and the ceiling.

A spokesperson for the church said on social media that the church will hold a gathering on Sunday in the front parking lot at 10:30 a.m. for worship and prayer. Any additional service and programming has been cancelled. The spokesperson also asked that people avoid going inside the church for the time being due to multiple hazards.

Representatives of the church have already met with insurance and a crew is on site to begin clean-up and restoration.

This incident is still under investigation. Stay connected to 1011now.com for the latest updates.

(WIS) - The West Columbia community is now rallying around one local Church that was vandalized with graphic images and messages of “Save Gaza” and “Free Palestine” amid the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Since the Suburban Baptist Church was hit with vandalism late Thursday night the West Columbia Police Department has begun to help clean up the mess by replacing the front sign and painting the front doors at the church.

“I was very shocked” said Megan Hobbs a member of the congregation at the Suburban Baptist Church.

Hobbs and other members of the Suburban Baptist Church couldn’t believe what they woke up to on Friday morning as they found pro-Palestine messages and profanity spray painted on the front and side doors of the church building.

The Church’s Mission House across the street which houses their food pantry was also vandalized.

Senior Pastor Tracy McGee said he started getting phone calls around 4 a.m. on Friday morning that his church had been vandalized. He and Assistant Pastor Elijah Smalls were in disbelief to learn about and see what had happened.

“When I got here and saw all the spray paint on the doors I couldn’t believe it” Smalls said.

“That stuff happens in New York City; it doesn’t happen in West Columbia” McGee added.

McGee says the graphic nature of the spray paint was jarring. In his 17 years at the Church he’s never seen anything like this.

“(I’m in) disbelief that something like this would happen and how far the craziness in this world has come” McGee said.

Luckily efforts to divide the Church’s congregation and damper their faith were unsuccessful as they held Sunday Service as normal the same week of the incident.

On Saturday McGee says a West Columbia Police Sergeant came to personally repaint the doors of the Church building. On Sunday churchgoers walked through the doors without having to stare at the profanity.

“He was up here and the pornography and the ‘Save Gaza’ was taken off the doors so we didn’t have to walk through that this morning” Mcgee said “What a strong revelation.”

Since the incident McGee has gotten phone calls from pastors across the country reaching out from as far as Austin Texas with messages of solidarity.

West Columbia Mayor Tem Miles also came out to Sunday Service to show his support and help their faith triumph over the hate.

“At the end of the day we need to all figure out a way to be better to each other and take care of each other while we’re here” Miles said.

Tracy also says despite the vandalism this incident won’t stop the church’s efforts and they’ll be back for service again next Sunday.

As of May 5th 2024 West Columbia Police says they have not charged anyone with vandalizing the property but that the investigation is ongoing.

Pastor Jeff Huckeby told KWTX that cushions on the pews the sound system and chairs will all need to be replaced. Both the chapel and the fellowship hall saw significant damage.

“It’s been out of the banks before but not this bad” Huckeby said. “It floated everything in the chapel and filled the room with silt.”

Early Sunday morning Huckeby made the call to cancel 11 a.m. Sunday service due to the condition the church was in.

“I came down early about 6:30 and that’s when I saw the water over the bridge and that the church was underwater at that time” Huckeby said.

Thankfully the church had flood insurance and an adjuster will be by next week to survey the damage.

”We’ve been through harder times before and we’ll just keep going” Huckeby said.

The church located at 6545 FM 107 was honored with a historical marker placed on its property by the Coryell County Historical Commission in May 1995 according to the Gatesville Messenger.

It was first organized as Coryell Creek Baptist Church in 1882 according to the marker.

(Alex Fulton for KWTX)

In 1929 the church changed its name to Pecan Grove Baptist and moved its present location off FM 107.

Sunday services will now be held under a pavilion onsite until all of the repairs are wrapped up.

“The church is more than just the building it’s the people” Huckeby said. “It doesn’t matter where we get together.”

Huckeby is asking his Central Texas neighbors to pray for him and his congregation as they work to rebuild.

Jeff Huckeby recorded footage of the flooding at the Pecan Grove Baptist Church in Gatesville Texas.

Two years ago it also provided physical refuge from the horrors outside.

Almost 100 residents sheltered in a basement chapel at the Church of the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary while Russian troops occupied the village in March 2022 as they closed in on Ukraine’s capital Kyiv 40 miles (60 kilometers) to the east.

“The fighting was right here” the Rev. Hennadii Kharkivskyi said. He pointed to the churchyard where a memorial stone commemorates six Ukrainian soldiers killed in the battle for Lypivka.

“They were injured and then the Russians came and shot each one finished them off” he said.

The two-week Russian occupation left the village shattered and the church itself — a modern replacement for an older structure — damaged while still under construction. It’s one of 129 war-damaged Ukrainian religious sites recorded by UNESCO the United Nations’ cultural organization.

“It’s solid concrete” the priest said. “But it was pierced easily” by Russian shells which blasted holes in the church and left a wall inside pockmarked with shrapnel scars. At the bottom of the basement staircase a black scorch mark shows where a grenade was lobbed down.

But within weeks workers were starting to repair the damage and work to finish the solid building topped by red domes that towers over the village with its scarred and damaged buildings blooming fruit trees and fields that the Russians left littered with land mines.

For many of those involved — including a tenacious priest a wealthy philanthropist a famous artist and a team of craftspeople — rebuilding this church plays a part in Ukraine’s struggle for culture identity and its very existence. The building a striking fusion of the ancient and the modern reflects a country determined to express its soul even in wartime.

The building’s austere exterior masks a blaze of color inside. The vibrant red blue orange and gold panels decorating walls and ceiling are the work of Anatoliy Kryvolap an artist whose bold modernist images of saints and angels make this church unique in Ukraine.

The 77-year-old Kryvolap whose abstract paintings sell for tens of thousands of dollars at auction said that he wanted to eschew the severe-looking icons he’d seen in many Orthodox churches.

“It seems to me that going to church to meet God should be a celebration” he said.

There has been a church on this site for more than 300 years. An earlier building was destroyed by shelling during World War II. The small wooden church that replaced it was put to more workaday uses in Soviet times when religion was suppressed.

Kharkivskyi reopened the parish in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union and set about rebuilding the church spiritually and physically with funding from Bohdan Batrukh a Ukrainian film producer and distributor.

Work stopped when Russian troops launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 2022. Moscow’s forces reached the fringes of Kyiv before being driven back. Lypivka was liberated by the start of April.

Since then fighting has been concentrated in the east and south of Ukraine though aerial attacks with rockets missiles and drones are a constant threat across the country.

By May 2022 workers had resumed work on the church. It has been slow going. Millions of Ukrainians fled the country when war erupted including builders and craftspeople. Hundreds of thousands of others have joined the military.

Inside the church a tower of wooden scaffolding climbs up to the dome where a red and gold image of Christ raises a hand in blessing

For now services take place in the smaller basement where the priest in white and gold robes recently conducted a service for a couple of dozen parishioners as the smell of incense wafted through the candlelit room.

He is expecting a large crowd for Easter which falls on Sunday. Eastern Orthodox Christians usually celebrate Easter later than Catholic and Protestant churches because they use a different method of calculating the date for the holy day that marks Christ’s resurrection.

A majority of Ukrainians identify as Orthodox Christians though the church is divided. Many belong to the independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine with which the Lypivka church is affiliated. The rival Ukrainian Orthodox Church was loyal to the patriarch in Moscow until splitting from Russia after the 2022 invasion and is viewed with suspicion by many Ukrainians.

Kharkivskyi says the size of his congregation has remained stable even though the population of the village has shrunk dramatically since the war began. In tough times he says people turn to religion.

“Like people say: ‘Air raid alert — go see God’” the priest said wryly.

Liudmyla Havryliuk who has a summer home in Lypivka found herself drawn back to the village and its church even before the fighting stopped. When Russia invaded she drove to Poland with her daughters then 16 and 18 years old. But within weeks she came back to the village she loves still besieged by the Russians.

The family hunkered down in their home cooking on firewood drawing water from a well sometimes under Russian fire. Havryliuk said that when they saw Russian helicopters they held hands and prayed.

“Not prayer in strict order like in the book” she said. “It was from my heart from my soul about what should we do? How can I save myself and especially my daughters?”

She goes to Lypivka’s church regularly saying it’s a “place you can shelter mentally within yourself.”

As Ukraine marks its third Easter at war the church is nearing completion. Only a few of Kryvolap’s interior panels remain to be installed. He said that the shell holes will be left unrepaired as a reminder to future generations.

“(It’s) so that they will know what kind of ‘brothers’ we have that these are just fascists” he said referring to the Russians.

“We are Orthodox just like them but destroying churches is something inhumane.”

Cincinnati Bengals rookie receiver Ja'Marr Chase entered Sunday's Week 18 game against the Browns in Cleveland with 1429 yards for the season - third most in Bengals' history - needing just 12 to break Chad Johnson's single-season franchise record of 1440 set in 2007.

Chase got to play in one more game than Ochocinco did but he broke Chad's record on a 24-yard catch and run from backup quarterback Brandon Allen in the first quarter that gave him 1455 in his first National Football League season.

Social media reactions:

Asked Ja’Marr Chase if there was a record he didn’t break that was a goal of his he said he was a touchdown short of his goal. Wanted 14 in his rookie season finished with 13. #Bengals — Kelsey Conway (@KelseyLConway) January 9 2022

Zac Taylor said Ja'Marr Chase never once lobbied for himself to play today it was Taylor's decision. Said Chase would have been completely fine if he didn't play today and didn't get to break the record. #Bengals — Kelsey Conway (@KelseyLConway) January 9 2022

@Real10jayy__ Congrats young boul 💯 — Chad Johnson (@ochocinco) January 9 2022

On the #Bengals second offensive series of the game Brandon Allen finds Ja'Marr Chase on first down to break the record. Chase needed 12 coming into today's game he got 24 yards on the play.



His day is likely done. — Kelsey Conway (@KelseyLConway) January 9 2022

Last week Chase's 266 yards were the most in a game by a rookie in NFL history. He had 11 catches - including three for touchdowns - in a 34-31 win in come-from-behind fashion against the Kansas City Chiefs at Paul Brown Stadium.

In the win against the Chiefs Chase also broke Justin Jefferson's NFL rookie record of 1400 receiving yards in a season set in 2020. Bill Groman had 1473 in his rookie season for the 1960 Houston Oilers before the AFL-NFL merger.

And Chase became just the third Bengals player - joining Carl Pickens (17 in 1995) and Tyler Eifert (13 in 2015) - with 13 receiving touchdowns in a season.

Chase's teammate starting quarterback Joe Burrow set a new Bengals' record for single-season passing yardage last Sunday. He also tied Andy Dalton's single-season record for passing touchdowns with his third TD pass of the game to Chase.

CSCO,Cisco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1bHV0aG5ld3N0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvbm9ydGhsYW5kLW91dGRvb3JzL2lzbGFuZC1sYWtlLWdldHMtZmlyc3QtY2lzY28tc3RvY2tpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Island Lake gets first cisco stocking,"DULUTH — Island Lake has received its first-ever stocking of cisco a fatty little fish hoped to beef up the size of walleyes in the popular reservoir.

Biologists for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources netted 250 adult cisco from Hanging Horn Lake near Barnum in early December just before the fish spawned and just before the lake iced over and moved them to Island Lake north of Duluth where they are expected to provide a high-calorie food for walleye.

It’s the first installment of what should be several cisco stockings said Dan Wilfond Duluth-area fisheries specialist for the DNR. The agency intends to stock about 4000 cisco each year for the next five years.

It’s hoped the cisco will then become self-sustaining reproducing and filling a niche in Island Lake's food chain.

Hanging Horn Lake was picked as the source because the cisco there were confirmed as disease-free and because it was the closest to Duluth with a sizable cisco population. But the little fish proved maddeningly hard to capture and keep alive so Wilfond said other donor lakes in Itasca and Cook counties will also be eyed in future years both to increase supply and add genetic diversity.

“No one should expect that throwing 250 cisco into Island Lake is going to create a big year class of cisco in 2022 and somehow turn the lake around quickly’’ Wilfond told the News Tribune. “It’s going to be a years-long process … but we're on the board. There are a few of them in the lake now. We've got the process rolling.”

Island Lake has excellent walleye reproduction almost every year one of the best lakes in the Northland. But those walleyes then grow extremely slowly among the slowest of any lake in the Northland. Anglers have complained about the small size of walleyes they catch on Island lake for decades dubbing the common 12-inch fish “Island lake Specials.” And DNR surveys found the same thing for the sprawling 10800-acre lake: an average size of about 12 inches down from about 17 inches 40 years ago.

Biologists say an inadequate food supply too many small walleyes competing for too few minnows may be part of the problem. So they moved ahead with a two-pronged effort to fix it.

The first change which began with the 2021 open water fishing season last May included a new bag limit of 10 walleye daily for Island Lake — up from six fish daily — with anglers encouraged to catch and keep more small fish. All walleyes kept must be under 15 inches. All walleyes 15-20 inches must be immediately released and anglers can keep one walleye daily over 20 inches.

It’s the first time ever in Minnesota that the DNR has used a higher bag limit to reduce overall walleye numbers and improve average size. Island Lake now has the highest bag limit for walleye in the state. The increased limit compares to the general limit of six walleyes daily in Minnesota although many lakes have four-walleye limits and there's a push at the state Legislature to lower the statewide limit to four walleyes daily for lakes that don't have special regulations.

The cisco stocking forms the other half of the DNR’s Island Lake walleye effort.

“We’ll be monitoring the lake as we continue to stock them  conducting assessments to see whether they take hold or not’’ Wilfond noted adding that he’s “cautiously optimistic’’ the DNR efforts will help boost the size of Island Lake walleyes.

In addition to lack of food Wilfond has said Island Lake walleyes may be impacted by spiny water fleas. In 1990 Island Lake became the first inland lake in Minnesota confirmed with the invasive species a Eurasian native that likely arrived in the Twin Ports in the ballast of ships. It appears walleye growth has slowed even more since they arrived. It’s possible the spiny water fleas are causing a reduction in some small fish species in the lake that walleye could eat.

Data shows cisco should thrive in Island Lake especially in the deeper coolwater zones of the reservoir but also that cisco eat spiny water fleas and may help reduce spiny water flea numbers in the lake.

It’s unclear if the cisco were so hard to catch because of the unusually warm autumn that kept water temperatures above the prime spawning level or some other reasons. Efforts to use traps in shallow waters near where cisco were supposed to be spawning produced zero fish Wilfond noted. He said it took two weeks of trying before crews finally collected 250 cisco using gill nets that were quickly retrieved to keep the fish alive far from their 4000-cisco goal.

“Hopefully we'll have better luck next year and in following years. We’re going to have some other source lakes to fall back on’’ he said noting it may be many years until anglers start seeing more big walleyes in Island lake as a result of the effort.

Island Lake is a man-made reservoir created in the early 20th century by damming the Cloquet River. It’s used by Minnesota Power as a water storage reservoir for its hydroelectric dam system on the St. Louis River near Carlton.

The DNR has conducted previous cisco introductions into Lake Elmo in the eastern Twin Cities into several Cuyuna Range mine pits near Brainerd and into Long Lake near Walker. In each case the cisco population became self-sustaining.

About cisco

Source: University of Minnesota

Cisco also called lake herring (especially in Lake Superior) and inland tullibee. The word ""cisco"" comes from a French name. Cisco are members of the Salmonidae family which includes trout salmon lake whitefish and char.

Where do they live?

Cisco (often called ""lake herring"") are common in Lake Superior but they also occur in many inland lakes of the central and northeast regions of Minnesota. The cisco is a cold-water fish that needs well-oxygenated water deep in the lake in summer so they usually do best in deep clearwater lakes.

How big are they?

ADVERTISEMENT

Their size is highly variable depending on the lake. In Cass Lake for example adults get as large as 12-14 inches long. In Lake Itasca they sometimes reach up to 24 inches and 4 pounds. In Ten Mile Lake they rarely go beyond 3.2 inches. Cisco in Lake Superior average about a foot long but some have been caught up to 24 inches. The Hanging Horn Lake cisco moved to Island Lake averaged about 6 inches long with one up to 14 inches.

What do they eat?

They begin eating copepods and small water fleas and later add bigger water fleas midge and ghost midge larvae. Sometimes they feast on mayflies and caddisflies as the bugs hatch at the water's surface.

What eats them?

Young and smaller cisco fall prey to many kinds of bigger fish including northern pike lake trout burbot yellow perch rainbow trout musky and walleyes. Some people net and eat cisco from some northern inland lakes and they are netted in Lake Superior where the so-called lake herring are considered prime table fare.

How do they reproduce?

They spawn in late fall usually late November. The spawning sites are commonly in shallow water over bottoms of clean rock gravel or sand. A single female may lay 3000-15000 eggs depending on her size. The embryos develop over the winter and hatch the following spring.

Amazon’s voice assistant hasn’t quite reached the level of HAL the iconic AI from 2001: A Space Odyssey. However we learned this week that Alexa is going to space later this year and around the moon for a technology demonstration on the Orion deep-space capsule as part of NASA’s Artemis 1 mission.

Veteran space reporter Alan Boyle GeekWire contributing editor joins us on this episode of the GeekWire Podcast to explain what Alexa will be doing during the mission and what the partners on the demonstration — Lockheed Martin Amazon and Cisco — hope to prove in the process.

Then we discuss some of the key milestones from the past year in space including Blue Origin taking the first paying passenger on a suborbital commercial flight plus highlights from SpaceX Virgin Galactic and others. And we look ahead to upcoming events to keep an eye on as detailed by Alan in his annual space recap and preview.

The tropical fruit also has a rich agricultural tale to tell.

While lychee is not widely grown in North America it’s been a fixture in Chinese agriculture for more than 2000 years. China remains the largest producer of the crop with it being a central source of income for many farmers in the country’s southern region. The FAO estimates that the Asia-Pacific region is responsible for more than 95 percent of the world’s production of lychees.

A team of scientists has recently decoded the tropical fruit’s genetics and say their findings hint upon ways to improve and sustain the crop’s future production. The research published this month in Nature Genetics determined that the lychee’s agricultural origins stemmed from two separate domestication events in the Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Hainan. They reached that conclusion by using the popular Fei Zi Xiao lychee as their reference genome comparing its genes to about 70 other wild and farmed lychee cultivars. This allowed the researchers to map out the lychee’s genetic evolution and trace its paths back to the first instances of it being farmed.

One key finding was a genetic deletion or a missing chunk of DNA near two genes associated with flowering. The mutation controls when and how long a lychee tree flowers. It explains the reason why the original Yunnan variety—which has the mutation—is an early flowering plant while the Hainan variety—which doesn’t have it—is late flowering. A hybrid of both varieties called the Fei Zi Xiao lychee flowers early in June but not as early as the original Yunnan lychees and not as late as the original Hainan variety.

Currently most farmed lychees ripen during a short window from early June to mid July. Once picked the fruit only lasts around two to three days. But having the genetic information to better understand when the plant will flower and then fruit researchers say it could lead to different fruiting and harvesting possibilities in time to control time periods extending that availability.

Why is this important? “This is a resource for the future of the lychee” says Victor Albert a University of Buffalo evolutionary biologist and senior author of the study. “To have its genome means that we can understand everything from the fruiting differences in the variety of lychees that exist but we can also determine and find traits like tastes fragrances colors and pathogen resistance.”

The sequenced genome of the lychee Albert explains will be especially key to preserving the crop as part of China’s agriculture industry in the context of climate change. When and if temperatures shift or when environmental stressors take their toll on agriculture finding or breeding varieties with preferable genetic traits will be the tactic taken to preserve the plant’s future. He adds that the genetic information could also help relatives of the lychee such as the maple tree navigate agricultural or environmental challenges.

Next the scientists want to sequence other genomes of those related species. The branch of researchers based in China also hopes to further research the study’s findings observing how the mutation or lack thereof controls the plant’s flowering and fruiting time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhL25hdGlvbmFsLWhlYWx0aC1taXNzaW9uLWxhdW5jaGVzLXByb2plY3QtbmlyYW1heS1pbi1hc3NhbS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84ODc4MDg4Ni5jbXPSAX1odHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS9uYXRpb25hbC1oZWFsdGgtbWlzc2lvbi1sYXVuY2hlcy1wcm9qZWN0LW5pcmFtYXktaW4tYXNzYW0vYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg4NzgwODg2LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,National Health Mission launches project 'Niramay' in Assam,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

The New York-headquartered bank said in October that it would require all US employees to be vaccinated against Covid as a condition of their employment in line with a Biden administration policy requiring workers supporting government contracts to be fully vaccinated.

The Biden policy has been widely challenged in the courts and is currently before the US supreme court following requests by Republican state officials and business groups to block it.

Citigroup also said it would examine requests for exemptions on religious or medical grounds or any other accommodation by state or local law on a case-by-case basis.

More than 90% of Citigroup staff have so far complied with the mandate and that figure is rising rapidly Bloomberg reported citing a Citigroup spokeswoman. Citigroup the news agency said will place workers who do not comply on unpaid leave with their last day of employment at the end of the month.

The enforcement of “no jab no job” on 14 January comes as Covid infections have surged in New York to five times last winter’s numbers – 59% thought to be of the highly transmissable Omicron variant.

The decision to enforce the mandate comes as Wall Street banks have struggled to get employees back to their office desks after close to two years of remote working.

Last month JPMorgan the largest US bank told unvaccinated staff based in Manhattan to work remotely “until alternative solutions are considered” and said it was increasing restrictions on unvaccinated workers.

In a memo sent to staff first reported by Reuters JPMorgan also urged bankers to get Covid vaccines and to receive booster shots while relaxing mask policy to require they are worn requiring in lobby areas elevators and in cafes when not eating.

The memo issued during a relative lull between the Delta variant and Omicron surge said “it seems unfair” for vaccinated workers to wear face coverings indoors adding that doing so would slow down its efforts for a return to normalcy.

Citigroup’s move comes as New York’s leadership announced a policy designed to hasten workers’ return to their desks in office buildings that are estimated to be just 30% full.

On Thursday New York City’s mayor Eric Adams standing beside the state governor Kathy Hochul proposed easing workers back into businesses with a three-day working week and then expanding to five days in New York City.



“I say let’s start out with a three-day week to let people see how safe it is to come back to work then we cycle back into a five-day week” he said. “We can do this within a three-week period and be up and operating in our city.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2MzZTRiY2NlLTAwZmEtNDNmYi1hNDI3LTYyNTUyM2NkZWJkYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street banks set to report record profits for 2021,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

The main demonstrations occurred in Duesseldorf Frankfurt and Magdeburg while “walkabouts” took place in many other German cities against measures imposed to combat the omicron variant.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced Friday that proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test will now be required to enter bars and restaurants in the country.

Proof of vaccination has been required to enter many public venues for several weeks but the new measure expands the mandate to include eating and drinking establishments.

Scholz announced the decision to reporters in Berlin following a COVID-19 strategy meeting with Germany’s 16 regional governors.

The leaders also agreed to shorten quarantine—or self-isolation—for those exposed to COVID-19 cases from 12 to 10 days. Those vaccinated or fully vaccinated with a booster will not have to quarantine at all.

Scholz said the government met its goal of administering 30 million booster shots by Christmas. He said it is now aiming to administer another 30 million by the end of January.

Protests against government coronavirus restrictions also took place Saturday in Turin Paris and Beirut.

India’s capital New Delhi was shut down Saturday to halt the spread of the coronavirus after a nearly fourfold nationwide spike in infections in the last week alone. Most shops were closed but some essential services remained open.

The surge in infections is fueled by the highly contagious omicron variant as political rallies attended by tens of thousands of people continue to be held by candidates before state elections are held later this year.

Global surge

Britain reported a record high 146390 new cases Saturday. The country also reported 150000 COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began more deaths than any other European country except Russia.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned Friday that hospital admissions were rising and said the country’s health system was facing a “rocky few weeks ahead.”

Sri Lankan health authorities began vaccinating children ages 12 to 15 Friday to fight off a wave of COVID-19 cases driven by the omicron variant.

In Japan the government approved new restrictions Friday in the southwestern regions of Okinawa Yamaguchi and Hiroshima to stop a rise in coronavirus cases. The restrictions include reduced hours for restaurants and bans on large-scale events.

A COVID-19 vaccine deadline is rapidly approaching for Citigroup employees in the U.S. The financial firm has issued a mandate—get the COVID vaccine by January 14.

The company says those who do not comply by Friday will be placed on unpaid leave until the end of the month and will then face termination. The unvaccinated Citigroup staffers also could lose out on end-of-the-year bonuses.

Staff can apply for medical religious or legal exemptions.

Reports say more than 90% of the staff have complied with the company’s vaccine mandate.



The deadline for the Citigroup vaccine mandate approaches as the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center reported early Saturday it has recorded 303.2 million global COVID cases and 5.5 million deaths. Johns Hopkins said 98.3 billion vaccines have been administered.

Hong Kong

In Hong Kong health officials Friday announced that more than 100 people including at least nine government officials and several lawmakers have been sent into quarantine after attending a birthday party where they had encountered two attendees who later tested positive for COVID-19.

Hong Kong public health chief Edwin Tsui told reporters the entire guest list of about 170 people would need to be isolated after a second person tested positive for COVID-19. The guest list at the Monday evening party included Home Affairs minister Caspar Tsui Hong Kong police chief Raymond Siu and immigration minister Au Ka-wang.

The guest list also included at least 20 lawmakers but as some left early it is not clear how many will be required to quarantine.

The party came three days after health officials advised residents avoid large gatherings. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Friday expressed disappointment that officials set such a bad example for the public.

The US bank announced its plan to impose new vaccination rules in October and now becomes the first major Wall Street institution to follow through with a strict vaccine mandate. Its move comes as the financial industry grapples with how to bring workers back to offices safely and get back to business as usual at a time when the highly infectious Omicron coronavirus variant is spreading like wildfire.

Other major Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs & Co Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co have told some unvaccinated employees to work from home but none has yet gone as far as sacking staff.

While Citigroup is the first Wall Street bank to enforce a vaccine mandate a handful of other major US companies have introduced “no-jab no-job” policies including Google and United Airlines with varying degrees of stringency.

More than 90 per cent of Citigroup employees have complied with the mandate so far and that figure is rising rapidly according to a source familiar with the matter adding that the timing of the vaccination mandate would be different for branch staff.

When it announced its policy Citigroup also said it would assess exemptions on religious or medical grounds or any other accommodation by state or local law on a case-by-case basis.

The bank said then it was complying with the policy of US President Joe Biden’s administration requiring all workers supporting government contracts to be fully vaccinated as the government was a “large and important” client.

“You are welcome to apply for other roles at Citi in the future as long as you are compliant with Citi’s vaccination policy” the bank said in the memo. “If you are not vaccinated we urge you to get vaccinated as soon as possible.”

Vaccination has become a divisive issue in the US as it has in many countries around the world with some people fiercely opposed and many Republicans critical of mandates imposed by governments and businesses.

The US Supreme Court was hearing arguments on Friday over requests by Republican state officials and business groups to block a Biden mandate for firms with more than 100 workers that requires employees be vaccinated or tested weekly.

Columbia Business School professor Adam Galinsky who advises companies on their return-to-office strategies said many companies initially welcomed the White House’s vaccine mandate because it took the matter out of their hands.

“However companies are recognising that the Biden mandate may not hold up at the conservative Supreme Court” he said. “If it doesn’t hold then they are going to have the decision put back in their hands and they will have to do something.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vYm9ybmVvYnVsbGV0aW4uY29tLmJuL3BhZ2UvNTc4My8_bT1panZqenhoa3R00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Borneo Bulletin Online | The Independent Newspaper in Brunei Darussalam Sabah and Sarawak | Page 5783,"Kirsten Grieshaber

BERLIN (AP) – Ukrainian refugee Mariia Kerashchenko tightly clasped the hands of her two children as she walked them through the courtyard of a seedy Berlin building up a graffiti-covered stairway and into a modern sunlit classroom.

Her seven-year-old son Myroslav is one of 40 children who started their first day of school on Monday only weeks after joining the millions flooding into Europe to flee the war in Ukraine.

Daughter Zoriana who is three is still too young for the class which is being taught by two Ukrainians who also fled to the German capital. The lessons part of a volunteer initiative will prepare the children for entering Berlin’s regular school system.

“It gets me emotional when I see all the help and solidarity here” the 30-year-old Kerashchenko from Vinnytsia in central Ukraine told The Associated Press (AP) her eyes welling with tears.

“Every day I hope that we can go back to Ukraine but it is too dangerous for now so in the meantime it is wonderful that my son can go to school in Germany” she added.

The classes for the refugees were put together by Burcak Sevilgen and Faina Karlitski who in only two weeks raised the funds organised the rent-free classrooms and advertised their programme on the messaging service Telegram.

The children nervously clutched their new exercise books sharpened pencils and erasers as their new teachers welcomed them in Ukrainian on the third floor of the former factory. They will follow their curriculum from back home and also take German language classes. The three hours of school each weekday will be followed by activities such as playacting painting or handicrafts.

Natalia Khalil 33 from Rivne in western Ukraine is teaching the third and fourth graders while Tatjana Gubskaya 56 will be in charge of the first and second graders. Gubskaya fled Ukraine with her daughter and a seven-year-old grandson who is in her classroom.

“The kids are grateful to have some kind of routine again and meet other children from Ukraine – they and their mothers have all been very stressed lately” said Gubskaya who also taught second grade classes before the February 24 Russian invasion.

The teachers will be paid EUR500 per month in donations until they have work permits and can be officially hired.

Sevilgen 36 one of the two people behind the refugee classes is a Berlin teacher herself. She and her 31-year-old friend Karlitski a management consultant decided to do what they could to get at least some of the refugee children back into school quickly.

“We both have always had an eye for social issues and wanted to help here as well” Sevilgen said explaining why they have spent every free minute to organise the classes.

They started raising funds and arranged with the Berlin youth support programme Arche – “ark” in English – to take over the sponsorship for the classes. They got an offer from online search engine Ecosia to use the rent-free rooms in Berlin’s immigrant neighbourhood of Wedding and quickly connected via Telegram with Ukrainian mothers who had recently arrived in Berlin.

More than three million Ukrainians have fled abroad most of them to Poland. The majority are mothers and their children with men of military age not allowed to leave Ukraine. Inside the country over six million have been displaced according to the United Nations (UN).

Germany has registered 225357 Ukrainian refugees as of Monday although the real numbers are expected to be much higher since they don’t need a visa to enter the country and federal police only keep records of refugees arriving by train or bus. Those Ukrainians entering Germany from Poland by car usually are not registered.

Up to 10000 refugees have been arriving by train daily in Berlin since the start of the war and thousands more have come by car. Many are staying at shelters in the city’s convention centre and at a former airport while others are with relatives who immigrated years ago and belong to a 300000-member Ukrainian diaspora.

The government estimates that about half of the refugees are children and teenagers who will need to attend schools and kindergartens. It has established a task force to coordinate their school attendance in Germany’s 16 states.

Several Berlin schools including some private institutions already have taken in a few refugees and city officials are in the process of establishing up to 50 special welcome classes to bring them up to speed in language skills. The authorities can draw from their experience from 2015-16 when about one million people fled conflicts in Syria Iraq and Afghanistan. Those children eventually entered the school system.

Until the welcome classes are up and running the two classes organised by Sevilgen and Karlitski will help ease the children’s transition to their new lives teach them German and enable them to make new friends.

“A new routine and other children – those are the most important things for them right now” Sevilgen said. “And if we get more donations we hope that we will be able to keep this project running as long as it takes to get the kids into the regular Berlin schools.”"

Over the past two years at least eight state-linked companies have announced major mergers acquisitions asset disposals or privatisations in the island’s biggest industrial overhaul in two decades.

Oil-rig builder Keppel Corp has been pivoting towards clean energy while Sembcorp Industries shed its rig business altogether. Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel) is entering the world of digital banking.

“I compare this to the restructuring phase of Singapore conglomerates in the early 2000s” in the aftermath of the Sars virus and the dot-com crash said Mr Kenneth Tang a portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management. “Those were very dark times for Singapore but they became a catalyst for change.”

The Singapore Government has for decades curated the nation’s economic future through a group of state-owned champions shifting direction as needed to stay relevant in the global economy. But the latest rewriting of the nation’s industrial playbook may prove harder as the giant firms take on competitors that are often newer and more nimble.

The Government has been pumping billions in recent years into transforming 23 industries including manufacturing financial services and real estate to meet the challenges of digitalisation. At the same time Singapore has created a 2030 roadmap to become a regional hub for carbon trading and green finance.

It has also set aside about $25 billion up to end-2025 for research in areas such as health and biomedical sciences climate change and artificial intelligence. And a series of industry-led groups have been set up to explore opportunities in areas such as robotics e-commerce and supply-chain digitalisation with government support.

For Keppel Sembcorp Industries and Sembcorp Marine the changing global economy means trying to shed or merge oil-related businesses and focus on renewable energy such as offshore wind and hydrogen. It’s a major shift for one of the world’s top oil trading and refining cities particularly at a time when the fuel’s price has been rising. Singapore has oil-refining capacity of 1.5 million barrels per day according to the United States’ International Trade Administration website. It’s the fifth-largest refinery and export hub in the world the US Energy Information Administration says.

While Keppel has increased its focus on renewable energy it’s also expanding its liquefied natural gas business. It’s in talks to merge its rig-building operations with smaller rival Sembcorp Marine which has also moved into clean energy in recent years while it still works on fossil-fuel projects.

“They are trying to build a new train while they are keeping the oil train running” said National University of Singapore associate professor of accounting Mak Yuen Teen. Sembcorp Industries has been working on solar and wind energy projects across India China and Britain but still gets a majority of revenue from selling energy from conventional sources such as coal and natural gas.

Singapore’s oil-refining industry isn’t going away though partly because many of oil’s by-products are still ubiquitous used in everything from toothpaste to synthetic fibres.

Refiners “are essentially saying we still need all these things in our daily lives but how do we make it more energy-efficient to produce the by-product” said Mr Song Seng Wun an economist at CIMB Private Banking. Singapore’s biggest renewables exports are likely to be goods such as semiconductors and services for companies seeking energy efficiency he said.",,,

Pristina: Kosovo police on Saturday seized hundreds of cryptocurrency mining machines and arrested one person in the tense ethnic-Serb majority north as the country suffered an energy crisis.Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are created through solving complex equations -- an endeavour that consumes enormous amounts of energyTensions between the Serb-majority area and the ethnic Albanian majority government are running high and Kosovo's government on Tuesday brought in a temporary ban on cryptocurrency mining in an effort to bring down electricity consumption.During the operation police ""confiscated 272 different anti-miner devices used for the production of Bitcoin"" a police statement said.One person was arrested it added.""The whole action took place and ended without incidents"" Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla said on Facebook.The confiscated equipment uses as much electricity as 500 homes a month or between 60000 and 120000 euros ($68000 and 136000) said Finance Minister Hekuran Murati on Facebook.""We cannot allow the illegal enrichment of some at the expense of taxpayers.""Ethnic Serbs in Kosovo's four northern municipalities have not paid for their electricity since the end of the 1998-1999 war between independence-seeking ethnic Albanian guerrilla and Serbian armed forces.They do not recognise Pristina's authority as they remain loyal to Belgrade.According to local media the total cost of the energy spent in the Serb-majority north is around 12 million euros a year.The energy crisis in Kosovo has worsened after a production unit of one of the two main power plants stopped working and prompted the government to introduce power reductions in December.The crisis comes also as a result of rising global import prices and increasing demand.Earlier this week police carried out two operations in ethnic Albanian majority areas and seized 70 pieces of crypto mining equipment.Economy Minister Artane Rizvanolli earlier this week labelled the hunt for crypto currency mining an ""emergency measure"" due to the crisis.However police operations raised questions over their legality as experts say there is no legal grounds to ban crypto currency mining as Kosovo has no law regulating the issue.Pristina said in October it had drafted a bill on crypto currency which the parliament was due to adopt by the end of the last year.

We will announce a strike call against UT's decision during the rally"".Section 133 of the Electricity Act 2003 makes it compulsory that under the favourable transfer scheme the service conditions of employees and staff must not be less favourable as per the statement.Electricity consumers have serious apprehension that after privatising the department the electricity tariff will be hiked to give more profits to a private party at the cost of consumers it noted.The policy of the government to give profitable avenues to the corporate to make a profit at the cost of the public is condemnable the federation said.Under Electricity Act 2003 the government has to take the advice of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission where major changes in policy are involved and which has not been done in the case of UT Chandigarh it pointed out.",,,

Bears could retain control for the next few weeks but there is a potential light at the end of the tunnel because the decline is approaching strong support at the 200-day moving average at 0.00002400 which has narrowly aligned with the .786 Fibonacci retracement of the September into October rally wave.

SPDR Select Sector Utilities ETF (XLU) posted the third highest ETF volume on Friday bouncing at 69 after a 5-day pullback. The fund has spent the last month testing resistance at the February 2020 high at 71.10 with a breakout setting the stage for the strongest gains since 2019. Natural gas prices haven’t risen at the same rate as other fossil fuels and many of these companies generate power through water nuclear and other cheap energies making them less vulnerable to rising commodity prices.

Universal Citywalk Review: Food Things to Do,"I much prefer Disney Springs overall but I still think there are things to be appreciated about CityWalk.

I took this picture at Disney Springs while visiting the Christmas Tree Stroll. Amanda Krause/Insider

In my opinion Disney Springs is the better place to spend a day. Parking is free there are more things to do and both adults and children can enjoy it.

That said I understand why some people might enjoy Universal CityWalk more. The free shopping center is in the same spot as its theme parks and it's a great option to visit popular places that you might not have access to at home.

At the end of the day it all comes down to personal preference.

But in that process people forget to draw the line between unique and unconventional and believe us it is thin but it’s there. The clip that you’re about to see is a classic case of it. This street vendor concocted one of the most unconventional dishes involving our favourite instant noodle Maggi. The clip from Sagar Pizza Point in Ghaziabad was shared by a food vlogger named Hanshul Anand. In the clip which looks normal in the beginning one can see a heating pan being loaded up with veggies oil salt and spices including the lip-smacking Maggi masala. However things go haywire when Coca-Cola comes into the picture. Now you would think that the cold drink is present as a side beverage but you’re mistaken. Coca-Cola is an ingredient here! Rather than boiling the noodle in water this vendor pours a bottle of Coke and then carries on with the recipe. Moments later the Maggi is all cooked and is served in disposable silverware.

Take a look at the clip here:

The short video has racked up close to 2.5lakh views and has managed to accumulate almost 9000 likes. Netizens were shocked to see their favourite instant noodles being prepared in Coke and were having a hard time digesting the recipe. While many netizens registered their contention through the comment box many took it as an opportunity to suggest some equally and more bizarre Maggi recipes. While one user suggested replacing Coke with beer another suggested Old Monk rum as the replacement. This is not the first time that such a video has been thrown at us by social media. A few months earlier another similar vendor was brought to light who used to cook Maggi in Fanta.

Force India came out of administration in August 2018 when Stroll led a consortium of investors and initially re-launched the team as Racing Point Force India.

The team was renamed to just Racing Point ahead of the 2019 campaign as the team continued to be moulded around Stroll’s leadership and vision.

And the final stage of the process came in January 2020 when Stroll led another consortium to take an initial 16.7% stake in Aston Martin who made their return to Formula 1 as a fully-fledged team in 2021.

But with the off-season winter period well and truly set in there is time for Stroll to take us all the way back to the beginning of the story.

Our new home is taking shape. A campus dedicated to cutting edge technology. A celebration of who we are. The journey continues side-by-side with @Cognizant. pic.twitter.com/KfJbo3BPnM — Aston Martin Cognizant F1 Team (@AstonMartinF1) January 6 2022

“I had several meetings with. Chase [Carey CEO of F1] at the time” Stroll told GP Racing magazine as quoted by Motorsport.com

“And that was a very very important part of my decision process to buy the company or not. He had a great influence on the decision. If there hadn’t been spending limits I wouldn’t have done it.

“People – human capital – are a very important factor. I would never have bought a team that was between ninth and tenth position.”

What tempted Stroll even further was Force India’s channelling of the underdog spirit as they performed above expectations compared to what was one of the smaller operating budgets in Formula 1.

He continued: “What impressed me and the reason for the purchase was that it was a team that operated on a budget of £90 million and only 400 employees (at the time Mercedes was spending £332 million a year and had 900 employees in Brackley alone) but two years in a row it was fourth in the championship and it would have been three years without the administration.

“All this with a third of the budget and less than half of the staff of the competitors who were above.

“There was already a core of 400 very passionate people here that famous expression who punch above their weight.

“They did more with fewer employees than other teams so it was an incredible opportunity to build on an already strong foundation. We didn’t start from scratch.”

The final piece of the puzzle came together when Stroll wanted to stay true to the team’s British roots given its long-standing association with Silverstone.

“When the company (Force India) went into bankruptcy there was no plan at the time” he explained.

“After getting the asset yes I had a very clear vision that this is an automotive company. And I had a dream that being based at Silverstone for almost three decades it had to be a British brand.

“And for me there is only one British brand that justifies being on the pedestal of F1. And that was Aston Martin. It was a kind of dream come true.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwdHYuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9kZW52ZXItYnJvbmNvcy1maXJlLWNvYWNoLXZpYy1mYW5naW8tYWZ0ZXItMy1sb3Npbmctc2Vhc29uc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Denver Broncos fire coach Vic Fangio after 3 losing seasons,"DENVER (AP) -- Vic Fangio was fired on Sunday morning as coach of the Denver Broncos after going 19-30 in three seasons.

Team president and CEO Joe Ellis who will step down later this year said general manager George Paton will have ""full authority to select the next head coach.""

""This morning George and I informed Vic of the decision to part ways with him as head coach"" Ellis said in a statement. ""For the last three seasons Vic put his heart and soul into coaching the Broncos. I want to thank Coach Fangio for giving his maximum effort to our organization since the day he was hired.""

Fangio released his own statement in which he thanked the organization and fans and praised Paton as one of the NFL's top GMs: ""Broncos fans you have a great one in George.""

Fangio said he appreciated the team's ""fight and character you showed each and every week. No matter the adversity circumstances or challenges we faced you never backed down. I am proud to be associated with this group of fighters and competitors.""

And he reiterated that the franchise is on the cusp of returning to greatness.

""The foundation is in place for this team to accomplish great things"" he said. ""The future is bright for the Denver Broncos and I wish the organization nothing but the best.""

The Broncos lost their final four games to finish 7-10 capped by a 28-24 loss to Kansas City on Saturday in which they blew a fourth-quarter lead and extended their losing streak against the Chiefs to 13 games.

Fangio met with Paton ahead of the season finale and laid out his plan to fix the Broncos' myriad problems that extended the team's playoff drought to six seasons and string of losing records to five years.

Fangio led Denver to a 5-11 mark last season and went 7-9 in 2019 after he replaced Vance Joseph who was fired after two losing seasons.

Fangio got the job after more than three decades as an assistant and he burnished his reputation as a defensive master during his time in Denver. But the Broncos didn't win and that cost him his job.

Fangio and Paton hit it off when Paton was hired last year to replace John Elway. They saw eye-to-eye on the draft and many felt their close relationship would help Fangio survive a third losing season.

""I have tremendous respect for Vic and all he's accomplished in the NFL"" Paton said in a statement. ""Over the past year I appreciate his partnership friendship and tireless work ethic he demonstrated as our head coach.

""Vic will continue to have great success in this league and I thank him for everything he did for the Broncos as well as me personally.""

Fangio isn't expected to be out of work long. He will be a candidate for a defensive coordinator job in the new round of coaching changes this month.

Fangio's creative schemes helped the Broncos thwart some of the best young quarterbacks even when his defense was depleted by injuries or COVID-19. The long list of QBs who have had some of the toughest days of their careers against Fangio's teams include Tua Tagovailoa Justin Herbert and Patrick Mahomes.

Last month the Broncos held Joe Burrow to 157 yards passing. Burrow followed that tough afternoon with a two-game stretch against Baltimore and Kansas City in which he threw for a combined 971 yards and eight touchdowns.

Yet Fangio's teams struggled mightily on offense and special teams and his game management skills including use of timeouts challenges and clock handling came into question in all three of his seasons in Denver.

The Broncos averaged better than 10000 no-shows over their final six home games including nearly 15000 Saturday a sign the fanbase had grown frustrated with Fangio.

The Broncos were still in the mix of the AFC's crowded playoff field in mid-December before losing their final four games.

Asked Saturday about his 5-13 record in the AFC West that includes an 0-6 mark against the Chiefs Fangio said ""Well those other three teams have top-shelf quarterbacks which is obvious to everybody.""

Equally obvious is how the Broncos have failed to find their own premier passer swinging and missing on the likes of Paxton Lynch Drew Lock Case Keenum and Joe Flacco.

The Broncos have churned through 10 starting quarterbacks since Peyton Manning's retirement a month after Denver's win in Super Bowl 50 11 if you include running back Phillip Lindsay who started against New Orleans in 2020 when all four of Denver's quarterbacks were in COVID-19 protocols.

One of Paton's first moves as GM was to acquire veteran Teddy Bridgewater who went 7-7 as Denver's starter before missing the final three games with a concussion.

Lock the starter in 2020 lost all three of his starts despite not turning the ball over after committing an NFL-high 18 turnovers last season.

Paton is expected to focus his efforts this offseason on finding the Broncos' sixth different starting QB in six seasons.

Thanks to his trade of Von Miller to the Rams he has 11 draft picks including five in the top 100 to either restock his roster or use as chips to acquire a veteran via a trade. He'll also have nearly $70 million in cap space to sign free agents.

With so much repair work ahead Paton added to his plate a search for a head coach and now the team will have to start from scratch on both offense and defense.

By Virginia Bruce

Starting around November 15 last year I noticed that I wasn’t getting regular cell service on my Xfinity Mobile phone when I was home. I posted on a couple of social media sites and found that I wasn’t alone.

A cell coverage map from CellMapper

Xfinity Mobile uses the Verizon network. I had always had good service at my home in the Bonny Slope area. I used to have Verizon and switched to Xfinity when I realized they could provide the same network for less money. I was a happy customer until that day.

After much online discussion I waded through the layers of resistance and spoke to a service rep and through diligence was able to talk to someone senior and received a $65 credit on my bill. Service didn’t improve though.

I contacted the Oregon Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and learned that nobody has authority over the provision of cellular service except the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)! No state or local agency has any jurisdiction. And the Service Agreement* basically says they don’t have to provide anything!

After filling out the PUC complaint form however I learned that at least they could notify the carrier. I got a call from Xfinity corporate and at first I thought I’d get somewhere. Many of those who posted were told that service was fine despite our experience! But in the end that’s what they told me also. “Cellular service availability is determined by the operator of the cellular network and is not guaranteed.”

Then a participant in one of the social media discussions shared this:

“I called Verizon on Friday last week to challenge my bill given their obvious reduction in service. I went through their business office side rather than the Tech Support side. I guess that I got lucky as I randomly got a Senior Support manager. I told him that I had TWO distinct issues abrupt loss of service and my bill not being reflective of the service that they spend millions of dollars advertising as being the best. He listened to the facts that I presented to him then he painstakingly searched their database and validated every point that I made.

What he shared (which I believe he was not supposed to do) was that about a month ago they transitioned three towers in our area to ‘Microwave’ towers that as he described it give better local coverage but do NOT have the distance coverage…. so the people living close to those towers are celebrating our friends at Verizon.

In conclusion: 1) He said that our area needs one or two additional towers and he was going to use his executive contacts to push this project to the top of the list…which as he confessed does still take time to get boots on the ground to survey the best sites order equipment schedule crews etc. 2) He reduced our November bill by half which was less than I was pushing for but more than I realistically expected.”

We’re all using wi-fi to boost our home signal as we’ve been advised to do. But what if we want to use our phone when we go for a walk or even work in the garden?

I don’t have any great suggestions for how we can make an improvement but here’s the contact information for the person I spoke to at Xfinity corporate:

Kimberly F. Executive Resolutions TPX CX Care Operations Phone 844-963-0087 Extension 3052564 M-F 9 am-5:30 pm EST Xfinity_Mobile@comcast.com

As we gathered information from neighbors it became obvious that none of the carriers provided great service around here. But when you have decent service and then lose it because of a corporate decision it grates!

*Either the operator of the cellular network or we may elect to modify the cellular or WiFi network and/or the manner in which your Services operate on such network at any time including but not limited to changing the prioritization of traffic establishing speed or usage limitations or impacting other attributes of your Service. We will endeavor to provide you with advance notice of any change that we believe may materially affect your Service but shall be under no obligation to do so.

If I open and close the ""lid"" of the laptop the cursor eventually reappears. What's wrong? Does it indicate that more serious problems are about to occur?

GENE MISKOWIEC Little Canada

A: The disappearing cursor problem is common on Macs and usually isn't serious. But there are several potential causes and you'll have to figure out through trial and error which one is the source of your problem. Here are some of the common causes:

You may not have enough RAM memory available because of the way you use the Mac. RAM (random access memory) chips temporarily store data for software that's currently running. But you can use up your RAM storage capacity if you run too many Web browsers or other apps at the same time or if you use two or more computer screens at once.

An app may be interfering with the cursor. To find the culprit ""force quit"" apps one at a time.

Your Mac may have malware; run the free version of Malwarebytes (tinyurl.com/4sbj2pah).

If you use a wireless mouse its battery charge may be low.

If you've recently installed a new operating system you may need new Mac software drivers for a wireless mouse (see tinyurl.com/5n9426s2) or new mouse ""firmware"" (software for a particular device) from the manufacturer's website.

If you watch YouTube videos while using other apps the video may be causing the cursor to disappear. This is by design; the cursor isn't supposed to be visible while a video is playing.

(For details about disappearing cursor causes and fixes see tinyurl.com/bdcvvfdn or tinyurl.com/bde3rp7h or tinyurl.com/yv7xzupn).

Q: Comcast e-mail has gradually stopped delivering newsletters I subscribe to from the New York Times clothing retailers Uniqlo and & Other Stories the Minnesota Orchestra the British newspaper Daily Telegraph the activist Environmental Working Group the Associated Press and others. I later learned those e-mails had been misclassified as spam and sent to the spam folder — although I can't find them there. I tried your advice about disabling the Comcast spam filter (see tinyurl.com/yckvt3xh) but it didn't help. I also didn't get any help from Comcast's technical support people. Do I need to get a new e-mail provider?

ALEXANDRA LIVINGSTON St. Paul

A: Because spam is sent out in vast quantities every day (a process called bulk mailing) e-mail spam filters are designed to scrutinize all bulk mail including newsletters. As a result legitimate newsletters are sometimes misclassified as spam.

If that happens to you you should be able to go into your Comcast spam folder reclassify your newsletters as ""not spam"" and have them delivered to your inbox in the future. But you face two obstacles: Comcast's spam filter has a history of misclassifying too many legitimate e-mails as spam. In addition anything that's classified as spam is deleted from your spam folder in seven days. As a result you need to look in your spam folder every day or you could lose an e-mail that you really want.

If you don't want to put up with that try using a free e-mail account from Microsoft's Outlook.com Google's Gmail or Yahoo Mail.

The 107-page lawsuit added 11 new counts against school officials in the wake of new information that has emerged in the five weeks since investigators say 15-year-old sophomore Ethan Crumbley shot and killed four fellow students at Oxford High School and wounded seven others including a teacher.

He faces four counts of first-degree premeditated murder and 20 other felonies and was bound over for trial Friday hours before Southfield attorney Geoffrey Fieger filed the amended lawsuit.

Fieger filed the original lawsuit Dec. 9 on behalf of sisters Riley and Bella Franz students at Oxford High who survived the shooting. Riley a 17-year-old senior was shot in the neck while next to Bella 14 a freshman as they exited a restroom during the attack according to Fieger.

The amended lawsuit accuses Oxford Superintendent Tim Throne of knowing about threats against students failing to prevent the attack and putting students in greater danger.

""The individually named defendants are each responsible through their actions for making the student victims less safe causing the students to be in direct harm and acting in a manner that was so reckless as to demonstrate a substantial lack of concern for whether an injury results"" Fieger wrote.

The amended lawsuit filed late Friday continues to list allegations against one man who school district lawyer Timothy Mullins said has not worked at the district in more than a year. Mullins has called the allegations false.

“(Fieger) has added some negligence counts to his complaint and now as before he doesn’t even know who he’s suing” Mullins said Saturday.

Mullins previously said Oxford school officials will claim they are immune from liability.

“There is a criminal investigation and prosecution taking place and the Oakland County prosecutor has asked us not to comment upon the facts of the case so as to avoid any interference” Mullins said. “Our priority is to get the kids back to school. There will be plenty of time for comment.”

The lawsuit accuses school officials of failing to stop an attack that inflicted physical and psychological injuries on students and spreads the blame among the highest-ranking Oxford school officials along with unidentified teachers and counselors.

The attack was the country's deadliest school shooting since 2018. Killed in the attack were Oxford High School students Hana St. Juliana 14; Madisyn Baldwin 17; Tate Myre 16; and Justin Shilling 17.

The lawsuit includes details that have emerged in several court filings and appearances since the shooting.

On the day of the shooting one of Crumbley's teachers saw graphic drawings with violent images and pleas for help and reported what she saw to counselors according to police and school officials.

Crumbley allegedly told counselors once he was taken to the office that his drawing was part of a video game he was designing and that he planned to pursue video game design as a career Throne said in a statement. Crumbley remained in the office for about 90 minutes and worked on school assignments while the school tried to reach his parents.

After speaking to parents James and Jennifer Crumbley in the school office and again to Ethan Crumbley school counselors concluded he did not intend on committing either self-harm or harm to others Throne said.

His parents were informed they had 48 hours to seek counseling for their child or the school would contact Child Protective Services. They were asked to take their son home for the day but they ""flatly"" refused and left without their son Throne said.

Police have said they believe the handgun was concealed in Ethan Crumbley's backpack.

Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald has said a teacher reported Ethan Crumbley also was searching for ammunition on his phone at school a day before the shooting. School officials reached out to Jennifer Crumbley but never heard back.

Fieger accused high school Principal Steven Wolf of knowing about threats of violence from Crumbley according to the lawsuit.

""Despite the posts and knowledge of threats of violence defendant Wolf sent emails to the parents at Oxford High School instructing them not to share the posts report the posts or otherwise take the threats seriously"" Fieger wrote.

The principal made the situation worse Fieger added.

""Defendant Wolf excited Ethan Crumbley by pulling him out of class warning him that Child Protective Services might be called (without actually calling Child Protective Services) thereby encouraging Crumbley to accelerate his timetable for murder"" according to the lawsuit.

""Defendant Wolf gave Ethan Crumbley the opportunity to retrieve the weapon from his backpack and shoot students at Oxford High School"" Fieger wrote. ""... Wolf's conduct was so reckless that it demonstrated a substantial lack of concern for whether an injury resulted when he acted as set forth above.""

The lawsuit faults two unnamed school counselors for failing to report that they found violent pictures and notes drawn by Crumbley that threatened violence against fellow students.

Failing to act provided ""clearance for Ethan Crumbley to commit his acts of violence allowing Ethan Crumbley thereby to have the opportunity to carry out his murderous rampage on an accelerated timeline"" Fieger wrote.

New GPS III Follow-on satellites — or GPS IIIF for short — will continue to improve the constellation’s accuracy and protection against jamming.

GPS III satellites are already a substantial upgrade to the current constellation providing three times greater accuracy and eight times better anti-jamming capability than their predecessors. In addition to introducing a new civil signal that is compatible with other navigation satellite systems the five GPS III satellites on orbit completed the space component of M-code — an even more secure and accurate signal for military use.

The Space Force has launched five of the planned GPS III satellites and three more have been declared “available for launch” but are waiting in storage with prime contractor Lockheed Martin. The remaining two are undergoing testing.

The Space Force has a contract with Lockheed for up to 22 GPS IIIF satellites. The service already exercised contract options for seven GPS IIIF satellites with the most recent award taking place in October 2021 when Space Systems Command issued $737 million to the company for three more satellites.

GPS IIIF satellites will be more advanced than their predecessors. Most notably the new space systems will prove a new Regional Military Protection capability a steerable M-code signal that can concentrate the effect in a specified region. RMP can provide up to 60 times greater anti-jamming measures helping ensure soldiers can access critical position navigation and timing data in contested environments.

Other new features include a laser retroreflector array to increase accuracy; an upgraded nuclear detection detonation system payload; and a search and rescue payload.

Starting with the third GPS IIIF space vehicle the satellites will be built with Lockheed’s LM2100 Combat Bus specifically designed for military use. The company claims its new bus which will also be used for the Space Force’s next missile warning satellites will have greater resiliency and cyber protections more power and better propulsion.

And thanks to a new port option on the LM2100 bus it could be possible to upgrade GPS IIIF satellites on orbit. The company’s Augmentation System Port Interface essentially works as a USB port for the satellite allowing the Space Force to launch new payloads into space that can be plugged into the system.

There's a vivid reddish star in the night sky. Called Betelgeuse it's found in the famous constellation Orion and over millions of years has swelled in size earning it the title of a ""red supergiant."" Betelgeuse over 500 light-years from Earth will eventually collapse on itself — or perhaps the distant star already has — resulting in a dramatic explosion called a supernova.

Until recently astronomers had never directly witnessed a massive aging star explode. But in 2020 astronomers atop Maui used a powerful telescope to detect an unusually active red supergiant much more distant than Betelgeuse (at some 120 million light-years away). They watched it closely for 130 days giving themselves an invaluable view of the grand finale. The resulting stellar explosion is called ""supernova 2020tlf.""

""We actually saw the star violently erupt"" Wynn Jacobson-Galán an astronomer at the University of California Berkeley who led the research told Mashable. ""It's been something we wanted to find.""

The research was published Jan. 6 in The Astrophysical Journal.

""We actually saw the star violently erupt.""

The explosion of this star happened well beyond our Milky Way in the galaxy NGC 5731 so there's no ""close-up"" footage. (Any stars well beyond our galaxy usually appear as a dot through our telescopes.) But the astronomers sensing the explosion was imminent employed specialized imaging equipment at the W.M. Keck Observatory atop the lofty Mauna Kea in Hawai'i to observe the climatic ""powerful flash"" and intense release of energy.

The blast was conspicuous even in a distant galaxy filled with luminous stars. ""It takes just one supernova to outshine all the other stars in the galaxy"" explained Jacobson-Galán.

To better visualize the dramatic cosmic event astronomers made the animation below. Here's what you're seeing:

Pre-eruption: The star emits bursts of heat and radiation (that's when the astronomers detected the active star). Violent flash: The collapse of the star itself (at 11 seconds in the video). This is the supernova. Aftermath: The exploded star and resulting cloud of dust gas and elements expand into space

Supernovas caused by the collapse of massive and expanding stars are violent ends to these great gaseous orbs but they're also invaluable cosmic creators. Crucial elements like iron are manufactured inside the most massive stars and the ensuing supernova eruptions scatter the critical elements throughout space. Some elements are only created in extreme conditions during the blast itself like silver gold uranium and lead.

""Without supernovae life would not be possible"" explains NASA. ""Our blood has iron in the hemoglobin which is vital to our ability to breath. We need oxygen in our atmosphere to breathe. Nitrogen enriches our planet's soil. Earth itself would be a very different place without the elements created in stars and supernova explosions.""

Before this unprecedented supernova observation astronomers mused that perhaps red supergiant stars were quiet before they collapsed in dramatic fashion. But this star (and perhaps others too) emitted vibrant heat and energy before the blast.

Jacobson-Galán and other astronomers will continue to sleuth out opportunities to view how stars behave before they go supernova and scatter essential elements into the universe. It's certainly a thrilling scientific endeavor.

The Pacific Northwest is known for its steady rainfall and its coffee culture which is how the people up there refer to their intense caffeine addiction. Now Costco members in Oregon Washington and Alaska have a coffee creamer to help them through the long wet winter guilt-free.

Two separate Instagram accounts for Costco fans are promoting Nutpods' non-dairy creamer which you'll find in the dairy section of Costco stores from Fairbanks to Medford. Nutpods' creamers are made with real coconut and almond and they come in four flavors: original hazelnut caramel and French vanilla. Both Instagram accounts @costcobuys and @costcodeals only show the French vanilla.

The price is $9.99 for a three-pack of big 750 mL containers. You can order the product online through the Nutpods website and pay $14.95 for a four-pack of 330 mL cartons. After comparing the pennies per milliliter we found that shopping at Costco will save you a whopping 61%.

Judging by the reactions on Instagram some shoppers are thrilled with the news that Nutpods creamers have arrived at Costco. ""Yay!! This is the best stuff!! I actually get excited thinking about my creamy morning cup of coffee when I go to bed at night"" @jolynn_z commented under @costcobuys' post with no apparent hint of irony.

As cities and towns grew the general store gave way to specialty retailers department stores and grocery chains. The years following World War II saw massive consumer spending the advent of suburban shopping malls and in the early 1980s the coming of no-frills warehouse club Costco. Retailing underwent a seismic shift after 1995 when Amazon began selling books online from a derelict building in Seattle. In 2020 retail sales in Washington exceeded $178 billion and Amazon was the world's largest retailer with annual worldwide net sales of more than $386 billion.

Beginnings

The business of retailing was set in motion in Washington on New Year's Day 1850 when the brig Orbit arrived at the new town of Smithfield (now Olympia) carrying gold seekers returning from California. Their greeting party included Michael T. Simmons (1814-1867) who had recently sold his sawmill at Tumwater for $35000. Wrote Edmond S. Meany in his 1909 History of the State of Washington:

""In the Orbit they returned to Puget Sound bringing with them Charles Hart Smith a young man who had come from Calais Maine with the gold hunters. Mr. Simmons bought the brig and loaded her with spars for San Francisco. He sent young Smith as supercargo to sell the spars and bring back a cargo of merchandise. In the meantime Levi L. Smith had died and his interest in the Smithfield place fell to his partner Edmund Sylvester who persuaded Mr. Simmons to start a store in Smithfield and deeded him two lots. A structure of rough boards was reared two stories high and twenty-five by forty feet ground dimensions. In this building the Orbit's cargo was placed and the first American store was opened for business"" (Meany 226).

It wasn't long before Simmons had competition. In July 1850 Lafayette Balch arrived on the George Emery with a load of goods. ""These were unloaded at Olympia but the town-site owner Sylvester was afraid the opposition might injure the Simmons store. He refused favorable terms and Mr. Balch reloaded the goods and building a large-frame store at Steilacoom installed Henry C. Wilson as his clerk and began business in a rival town"" (Meany 227).

Simmons's new venture was said to be profitable but he had placed too much trust in Charles Hart Smith: ""Young Smith was installed as a clerk manager and sort of partner. Had he been honest he might have filled a prominent niche in the commercial history of the Pacific coast. He was sent to San Francisco with $60000 in cash and credits and absconded with the whole sum leaving Mr. Simmons practically bankrupt"" (Meany 226).

Meanwhile on Alki Point

Meanwhile about 50 miles up Puget Sound the Denny Party came ashore at Alki Point on November 13 1851 and soon Charles C. Terry (1828-1867) had opened a store in a hastily built cabin.

""Having noted what kind of supplies California settlers needed he came prepared to open a general store and his first goods had travelled up to Puget Sound with him on the Exact. Being meticulous about the care and feeding of money he kept a little black notebook which is still preserved neatly listing all the items. He had thoughtfully provided the pioneer settlers with one keg of whiskey one keg of brandy ... one box of tobacco one box of raisins one box of tinware and one box of axes. He quickly put together a cabin in order to display his goods and was in business as 'The New York Cash Store' with John Low as a partner in a matter of days. By this time he had acquired from the captain of a trading schooner: more whiskey some pork flour molasses hard bread boots brogan shoes prints hickory shirts window sashes a glass grindstones crosscut saws files mustard pepper-sauce and sugar"" (Speidel 28).

The first dated sale in Terry's ledger took place on November 28 1851 when he sold two axes to Low for $6. Another early customer was Luther Collins who had settled on the Duwamish River a few weeks before the Denny Party arrived. ""Collins bought six pans one large and two small tin pails six pint basins a coffee pot two frying pans two candlesticks and one dipper. It appears that Collins paid for these goods with 12 salmon"" (Warren 88).

Terry according to historian Bill Speidel was a slick businessman. ""He bought his merchandise wholesale in San Francisco and sold it at exorbitant prices to the Indians. They didn't have money so they brought in logs and timbers which he bought cheap and sold dear"" (Speidel 29). Unfortunately for Terry the location of his store would become a liability. Within a year most of the Alki settlers had relocated to the eastern shore of Elliott Bay and in 1852 settler David S. ""Doc"" Maynard (1808-1873) opened the first general store in Seattle. Maynard wrote Murray Morgan in Skid Road ""was the town's first capitalist. He hired some Indians to help him build a place down by the Sag as they called the low land by the water and within a few days he was selling goods in his new store the Seattle Exchange a building eighteen feet long and twenty-six feet wide with log sides a shake roof and over the front part a low attic that Maynard used as living quarters. The store sold according to an advertisement Maynard wrote for the paper in Olympia 'a general assortment of dry goods groceries hardware etc. suitable for the wants of immigrants just arriving'"" (Skid Road 26).

Gold Sparks a Retail Boom

Newcomers began swarming into the region after gold was discovered along the Fraser River in 1858. Wrote historian Cassandra Tate of the gold seekers: ""Thousands of miners traveled to the Fraser by way of Victoria on Vancouver Island turning what had been a provincial outpost in British Columbia into a bustling supply center. Many other miners used Seattle or Bellingham as a jumping-off point. Still others traveled upriver on the Columbia from The Dalles moving north from there through the Cowlitz Yakima Wenatchee and Okanogan valleys. They all needed food and supplies which several settlements jostled to supply"" (""Gold in the Pacific Northwest""). At The Dalles at least one store was in place by 1856; 40 settlers sought shelter inside the store during the Cascades Massacre. By 1858 German immigrant Louis Schwabacher had set up a competing store along the Columbia River and in 1860 the Schwabacher brothers opened a prosperous general store in Walla Walla not far from new gold fields in southern Idaho.

At Bellingham Bay an estimated 10000 miners flooded in hoping the newly built Whatcom Trail would provide easy access to the Fraser River. ""Among the local businesses to profit was Thomas G. Richards and Company of Whatcom … the company soon outgrew its wood-framed store and replaced it with a two-story brick building – the first brick structure in Washington Territory"" (""Gold in the Pacific Northwest""). One of the hopeful miners to stop at Bellingham was Emory C. Ferguson who later opened the first general store in Snohomish. According to historian Norman H. Clark Ferguson was ""confident that as the first white man there he could win a ferry franchise open a store file a homestead claim and make a good living on military traffic while a town grew around him"" (quoted in ""Gold in the Pacific Northwest""). Ferguson's store eventually failed but his instincts were sound: By the 1880s a general store could be found in virtually every town in Washington Territory.

North America's final gold rush began in earnest on July 17 1897 when the steamship Portland arrived in Seattle carrying 68 miners and two tons of gold lifted from the Klondike River. Thus began a retailing frenzy. ""Seattle was advertised throughout the Nation as the outfitting center and point of departure for the North Country. Seventy-four ships were launched between January and July. Old industries expanded and new ones sprang up to meet the demand for machinery tools camp equipment clothing and foodstuffs"" (Washington: A Guide 219). During the next two years more than 100000 people headed to the Klondike gold fields and Seattle was the starting point for nearly two-thirds of them. ""They paid dearly for transportation subsistence and supplies. It cost an estimated $1000 to get to the Yukon with the proper equipment. During the first month of the rush merchants in Seattle sold more than $325000 worth of goods to miners headed north"" (""Gold in the Pacific Northwest"").

Rise of the Department Store

In Washington's larger cities and towns general stores gradually gave way to specialty stores selling a narrower range of goods. In turn-of-the-century Tacoma for example ""If you wanted a hat you went to Reed’s Hats. If you wanted a new dress you either went to a fabric store and made the dress yourself or purchased one at a women’s dress shop. If you needed new slacks you would head to men’s clothier Klopfenstein’s. If you needed a shoe repair or new shoes you would go to Bone Dry Shoe Store"" (""The History of Fashion …"").

The number of specialty shops in Seattle increased after the Great Fire of 1889. In 1890 alone George Bartell Sr. (1868-1956) opened his first drugstore on Jackson Street; Edward (1839-1899) and Josephine Nordhoff (1871-1920) opened the Bon Marche dry-goods store on 1st Avenue at Cedar Street; and Donald E. Frederick (1860-1937) partnered with Nels B. Nelson (1854-1907) and James Meacham to start a used-furniture store near 1st and Pike. A year later Clinton C. Filson (1850-1919) opened an outdoor-clothing store in Kirkland relocating the business to Seattle in 1897.

In 1901 Swedish immigrant John Nordstrom (1871-1963) used the proceeds from a disputed land claim in the Klondike gold fields to open a shoe store at 4th and Pike with partner Carl F. Wallin. Over the course of the next century Bartell Drugs the Bon Marche Frederick & Nelson C. C. Filson and Nordstrom would become retailing icons in the state's largest city.

Along with specialty retailers department stores became a staple of urban life during the unfolding industrial age:

""Cities grew in size and population as workers sought jobs in the burgeoning factories plants and sweatshops … With employment came wages and with wages came a desire for a better life and with that came downtown shopping sprees. To provide room for the merchandise and comfort for the buyer a new kind of space emerged the department store … These embodied a commercial e pluribus unum: under one roof many shops"" (""A Brief History Of Shopping"").

Among the state's earliest department stores was the opulent and innovative Crescent which opened in Spokane in 1889 as a small dry goods store. The Crescent grew with Spokane and within 20 years boasted a staff of more than 300 including several fashion buyers who in 1912 began traveling to Paris. By 1915 the Crescent was doing $3 million a year in sales. It started offering ""charger plates"" a forerunner of the modern-day credit card in 1939 and in 1948 the store installed escalators a rare and expensive novelty.

Department stores were situated in some smaller Washington towns as well though keeping them stocked could be difficult. In Lynden in 1897 William ""Billy"" Waples (1875-1962) and Andrew Smith opened a general store which soon became the popular Lynden Department Store. In the early days ""Smith made four trips a week to Whatcom (now Bellingham's Old Town) a nearly 30-mile roundtrip via horse and wagon over muddy dirt or plank roads and across the Nooksack River by ferry. On a typical trip Smith would leave at 4 a.m. and spend the day picking up merchandise at Whatcom wholesale houses returning at 9 p.m. or later with an average of two tons of merchandise"" (""Billy Waples Opens …""). After moving three times into larger locations Waples built a new store on Lynden's Front Street. It opened in 1914 selling men's and women's clothing housewares groceries dry goods farm equipment -- and even new cars. Waples ""had agencies for a variety of automobiles including early Apperson 'Jack Rabbit' models"" (""Billy Waples Opens …"").

Down the Grocery Aisle

In the years before World War I groceries were usually obtained at specialty shops -- bakeries butchers fish mongers green grocers and the like. ""The standard shopping experience was like a deli. Shoppers asked for items at a counter and [their order] was slowly filled from the back while they interacted with one of the many clerks"" (""The Grocery Revolution …""). The first major innovation in the grocery business came around 1915 with the introduction of self-service ""cafeteria-style"" stores including the Groceteria chain in Seattle. Instead of requesting items from a clerk customers carried shopping baskets selected their own goods and paid at the front greatly reducing labor costs for store owners. Founded by Alvin Monson in 1915 Groceteria expanded quickly to include about 30 stores but after Monson returned from World War I with severe post-traumatic stress disorder the business faltered. Its last store closed in 1928. ""As Groceteria stalled a number of other discount self-service chains entered the Seattle market from outside. First and chief among Groceteria’s rivals was the Washington franchise of Piggly Wiggly … The hole left by Groceteria was filled by a growing list of ever-larger chains. During the Great Depression these coalesced into Safeway and its local rival Tradewell"" (""The Grocery Revolution …""). By 1935 Safeway boasted 64 stores in Seattle and dozens more around the state.

The Nordstrom Way

Seattle was booming when Nordstrom and Wallin opened their shoe store in 1901 and it wasn't long before they needed a larger space. They moved to a building on 2nd Avenue between Pike and Union streets and in 1923 Wallin & Nordstrom opened a second store in the University District. Elmer Nordstrom (1904-1993) John Nordstrom's son began helping at the 2nd Avenue store at age 12 the start of a legendary career in retailing. Elmer was a ""button boy"" sewing buttons on women's shoes and then did stock work. ""I also helped with deliveries"" he wrote in his memoir A Winning Team. ""In the evenings I would take packages through the alley exit cross Union and then take another alley between Second and Third to the tiny office of United Parcel Service. Now they're a nationwide delivery service but at the time they were a small Seattle company started by the Casey family with a couple of trucks and a few motorcycles. They only made deliveries in the city and we were one of their first accounts"" (A Winning Team 16).

In 1928 Elmer and his brothers Everett (1903-1972) and Lloyd (1910-1976) bought out their father's share of Wallin & Nordstrom and a year later shortly before the stock-market crash they bought out Wallin. With money borrowed from their father the brothers set about improving and expanding their 2nd Avenue store leasing an adjacent space to double the square footage and creating a basement area for lower-priced merchandise. They also made the sales floor more comfortable. ""In all we fashioned a store that was considered very modern"" (A Winning Team 27).

Over the next 30 years Nordstrom would grow into the largest independently owned shoe store in the U.S. Thirty years after that in 1989 it became the country's largest specialty-store chain. But the Nordstroms had nearly lost it all during the Great Depression. The brothers had made a pact to pay back their father's loan and with sales plunging the entire operation was in danger of collapse. ""Business got worse and worse and it looked like we would lose everything"" Elmer Nordstrom wrote. ""But with liquidation staring us in the face we had an encouraging upturn and business improved … We put in long hours watched our overhead carefully controlled our buying and markdowns personally attended to every minor detail and worked closely on all matters. Our main concern was to pay for our store and achieve a solid footing. And we found that with our combined efforts we could make ends meet. We got by"" (A Winning Team 35).

After World War II with their future secure the brothers turned their attention to expansion. In 1950 they opened a store in Portland their first out-of-town venture. They then contracted with a string of department stores to lease spaces in which to operate their shoe departments. In a matter of a few years Nordstrom was selling shoes in Seattle Portland Tacoma Oakland Honolulu Albuquerque Phoenix Fresno and Sacramento. It also had made a winning bet on a new phenomenon – the suburban shopping mall.

Coming of the Malls

Retailers including Nordstrom prospered in the years immediately following World War II. ""Instead of the feared postwar recession manufacturers struggled to meet consumer demand. After 10 years of the worst depression in history and five years of a wartime economy that paid good wages but directed production to the war effort American families went on a buying spree. They replaced worn-out appliances and autos repaired their homes or moved to better ones and replenished their wardrobes with double-breasted suits and longer dresses now that wartime material shortages were history. They also purchased new products the prime example being television sets"" (Warren 30). Meanwhile the nation's car culture had taken hold contributing to suburban flight and less reliance on downtown retailers. In 1950 the region's first shopping mall Northgate opened north of Seattle with the Bon Marche department store as its anchor tenant.

Not everyone was impressed. In his 1976 book Seattle Past to Present Roger Sale described Northgate as ""a huge shopping center in the middle of what had been and what in a different way continues to be nowhere. Northgate had a hundred stores a skyroof a mammoth parking lot and it offered nothing unique beautiful tasteful or offensive. In recent years it has become de rigueur to speak of blights caused by freeways but the 1-5 freeway in Seattle when it came did less damage to its surroundings than did Northgate or Aurora Avenue"" (Sale 190). But if malls failed to please everyone aesthetically they were hugely popular with shoppers and Northgate one of the first suburban shopping centers in the U.S. was on the cutting edge. ""Northgate was an instant success … The parking lot was jammed at peak hours for 10 days following opening … The developers used polar bear cubs a Cadillac giveaway and a children's play area to attract shoppers. New electric-eye doors in some stores aided shoppers laden with packages"" (""Northgate Shopping Mall in Seattle ..."").

While Northgate was the brainchild of Bon Marche president Rex Allison the forward-thinking Nordstrom brothers were quick to get onboard. Recalled Elmer Nordstrom: ""When we signed the lease at Northgate in 1949 I drove my father out to view the site of our new store. It was in those days quite a drive out in the country … Construction had barely started and I pointed to a large mud hole indicating that this was to be our new store. Father was absolutely floored and shook his head slowly. 'I think that you are making a big mistake here' he said. Actually we had considered the venture very carefully. Everett had even chartered a light airplane to fly over the area and came back to report that there were large numbers of residential units going up in the immediate area. What seemed like an inordinately big risk to an older man such as my father was a challenging opportunity for us"" (A Winning Team 53).

The next four decades from 1950 until about 1990 would be glory days for a growing number of shopping malls in Washington. Bellevue Square on Seattle's Eastside and the NorthTown Mall in Spokane were operational by 1955. Next came Tacoma Mall which opened in 1965 followed in quick succession by Southcenter in Tukwila (1968) the Columbia Center Mall in Kennewick (1969) the Valley Mall near Yakima (1972) Everett Mall (1974) Vancouver Mall (1977) and Alderwood Mall in Lynnwood (1979). Southcenter conveniently situated at the intersection of 1-5 and 1-405 was the most ambitious of them all. Sprawling over 90 acres it boasted 1.1 million square feet of retail space and parking for 7200 automobiles. A crowd estimated at 12000 turned out for an opening preview and drank 4800 bottles of celebratory champagne.

The 'Cult' of Costco

By the 1970s much of the retail sector had shifted to the suburbs. The malls were thriving while ""strip malls"" -- clusters of stores sharing a common parking lot -- proliferated along busy arterials such as Aurora Avenue in Seattle and Pacific Highway in Tacoma. ""Customarily they are the locale of a chain-store pharmacy a bank a few fast-food restaurants a nail salon and a dry cleaner"" wrote social historian Stefan Kanfer of strip malls. ""And customarily they are the scar tissue of the American landscape"" (""A Brief History Of Shopping""). Meanwhile supermarkets introduced in Washington in the 1930s had grown ever larger through a series of mergers and acquisitions. The grocery business was marked by innovation: Shopping carts were invented in 1937 and 24-hour markets began to multiply in the 1970s. The first supermarket price scanners were not in use until 1974 although bar-code technology had been patented 22 years earlier.

A newcomer to the state's retail mix arrived in 1983 when the first Costco membership warehouse was opened in Seattle. Costco's innovations were numerous: By eliminating most of the frills and costs associated with traditional retailers -- including salespeople delivery advertising billing departments fancy displays and grand buildings -- it was able to undercut competitors in dramatic fashion. A yearly membership fee further helped reduce its overhead ""so that items could be sold at an average of 9 percent over cost from the manufacturer"" (""Costco Wholesale ...""). Costco's impact was immediate and stunning; it became the first company ever to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in less than six years.

In 1999 Fortune magazine writer Shelley Branch visited Seattle to interview Costco CEO Jim Sinegal (b. 1936) who founded the company with Jeffrey Brotman (1942-2017). Costco had grown to 289 stores with $24 billion in annual revenue. Under the headline ""Inside The Cult Of Costco"" Branch wrote: ""Unlike predictable discounters which can numb shoppers with sales and sensible bargains Costco has figured out that a low price artfully affixed to high-quality high-end merchandise can transcend the pedestrian notion of 'discount.' Played out in Costco's cement-floor aisles the high/low shopping experience becomes a powerful middle-class elixir"" (""Inside The Cult ...""). Fortune reported that one in four American households had a Costco membership and that Costco had enlarged its red-plastic shopping carts four times since 1984. ""Discount merchandising is not for the timid"" Sinegal told the magazine. ""We'd like it to be known that we are the toughest negotiators in the business. And that we're gonna come after [vendors] for every nickel we can and we won't let up until we think we've got the price right on the merchandise"" (""Inside The Cult ..."").

Amazon Upends Retail

As much as Costco altered the retail landscape its impact paled in comparison to what came next. In 1995 little more than a decade after Costco opened its first store a 30-year-old Princeton computer-sciences graduate arrived in Seattle to start a company that would sell books on the internet. Jeff Bezos (b. 1964) said he chose Seattle ""because it is only one shipping day away from the country's three largest book wholesalers and because there is a readily available supply of talented software engineers here"" (Moody 207). Six months after Amazon's launch Fred Moody a reporter for The Weekly went to check out Amazon's operations in ""a warren of small offices that looked across at the Sears/Starbucks building"" (Moody 206). In the basement ""legions of employees were frantically filling orders. Bezos already was looking for bigger quarters"" (Moody 207).

Bezos had hit on an idea that Moody described as both ingenious and simple. ""Bezos built his store by acquiring connections with the electronic inventories of the nation's seven largest book wholesalers all the formats of which were incompatible with the others. He then wrote translation software that made all the databases readable by his computer system and wrote more software to make the resulting 'inventory' accessible to his customers ... A customer found the book he or she wanted on Amazon's site and ordered it. Amazon in turn ordered it from the wholesaler who had it in stock having it shipped overnight to the company's Seattle address where it would be unpacked combined with other book from other wholesalers in the same customer's order repackaged and shipped that day to wherever the customer wanted"" (Moody 207). Thus was born what by 1999 was the world's biggest online retailer.

Amazon's growth over the ensuing 25 years was staggering. In 2017 Amazon muscled into the grocery business when it purchased the Whole Foods chain and in January 2021 Amazon with 75000 employees in the Seattle area surpassed Boeing as the state's biggest employer. Reported The New York Times in August 2021 ""Amazon has eclipsed Walmart to become the world’s largest retail seller outside China ... a milestone in the shift from brick-and-mortar to online shopping that has changed how people buy everything from Teddy Grahams to teddy bears. Propelled in part by surging demand during the pandemic people spent more than $610 billion on Amazon over the 12 months ending in June"" (""People Now Spend ..."").",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8wOC91cy9ib3VsZGVyLWNvdW50eS1jb2xvcmFkby1jb3ZpZC1zaG9vdGluZy1maXJlL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzAxLzA4L3VzL2JvdWxkZXItY291bnR5LWNvbG9yYWRvLWNvdmlkLXNob290aW5nLWZpcmU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This community was reeling from a mass shooting and several Covid-19 surges. Then a fire wiped out hundreds of homes,"CNN —

When Gurjeet Gill Dhanoa’s family moved from Canada nearly 23 years ago they planned to operate the Tandoori Grill in Boulder County Colorado for just a few months. But the restaurant proved successful and they stayed putting down roots in the community they now call home.

By the end of 2021 all they had left was that store.

For most of last year the family had been adjusting to the changes the Covid-19 pandemic forced on the restaurant: navigating takeout orders instead of in-house diners shutting down their lunch buffet and relying on federal financial aid to make ends meet.

The day Gill Dhanoa went to get her first Covid-19 vaccine – a Monday when the restaurant is usually closed – the familiar plaza where their business is located flashed on the news. Their store sits across the street from a King Soopers where a mass shooting was unfolding. The gunman killed 10 people – some shoppers others employees – ranging from 20 to 65 years old.

In the days after the massacre Gill Dhanoa’s family handed out food to the grieving crowds that cycled through the memorials.

Months later when a vicious blaze charred thousands of acres in a matter of hours the restaurant offered shelter to the employees who were forced to evacuate. Gill Dhanoa’s family homes – where she lived with her husband and teenage son where her parents lived with her brother and a third a rental home – were swallowed by the flames.

“These four walls are home right now” she said standing inside her restaurant.

In the ashes of her home only a few items remained intact: a stack of buttons a salt and pepper shaker some coins a horseshoe a towel rack.

The Marshall Fire fueled by powerful winds last Thursday leaped into suburban neighborhoods across southern Boulder County and ravaged parts of Superior and Louisville wiping out more than 1000 homes.

The blaze came at the heels of a traumatic year for a place often referred to as the “Boulder Bubble” a nod to the healthy utopian-like lifestyle many residents take pride in and that some say is removed from surrounding realities.

But if anything locals here say the tragedies they’ve experienced in the last year reflect growing national crises – including the global pandemic a rise in gun violence and climate change – that no community is immune to and which some residents say can be curbed or prevented.

“I wish these things weren’t happening. I’m devastated that they do happen. And I think we have had enough experience in our country to know that there are things that we can do to prevent them from happening” said Kellie Brownlee 29 a graduate instructor at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Those things include measures to prevent further gun violence boosting vaccination numbers to help curb further surges and tuning into climate action to better address recurring natural disasters like wildfires Brownlee said.

“It’s heartbreaking when it comes into your community but it also brings to light the fact that this will affect all of us at some point” she said.

Sirens again and again

Just a few blocks from the University of Colorado Boulder Jeff Gamet said it was often sirens rushing by his home that tipped him off to the tragic events that took place in the community.

The freelance writer heard authorities rush by in early March when a party on nearby University Hill escalated to what Boulder police called a “riot” involving hundreds of people violating Covid-19 restrictions. When officers arrived and attempted to break up the crowds they were hit with bricks and rocks police said. At least 10 people were arrested.

Days later Gamet heard helicopters and police vehicles speed by again this time heading to the scene of the shooting at the King Soopers store.

A mental health resource center was set up following the shooting for people impacted by the rampage including victims’ families store employees first responders and others across the Boulder community. The center continues to offer mental health counseling comfort dogs art therapy walking groups and acupuncture.

Gamet visited a memorial for the victims in the days after the shooting – a brief exception to a year he largely spent in his home dodging the coronavirus so he wouldn’t pass it on to his immunocompromised parents. Looking around at the memorial after the shooting he said he found vivid reminders of the other crisis.

“We’re all wearing masks” Gamet said. “So we had that emotionally devastating incident and underlying it we were still trying to deal with a pandemic.”

Amid another nationwide case surge and the rapid spread of the virus Gamet found out last month he had come in contact with a known Covid-19 case in the community. His father tested positive but has since recovered.

Boulder County recently recorded a spike in new Covid-19 infections according to county data. Roughly 83 people were hospitalized with the virus on January 7 up by more than 50% from two weeks earlier the data shows.

Days after a Christmas spent in quarantine Gamet said he found himself preparing to evacuate in case the Marshall Fire came close.

“There’s been so much going on” he said. “There were days where I’d be in the middle of my routine and I would just cry.”

Hoping for a brief respite he attempted to order his favorite local snack: Boulder Popcorn. But the Heuston family which ran the popular popcorn business out of their garage lost their Louisville home in the Marshall Fire.

“That’s the first home we ever bought. We raised our kids in that home” said Chris Heuston who said her husband started the popcorn business with their daughter. All that’s left now of their home of 27 years she said “is just ashes in a concrete hole.”

Without any warning from local officials the family watched the flames approach last week and had just minutes to grab some belongings Heuston said. By the time she ran out of her home which was filled with smoke and soot she could see the fire in the field behind her home.

“I just wish I had 15 more minutes to grab a few more things that meant something” she said. Safely sheltering at a friend’s house several miles away she watched the flames swallow her home on live television after a news crew set up cameras nearby.

‘We’re constantly in crisis mode’

The recent blaze and the rapid spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant have also stretched thin the local school system which is combating teacher absences navigating what a safe return to school should look like and helping staff and families who lost everything in the flames said Randy Barber chief communications officer for the Boulder Valley School District.

“It’s been overwhelming” Barber said. “We’re constantly in crisis mode.”

The district reopened its doors after the winter break on Wednesday Barber said after getting the buildings in working condition again – including by purifying the smoke-filled air inside and restoring electricity. District officials Barber added have prioritized having students in class throughout the pandemic as a means of family support.

“It’s incredibly important for families that are going through such unthinkable things to have a place for students to be able to go that’s safe that’s stable” Barber added. “For there to be some level of normalcy in these families’ lives.”

At least 42 employees lost their homes in the Marshall Fire Barber said. More than 480 families in the district have reported some kind of impact from the blaze. The district is coordinating to provide necessary resources to students who need them including laptops school supplies and counseling support.

Much of the fire damage was in and around Louisville and the town of Superior where some former Boulder residents found refuge after a massive flood in 2013 that wiped out hundreds of homes said Grace Peng a scientist who used to live in Boulder County. Those areas were also where many used to look to for more affordable options than what was offered in the city of Boulder which is now one of the most expensive areas in the nation.

But prices in recent years shot up in those areas as well residents say and the loss of structures means an even larger affordable housing crisis is on the way because of the housing shortage.

“There are a lot of people that have no place to live now and they can’t afford to get a place here. What are they going to do?” said Gamet the freelance writer. “Are these people just going to move away and be gone from the community?”

A day-by-day recovery

After the series of traumatic events what many in the community may be feeling is a “sense of groundlessness” said Sona Dimidjian a psychology professor and director of the Renée Crown Wellness Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder.

“Like the ground has been pulled out from under them” Dimidjian said. “I think it’s important for people to know that’s part of experiencing a traumatic event like this.”

For the Gill family the past year in Boulder County seems to point to a dangerous reality the nation is heading to said Mandip Gill Gurjeet’s brother.

“I think this last year year and a half has just been trending towards our new normal” he said. “I don’t think any of us are equipped to handle what’s happening. And I think we’ve all learned that by the surge of (the) mental health crisis.”

Grappling with what happened will be a long term process for the community Dimidjian said and it’s important residents and those impacted know there are mental health services and counselors in the community that can offer guidance and support.

For many here that process has only just begun.

Gamet said an unwavering routine and a large support system of friends have helped him cope. Humor and positivity are helping Gill Dhanoa combat the shock since losing her home. And a GoFundMe page has been set up for her family.

Heuston’s family spent the days after the blaze making family dinners watching movies and assembling puzzles hoping to revive a small sense of normalcy. Despite all the things lost Heuston is thankful they’re all still here.

“One of the things the pandemic taught us too is how much our health and our families and our lives mean and it’s finding some of that beauty in our world every day” she said. “Because if not how do you keep going?”"

STOCKHOLM -- Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden has tested positive for COVID-19 the Royal Court said on Saturday only days after King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia also tested positive.

""The Crown Princess who is fully vaccinated has cold symptoms but is otherwise well. Infection tracing has been initiated"" the Court said in a press release.

The Crown Princess and her family are in isolation in their home.

It was the second time that Crown Princess Victoria tested positive. Last March she and her husband Prince Daniel tested positive.

The Royal Court said on Tuesday that after positive test results King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Victoria had mild symptoms.

The Swedish Public Health Agency said earlier that the Omicron variant is spreading fast in the country where it has become the dominant strain.

Nearly 24000 cases were confirmed in the country on Wednesday according to the Swedish Public Health Agency.

This was considerably more than the previous record number of just over 17000 infected that were confirmed during a 24-hour period earlier in the week.

The cumulative number of confirmed cases since the pandemic started is nearly 1.417 million among the population of 10.4 million.

The statistics also show that the total number of deaths in the country was 15377 by Friday.

According to official figures 86 percent of the population aged 12 and over have had at least one dose of vaccine while 82.2 percent had been vaccinated at least twice and 32.3 percent of those aged 18 and older had received the third dose.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhbXBzaGlyZWxpdmUubmV3cy9uZXdzL3Byb3BlcnR5L3dhcmJsaW5ndG9uLWNhc3RsZS1oYXZhbnQtaG9tZS10dWRvci02NDUxNDA20gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGFtcHNoaXJlbGl2ZS5uZXdzL25ld3MvcHJvcGVydHkvd2FyYmxpbmd0b24tY2FzdGxlLWhhdmFudC1ob21lLXR1ZG9yLTY0NTE0MDYuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warblington Castle: The Havant home with Tudor ruins linked to Catherine of Aragon for sale,"Sorry...

Rest assured the audience did not mind. For the contractors in attendance the 2022 projects represent potential business and the 2021 work reviewed by Sparks represents jobs well done. For everyone else they’re an insight into the work that is sometimes required on a railroad with roots dating to the founding of the Baltimore & Ohio in 1828.

One good example: the long-discussed Howard Street Tunnel in Baltimore along with related clearance projects which will allow double-stack container traffic to reach the Port of Baltimore.

With the lengthy funding and permitting processes complete a ceremony for the start of work on the 1.4-mile tunnel under central Baltimore which dates to 1895 was held in November [see “Groundbreaking set for Baltimore tunnel project” Trains News Wire Nov. 29 2021].

Contracts for the main tunnel project which will lower the track and/or modify the arch of the stone tunnel are expected to be awarded by mid-year with construction starting before the end of 2022.

“It’s the last main link on the core routes of our network that’s not cleared for double-stacks” Sparks said “and by 2025 it will be. … We run right under the street and there’s not a lot of cover there. And just to add to the difficulty there’s also light rail over top of us in that street as well. If it was easy it would have been done decades ago. It’s not.”

That’s a theme of several pieces of the project. Another is the related North Avenue Bridge where the CSX main line passes under the street of the same name. At first glance it looks like a fairly straightforward if aging underpass featuring stone arch masonry.

“What you don’t see is that inside what looks like a tunnel is a bridge that goes over Amtrak’s tunnel” Sparks said. “Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor goes underneath us; this is their B&P Tunnel “[itself a subject of replacement efforts. … So we’ve got road railroad and then railroad tunnel. And we need to get another four-plus feet of clearance in there.

“That should be easy” he joked. “A lot of smart people in this room and the companies you represent please figure this out because we need to get that done by ’24.”

Two other bridges have to deal with water mains and Sparks also shared a photo of eight other clearance jobs to be addressed as part of the southern portion of the project. “Those are all big deals but it kind of becomes routine compared to some of the other higher-profile projects nearby. And this is just all just for the Bayview South half of the project. We’ve also got the Bayview North half of the projects thought the remainder of Maryland Delaware and Pennsylvania.” Five of the eight clearance projects in that segment are expected to see construction bids awarded by the third quarter of 2022.

“The goal is to have achieved clearances in 2024 coming from the north from Philadelphia and the Port of Baltimore” Sparks said “and in ’25 getting through Howard Street Tunnel to get to the Port of Baltimore from the South.”

Other projects

Work is also proceeding in Virginia where CSX and the commonwealth forged a landmark agreement in 2019 to create separate freight and passenger rights-of-way south of Washington D.C. [see “Virginia CSX announce major rail infrastructure plan” News Wire Dec. 20 2019 and “Plans take shape for how Virginia-CSX agreement will reshape rail travel” News Wire Jan. 27 2020].

In all projects worth more than $3 billion are taking shape in Phase 1. CSX is taking the lead on five of those — a fourth main track through Alexandria a third track from Franconia to Lorton and three sidings — valued at more than $1 billion. The Virginia Passenger Rail Authority is out front on $2 billion worth including the Potomac Long Bridge a Franconia-Springfield bypass and six stations either proposed or set for upgrades.

The Alexandria main is in design and permitting and will be contracted out as soon as those processes are complete.

“As soon as we get notice to proceed from Virginia for the various parts and pieces we’re entering into agreements” Sparks said. “Keep your eye on Viriginia; there’s a lot going on in the railroad sphere.”

Efforts are also continuing to advance CSX-related work that is part of Chicago’s CREATE project most significantly the South Side’s Forest Hill Flyover (P3 in the CREATE naming system) which will address one of the region’s most notorious bottlenecks the cluster of diamonds where CSX and its Baltimore & Ohio Chicago Terminal cross the Belt Railway of Chicago and Norfolk Southern the latter of which hosts Metra commuter service.

“This is a big deal for operations in Chicago. … When it’s morning rush hour and evening rush hour you don’t run freight trains. You run the commuter trains.” This is particularly difficult for CSX because its 59th Street Intermodal Facility essentially abuts the diamonds. “Imagine running a hotshot intermodal train from New York to Chicago. You can see the terminal. You just can’t get there because it’s commuter rush hour.” That project will go out to bid in the first quarter of 2022 and be awarded in the second quarter.

Other ongoing CREATE projects include grade-crossing separation projects adjacent to the 59th Street facility; and Dolton Interlocking which involves C&O and its B&OCT Indiana Harbor Belt Union Pacific and NS which should go out to bid later this year.

Also to come: “an aggressive capital campaign” on New England’s Pan Am Railway if the CSX purchase of Pan Am passes muster with the Surface Transportation Board; a new intermodal container yard at 63rd Street in Chicago adjacent to the 59th Street terminal which should be done this year; and five siding extensions plus a project in Montgomery Ala. including both a siding extension and work on Chester Yard.

2021 in review

A number of intermodal projects highlighted work completed by the railroad in 2021. The long-discussed Carolina Connector in Rocky Mount N.C. is one example [see “CSX Transportation celebrates ..” News Wire Nov. 18 2021] but perhaps not the project most reflective of current conditions.

Pat Cummins has faced questions over the timing of his declaration in the fourth Ashes Test after England held on for a thrilling draw at the SCG on Sunday.

Cummins set England a target of 388 after declaring late on day four at the SCG however the Aussie bowlers fell one wicket short of completing an extraordinary victory.

'OH MY GOD': Cricket world erupts over 'insane' Ashes drama

'HORRIBLE': Aussie batter in selection controversy after Ashes fail

Some felt that Cummins should have declared earlier to give his chargers a greater chance of bowling out the tourists particularly considering the wet weather that was forecast.

England reached 9-270 after surviving 102 overs with No.11 Jimmy Anderson navigating an over of Steve Smith's leg-spin in fading light before the nail-biting contest ended at 6.50pm AEDT.

The result ends Cummins' hopes of captaining what would have been just the fourth 5-0 Ashes sweep in the storied 145-year history of Test cricket.

“I think he’ll be thinking about that declaration yesterday” Mark Waugh said in commentary for Fox Sports.

“He’ll be thinking ‘Hmm I think I went a bit long I better win this game for us now otherwise I’ll be looking back thinking why did I keep batting?’

“I think they batted too long. They did not need to bat as long as they did.

“340 was plenty and if they wanted to get to 380-400 they should have got there quicker. There was rain forecast there were a lot of things that said you don’t need to get to 400.”

Shane Warne said Cummins would have a sleepless night thinking about the declaration but pointed out that Australia missed some key chances to win the game.

“First of all he’s going to learn a lot today” Warne said. “He probably won’t sleep tonight he’ll be thinking about all the things he could have done all the options he had.

“Let’s not forget there were seven overs of rain a missed run out dropped catches and if Australia had've held their catches and got the run out — Jonny Bairstow I think was first or second ball — and they got the seven overs of rain they might have actually been able to get it done a lot earlier in the day.

Story continues

“Look whenever it gets to nine wickets down everyone’s going to say you should have declared earlier. That’s always going to happen that’s just the way it is that’s just the way the game goes.”

Pat Cummins defends declaration in fourth Ashes Test

Cummins defended his tactics after the match on Sunday.

""I don't think we needed to hand it to them on a platter but for sure we were willing to risk England winning"" Cummins said.

""Around three and a half runs per over was similar to ... the game was ticking along around about that rate.

""I thought 100-110 overs at that rate still gave them a little bit of a cherry if a couple of batters got in.

""The wicket was still not playing too many tricks. I thought if they batted really well 350 is pretty achievable. I wanted to give us enough time.""

The skipper even donned a helmet as Australia crowded the bat in Nathan Lyon's final few overs knowing his every move bowling change and rejigged field would be heavily scrutinised.

""I certainly learned a lot ... made quite a few calls - some came off some didn't"" Cummins said.

""Even from the second innings compared to the first I felt a lot calmer and in control ... take that extra second that breath at the top of the mark.

""Probably the hardest thing to do is to try and choose among our five bowlers plus Smithy and Marnus (Labuschagne).""

James Anderson batted out the final over of the day – and the 102nd of England's second innings – at the Sydney Cricket Ground to ensure the tourists reached 270-9 at stumps and avoided a series whitewash.

With the Ashes already lost after a dismal opening three Tests Joe Root's team performed resiliently to restore some pride heading into the final match in Hobart.

They relied on some good fortune too. Rain delayed the restart in the second session on Sunday further stalling Australia after they had clinched the important wicket of Zak Crawley (77) who became England's third-youngest opener to score a half-century in an away Ashes series just before lunch. Rain also effected play earlier in the match.

Cummins meanwhile held on late to declare on day four despite Australia having built a towering lead with Crawley and Haseeb Hameed only facing 35 minutes at the crease late on Saturday.

""Obviously [we were] really keen [for the win]"" Cummins said at the post-match presentation.

""But I think it was a great game of Test cricket we got close. A bit less weather might have got us there but it was a really hard-fought match – that's why we all love it. We'd have loved to go up 4-0 but it was a good match.

""The weather forecasts are hopeless I learned that this week. I think day four was meant to rain all day. I was ready to follow-on we'd have had a full day of sunlight yesterday to bowl in.""

Asked about his late declaration Cummins added: ""Being in a position to get up close to 400 I think we needed that.

""The wicket wasn't playing many tricks we’ve got some class batters. Today was good fun I felt really lucky to have genuine bowlers plus Smithy [Steve Smith] and Marnus [Labuschagne] to throw the ball to. It felt like we were right in with a shot.""

Australia were led in the fourth Test by the magnificent Usman Khawaja who marked his first appearance in their red-ball side since the 2019 Ashes series with a hundred in each innings.

He became just the third player to score a hundred in each innings of an SCG Test and the first since former Australia captain Ricky Ponting in 2006 also against England.

""Two hundreds no it can't [get much better]"" Usman said.

""It was a terrific game. We'd have loved to win but it was a great game a great fight from England Test cricket at its best right down to the wire. It could have gone either way – we couldn't ask for much more.""

Khawaja has already said he does not expect to be in Australia's team for the final Test with Travis Head expected to return from a coronavirus-enforced absence but the 35-year-old knows he has a big role to play over the next 12 months.

""I'm enjoying the game love the game. There's lots of ups and downs. I fully know I could go out next time I play and get two ducks it's just the way this game is"" he continued.

""That's why we love it. It's such a hard game. It's really satisfying. There's nothing harder that Test cricket when you perform like that you know you've done something right.

""There's a lot of cricket coming up. Fingers crossed we stay healthy. The guys have played unbelievably before this game 3-0 up. We couldn't have asked for much more from this series and hopefully the next game we can win that and then win a few games away.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L25ld3Mtd2F0Y2gtcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtYm93bHMtdG9lLWNydXNoaW5nLXlvcmtlci11bnJhdHRsZS1tYXJrLXdvb2TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[Watch] - Pat Cummins bowls a toe-crushing yorker to send Mark Wood packing,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-watch-pat-cummins-bowls-toe-crushing-yorker-unrattle-mark-wood on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L25ld3Mtd2F0Y2gtcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtYm93bHMtdG9lLWNydXNoaW5nLXlvcmtlci11bnJhdHRsZS1tYXJrLXdvb2TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vc3BvcnQvbGl2ZS8yMDIyL2phbi8wOS9hc2hlcy0yMDIxLTIyLWF1c3RyYWxpYS12cy1lbmdsYW5kLWRheS1maXZlLTUtY3JpY2tldC00dGgtZm91cnRoLXRlc3QtbGl2ZS1zY29yZS1jYXJkLWF1cy12LWVuZy1zdGFydC10aW1lLWxhdGVzdC11cGRhdGVz0gGsAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9saXZlLzIwMjIvamFuLzA5L2FzaGVzLTIwMjEtMjItYXVzdHJhbGlhLXZzLWVuZ2xhbmQtZGF5LWZpdmUtNS1jcmlja2V0LTR0aC1mb3VydGgtdGVzdC1saXZlLXNjb3JlLWNhcmQtYXVzLXYtZW5nLXN0YXJ0LXRpbWUtbGF0ZXN0LXVwZGF0ZXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ashes 2021-22: England hold out for fourth Test draw with Australia – as it happened,"9 Jan 2022 08.25 GMT Australia it has to be said were much the better team. They had the man of the match in Khawaja and the over of the match in that corker from Cummins which contained two Waqar Younis inswingers and proved too hot for Buttler and Wood to handle. And yet it is England who will feel the happier in Sydney tonight. They have made the great escape against heavy odds. They have three batters back in form in Stokes Bairstow and Crawley. They have Broad taking five-fors again and even remembering how to bat. But most importantly they’ve regained their self-respect. They’ve given Martin Johnson’s famous line a tweak: can’t field can bat and bowl a bit can fight. After a mostly dismal 2021 they are unbeaten in 2022.

9 Jan 2022 07.57 GMT England finish on 270-9 with Broad 8 not out off 36 balls – superb stuff – and Anderson 0 not out off six. The players of both sides shake hands bump fists and exchange knowing smiles. Jonny Bairstow in a blue singlet runs out to grab a stump. He and Broad were England’s stars here but the Player of the Match was undoubtedly Usman Khawaja who was robbed of the victory his twin hundreds richly deserved. Share Updated at 08.27 GMT

9 Jan 2022 07.52 GMT Match drawn! Anderson survives One last prod and England have secured the draw and avoided humiliation. It will feel like a win. Share

9 Jan 2022 07.51 GMT One ball to go Anderson blocks the fourth  the fifth... Share

9 Jan 2022 07.49 GMT Mid-102nd over: England 270-9 (Broad 8 Anderson 0) Anderson blocks one ball and another and a third. Three balls left. Share

9 Jan 2022 07.48 GMT 101st over: England 270-9 (Broad 8 Anderson 0) It’s Lyon to bowl his last over and Broad to face. He pokes and prods. Dot dot dot dot dot. Broad does some gardening. And one more prod! Broad survives so we are down to the last over. Test cricket proper Test cricket. Share

9 Jan 2022 07.46 GMT 100th over: England 270-9 (Broad 8 Anderson 0) So Steve Smith who was originally picked as a bowling all-rounder remembers how to bowl at the crucial moment.The whole over was good with no full-tosses in sight. Two overs left. Broad and Anderson! Share Updated at 07.46 GMT

9 Jan 2022 07.44 GMT WICKET!! Leach c Warner b Smith 26 (England 270-9) The breakthrough! Supplied by Steve Smith with his occasional leg-breaks. It’s a good one and Leach can only nick it to slip. The win is on! Share

9 Jan 2022 07.41 GMT 99th over: England 268-8 (Leach 24 Broad 8) Lyon continues and Cummins is now at short point wearing a helmet. What an interesting captain he is turning out to be. Somehow again Broad survives. The tension is delicious. And the umpires are discussing the light! They seem to be saying that the quicks can’t bowl any more. Three overs to go – two of them to be bowled by either Smith or Labuschagne. Share Updated at 07.42 GMT

9 Jan 2022 07.38 GMT 98th over: England 268-8 (Leach 24 Broad 8) After flicking that yorker from Starc a while ago Leach now does the same to Cummins. He gets three and reaches 20. Broad living more dangerously somehow keeps a couple of straight balls out. Leach off-drives for four handsomely. Four overs to go. Australia’s chances of a win is down to 27pc on CricViz and down to about 67 in my book. Share

9 Jan 2022 07.34 GMT 97th over: England 260-8 (Leach 17 Broad 7) It’s Lyon to Leach. Is there a spinners’ union? You wouldn’t think so from Lyon’s field which consists of four close catchers on the off side and four on the leg. There’s also a whole lotta sledging going on. Leach unperturbed pushes for three and leaves Broad with one ball to see off which he manages. Five overs to go. Share Updated at 07.35 GMT

9 Jan 2022 07.31 GMT Nathan Lyon is coming on. He has four wickets in the match all left-handers. England have three batters left all left-handers. Share

9 Jan 2022 07.30 GMT 96th over: England 257-8 (Leach 14 Broad 7) Cummins proactive as ever with the bowling changes replaces Boland with himself. He peppers Broad and fells him – not by hitting him but by bowling a sharp bouncer that Broad actually plays well swaying so sharply that he falls over in the process. Six overs left. “As in the first innings” says Brian Withington “I am increasingly baffled by the run taking options during a Stuart Broad partnership. Previously he was farming the strike at Bairstow’s expense. Now he’s protecting Jack Leach and the trusty Millichamp & Hall deadbat. What gives?” Who knows? Share Updated at 07.34 GMT

9 Jan 2022 07.25 GMT 95th over: England 257-8 (Leach 14 Broad 7) Green gives way to Starc. Leach ducks a bumper and then gets behind the line to block a length ball. He takes the single on offer showing more faith in Broad than some would. Starc goes round the wicket and dishes up a full-toss which Broad jabs to third man. A yorker to Leach brings a classy flick for four that carries a subtext. “Dear Jos and Woody that’s how you deal with them. Love Leachy.” And here’s Kim Thonger. “I wonder if it’s time for England to accept that Australia is no longer the right type of opposing team” he muses. “Perhaps a future winter tour to Kazakhstan is more appropriate? I hear the batting and bowling units there are less highly regarded and helpful bad weather interruptions more frequent although we should of course take nothing for granted under the current management.” Share Updated at 07.34 GMT

9 Jan 2022 07.19 GMT 94th over: England 249-8 (Leach 7 Broad 6) Broad is coping better than some of his more illustrious mates with Boland’s stock-in-trade the length ball lasering in on the off bail. So Boland tries a bouncer which is the right ploy to Broad - but he copes with this to swaying out of the line like the useful No.8 he once was. Eight overs to go. Share

9 Jan 2022 07.16 GMT 93rd over: England 247-8 (Leach 7 Broad 4) All three of the remaining batters are left-handers just to make life even easier for the Aussies. CricViz are giving them a 60pc chance; I make it about 99. But England get through this over from Starc and take six runs off it as the wide open spaces beckon to them on both sides of the wicket. Nine overs to go. Share

9 Jan 2022 07.09 GMT 92nd over: England 241-8 (Leach 4 Broad 1) So England are relying on Leach and the old firm Broad and Anderson whose batting has long since been pretty abysmal. The field at last is full-on predatory – four slips a gully and three short legs. Broad nudges a single to join Leach on his signature score but then Leach goes and spoils it by taking three. Ten overs left. Is it cowardly to pray for rain? Share Updated at 07.12 GMT

9 Jan 2022 07.05 GMT Wicket!! Bairstow c Labuschagne b Boland 41 (England 237-8) The coup de grace! It’s Bairstow it’s Boland but it’s also Cummins who posts a silly point and sees the ball pop up off bat and pad. That surely is curtains for England. Share

9 Jan 2022 07.03 GMT 91st over: England 237-7 (Bairstow 41 Leach 1) Cummins takes himself off and sends for Cameron Green who’s been so effective as a bowling all-rounder in this series – the rich man’s Craig White. Bairstow is watchful at first then hooks him for four and swats to mid-on to get the single he wants. Leach with one ball to negotiate leaves it on length. He has survived six overs. Can he manage 11 more? Share

9 Jan 2022 06.57 GMT 90th over: England 232-7 (Bairstow 36 Leach 1) Leach plays and misses at Boland whereupon Marnus Labuschagne gets over-excited and says “There was a noise there was a noise.” Cummins reviews wrongly this time and Australia are down to their last one. Remind you of anything? Meanwhile an email comes in from Colum Fordham. “CricViz prediction of moral victory 5%” he says. “If Bairstow and Leach survive this onslaught and hold on for a draw it would do so much for morale in the England camp. And amongst desperate England fans. The strength in depth of the Australia team is bewlidering. Plucking Boland from Sheffield Shield obscurity and recalling as fine a batsman as Khawaja are beyond belief. Still Crawley’s performance and Bairstow’s renaissance offer a few crumbs of comfort.” They do – plus for the first time we have some fifth-day tension. Riches! Share Updated at 06.58 GMT

9 Jan 2022 06.52 GMT 89th over: England 232-7 (Bairstow 36 Leach 1) Cummins tries some short stuff to Bairstow which is surprising when the yorkers were going so well. One bouncer is a no-ball and another is upper-cut for four but it stops Bairstow nicking the strike which may have been the point. There are 13 overs to go. Share

9 Jan 2022 06.48 GMT 88th over: England 227-7 (Bairstow 32 Leach 1) Boland’s first ball brings a scare as Bairstow seems to give a chance to leg slip where Starc can’t hold on. Replays suggest it was off the thigh pad anyway. Bairstow keeps calm and carries on guiding the next ball into the covers for two then pushing for a single when he could have had three. Leach left with just the one delivery to face plays and misses as Boland swings it back in from outside off. Share Updated at 06.48 GMT

9 Jan 2022 06.42 GMT Well this is just what England need. Scott Boland! Share Updated at 06.42 GMT

9 Jan 2022 06.39 GMT 87th over: England 224-7 (Bairstow 29 Leach 1) Cummins has a whole over at Leach but can’t make use of it as his first ball is pushed firmly for a single. Jack Leach has the score for which he is famous. Mind you Cummins in this form could trouble any batter in the world. He comes close to getting Bairstow caught at leg slip with a vicious snorter but it flies to the boundary and is given as four leg byes. And that’s drinks with the Aussies right back on top thanks to one fabulous over from their captain. Not sure who’s trotting out with drinks for the batters but I hope he’s offering them a flask of brandy. Share

9 Jan 2022 06.32 GMT 86th over: England 218-7 (Bairstow 28 Leach 0) England’s faint hopes now rest on the shoulders of Bairstow without whom they would not have made it to this final session. Facing Starc he edges to second slip and is dropped by Steve Smith. It was low and not easy but not that hard either. I’d like to think that Bairstow murmurs “Mate you just dropped the whitewash.” Share

9 Jan 2022 06.29 GMT 85th over: England 218-7 (Bairstow 28 Leach 0) That was a great great over from Cummins leading from the front. Australia’s chance of a win on CricViz which was down to 7 per cent has leapt to 24. On TimViz it’s more like 94. Share Updated at 06.29 GMT

9 Jan 2022 06.26 GMT Wicket!! Wood LBW b Cummins 0 (England 218-7) Another one! Another Waqar special! It’s the toe-crusher and it would be hitting leg stump. Paul Reiffel gives it Wood reviews but to no avail and Australia are on the march. Share

9 Jan 2022 06.23 GMT Wicket! Buttler LBW b Cummins 11 (England 218-6) Noooo!! Cummins produces a Waqar Younis inswinger jagging back late and thudding into the back pad. And he gets the review spot-on too. Off goes Buttler who had looked good and with him go at least half of England’s hopes of a draw. Share

9 Jan 2022 06.19 GMT 84th over: England 218-5 (Bairstow 28 Buttler 11) A less eventful over from Starc who joins the dots until Bairstow glances for a couple. So Australia still need five wickets and England have 18 overs to get through. “Hello Tim.” Hello Alisdair Gould. “This is like watching a game of Jenga. Thanks for all.” It’s a pleasure and that’s a great way of putting it. Share

9 Jan 2022 06.13 GMT 83rd over: England 216-5 (Bairstow 26 Buttler 11) Cummins bowls a lifter outside off stump and Buttler is equal to it pulling out of his back-foot defensive shot at the last moment. Marnus Labuschagne appeals for caught behind when the bat wasn’t even close to the ball. “He’s been on the Smarties again” says Mark Butcher. Share

9 Jan 2022 06.10 GMT 82nd over: England 215-5 (Bairstow 25 Buttler 11) Smith gives way to Starc who finds some swing back into the right-hander and strikes Buttler twice. The first blow is painful possibly into the box but too high to be perilous. The second is on the pad and Cummins reviews but it’s a Tim Paine of a decision – clearly going down. We’re down to the last 20 overs. It’s not quite a nail-biter yet but it will be the minute the next wicket falls. Share

9 Jan 2022 06.04 GMT 81st over: England 215-5 (Bairstow 25 Buttler 11) Back comes Cummins with three slips a gully and a short leg when Steve Waugh would have had at least five slips. The new ball usually makes things happen and so it proves. Buttler takes a single off the hip Bairstow cuts handsomely for four Bairstow glides for a single Cummins bowls a no-ball Buttler jabs the bat down on a low one and finally Buttler gets a nick that doesn’t carry. It’s a little bit of everything to quote the great song by Dawes. Share Updated at 06.05 GMT

9 Jan 2022 05.58 GMT 80th over: England 207-5 (Bairstow 20 Buttler 9) I take it back about Smith: in his second and surely final over he dishes up two full-tosses and a long hop. Buttler helps himself to a clip for two and a glance for three and Bairstow cuts for two. And that’s the end of that chapter of the game as Australia are about to take the new ball. Share Updated at 05.59 GMT

9 Jan 2022 05.52 GMT 78th over: England 200-5 (Bairstow 18 Buttler 4) Cummins takes Starc off which may be a sign that he will take the new ball in a few minutes. Sticking to his policy of being funky with the bowling changes he sends for Steve Smith – once a proper leg-spinner now an occasional one. On the evidence of this first over he may still be better than Labuschagne because he’s more accurate. Bairstow drives him square for a single to bring up the 200. Share Updated at 05.53 GMT

9 Jan 2022 05.49 GMT 77th over: England 199-5 (Bairstow 17 Buttler 4) Lyon sniffing more blood has four men round the bat for Buttler. He gets some lavish turn out of Starc’s footmarks and appeals for leg-before as Buttler plays no stroke but it’s too high. The bounce which so often gets Lyon a wicket can work against him too. Share

9 Jan 2022 05.46 GMT 76th over: England 199-5 (Bairstow 17 Buttler 4) Buttler is on a pair out of form and nursing an injured finger but apart from that he’s absolutely fine. He gets off the mark with no fuss easing Starc through the covers for three. Australia need five wickets; England need to survive for 26 overs. Share

9 Jan 2022 05.42 GMT 75th over: England 193-5 (Bairstow 15 Buttler 0) The ball before that Stokes had gone down the track and lofted Lyon for four. Now he’s kicking himself in the dressing-room and instead of him and Bairstow a natural and prolific pairing England’s hopes are resting on Bairstow and Buttler who hardly ever seem to make runs together. Share

9 Jan 2022 05.39 GMT WICKET! Stokes c Smith b Lyon 60 (England 193-5) That’s the big one! Lyon finds some turn outside off and Stokes goes back and dabs to slip as giving catching practice. He departs swearing profusely knowing he may well have allowed the floodgates to open. But what a fine innings that is from a wounded warrior. Share Updated at 05.39 GMT

9 Jan 2022 05.36 GMT 74th over: England 189-4 (Stokes 56 Bairstow 15) It’s a double change as the mighty Boland gives way to Starc. Can he find some reverse swing? He can – he produces an inswinging yorker which Stokes might not clip for a single if his eye wasn’t in. Reverse swing is a killer for a new batter so the question is whether Australia can separate this pair who have now been out there for 16 overs on top of the 29 they saw off in the first innings. “Thank you for the clear explanation” says Jane Evans “and so glad Boland and his heavy balls are back on deck!” Ha. There’s a reason why that expression tends to be used in the singular.

Share

9 Jan 2022 05.30 GMT 73rd over: England 187-4 (Stokes 55 Bairstow 14) Cummins who certainly doesn’t over bowl himself takes his sweater and brings back Lyon. His over brings a single to each batter and no dramas. The Barmy Army celebrate by singing God Save the Queen. On Twitter there’s a typically good spot from Andy Zaltzman. “Khawaja two hundreds at five; Stokes two fifties at five” he notes. “This is only the second Test [ever] played in which the number 5 reached fifty in all four innings. The other was the Durban timeless Test in 1938-39 when Nourse & Viljoen for SA and Ames & Paynter for Eng all made 50s at 5.” Share

9 Jan 2022 05.25 GMT 72nd over: England 185-4 (Stokes 54 Bairstow 13) Boland gets some swing with his nip-backer and appeals for LBW against Bairstow but it’s too high and Cummins rightly declines to review. Next ball Bairstow has a wild waft outside off and could easily get a nick. Fine margins as always in this fiddly old game. Share

9 Jan 2022 05.22 GMT 71st over: England 185-4 (Stokes 54 Bairstow 13) Cummins has been uncharacteristically expensive in this innings and now Stokes swings him for four almost for six. But Cummins may not mind too much as the ball went not too far from the man at fine leg. A telling caption shows that Stokes’s batting average against Australia 36 overall is a tale of two mindsets – a frustrating 27 in the first innings a formidable 50 in the second. Share

9 Jan 2022 05.17 GMT 70th over: England 181-4 (Stokes 50 Bairstow 13) I don’t believe it: Boland has conceded two! Off one ball. Bairstow nudges to the keeper’s left and races back for the second more judiciously than he did when he first emerged. So England have made it through 70 overs with a minimum of 32 to go if the rain doesn’t return. On CricViz’s predictor the draw has soared to 85 per cent. Hmmm. Share Updated at 05.17 GMT"

Instead Jana wants the Birmingham Alabama-based company to circle back to a potential third-party merger.

There are hypothetical advantages and disadvantages to both a public spinoff and merger with another organization according to market experts.

One of those strategies is likely more realistic than the other however.

“[With a spinoff] you’re not at the mercy of a bidding process and you’re not waiting for buyers to show up” Jefferies health care services analyst Brian Tanquilut told Home Health Care News. “It’s an easy surefire way to affect the separation of the two businesses and hopefully realize some of the trapped value in the fact that they’re together.”

Encompass Health’s home health and hospice segment is made up of nearly 350 locations in 34 states with the bulk of those being on the home health side. Overall the segment does about $1.1 billion in annual revenue with roughly 158300 home health admissions per year and about 13200 hospice admissions per year.

In addition to the home health and hospice segment Encompass has a network of 145 in-patient rehabilitation hospitals. With about $3.9 billion in annual revenue that makes the company the largest owner and operator of such facilities in the U.S.

In 2020 Encompass Health executives said they were exploring strategic alternatives to maximize the value of its home health and hospice segment. In October they said a public spinoff was the best course of action to do that.

It’s not an infrequently used strategy with another recent example being The Ensign Group (Nasdaq: ENSG) spinning off its home health hospice and senior living segment into The Pennant Group (Nasdaq: PNTG).

“Executing a spinoff is not a unique strategy as many companies that are somewhat diversified with large caps have executed spinoffs” Les Levinson co-chair of the transactional health care practice at Robinson & Cole LLP told HHCN. “The primary reason for doing it is that you’re feeling there’s value that’s locked into the larger corporate structure. And by spinning that off and having it trade on its own that value is going to be appreciated more as a pure-play versus being mixed in with other business lines.”

Indeed an advantage of the spinoff is not having to find a third-party buyer or merger partner. Another benefit is bypassing the integration process – and any personnel hurdles that may arise.

A spinoff typically comes with more control leaving the fate of the separated company in the hands of its existing decision-makers who are intimately familiar with all of the challenges and inner workings of the business.

Encompass Health began making leadership appointments for its home health and hospice segment in June announcing Barb Jacobsmeyer and Crissy Carlisle as incoming CEO and CFO respectively.

“They’ve already set up a new management team for the business so that certainly helps” Tanquilut said.

A downside of a potential spinoff: The separated company just doesn’t perform as expected or the investor community simply doesn’t rally behind it.

Another drawback is missing out on synergistic benefits associated with a merger or combination Levinson explained.

Jana according to Reuters is pro-merger because it sees a combination with another industry player as a way to better manage challenging operational conditions including a shortage of nurses.

“By either aligning with or combining with another entity who is also in your space you may create certain synergies” Levinson said. “Market penetration other intangibles that might not be fully appreciated if you’re just doing it on your own as a standalone kind of competing with the rest of the universe.”

As far as a third-party merger or sale those options could create more instant value for Encompass Health shareholders – if there’s an interested buyer that’s making an attractive deal.

The problem with that scenario though is there aren’t many home health players that could swing a deal for an asset that’s the size of the Encompass Health home health and hospice segment. And similar to Encompass Health most of the home health publicly traded companies have seen their stock prices go somewhat depressed.

“Everyone has seen their stocks pulled back quite significantly” Tanquilut added. “Their ability to acquire an asset like Encompass that evaluation that would be compelling to the board has been impaired in a way because of the pullback in the respective stocks. I think it’s just harder to get a sale process done an evaluation that the board would want.”

Last April reports surfaced that Encompass Health representatives had been spotted in Rhode Island the home of CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) which led some to think CVS was positioning itself for a home health move.

There have been no further Encompass Health-CVS reports since.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.""



Angela Bassett has said it before and she’ll say it again: “You look good for your age” is not a compliment.

The then 63-year-old recently opened up about why she feels this way.

“When we take care of ourselves we do look good for our age whatever age that is you know?”

At 64 Angela Bassett knows she looks good. She doesn’t need anyone to tell her especially if they’re going to add “for your age” to the end of the compliment.

If you think about it the overused phrase “You look good for your age” is kind of a backhanded insult—why must age be a factor in someone’s beauty? That’s what Bassett wants to know.

“I think when we take care of ourselves we do look good for our age whatever age that is you know?” the actress recently told InStyle.

This isn’t the first time the 9-1-1 star has resisted the cliché either. In 2018 she told Allure of the time a woman bagging her groceries leaned over the counter to say “You look so young.” Instead of thanking her Bassett had a little fun with it. “I said ‘Hearing that is a wonderful thing—seeing as I’m 80!’” she laughed.

Although she admitted to Allure that it “feels good that they wonder” she knows her value is rooted in much more than appearance. That’s something she’s paid close attention to throughout her career especially as someone who has stepped into the shoes of legendary characters like Rosa Parks Betty Shabazz Tina Turner and the Black Panther’s Ramonda the Queen of Wakanda.

“Thirty and 40 years ago when I started out Black characters were weighted too heavily in the negative. I was always mindful of those images” she told InStyle. “There’s complexity to us. There’s beauty to us. There’s strength to us. There’s compassion to us. There are so many wonderful things.”

That may be why she doesn’t have a ton of advice when it comes to looking youthful—she has more important things to talk about. And when it comes to her radiant skin specifically she admitted that she can’t take much credit for it.

“My aesthetician is a big part of it. I found a great one Skin by Mamie [Mamie McDonald]. She is so gifted at what she does” Bassett raved. “As August Wilson once wrote after two hours with her ‘I am shining like new money.’ I don’t really wear makeup if I don’t have to. I’m trying to just keep healthy skin that I don’t need to cover up.”

And although it may be hard to believe she does have problem areas that pop up “like hormonal changes and melasma” she said. And when McDonald isn’t working her magic on Bassett’s skin the actress previously told the Los Angeles Times that she loves using Dr. Barbara Sturm’s line for darker skin tones.

“But I feel like so much of who we are is on the inside” she told InStyle. “So if you’re stressed it shows and it shows in your skin.”

In fact in Bassett’s opinion staying as stress-free as possible works better than any anti-aging cream on the market. “As we advance 60 is the new 40 or 70 is the new 50. It keeps getting pushed” she told Allure. “But you have to keep the stress down and the attitude hot.”

Now those are some words of wisdom we can live by.

It’s an autonomous tractor.

More specifically it’s the self-driving John Deere 8R tractor that can plow fields avoid obstacles and plant crops with minimal human intervention. It looks a lot like any other John Deere tractor — it’s green and yellow — but there are six pairs of stereo cameras that use artificial intelligence to scan the surroundings and maneuver accordingly. The farmer doesn’t need to be anywhere near the machine to operate it either as there’s a smartphone app that controls everything. The tractor goes on sale later this year just in time for an extra special robotic harvest season.

“In my view it’s a big deal” Santosh Pitla associate professor of advanced machinery systems at the University of Nebraska told Recode. John Deere’s equipment accounts for more than half of all farm machinery sold in the United States and even the simple fact that it’s putting an autonomous tractor on the market will change the way farming works. “That’s big news” Pitla said “and it’s good news.”

This is clearly a big deal for John Deere but it also represents a huge step forward for the precision agriculture movement as a whole. Simply put precision agriculture is a concept that utilizes computers data gathering and satellite imagery to build a strategy for maximizing the output of a farm. Autonomous farming equipment like soil sensors specialized drones and self-driving tractors are key to a future where we can produce more crops with less effort and less environmental impact. But exactly who’s in charge of that future and who benefits from it is still to be determined.

There’s reason to believe that farmers who own thousands of acres will be first in line to buy John Deere’s new self-driving tractors. With models ranging from 230 to 410 horsepower the John Deere 8R tractors are big machines designed for big farms. And while the company hasn’t said how much its new autonomous tractor will cost existing non-autonomous models in the 8R line can cost over $600000. John Deere says it will sell the automation system as a kit that can be installed on its other tractor models. The company also says it’s looking into offering a subscription plan but didn’t specify how much it would cost.

But even if a farmer buys the tractor outright it’s not clear who actually owns the equipment or the valuable farming data it collects. The newest John Deere tractors are sensor-filled and internet-connected. Almost anything the machine does gets logged and beamed to the cloud from an onboard cellular transmitter and John Deere has the capability to remotely shut down many of its tractors if it determines that someone has modified their equipment or has missed a lease payment. Many farmers say they can’t even repair the tractors themselves lest they trip a switch that disables the machine entirely. This means they’re forced to pay John Deere or its authorized repair shops for their maintenance needs. Meanwhile John Deere’s privacy and data policy says it can share the data about farmers’ activities that its software collects with “outside parties” in certain circumstances.

“I’m all for innovation and I think John Deere is a helluva company” Kevin Kenney an agricultural engineer and right-to-repair advocate told Wired after John Deere announced its autonomous tractor. “But they’re trying to be the Facebook of farming.”

John Deere isn’t the only one working on autonomous farming equipment and it’s not even clear that big self-driving tractors are the best use of the technology. Case has an autonomous tractor concept that doesn’t even have a cab for a human driver and AGCO which owns farm equipment brands like Fendt and Massey Ferguson is testing smaller autonomous machines including a seed-planting robot that’s the size of a washing machine. DJI the popular drone maker now has an entire division devoted to flying farming robots that can help with anything from crop monitoring to targeted pesticide spraying.

A number of researchers think that swarms of smaller machines working together are more promising for a wider range of farmers. Pitla the Nebraska professor is working on technology that would replace a single 500-horsepower tractor with 10 50-horsepower tractors. Not only could the swarm better handle different terrain and smaller farms whose land might not be as uniform as large farms but if one tractor broke the rest could keep working.

“I’ve seen farmers doing 18 hours of planting because the weather is perfect the soil conditions are perfect” Pitla said. “It’s a very timely operation. So in a way if you have swarms of these machines you’re distributing the risk.”

When you consider the fact that the farming industry is facing an ongoing labor shortage which some say is getting worse the concept of autonomous farming equipment is even more appealing. That fact could alleviate concerns that automation takes jobs away from humans but it will likely take years before we understand just how disruptive widespread adoption of automation in agriculture could be to the labor market.

Farmers and technologists alike hope that self-driving tractors and other autonomous farming equipment will usher in an era of greater yields. The driving principle behind precision farming is that by better understanding the soil and addressing issues with crops we can squeeze more productivity out of the world’s limited amount of farmland without a negative impact on the environment. This factors into a growing debate over whether industrialized agriculture is recklessly profit-driven and exploitative of the land or if consolidating farms is more efficient. With the proper rollout of autonomous farming technology we could have it both ways.

“Similar to the autonomous car industry full autonomy of farm vehicles and equipment can also be considered as an important if not the ultimate goal in the agriculture industry” said Abhisesh Silwal a project scientist who works on agricultural robots at Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute. He added that automating delicate time-sensitive tasks like pruning and harvesting which typically require skilled workers could help sustainability in the long run.

For now while researchers make drones and swarm-bots smarter we’ve got John Deere and its self-driving tractor. Even if it’s not suitable or affordable for every farmer the new self-driving machine is pushing autonomous agriculture further into the mainstream. And unlike the TV that can display NFTs this technology can actually help feed the world.

John Deere recently unveiled its new autonomous tractor that's ready for large-scale production.

The tractors will be able to operate without a driver vis mobile device.

While the farming industry has lost workers over the years some farmers are debating if this technology is necessary.

Self-driving tractors are coming to plow a field near you.

Acruculrual manufacturer John Deere unveiled its new autonomous tractor that's ready for large-scale production at a press conference last week. The company hopes to have the tractors available for sale sometime later in the year.

Farming with these self-driving tractors will look a little different and John Deere hopes the new machinery will help fill the gap between the world's growing population and the dwindling number of workers on farms.

""The global population is expected to grow from about 8 billion to nearly 10 billion people by 2050 increasing the global food demand by 50%"" according to a press release from John Deere. ""Furthermore farmers must feed this growing population with less available land and skilled labor and work through the variables inherent in farming like changing weather conditions and climate variations in soil quality and the presence of weeds and pests.""

The tractor combines technology already in John Deere tractors like GPS navigation horsepower and plows with newer innovations that allow it to be autonomous. All that farmers need to do to operate the equipment is set in their field and use their mobile device to start the tractor according to John Deere. While the machine is on the farmer can then leave the field.

From their mobile device farmers will be able to monitor the tractor and see things such as live video images data and metrics that will allow the farmer to make any adjustments as needed.

Although this may seem like a big step for farmers John Deere has been automating much of its equipment for nearly two decades. Much of the company's machinery today has an auto-steer system that uses GPS to locate and guide tractors. While these tractors still need a driver to correct and missteps and watch the direction of the plow a lot has been taken off of farmers' hands. This new tractor is just taking these existing technologies to the next level.

""This is not a demo. It's not a concept machine. It's something we've had in the field with farmers for years and will be taking to production in fall"" Deanna Kovar vice president of production and precision ag production systems at John Deere said to The Verge.

For certain tractor models farmers can expect to spend over $600000. While John Deere is selling the automation system separately so it can be downloaded into tractors they already own some farmers are still worried about the costs.

Many farmers say they can't even repair their John Deere tractors on their own they have to find a John Deere authorized repair shop to do the work for them which can be expensive. The company even has the availability to remotely shut down many of its tractors using cloud technology if a farmer has modified their equipment or has missed a lease payment on their machine.

""I'm all for innovation and I think John Deere is a helluva company but they're trying to be the Facebook of farming"" Kevin Kenney an agricultural engineer who believes farmers have the right to repair their own equipment told Wired.

While self-driving machinery could help farmers save money in the long term by limiting the number of workers they need on their farms the necessity of the involvement of artificial intelligence in farming is still debated amongst farmers.

The challenge: Most of the food we eat comes from farms and as the world population grows farmers will need to produce more food to keep everyone fed.

Many farmers are already having trouble finding enough laborers though — younger people are increasingly opting for less physically demanding careers and immigration policies are making it harder for migrant workers to reach U.S. farms.

“You can turn [the tractor] loose and just let it work 24 hours a day.” Doug Nimz

An autonomous tractor: Tractors are an essential part of farming — they pull the equipment used for plowing planting fertilizing harvesting and more.

Traditionally all of this work could only be done with the help of a tractor driver during good weather and normal working hours. But self-driving or autonomous tractors don’t need a human driver so they can solve one part of the labor problem.

“You want to get as much work done as you can [but] asking an employee to [work late at night after a long day] is hard” Doug Nimz a Minnesota farmer who tested John Deere’s new autonomous tractor told CNET.

“An autonomous tractor can do this … It’s no problem. It doesn’t care” he continued. “So you can turn it loose and just let it work 24 hours a day to get ahead of weather.”

Not only can an autonomous tractor keep working when a manually driven machine would likely be parked the vehicle’s cameras sensors and AI software can allow it to do the job more precisely planting seeds in straighter rows at the perfect distance from one another.

This can increase the efficiency of a farm ensuring the maximum number of crops are grown on the given amount of land.

What’s new? John Deere has now debuted its first autonomous tractor at CES the annual tech showcase.

The company says it plans to begin selling the tractors later in 2022 and while it has yet to reveal a price it has said it’s considering a subscription or leasing model. That may make the vehicles more affordable upfront — and give farmers a chance to try it out before committing to a big investment.

Farmers use an app to pause or restart the autonomous tractor check how much fuel it has and more.

How it works: To use John Deere’s autonomous tractor a farmer just has to transport it to the desired field and drive it around the perimeter once to create a map of the area.

After that they can use an app to pause or restart the tractor check how much fuel it has and more. If the tractor encounters an obstacle it’ll stop and send the farmer an image of it via the app so that they can decide what to do next.

Initially the tractors will work autonomously with the plows used to till soil but John Deere plans to add more capabilities in the future.

The big picture: This isn’t the first autonomous tractor to reach farms — the small California startup Monarch Tractor started selling its all-electric self-driving tractor in 2021 and other companies have at least demonstrated their own models.

However John Deere is one of the biggest farm machinery manufacturers in the world meaning its launch of an autonomous tractor is likely to make far bigger waves in the agriculture industry than any machine that came before it.

LAS VEGAS — John Deere announced a fully autonomous tractor during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on Jan. 4.

The tractor which can function without a driver in the seat is a John Deere 8R Tractor with added camera systems GPS guidance system and TruSet-enabled chisel plow and onboard computers to process images.

Officials with the company say the new tractor helps people who would normally be stuck in the seat for hours each day focus on other jobs around the farm especially as skilled labor becomes harder to find.

The tractor's six sets of stereo cameras give the tractor 360-degree obstacle detection and the ability to calculate distance.

The company says images captured by the cameras are passed through a deep neural network that determines if the machine continues to move or stops depending on if an obstacle is detected.

The autonomous tractor also continuously checks its position relative to a geofence ensuring it is operating where it is supposed to officials say the tracking is within less than an inch of accuracy.

After farmers transport the tractor to a field and set it up for autonomous use they can swipe a slider on the phone app to start the machine.

Through the app ""John Deere Operations Center Mobile"" farmers can also monitor their tractor live video from its cameras data and metrics adjust the speed of the tractor depth of the plow and more according to company.

Officials with the company say the tractor will be available for purchase later in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMDkvdGhlcmVzLWEtc3VycHJpc2luZy1uZXctYXV0b25vbW91cy1kcml2aW5nLXBsYXktb24td2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtZGVlcmUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,There's a surprising new autonomous driving play on Wall Street: Deere,"Wall Street's latest autonomous vehicle play may surprise investors. Machinery manufacturer Deere could be the latest company to cash in on the AV trend with its new self-driving tractor according to Baird. ""The Deere autonomous tractor is here and it's quite impressive"" Baird's Mircea Dobre said in a note Friday. ""The tractor revolutionizes how critical jobs (tilling planting harvesting) will be done rendering prior modes of farming obsolete and setting up a multi-year fleet upgrade cycle."" Once in operation the machine does not need any human supervision to perform the job making it the first fully autonomous tractor Baird highlighted The firm raised its price target on Deere to $475 from $425. The new projection implies more than 25% upside from Friday's closing price. The tractor is just the start according to Baird. Deere is also working on other equipment like sprayers and combine harvesters as well as processes like planting and spraying the firm noted. Deere plans to sell the autonomous solution as a subscription service. Baird said the autonomy subscriptions are ""likely to enhance long-term margins and returns"" and could be a ""multi-billion revenue stream."" The algorithm from Deere subsidiary Blue River is the ""secret sauce"" that makes the company's autonomy solutions unique Baird said. ""We remain buyers of Deere with increased long-term conviction"" Dobre said.

The mother to a non-binary customer attempting to fly with Delta Air Lines alleges the airline is discriminating against them after she was unable to buy a plane ticket for them unless they inaccurately marked their gender as “male” or “female” while purchasing the ticket despite the person having a valid identification with an “X” marker and a birth certificate also with an “X” gender marker.

“@Delta is discriminating against #nonbinary individuals and not allowing them to fly despite legal ID issued by states that allow X on birth certificates and state-issued IDs” the mother alleged in a now-viral thread of tweets posted on January 6.

“TSA requires that the boarding pass reservation match your state issued ID. TSA accepts X as a gender marker on state IDs. The problem isn’t with TSA. The problem is airlines like @Delta and @AlaskaAir” the mother Aurora Dawn wrote. “I first discovered this problem when trying to make an online reservation to buy a ticket as a Christmas present for my #nonbinary adult child. The only gender options in @Delta and @AlaskaAir online reservation systems is male or female.”

Following TSA directions to call the airlines directly she called Delta to make the reservation but a representative told her that “she was unable to change the gender designation to X” and that the ticket must have male or female gender designations. After explaining that her child is non-binary and their birth certificate has an “X” gender marker as does their identification the representative put her on hold.

Then “a @Delta supervisor in Atlanta came on the line and told me that their system only uses male/female and I can only use one of those. I explained again that my adult child is #nonbinary and #LGBTQ and their ID is X and TSA requires them to match” she wrote.

“The @Delta supervisor got short with me and said sorry that’s the policy” with the supervisor adding that she believes “that is not discriminatory it’s just their policy.” Dawn responds “Then the policy is discriminatory.” She hung up unable to get the plane ticket from Delta and unable to find another airline offering flights on the same route for a similar price that recognizes non-binary identification.

“And even if I could find an airline that would issue a ticket with the correct X gender @Delta was the least expensive” she pointed out. “Why should a #nonbinary #LGBTQ person have to pay MORE in order to be allowed to fly?… that’s discrimination.”

@Delta is discriminating against #nonbinary individuals and not allowing them to fly despite legal ID issued by states that allow X on birth certificates and state-issued IDs.

She cited a 2018 article published by INTO reporting that Delta pledged to “we are exploring options to be even more inclusive of non-binary customers with a non-binary gender option during the booking process.”

In 2019 Delta reported to NBC News and confirmed to the Daily Beast they were “planning to offer a non-binary gender option during the booking process… to accommodate the needs of diverse customers throughout our business.”

Delta has previously received criticism for how other LGBTQ customers have been treated in recent years.

In October the airline announced that flight attendants would begin to make gender-neutral introductions during on-board announcements like “hello everyone” as opposed to “ladies and gentlemen.” The airline said at the time “Promoting inclusion throughout the travel journey is core to creating a safe comfortable and respectful space for all of our customers and employees.”

More and more states and locales across the United States have begun offering gender markers that aren’t male or female in recent years. According to the Movement Advancement Project (MAP) 21 states and the District of Columbia allow for “X” markers on driver’s licenses and IDs covering about 45 percent of the American LGBTQ population —and all states and U.S. territories have some form of process allowing people to change their gender markers although all are not easy.

15 states allow “X” markers on birth certificates but 14 states and Guam require proof of gender-affirming surgery before they allow people to change their gender marker while three states do not allow changes under any circumstances.

While domestic flights in the United States do not require passports the State Department under President Joe Biden (D) has begun to make it possible for Americans to get gender-neutral “X” markers on their passports and other federal identification. This is in accordance with a 2019 ruling issued by a federal judge directing the State Dept. to give Dana Zzyym an intersex person a passport accurately reflecting their identity. Zzyym received the first passport with an “X” marker under gender identification was issued in October 2021.

From 1977 until that point the Department of State only issued passports with an “M” or “F” gender marker. Prior to 1977 U.S. passports didn’t have gender markers on them at all.

Regardless of how you feel about this a legal State ID with X should be accepted by airlines. Gender identity is a protect class under the Civil Rights Act. Period. — ⚖️Aurora Dawn⚖️ 💪🏻🌊🌈💜 (@truth_trumps) January 8 2022

Lawmakers including out Colorado Rep. Brianna Titone (D) and other LGBTQ community members and advocates such as Charlotte Clymer tweeted about Delta’s alleged actions.

Delta did not respond to Dawn’s tweets on Twitter but told LGBTQ Nation in a statement “Delta Air Lines is a proud long-time supporter of the LGBTQ+ community and we understand that being seen and acknowledged is part of having an equitable travel experience.

AirlineRatings.com has named Air New Zealand as the safest airline in the world for 2022.

The organization publishes the top 20 list every year and ANZ beat out 2021's top carrier Australia-based Qantas.

Five US carriers made the list in 2022 though Southwest Airlines dropped off after ranking 13 last year.

AirlineRatings.com a source for airline safety and product reviews has revealed its top 20 safest carriers in the world for 2022 with five US airlines making the list.

Established in 2013 AirlineRatings.com is a trusted website that rates airline safety inflight products and COVID-19 compliance of 385 worldwide carriers on a unique seven-star scale. Every year AirlineRatings.com releases a list of the top safest airlines in the world and this year Air New Zealand snatched the title from Australia-based Qantas.

AirlineRatings.com editor-in-chief Geoffrey Thomas explained in a press release that ""there is very little between the top 20 they are all standouts.""

""Our top 20 safest airlines 2022 are always at the forefront of safety innovation operational excellence and the launching of new more advanced aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787.""

Air New Zealand is the safest airline in the world for 2022 according to AirlineRatings.com with carriers like Etihad Airways TAP Air Portugal Qatar Qantas Lufthansa and Finnair also making the list. Five US carriers also earned top spots including Alaska Airlines Delta Air Lines Hawaiian Airlines American Airlines and United Airlines.

According to Thomas ANZ earned the title because of its superb incident record number of technological innovations and cockpit advancements comprehensive pilot training and low fleet age which averages just 6.8 years.

AirlineRatings also said ANZ's pilots operate in harsh weather conditions and remote environments adding to the carrier's safety ranking. Moreover the airline excelled in COVID policies and practices.

""Air New Zealand has won countless awards and has a firm focus on safety and its customers and over the past 18 months COVID-19 has brought yet another new dimension to the challenges"" Thomas said.

According to the organization the 2022 awards were based on six factors including crashes in the past five years serious incidents over two years audits from aviation governing bodies government audits fleet age and COVID policies.

However Thomas clarified that all airlines experience incidents and that it is not always the fault of the carrier when things go wrong but sometimes rather the aircraft or engine manufacturer.

""It is the way the flight crew handles these incidents that determines a good airline from an unsafe one"" he said.

There were several ranking shifts in 2022 compared to 2021 most notably were Qantas losing its crown to Air New Zealand after a three-year winning streak Southwest Airlines falling out of the top 20 after ranking number 13 last year and TAP Air Portugal being named Europe's safest carrier after not making the list in 2021.

Airlines had already canceled more than 1150 flights in the U.S. on Sunday by noon.

The omicron variant of COVID-19 has devastated airline operations and airline schedules for more than two weeks now. Airlines simply don't have enough staff to operate all their flights because of sick calls. A few major snowstorms haven't helped matters.

Henry Harteveldt a travel industry analyst and president of Atmosphere Research told TPG that COVID-19 was causing staff shortages at every airline and at every airport. ""Obviously many cancellations occur at the last minute when a crew member is unable to work ... airlines have done the best they can to cope with a situation that isn't just fluid but chaotic.""

The airlines are doing better this weekend than they did last week. Friday airlines canceled more than 2600 flights as a snowstorm hit the Northeast.

Harteveldt also told me the airlines were doing the best they could considering we are in the middle of an ever-changing pandemic:

""This is so frustrating for airline managers airline employees and for travelers. Everyone is eagerly awaiting to see the broader number of case counts and start to see verifiable good news that allows us to confirm the omicron variant peak has been reached and has passed. But this isn't a situation the airlines can control.""

Though its operations first started less than three months ago ITA Airways has become an airline of great interest both in its home country and around the world. The fact that it is the Italian national airline is a strategic factor both for the company itself and for other European and non-European airlines. Several sources have reported that not only the American carrier Delta is interested in becoming a partner of ITA Airways but recently also the German behemoth Lufthansa.

ITA Airways is undoubtedly a newborn company economically stable and focused on its future in order not to make the same mistakes as its predecessors. President Altavilla says it would be wrong to remain independent because ITA Airways is too small compared to the three big airline groups operating in Europe. So his goal is to form an alliance with a major partner as soon as possible before the start of the summer season which tends to be a very profitable time for airlines in Europe.

Lufthansa’s offer is not official but it is rumored that the German group is willing to acquire a significant share of ITA’s capital – not less than 15-20% with the possibility of reaching 40%. On the other hand Delta already in negotiations with Alitalia during the period the carrier was under administration would likely prefer to see the agreement with the German giant go away in favor of their own deal with ITA to develop a stable network with Italy one with an airline which Delta already has codeshare agreements.

Negotiations although not yet official seem to be trending toward Lufthansa according to sources of the Italian newspaper Il Messaggero. ITA’s president has also talked up the benefits of a European partnership over any other.

Finding Its Alliance

Today SkyTeam posted on its social channels an updated graphic with the 19 member airlines including of course ITA Airways. The choice of ITA Airways to become part of the SkyTeam group led by Delta and Air France made it seem from the outset that the partner was Delta. However the choice to be bound for only one year in this alliance opens up the possibility of new scenarios come the expiration of the term. Therefore at the end of 2022 should the agreement with Lufthansa materialize ITA Airways could switch to competition and become part of the Star Alliance group which in Europe is anchored by Lufthansa.

It has been confirmed that the Airbus A350s that will join the ITA Airways fleet as of June 2022 are those that previously belonged to beleaguered Chinese carrier Hainan Airlines. However the planes despite never having been delivered to the Chinese airline due to financial problems their internal fittings have already been completed and therefore do not match those of ITA Airways. All this will therefore have an increased cost for the internal and external retrofit but it is not yet clear whether the company or the lessor will pay for it.

The Austin Texas-based real estate investment trust aiming to cash in on pandemic-era demand for data centers bought 55 percent of Johannesburg’s Teraco from investors that include Berkshire Partners and Permira Reuters reported. The deal values Teraco at about $3.5 billion.

Digital Realty which has 280 data centers across the world is making the purchase as

infrastructure and real estate funds snap up multi-billion-dollar deals for warehouses filled with computing and data storage systems.

Africa’s data center market is expanding as companies turn to local cloud storage to cut costs by renting storage rather than relying on other nations or building their own servers. At the same time data consumption on the continent is rising as tech companies and carriers roll out fiber optic cables to provide faster and more stable internet connections that need secure local data hosting.

Teraco operates seven data centers in Johannesburg Cape Town and Durban serving more than 600 clients that include global internet companies.

The Teraco deal would add regional scale with a “network-dense portfolio in South Africa’s most strategically important metros” said Digital Realty CEO William Stein.

As the pandemic unfolded in 2020 economic volatility prompted companies to freeze information technology budgets sending demand for data centers down 11 percent. Even so 2020 was still the second-best year on record for leasing according to CBRE.

Data center real estate investment trusts were also the best performing REIT sector. While the real estate investment trust market declined 12 percent data center real estate investment trusts rose on average 25 percent.

Digital Realty Trust a $41 billion real estate company and one the nation’s largest data-center developers began development of a 600000-square-foot compound in 2020.

Digital artist Huang Heshan sold 310 virtual homes in his online city TooRichCity in two days raking in the equivalent of about $62700 according to Sixth Tone. The homes were sold as non-fungible tokens or NFTs which are units of data stored on blockchain technology.

While that may not sound like a lot of money land prices in the U.S.-developed The Sandbox universe have jumped exponentially: Lots now sell for $15612 up from $1175 just two months ago.

Virtual real estate has taken Chinese buyers by storm in the last year according to the outlet. ”Metaverse property” was the most popular industry news term in 2021 according to China Real Estate Business.

Heshan is one of many artists in China who have created virtual cities that sell digital blocks of land to consumers.

“Metaverse property represents the right to choose your own lifestyle” said one Chinese Sandbox investor referred to by his online pseudonym Carson who is a member of LuluLand — a crypto community that runs a virtual world in The Sandbox.

Chinese mobile game maker Honnverse also offers virtual homes 3-D models that serve as home base for users. In October the homes traded on a secondary market app after the game launched. Some for $150 to $470.

Skeptics are baffled. “This is all fake” one user told the outlet. “I believe in the metaverse but Honnverse and metaverse are two different things — having a property in Honnverse is like FarmVille.”

Other users are spending money to view design and build their own homes without buying the underlying NFT. Beijing-based VR start-up Pico Interactive which was recently acquired by China’s ByteDance operates virtual reality headsets that users can use to explore virtual property.

The increased popularity of virtual homes comes as Evergrande struggles. This week it was ordered to demolish 39 buildings at a Chinese resort in the province of Hainan after officials said the building permits had been illegally obtained.

For comparison only two homes sold for over $10 million in the first 11 months of 2021. And three sales achieved that price point in all of 2020.

A 45212-square-foot mansion on 70 acres at 10687 Evans Ridge Road in Parker sold for $12.5 million in December earning the top spot among local home sales for the month. It was also the priciest home sale ever in Douglas County according to listing agent Liza Hogan with Douglas Elliman Real Estate.

Cal Turner Jr. former CEO of the Dollar General chain and son of the founder sold the home on Dec. 13. It was originally listed for $12.9 million in 2018.

Turner 71 purchased the 11-bedroom 24-bathroom home for $7.4 million before it was completed in 2002 according to property records. He finished designing the interior and added outdoor living spaces according to the listing agent. Hogan said last month’s sale included Turner’s art and wine collection.

Turner took over as president of Dollar General after his father in 1977 and served as chairman and CEO until 2003.

The home was bought by Jonathan Yantis the 51-year-old co-founder of the NFT blockchain Worldwide Asset eXchange according to property records.

The home’s amenities include an indoor swimming pool a fishing pond an entertainment wing with a stage and dance floor and a wine cellar organized by food pairings. There’s also three apartments for guests each with a private entryway and a two-bedroom caretaker’s apartment above one of the property’s four garages.

Hogan represented both the seller and the buyer in the deal.

Here are the next four priciest local home sales from December:

Most people either clean their homes weekly or whenever enough dirt piles up but for Fiona Mills cleanliness is a part of her daily life. Mills is a former hoarding technician and franchise Ramp-Up Coach with Spaulding Decon a company that tackles everything from homicide and suicide cleaning to mold remediation.

Last November Mills shared her favorite cleaning hacks with Insider. Now she's told Insider which cleaning products are prime to get the job done.

Mills' go-to cleaning solution is hot water and trisodium phosphate or TSP

According to Mills TSP is a ""heavy degreaser"" that can cut through just about any mess including bathroom build-up.

""TSP works wonders for tough bathtub stains"" Mills told Insider. ""Mix a teaspoon of TSP with some hot water and spray into the bathtub rub with a sponge and rinse well.""

Mills also mentioned The Pink Stuff Microban and Mrs. Meyer's cleaning products.

The Pink Stuff Miracle Cleaning Paste sells for $8 on Amazon. Microban 24's Multi-Purpose Cleaner can be found on Amazon for $12. Most of Mrs. Meyer's multi-purpose cleaners can be purchased from their website for $4.

Mills also mentioned Pine Glo Antibacterial Disinfectant Cleaner which sells for $0.84 at Walmart and white vinegar which can be boiled on a stovetop to get rid of smelly odors.

Mrs. Meyer's Cleaning Products and these other brands are environmentally friendly

In addition to Mrs. Meyer's cleaning products Seventh Generation is another brand that sells a plethora of cleaning wipes sprays and detergents.

Homeowners can purchase Seventh Generation products at Home Depot or Amazon.

However be careful with chemical products like bleach

Mills suggested that homeowners use bleach and similar products with a healthy amount of discernment.

""Be mindful with bleach or ammonia – make sure there is good ventilation"" Mills said. ""Do not use bleach if rust is present anywhere – it only makes it worse.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAxLzA5L2JldHRlci1idXktZmVkZXJhbC1yZWFsdHktaW52ZXN0bWVudC10cnVzdC12cy1yZWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Federal Realty Investment Trust vs. Realty Income,"Both are good buys. A big determiner is how you want your dividends delivered.

Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) and Realty Income (O 0.64%) have a lot in common that commends them to investors as long-term buy and holds.

They're both real estate investment trusts (REITs) which requires that pay at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. They generate that income from their commercial real estate portfolios counting on their tenants to provide real estate investors with a steady flow of cash and share price appreciation over a period of years.

Notice I said years. What makes Federal Realty and Realty Income such compelling choices is their venerability matched by performance. Both are Dividend Aristocrats which means they're among the 65 members of the Standard & Poor's 500 that have raised dividends for 25 straight years or more. Federal Realty goes a step further. It's one of the 31 companies meriting the title of Dividend King bestowed for 50 straight years of payout increases.

Below we'll look a bit deeper at each of their portfolios and performance.

Realty Income is an 11000-pound giant among retail REITs

Realty Income with a market value of about $40 billion is by far the larger of the two with about 11000 properties under long-term net-lease contracts with 650 different clients in all 50 states the U.K. and Spain. Net-lease contracts require tenants to pay most of a property's operating costs.

Dollar General and Dollar Tree-Family Dollar account for 1462 of those leases and 7.5% of the REIT's rental revenue. 7-Eleven (592 leases) and Walgreen's (246 leases) meanwhile individually account for 5.7% and 5% of rent revenue respectively. Then there's FedEx with only 42 leases but 3.4% of total rent.

As for performance Realty Income has posted annualized dividend growth of 4.5% since joining the NYSE in 1994. Its record actually goes back to 1969 when it was created to provide monthly dividends to shareholders long before it went public.



Realty Income calls itself the ""Monthly Dividend Company"" and right now that payout is $0.246 a share every month good for a yield of about 4.1% based on its recent share price of about $71.

Federal Realty is smaller but also mighty

Federal Realty has a market cap of about $10.7 billion one fourth that of Realty Income and a much smaller footprint. Instead of casting such a wide net Federal Realty focuses on what it calls ""award-winning retail environments and mixed-use neighborhoods in the nation's most desirable markets.""

It has 106 properties with about 3100 commercial real estate (CRE) tenants and about 3200 residential units concentrated in coastal markets such as Washington D.C. Boston San Francisco Los Angeles Chicago and Phoenix.

Federal Realty which pays its dividend four times a year raised its quarterly payout by a penny to $1.07 a share last summer continuing a string of 54 annual increases the longest in the REIT industry. That's good for a yield of about 3.15% based on the recent share price of about $135.



Realty Income has the total return lead and gets the nod here

As an income-focused investor I like to look at total return taking into account dividends and share price growth. Realty Income is the clear winner here as $10000 invested in its stock 10 years ago would now be worth about $32000 compared with about $21000 for Federal Realty.https://ycharts.com/charts/fund_chart_creator/fool/#/?annotations=&annualizedReturns=false&calcs=i[…]=&title=&units=false&useEstimates=false&zoom=10

Realty Income and Federal Realty are both widely held widely respected members of the real estate sector and for good reason. They both have long records of reliable paybacks and decent returns making them ideal candidates for a retiree's portfolio.

As for looking ahead Federal Realty has increased its 2022 forecast for funds from operations (FFO) per diluted share from an estimated $5.45-$5.50 for 2021 to $5.65-$5.85 for 2022 Realty Income meanwhile says it has invested in $1.61 billion in 308 properties and properties under development or expansion including $532.5 million in Europe.

Those are just two of the metrics that point to continued solid returns from these two dividend stalwarts. Stocks like these are often viewed by individual investors as an alternative to low-yielding bonds cash and certificates of deposit. Either of these two will do that just fine.

A big choice is whether you prefer the payout monthly or quarterly of course but there's more. Realty Income's higher yield and stronger returns and its significant investment in revenue growth gives it an edge over its worthy competitor."

As of Friday the fund has raised nearly half a million dollars thanks to the generosity of Coloradans.

On Sunday a little of that money was spent executing a young girl's idea.

Marian Cole said she was shopping with her daughter Farrah on January 3 when Farrah began putting toys into their shopping cart. At first Marian did not know why her six-year-old daughter was doing this.

“Can we get them? And I said oh no we can't. We just had Christmas. And we don't need that. But then she was like it's not for me. It's for those kids that lost everything. And I couldn't say no"" explained Marian.

Marian and Farrah started shopping for the children who lost their homes in the Marshall Fire. The duo began by filling six backpacks with toys selected by Farrah.

“We have these very rare teachable moments where you just are given the opportunity to let your kid show their compassion"" said Marian.

Marian made a post on their neighborhood website encouraging others to participate in ""Farrah's Challenge"" and fill a backpack. She was shocked by the outpouring of support for the idea.

""I posted in the evening and by the next morning a ton of people had shown interest in it. And she had raised $296... We've probably packed 45 backpacks. And we've I think we've exhausted all of the donations but people keep asking if we need more. And it's overwhelming because what I thought was just going to be an extra 10 minutes on a Dollar Tree trip has turned into a week long process. We pack a couple a night"" Marian said.

On Sunday Denver7 Gives took part in ""Farrah's Challenge"" and went shopping for toys at the Walmart in Castle Rock. Walmart wanted to help too and donated six backpacks to Farrah's mission which is the same amount that Farrah initially packed.

Hana and Nana’s named after the Palmer Township couple’s 9-year-old daughter and Adrian’s mother offers a menu similar to that of Mike’s with breakfast staples such as meat and veggie omelets and egg platters with toast jelly and home fries.

Lunch options include cheeseburgers hot dogs egg salad and tuna salad sandwiches (on rolls) and turkey roast beef and pastrami subs. Many items are under $6.

The Hasandjekajs who have an Albanian background also introduced new menu items including a “From the Balkans” panini (with dry aged beef shredded bologna arugula and olive oil) “Sister Christina” dessert (baked apple stuffed with pecans and topped with whipped cream caramel and chocolate) and bubble tea (made with tapioca pearls) in regular coconut and mango flavors. A new espresso machine prepares lattes cappuccino and other drinks. Info: 610-838-0505.

Less than a mile south of Hana & Nana Coffee another business will be serving up specialty coffee beverages in the coming months.

Starbucks the popular coffee shop chain with more than 33000 stores worldwide is nearing completion of a cafe at the former Bank of America building at Main Street and Polk Valley Road in Hellertown.

A Starbucks cafe is expected to open in the spring at Main Street and Polk Valley Road in Hellertown. The building in The Shoppes at Hellertown previously housed Bank of America.

The cafe which will employ approximately 25 workers is expected to open in the spring according to a Starbucks spokesperson.

Interior and exterior renovations have been ongoing for the past several months and new landscaping and traffic patterns have also been installed around the building recently.

Starbucks founded in Seattle in 1971 also offers food such as breakfast and lunch sandwiches wraps and baked goods.

There are about two dozen Lehigh Valley locations including a kiosk inside the Giant grocery store less than a half mile away on Leithsville Road in Lower Saucon Township.

Shopping center changes

From coffee to kicks athletic footwear chain New Balance closed in late December after 15 years of business at The Promenade Shops at Saucon Valley.

It’s unclear what led to the closure and a company spokesperson did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

The departure adds to an already high vacancy rate at the Upper Saucon Township shopping center which opened in 2006 with more than 70 retailers and restaurants. The Promenade Shops now features more than 20 vacant storefronts — nearly a third of its total spaces.

New Balance selling athletic footwear closed in late December after 15 years of business at The Promenade Shops at Saucon Valley.

On the bright side the center in recent months has welcomed some tenants including European Wax Center; fashion-comfort footwear store The Extra Pair by Sole Provisions; and All Weather Selvedge Denim Co. (AW) specializing in denim jeans made from proprietary Japanese selvedge fabrics.

Promenade Shops tenants set to open in the coming months include: Lashes by Gab providing lash services retail products and more; and ELITE Salons & Suites a “community of beauty professionals who are independent salon owners and all work together to provide high-end luxury services to clients.”

At the Southmont Plaza in Bethlehem Township discount variety store chain Dollar Tree is coming soon to the space previously occupied by Pier 1 Imports according to exterior signage. A tentative opening date has not yet been announced.

Dollar Tree Inc. headquartered in Chesapeake Virginia operates more than 15500 stores across the 48 contiguous states and five Canadian provinces. Stores operate under the brands of Dollar Tree Family Dollar and Dollar Tree Canada.

Dollar Tree a chain of discount variety stores that has served North America for more than 30 years is coming soon to the space previously occupied by Pier 1 Imports at the Southmont Plaza in Bethlehem Township.

Customers of Dollar Tree can shop a wide variety of merchandise priced around $1 including housewares cleaning supplies snacks health and beauty products toys stationery giftwrap and party supplies.

Dollar Tree which has about 8000 stores nationwide had maintained the “everything-for-one-dollar” philosophy for 35 years but last year announced that it would be permanently raising prices by 25% on a majority of its products “in order to continue offering extreme value to customers.”

The company planned to introduce the new $1.25 price point in more than 2000 Dollar Tree stores in December and complete the rollout to all of its U.S. stores by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2022.

The change is not a reaction to short-term or transitory market conditions the company said. Instead the new price point enhances Dollar Tree’s ability to “materially expand its offerings introduce new products and sizes and provide families with more of their daily essentials.”

A big determiner is how you want your dividends delivered.

Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) and Realty Income (O 0.64%) have a lot in common that commends them to investors as long-term buy and holds.

They're both real estate investment trusts (REITs) which requires that pay at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. They generate that income from their commercial real estate portfolios counting on their tenants to provide real estate investors with a steady flow of cash and share price appreciation over a period of years.

Notice I said years. What makes Federal Realty and Realty Income such compelling choices is their venerability matched by performance. Both are Dividend Aristocrats which means they're among the 65 members of the Standard & Poor's 500 that have raised dividends for 25 straight years or more. Federal Realty goes a step further. It's one of the 31 companies meriting the title of Dividend King bestowed for 50 straight years of payout increases.

Below we'll look a bit deeper at each of their portfolios and performance.

Realty Income is an 11000-pound giant among retail REITs

Realty Income with a market value of about $40 billion is by far the larger of the two with about 11000 properties under long-term net-lease contracts with 650 different clients in all 50 states the U.K. and Spain. Net-lease contracts require tenants to pay most of a property's operating costs.

Dollar General and Dollar Tree-Family Dollar account for 1462 of those leases and 7.5% of the REIT's rental revenue. 7-Eleven (592 leases) and Walgreen's (246 leases) meanwhile individually account for 5.7% and 5% of rent revenue respectively. Then there's FedEx with only 42 leases but 3.4% of total rent.

As for performance Realty Income has posted annualized dividend growth of 4.5% since joining the NYSE in 1994. Its record actually goes back to 1969 when it was created to provide monthly dividends to shareholders long before it went public.



Realty Income calls itself the ""Monthly Dividend Company"" and right now that payout is $0.246 a share every month good for a yield of about 4.1% based on its recent share price of about $71.

Federal Realty is smaller but also mighty

Federal Realty has a market cap of about $10.7 billion one fourth that of Realty Income and a much smaller footprint. Instead of casting such a wide net Federal Realty focuses on what it calls ""award-winning retail environments and mixed-use neighborhoods in the nation's most desirable markets.""

It has 106 properties with about 3100 commercial real estate (CRE) tenants and about 3200 residential units concentrated in coastal markets such as Washington D.C. Boston San Francisco Los Angeles Chicago and Phoenix.

Federal Realty which pays its dividend four times a year raised its quarterly payout by a penny to $1.07 a share last summer continuing a string of 54 annual increases the longest in the REIT industry. That's good for a yield of about 3.15% based on the recent share price of about $135.



Realty Income has the total return lead and gets the nod here

As an income-focused investor I like to look at total return taking into account dividends and share price growth. Realty Income is the clear winner here as $10000 invested in its stock 10 years ago would now be worth about $32000 compared with about $21000 for Federal Realty.https://ycharts.com/charts/fund_chart_creator/fool/#/?annotations=&annualizedReturns=false&calcs=i[…]=&title=&units=false&useEstimates=false&zoom=10

Realty Income and Federal Realty are both widely held widely respected members of the real estate sector and for good reason. They both have long records of reliable paybacks and decent returns making them ideal candidates for a retiree's portfolio.

As for looking ahead Federal Realty has increased its 2022 forecast for funds from operations (FFO) per diluted share from an estimated $5.45-$5.50 for 2021 to $5.65-$5.85 for 2022 Realty Income meanwhile says it has invested in $1.61 billion in 308 properties and properties under development or expansion including $532.5 million in Europe.

Those are just two of the metrics that point to continued solid returns from these two dividend stalwarts. Stocks like these are often viewed by individual investors as an alternative to low-yielding bonds cash and certificates of deposit. Either of these two will do that just fine.

A big choice is whether you prefer the payout monthly or quarterly of course but there's more. Realty Income's higher yield and stronger returns and its significant investment in revenue growth gives it an edge over its worthy competitor."

Larry Baldwin and Rick Dove his colleague at the Waterkeeper Alliance an international nonprofit focused on clean water stood next to a small Cessna airplane going over their flight plan before taking off.

Baldwin’s mission was to fly over eastern North Carolina—host to an increasing number of industrial-scale hog and poultry barns often crowded right next to one another to collect evidence of the waste being discharged into nearby creeks and waterways which could threaten neighboring communities with air and water contamination.

For years Baldwin and his colleagues from Waterkeeper organizations across the state have been undertaking airborne sorties in privately chartered planes to document hog and poultry waste leaking into watersheds. Baldwin would snap pictures to supplement ongoing investigations into livestock operations he suspected were illegally contaminating water with waste from open pits of hog feces and urine.

“These Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations or CAFOs are spread over large areas mostly in rural North Carolina and it’s not easy to discover a violation from the road” Baldwin said. “That is why we have to get into these small planes to see from above if a swine or poultry facility is committing a violation.”

Flights Baldwin said are the best way to compile evidence of violations and potentially illegal waste management practices by CAFO operators he said as well as monitor the increasing proliferation of large-scale hog and poultry operations into areas with low-income communities of color.

“The most typical pollutants found in air surrounding CAFOs are ammonia hydrogen sulfide methane and particulate matter” according to a report from the National Association of Local Boards of Health “all of which have varying human health risks.”

A recent study by the National Academy of Sciences attributed 95 premature deaths annually in North Carolina’s Sampson County and 83 such deaths in its Duplin County to the fine particulate air pollution caused in part by ammonia emissions from hog operations. Minority neighborhoods in the state are disproportionately impacted by hog farm pollution and face myriad health problems from the pollution including anemia infant deaths kidney disease and septicemia according to research from Duke University.

Civil rights activists have for years pointed out long-standing environmental issues related to the continued usage of lagoon and sprayfield systems an outdated waste management practice in which untreated hog urine and feces are stored in giant open lagoons and periodically sprayed into the air and onto nearby fields as fertilizer.

Unregulated Chicken and Turkey Operations Add Contamination

The problem is compounded by the rapidly proliferating poultry industry which is largely unregulated. The state’s Department of Environmental Quality does not even have information on the location or waste disposal practices of these industrial-scale chicken and turkey barns.

Commercial poultry farms produce more waste laden with nitrogen and phosphorus than the state’s massive commercial hog farms but need no operating permits face no requirement to submit waste management plans to the DEQ and can only be inspected if someone in the community complains about their operations.

Nutrient pollution from the over-application of nitrogen and phosphorus in animal manure and chemical fertilizers is considered one of the country’s most widespread and costly environmental problems causing algae blooms that kill fish harm aquatic habitats and sicken humans with elevated toxin concentrations and bacterial growth.

The near absence of regulatory controls and enforcement action has left communities to fend for themselves. Waterkeepers attempt to fill in the gaps by monitoring air and water pollution from CAFOs.

“We combine aerial monitoring with on-the-ground investigation including testing ground water to assess if there are elevated levels of nutrients or harmful bacteria in the water body near the suspected hog or chicken facility” Baldwin explained. When elevated levels of pollution are detected those results are passed on to the DEQ for action.

But the state regulator has failed to take action against violators despite the evidence of illegal discharge proven by thorough water testing over time Baldwin said. “The DEQ does not have the resources to undertake independent investigation to detect a violation nor would they admit our findings because it’s done by a third party” he said.

Josh Kastrinsky a DEQ public information officer responded that the department “investigates complaints involving animal feeding operations to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations for the protection of the environment and public health.”

Kastrinsky said the department’s Division of Water Resources “may consider third party evidence as a part of their investigation but could not proceed with an enforcement action based only on that data without verification by inspectors.” The Division of Water Resources he said investigates complaints alleging immediate threats to the environment or human safety or health within 24 hours. For other complaints it conducts site visits within five business days.

So the Waterkeepers also inform the public about the environmental harms and risks to public health their investigations into CAFOs uncover. “Hopefully this will lead to increased public pressure that can get the state to do the right thing” Baldwin said.

For years environmental groups have joined communities near swine and poultry operations in urging policymakers to devise a better waste management system than the outdated lagoon and sprayfield systems currently in use.

Instead last July the North Carolina state legislature passed the Farm Act of 2021 which requires the state regulator to come up with a general permit within a year to enable interested swine operations to trap methane gas from the hog waste stored in open lagoons and convert it into biogas.

The DEQ has already granted four biogas permits to the hog facilities in eastern North Carolina as part of a $500 million program known as Align Renewable Natural Gas or Align RNG a joint venture between Smithfield Foods and Dominion Energy Inc. that began in 2018.

Two North Carolina civil rights groups have filed a complaint with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to investigate the approval of the plan to produce biogas by the state environmental agency despite the concerns that the project will increase air and water pollution.

DEQ is required to finalize the general permitting process before a July 1 2022 deadline.

But as New York and other left-leaning states consider ways to limit natural gas and the greenhouse gas emissions it creates 20 mostly Republican states have passed laws barring cities and counties from blocking gas hookups.

“Growing the demand for natural gas is exactly what the world does not need right now” said New York state Sen. Brian Kavanagh the Democrat who sponsored the natural gas phaseout legislation. “If you build buildings that rely on fossil fuels you are baking in very long-term needs.”

Fossil fuel combustion in buildings mostly for heating is responsible for about 13% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States according to 2019 figures from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Kavanagh’s bill would mandate all-electric buildings after 2023 except in cases where local permitting authorities determine they’re not feasible which may depend on the availability of equipment and labor. His efforts were bolstered late last month when council members in New York City voted to pass a similar ban albeit on a slower timeline by 2027. New York legislative leaders did not respond to requests for comment about the prospects for Kavanagh’s bill in this year’s session.

The New York City vote in December was by far the biggest victory for advocates of natural gas bans. They say it’s a necessary step to curb future demand for fossil fuels and to limit the growth of climate change-causing carbon emissions.

Gas industry leaders and their political allies say the bans will raise construction costs and utility bills while doing little to stop climate change.

“This is not really a climate solution” said Daniel Lapato senior director of state affairs with the American Gas Association an advocacy group for the natural gas industry. “When you start eliminating these options you have to look at the cost implications to the homeowner.”

Lapato pointed to gas companies’ efforts to produce more renewable natural gas which is methane captured from landfills farms and other sources. Laws to force electrification could stifle industry efforts to scale up that more climate-friendly option he said.

Phasing out natural gas also will require an increase in electricity production and transmission as buildings consume more power for their heating systems. Unless that electricity is produced from clean sources gas bans will simply shift emissions rather than reducing them. Most of the nation’s electricity still comes from fossil fuels although the use of coal—which has some of the highest emissions—is rapidly shrinking and it now produces less electricity than renewables. Carbon-free electricity from wind solar hydropower and nuclear projects now makes up about 40% of the nation’s electricity supply according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Lawmakers pushing the bans say their plans will be phased in gradually enough to allow energy companies to meet the added demand with renewable electricity.

Natural gas bans also have drawn the ire of some restaurant industry groups which say that chefs rely on flame cooking and temperature control that can’t be easily replicated from electric sources. Some laws have specifically exempted gas stoves which produce minimal emissions compared with building and water heating.

‘We’re sending a clear signal’

New York City’s decision to ban natural gas connections in new construction was significant not only because the city is the largest in the United States but also because it’s a cold-weather city that relies extensively on natural gas for heating. Many of the cities that have enacted similar bans are on the West Coast—starting with Berkeley California in 2019—with warmer climates and less intensive gas use.

“New York City is a four-season city. We have very cold winters and hot summers and we’re saying all-electric is possible” said Annie Carforo an organizer with WE ACT for Environmental Justice a Manhattan-based community organization that supported the ban. “The No. 1 polluters in New York are big buildings and there’s a heavy reliance on natural gas.”

The law will require newly permitted buildings shorter than seven stories to go all-electric by 2024 with taller buildings following in 2027. The ban applies to heating and clothes dryers but currently exempts water heaters which will eventually be included.

Council member James Gennaro who chairs the council’s Committee on Environmental Protection said he consulted the construction industry and electrical utilities in crafting his proposal.

“We’re walking slowly into this. We’re not doing a cannonball but we’re sending a clear signal that this is how it’s going to be” he said. “We’re giving technologies an opportunity to mature and meet the challenge and for the grid to expand capacity and become fully renewable. But we can’t stay here forever in a fossil fuel world.”

Seattle leaders took similar action last year by strengthening existing restrictions on natural gas in new commercial and multifamily buildings. The city now bans the use of natural gas for heating and restricts gas-fueled water heating to certain building types.

Duane Jonlin the city’s energy code and energy conservation adviser said roughly a third of Seattle’s carbon emissions are from natural gas use in buildings.

“When you’re trying to reduce your carbon footprint you have to stop burning stuff in buildings” he said. “This should now be considered caveman technology.”

Washington state also is considering statewide action on the issue. Gov. Jay Inslee a Democrat has proposed a measure that would require new buildings constructed after 2034 to reduce energy use intensity by 80%. While not an outright ban on natural gas the measure would “require a significant shift towards zero emissions technologies” said Anna Lising Inslee’s senior energy adviser.

Nevertheless gas proponents expect lawmakers to continue to push for a ban in the 2022 session.

“I think the move in the legislature is going to be to ban or remove natural gas as a source of heat in construction of new homes moving forward” said Jan Himebaugh government affairs director with the Building Industry Association of Washington.

“These policies have a large impact on the cost of housing in Washington and it will drive up the cost of new homes.”

‘Pause Button’

But even as states such as New York and Washington consider laws to phase out natural gas conservative states have moved rapidly to protect it. Since 2020 20 states have passed laws to block local governments from banning the fuel.

Utah state Rep. Steve Handy a Republican said multistate utility Dominion Energy asked him to propose a “ban on bans” in his state. Handy a former city council member said preempting local governments was a “tricky place to be in” but that he wanted to preserve consumer choice.

“To dictate that to consumers and businesses—I wasn’t comfortable with that” he said. “I thought we ought to put a pause button on and let the market do this.”

The gas industry argues that banning the fuel will increase construction costs and drive up utility prices in areas that are required to electrify.

Climate advocates counter that electric-powered heat pumps are becoming more and more affordable. RMI the Colorado-based clean energy nonprofit published an analysis in 2018 that found heat pumps—which handle both heating and cooling—are more cost-effective than the combined price of natural gas heating systems and air conditioning units. Electrification supporters also point to projections that show the price of natural gas increasing over the next decade.

“When people are saying it’s going to raise costs that’s fearmongering” said Russell Unger co-leader of RMI’s Building Electrification Initiative. “In most of the country costs are lower [for all-electric buildings].”

Jonlin the Seattle official said heat pumps are slightly more expensive to install in new buildings that don’t have air conditioning but not enough to affect the city’s construction market. Utility bills are roughly equivalent he said but expected to favor electric buildings in the long term.

“Over time it becomes more economical to heat with a heat pump” he said. “And it’s dramatically less expensive to take new construction and do it the way we need to meet environmental goals now instead of building it the wrong way and go through the expense of converting it in some future decade.”

Readying the grid

Another point of contention is the increase in electricity production and transmission that will be needed to heat homes from the grid rather than natural gas pipelines.

“The electrical grid as it’s built right now can’t handle that degree of added demand” said Jake Rubin a spokesperson for the American Gas Association. “It’s going to cost billions of dollars to build out our electrical system to handle those new customers.”

Climate advocates say that demand will be added gradually at the same time as utilities are already making plans to expand their renewable energy production. They acknowledge that banning natural gas will be an effective climate policy only if the ramp-up in electricity production is fueled by clean sources.

“We can’t wait to convert buildings until the [electricity] generation transmission and storage infrastructure is sufficient to meet the demand and we can’t convert all the buildings without improving that infrastructure” said Kavanagh the New York legislator. “They have to go together.”

Gas defenders also say electrified buildings will leave people unable to heat their homes during extended power outages. But few gas-powered buildings can operate under those conditions either said Andrew McAllister a commissioner with the California Energy Commission.

“That’s a red herring” he said. “Most furnaces aren’t going to work without power. They have a fan they have controls.”

Buildings are responsible for about a quarter of California’s emissions McAllister said with half of that total coming from on-site combustion such as natural gas heating.

The other half comes from the energy used to generate the electricity to power those buildings. His agency has issued building codes giving new construction an “energy budget” that is difficult to meet with natural gas pushing a switch to heat pumps.

“The equipment managers and the labor community think they’re up to the task” he said. “Having it in the building code will open up the marketplace quickly.”

At the risk of facing a Jake Gyllenhaal–style backlash I’ll just say it: I’m not a huge fan of showering. It takes time. Your hair gets wet and then it needs to be dried. And in my tiny Brooklyn apartment the tub is barely wide enough for me to raise my arms to shampoo my scalp without my elbows touching the curtain.

So I’ve outfitted my bathing space to be as inviting as possible. There’s a Quiet Town plastic curtain that lets in the light from the only window in the room. Two Slash Objects mats rest on the floor to cover our rental tile. And a string-of-banana plant that I found on a recent trip to North Adams Massachusetts hangs in the sill. See I’m trying!

But nothing has made me more excited about lathering up lately than our new showerhead. The Jolie is a recently launched DTC fixture that thanks to an internal filter removes chlorine heavy metals and contaminants that can dry out your skin and hair. And did I mention it’s cute? Available in six colors from tomato red to pale pink to black the Jolie is also a style update to whatever basic showerhead came with our rental.

Installing it was simpler than I imagined. The Jolie comes with a very adorable mini wrench for taking down the old sprayer and hooking up the new one a process that took my very capable nonplumber boyfriend a total of 20 seconds. There’s even tape in the package to use if you need it—we didn’t.

After admiring our new chrome beauty I did what any design-loving anti-bather would do: hopped in the shower. The water pressure was strong without being blasting; the spray was wide but not too; and the angle was easy to adjust.

And my skin? After a month I’ve noticed that my moisturizer goes on easier and my hair feels as soft as a toddler’s. The results have been so impressive that I’ve almost turned in to someone who looks forward to daily bathing.

Deep cleaning and pest control have been called in to a central Auckland Domino's Pizza store after an insecet was found in one customer's pizza yesterday.

Peter Chao who described the unidentified insect as a cockroach said he bought the pizza from Domino's on Mount Eden Rd on Saturday night and found that a bug that had been baked in one of the slices.

Chao said he had diarrhoea after eating the pizza and was worried there were others who had also been sold pizzas with insects from the store.

""I am worried about what is happening at this place"" he said.

A Domino's Pizza spokeswoman said it was sorry to hear about the customer's experience.

""Food safety is extremely important to us and we follow rigorous standards including monthly professional pest inspections"" the spokeswoman said.

""On review we can confirm that this store was fully up-to-date with these inspections with the last being conducted in late December 2021.""

She said Domino's Mount Eden sends out hundreds of pizzas weekly and ""to the best of our knowledge this is and isolated incident"".

""Upon learning of this customer's experience we contacted the customer directly and have organised a deep clean of the store as well as for our pest control company to further inspect"" the spokeswoman said.

The standard approach to buying a sofa is to opt for neutral upholstery and add in color or pattern with smaller (read: less expensive) accessories. A gray sofa piled with gingham throw pillows a leather love seat in front of floral wallpaper—anchor with a safe solid sprinkle in the fun sparingly. However it’s no surprise that Charlotte of the famed Sex and the City foursome would take a calculated design risk. In episode four of the HBO Max reboot And Just Like That… we get a further glimpse into her Park Avenue living room and the unapologetically pink floral sofa that lives there.

It was love at first sight for set decorator Carol Silverman. Says Sarah Nicholas Williams founder of Radish Moon: “Carol found my fabric in the John Rosselli showroom and reached out immediately.” Rather than sticking with a traditional tufted three-seater Silverman chose to cover a slouchier model in Parrot Tulip by the textile brand. The hand-illustrated stripes and buds mirror Charlotte’s bubbly yet always composed personality don’t you think?

If the look seems like a big leap take a cue from artist Malene Barnett’s Brooklyn brownstone and only use patterned fabric on the back cushion of the sofa. In colors pulled from the room’s artwork the element feel like a complement rather than a singular statement.

Confused about inflation? You’re not alone.

Inflation is paradoxically both incredibly simple to understand and absurdly complicated.

Let’s start with the simplest version: Inflation happens when prices broadly go up.

That “broadly” is important: At any given time the price of goods will fluctuate based on shifting tastes. Someone makes a viral TikTok about brussels sprouts and suddenly everyone’s gotta have them; boom sprouts prices go up. Meanwhile sellers of cauliflower last season’s trendy veg are practically giving their goods away. Such fluctuations are constant.

Inflation however occurs when the average price of virtually everything consumers buy goes up. Food houses cars clothes toys etc. To afford those necessities wages have to rise too.

It’s not always a bad thing. In the United States for the past 40 years or so (and particularly this century) we’ve been living in an ideal low-and-slow level of inflation that comes with a well-oiled consumer-driven economy with prices going up around 2% a year if that. Sure prices on some things like housing and health care are much higher than they used to be but other things like computers and TVs have become much cheaper — so the average of all the things combined has been relatively stable.

Still with me?

All right let’s cut to today and why inflation is all over the news.

When ‘inflation’ is a bad word

Inflation becomes problematic when that low-and-slow simmer gets fired up to a boil. That’s when you hear economists talk about the economy “overheating.” For a variety of reasons largely stemming from the pandemic the global economy finds itself at a rigorous boil right now.

Economists use two main gauges to track inflation in the United States and both are at their highest level in four decades.

The Consumer Price Index for March rose 8.5% – a level not seen since December 1981 when the CPI stood at 8.9%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index which the Federal Reserve prefers rose 6.4% in February from the same period a year earlier its fastest increase since January 1982.

And here’s where Econ 101 merges a bit with Psych 101. There’s a behavioral economics aspect to inflation where it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. When prices go up for a long enough period of time consumers start to anticipate the price increases. You’ll buy more goods today if you think they’ll cost appreciably more tomorrow. That has the effect of increasing demand which causes prices to rise even more. And so on. And so on.

That’s where it can get especially tricky for the Fed whose main job is to control money supply and keep inflation in check.

How’d we get here?

Blame the pandemic. And Russia’s assault on Ukraine.

In the spring of 2020 as Covid-19 spread it was like yanking the plug on the global economy. Factories around the world shut down; people stopped eating at restaurants; airlines grounded flights. Millions of people were laid off as business disappeared practically overnight. The unemployment rate in America shot up to nearly 15% from about 3.5% in February 2020.

It was the sharpest economic contraction on record.

At the same time the Fed implemented emergency stimulus measures to keep financial markets from tanking. The central bank slashed interest rates to near zero and began pumping tens of billions of dollars every month into the markets by buying up corporate debt. In doing so the bank likely prevented a full-on financial meltdown. But keeping those easy-money policies in place over the past 20 months has also fueled — you guessed it — inflation.

By early summer 2020 demand for consumer goods started to pick back up. Rapidly. Congress and President Joe Biden passed a historic $1.9 trillion stimulus bill in March that made Americans suddenly flush with cash and unemployment assistance. People started shopping again. Demand went from zero to 100 but supply couldn’t bounce back so easily.

Turns out that when you pull out the plug on the global economy you can’t just plug it back in and expect it start humming at the same pace as before.

Take cars for example. Automakers saw the Covid crisis beginning and did what any smart business would do — shut down temporarily to mitigate losses. But not long after the pandemic shut factories down it also drove up demand for cars as people worried about exposure on public transit and avoided flying. Automakers (and car buyers) had whiplash.

Cars require an immense number of parts from an immense number of different factories all around the world to be built by highly skilled laborers in other parts of the world. Getting all of those discreet operations back online takes time and doing so while keeping workers from getting sick takes even more time.

Economists often describe inflation as too much money chasing too few goods. That’s exactly what happened with cars. And houses. And Peloton bikes. And any number of other items that became hot ticket items.

How’s the supply chain involved in all this?

“Supply chain bottlenecks” — that’s another one you see all over right?

Let’s go back to the car example.

We know that high demand + limited supply = prices go up.

But high demand + limited supply + production delays = prices go up even more.

All modern cars rely on a variety of computer chips to function. But those chips are also used in cellphones appliances TVs laptops and dozens of other items that as bad luck would have it were all in high demand at the same time.

That’s just one example of the disconnect in the global supply chain. Because new cars have been slow to roll in used car demand shot through the roof which drove overall inflation higher. In some cases car owners were able to sell their used cars for more than what they paid for them a year or two prior.

What happens next?

Prices and wages are likely to keep going up. But for how long and how much depends on countless variables across the globe.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dashed hopes that prices would come down significantly in 2022.

The conflict has upended commodity and oil markets driving up prices of food and gasoline around the world. That’s compounding supply chain headaches leading to further shortages of critical food items and oil.

Lockdowns in China meanwhile have left the world’s largest seaport essentially at a standstill. Corporations bear some blame as well as many big companies have been raising prices to protect their profit margins.

And there’s no telling what kind of new shocks — a resurgent Covid variant a massive shipping container getting stuck in a waterway a natural disaster — could set back progress.

There’s no single government or central bank that can fix the inflation resulting from those global disruptions.

But central banks are doing what they can. In the United States the Fed began raising rates in March by a quarter of a percentage point — its first increase since 2018 — and plans to raise rates several more times this year.

When money becomes more expensive to borrow that can take the heat off price increases and bring the economy back down to that nice gentle simmer. Or so the Fed hopes. Its biggest challenge is to deploy interest rate hikes at a pace the economy can tolerate — raising them too much or too quickly would risk collapsing demand which could derail economic growth or even cause a recession.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJldHRvd2Vucy8yMDIyLzAxLzA5LzEwLWJsdWUtY2hpcC1kb2dzLXlpZWxkaW5nLXVwLXRvLTQ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Blue Chip “Dogs” Yielding Up To 4.9%,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2022/01/09/10-blue-chip-dogs-yielding-up-to-49/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJldHRvd2Vucy8yMDIyLzAxLzA5LzEwLWJsdWUtY2hpcC1kb2dzLXlpZWxkaW5nLXVwLXRvLTQ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWZ4LmNvbS9mb3JleC90ZWNobmljYWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9meF90ZWNobmljYWxfd2Vla2x5LzIwMjIvMDEvMDgvU3RvY2stTWFya2V0LUZvcmVjYXN0LWZvci1OZXh0LVdlZWstRGlwcGluZy1Ub3dhcmRzLUJpZy1TdXBwb3J0Lmh0bWzSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlmeC5jb20vZm9yZXgvdGVjaG5pY2FsL2FydGljbGUvZnhfdGVjaG5pY2FsX3dlZWtseS8yMDIyLzAxLzA4L1N0b2NrLU1hcmtldC1Gb3JlY2FzdC1mb3ItTmV4dC1XZWVrLURpcHBpbmctVG93YXJkcy1CaWctU3VwcG9ydC5odG1sL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stock Market Forecast for Next Week: Dipping Towards Big Support,"Indices Technical Forecast: Neutral

S&P 500 Technical Forecast

The S&P 500 is weakening from the record highs and on that trend support from October 2020 is coming into focus. It held well last month we will see if it can again. For now giving trend and support the benefit of the doubt.

From a tactical standpoint a reversal off support could pave the way for longs to work back towards a new record high. If however we see support fail to usher in buying then a breakdown could have the market on its heels in a larger corrective pattern possibly worse.

Dow Jones Technical Forecast

The Dow Jones is faring better than the S&P and Nasdaq so this bodes well for the top-side as long as this can remain the case. Keep an eye on how the broader SPX handles support assuming it tags it in the days ahead. Continued relative strength could make the Dow a more attractive long if renewed stock market strength is to become a theme again soon.

The Nasdaq 100 is lagging behind quite a bit and is of concern for the broader market given its general leadership status. But it could be rotation out of higher beta new school names into old school names that reverses course. The NDX is testing horizontal support here around the 15550/650 area. More importantly though we need to watch the lower channel line from September 2020. Holding onto the upward channel structure will be important if we are to see this recent bout of weakness turn out to be nothing more than a correction. A breakdown out of the channel could pave the way for a larger trend reversal.

DR Horton a national homebuilder with a strong presence in the Cape Fear region owns a tract of land at around the halfway point between Leland and Bolivia and has designs on building 264 single-family lots on 135 of those acres according to the planning board packet. Currently the land is zoned within the low-density rural residential district.

When the project was previously vetted by county officials in September the planning department came away with significant concerns about the original site plan like the lack of open space in certain portions and the proximity of the site to a “sizable hog farm with multiple open waste lagoons” according to the planning board packet.

Following that analysis the applicant revised the site plans considerably and has since earned a recommendation of approval from planning staff according to principal planner Marc Pagès.

“They’ve done several revisions” Pagès said. “There was a lot of back and forth on this one.”

In the most recent site plans DR Horton has increased the size of the buffer between its lots and the next-door hog farm to over 100 feet according to Pagès.

“They’re putting in what they call a windbreak that has specific species of trees that are supposed to help with any potential odor” he added.

Otherwise the single-family lots are all proposed to be at least 50 feet from the flood zone and the project includes 67 acres of open space far more than the required 20 acres. Sidewalks are going to be put in on one side of the proposed private road.

In December the applicant hosted a community meeting that was scarcely attended and the only feedback the county received from adjacent property owners — after notice was given of the impending land move — was a message of support from the lot owner to the north Pagès said.

“We feel satisfied that the site is at a tremendous improvement over what they previously did and so that’s why we’re recommending the approval” Pagès said.

In Brunswick County the planning board grants final approval to land use requests like this one which give the developers license to construct their approved site plans within a three-year window. For all projects of this scale a series of local and state permits are required before construction can begin.

The planning board will meet at 6 p.m. on Jan. 10 at the Brunswick County Government Center. The board will also consider a pair of smaller-scale rezoning requests. The full agenda can be read here.

Special to the News Journal

How do you take your tea? Whether hot or cold iced pureed or turned into a smoothie a recent food trend suggests it’s likely you also prefer it loaded.

In recent years nutrition bars that serve tea and beverages loaded with vitamins and supplements have opened up across the United States leaving many to wonder about the hype.

With more than 15 shops dotting Escambia and Santa Rosa counties Key Nutrition owner Malinda Oakley knows that standing out among the rest is a tall order. According to Oakley Key Nutrition is already making a strong impact in the community.

“A lot of my regulars drive from as far as Nine Mile Road” Oakley said. “They will pass by as many as six nutrition shops on their way to see me. When you take care of the community the community will take care of you.”

Key Nutrition located at 10437 Sorrento Road Suite 204 in Pensacola offers a wide selection of loaded teas and shakes featuring fun names such as Kim K Chocolate Elvis and Peach Baby to name a few.

“There are three kinds of tea I offer” Oakley said. “Loaded tea specialty tea and beauty tea but you can add to your favorite shake tea or drink to enhance it. My beauty booster for example consists of biotin collagen and vitamins A C and E. But the first thing I want to know is if (customers) have any sensitivities to caffeine or other supplements.”

In the short time since opening Key Nutrition Oakley has built a steady customer base with Blue Angel Elementary School teachers student athletes and gym owners among the list. According to Oakley being in close proximity to Naval Air Station Pensacola has been another big draw.

“This is the best place to be on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings when the Blue Angels practice” Oakley said. “You can pull up a chair or bring a chair from inside and you have a front row seat.”

But it’s not just the wide varieties of loaded tea that keeps people coming back. Oakley believes that in order to own a successful business it must start with building the relationship from her side of the counter.

“I was also a bartender for 16 years” Oakley said. “Except now I feel like your local non-alcoholic healthy bartender. People come in share their lives discuss their nutritional needs and in return help create an atmosphere like Cheers where everyone knows your name.”

Oakley is no stranger to having everyone know her name. Just before she opened Key Nutrition Oakley had served as a dental assistant for 10 years.

“It was so hard leaving dentistry” Oakley said. “But if it weren’t for my best friend and better half of 22 years Romeo to make me jump into something I truly love I wouldn’t be where I am today. He paid attention to what I loved and hated about past jobs and gave me the courage to start this new journey.”

Key Nutrition is open from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday. For more information call 850-293-8484.

Peeing should never be painful. So if you're wincing when you wee or your urine feels like hot lava erupting from a volcano something's definitely up down there.

A burning or stinging pain or discomfort when you pee is known as dysuria and depending on the origin of the problem it can occur while you tinkle or even after according to the Cleveland Clinic. While dysuria is more common in people assigned female at birth (AFAB) anyone can have painful urination.

We spoke with Jodie Horton MD a board-certified ob-gyn and chief wellness advisor for Love Wellness to answer the ‌burning‌ question: ‌Why does it burn when I pee?‌ Here are the most common causes for dysuria and what you can do to manage (and prevent) painful urination.

1. You Have a Urinary Tract Infection

""Burning while you pee is usually the first sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI)"" Dr. Horton says.

A UTI happens when any part of your urinary system — kidneys ureters bladder urethra — becomes infected but infections in the bladder and urethra are most common according to the Mayo Clinic.

""The urethra is the tube that empties the bladder when you urinate so if it becomes red swollen or irritated it may cause burning when you pee"" Dr. Horton says.

People AFAB have a greater risk of developing UTIs than those assigned male at birth (AMAB). That's because people AFAB have shorter urethras which makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder per the Mayo Clinic.

Other signs of a UTI include:

A strong persistent urge to pee

Passing frequent small amounts of urine

Urine that appears cloudy

Red bright pink or cola-colored urine (a sign of blood in the urine)

Strong-smelling urine

Pelvic pain in people AFAB

‌Fix it:‌ If you suspect you've got a UTI see your doctor ASAP who will likely prescribe you an antibiotic to treat the infection. The longer you wait to seek medical help the worse the infection may become: UTIs can develop into a serious problem if they spread to your kidneys per the Mayo Clinic.

Also ""it's important to drink lots of water to help flush out the bladder and dilute the urine"" Dr. Horton adds. ""Concentrated urine can be more acidic and cause that stinging sensation when you urinate.""

2. You Have a Yeast Infection

Your painful peeing experience might be the product of a yeast infection. In people AFAB a yeast infection occurs when the natural balance of microorganisms in the vagina (including yeast and bacteria) are disrupted leading to an overgrowth of fungus according to the Mayo Clinic.

""Vaginal infections like yeast can cause the vagina to become swollen and inflamed making the area very sensitive"" Dr. Horton says. In people AFAB the urethra is located just above the vagina and when you pee the urine may encounter the irritated skin of the vagina and cause burning she explains.

Other symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection involve per the Mayo Clinic:

Advertisement

Itching and irritation in the vagina and vulva

Redness and swelling of the vulva

Vaginal pain and soreness

Vaginal rash

Thick white odor-free vaginal discharge with a cottage cheese appearance

Watery vaginal discharge

People AMAB may also get yeast infections which can cause the head of the penis to become inflamed a condition known as balanitis according to the Mayo Clinic. Redness scaling and a painful rash may also occur in penile yeast infections per Johns Hopkins Medicine.

Advertisement

‌Fix it:‌ Most yeast infections are treatable with antifungal topical creams and gels (many found in your local drugstore) Dr. Horton says. But if over-the-counter options don't relieve your symptoms you should see your doctor right away.

3. You Have Bacterial Vaginosis

Bacterial vaginosis — a kind of vaginal inflammation caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina — could be the source of your stinging pee.

In addition to burning during urination you may also experience itching a gray frothy discharge and a foul or fishy odor when you have bacterial vaginosis Dr. Horton says.

‌Fix it:‌ See your doctor who can prescribe oral antibiotics or a vaginal suppository Dr. Horton says.

If you have recurrent bouts of BV try taking over-the-counter boric acid capsules and suppositories which can help restore a normal vaginal pH Dr. Horton says. ""Taking probiotics daily can also prevent vaginal infections like yeast and bacterial vaginosis"" she adds.

4. You Have a Sexually Transmitted Infection

A slew of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can produce painful pee. Herpes gonorrhea and chlamydia are some of the most common offenders Dr. Horton says. These infections can cause the urethra — and in people AFAB tissue in the vulva and vagina — to become irritated and inflamed which is why you might tear up on the toilet.

Often people with an STI confuse the condition with a UTI as both can cause burning at the tip of the urethra after urinating so they don't get the proper treatment they need to resolve the issue Dr. Horton says. In addition to burning pee keep an eye out for other common STI symptoms such as unusual discharge abnormal bleeding pelvic pain or sores she says.

‌Fix it:‌ If you notice any of these signs see your doctor as soon as possible. He or she will be able to properly examine and diagnose you and prescribe the necessary medication.

5. You Have a Vaginal Tear

Tiny tears down there can cause a burning sensation after peeing even with no infection.

""Vaginal tears can occur after childbirth"" Dr. Horton says. (It makes sense if you consider how much the vagina must stretch during delivery!)

But small microtears can even happen during sex Dr. Horton adds. ""A penis finger or sex toys that are inserted can tear the delicate tissue in the vagina"" she explains.

‌Fix it‌: During the postpartum period patients are often given a small bottle to spray the vagina when urinating to decrease the burning or stinging sensation Dr. Horton says. ""New moms can also sit in shallow water called a sitz bath"" to relieve pain and inflammation she says.

And while preventing vaginal tears during birth isn't always possible you can avert abrasions during sex. To decrease friction and your risk of tearing Dr. Horton recommends using a silicone-based or pH-balanced water-based lubricant like Sex Stuff Personal Lubricant ($9.99 LoveWellness.com).

And always make time for foreplay and arousal. ""This allows the vaginal walls to relax and your body to make its own natural lubricant"" Dr. Horton says.

6. You Have Atrophic Vaginitis

The stinging sensation when you pee may be related to atrophic vaginitis a condition that occurs when the lining of the vagina becomes thin dry and inflamed due to a decrease in estrogen Dr. Horton says.

While a drop in estrogen and vaginal dryness is most common in menopausal people those who are perimenopausal breastfeeding or taking certain types of birth control can also experience atrophic vaginitis Dr. Horton says.

In addition to vaginal dryness and burning with urination atrophic vaginitis can also cause symptoms such as the following per the Mayo Clinic:

Unusual vaginal discharge

Genital itching

Urgency with urination

Frequent urination

Recurrent urinary tract infections

Urinary incontinence

Light bleeding after intercourse

Discomfort with intercourse

Decreased vaginal lubrication during sexual activity

Shortening and tightening of the vaginal canal

‌Fix it:‌ While many postmenopausal people experience these symptoms few seek help as they're too embarrassed to discuss their situation with their doctor per the Mayo Clinic.

But you don't have to suffer silently with this condition —there are effective treatments available. ""Hormone therapy or vaginal estrogen cream can help reduce the dryness restore a normal vaginal pH and alleviate vaginal burning and painful urination"" Dr. Horton says.

7. You’re Using Irritating Hygiene Products

The culprit causing your wee woes might be in your medicine cabinet. Yep the wrong feminine hygiene products can alter the pH balance of the vagina and cause vaginal infections redness and irritation Dr. Horton says. A swollen sensitive vagina is a telltale sign that you're using an irritating product she adds.

‌Fix it:‌ Dr. Horton recommends keeping your hygiene routine simple. ""The vagina can be cleaned with plain water"" she says. ""And if you choose to use soap to clean the vulva make sure you use a pH-balanced cleanser and avoid soaps with dyes and perfumes""

Also ditch the douching deodorants and feminine sprays for good Dr. Horton says. All of them can contain ingredients that act as irritants to your vagina.

8. You Ate Something That’s Causing the Burning

Believe it or not what you eat or drink can potentially produce painful urination Dr. Horton says.

Spicy or acidic foods including citrus fruit like oranges lemons limes and grapefruit as well as caffeine and alcohol can irritate the bladder and trigger burning when you pee she says.

‌Fix it:‌ Because not all people are affected by the same food or drinks it is helpful to keep a food diary to track which things caused you a twinge on the toilet Dr. Horton says.

Another smart strategy: Drink lots of water to dilute your urine. ""Very concentrated urine can also cause discomfort and burning"" Dr. Horton says.

9. You Have Prostatitis

In people AMAB pain during or after urination could indicate a prostate-related problem such as prostatitis according to the Cleveland Clinic. The prostate is the walnut-sized gland located below the bladder in people AMAB that produces semen and when it becomes swollen or inflamed you might feel like flames are shooting out of your urine.

Often triggered by a bacterial infection prostatitis can also occur as a result of nerve damage in the lower urinary tract brought about by surgery or trauma to the area per the Mayo Clinic.

The signs and symptoms of prostatitis can vary depending on the root cause. In addition to dysuria they can include per the Mayo Clinic:

Difficulty urinating such as dribbling or hesitant urination

Frequent urination particularly at night (nocturia)

Urgent need to urinate

Cloudy urine

Blood in the urine

Pain in the abdomen groin or lower back

Pain in the area between the scrotum and rectum (perineum)

Pain or discomfort of the penis or testicles

Painful ejaculation

Flu-like signs and symptoms (with bacterial prostatitis)

‌Fix it:‌ If you have any of these symptoms seek medical help immediately. Your doctor will be able to prescribe antibiotics (if a bacterial infection is causing the issue) or alpha blockers a type of medication that relaxes the bladder neck and surrounding muscles which will help relieve painful urination per the Mayo Clinic.

In addition nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may also decrease the discomfort of dysuria related to prostatitis.

(WBTV) - Around 15-20000 Duke Energy customers lost power in west Charlotte on Sunday afternoon after CMPD told the company to cut off power in order to rescue a man who climbed on top of an electrical transmission tower.

CMPD said the man seemed to be “impaired” or “delusional” in some way as he climbed to the top of the 85-foot electrical tower with six power lines each carrying 115000 volts.

As officers arrived on the scene just before 2 p.m. they attempted to talk with the man who was approximately 70 feet up the tower. While officers were communicating he climbed another 15-20 feet to the top of tower.

“I don’t know what your faith is but I think God was watching over him today” said Foley.

“These towers are extremely dangerous” explained CMPD Major Brian Foley. “You will die if you climb this tower and you touch something the wrong way.”

SWAT negotiators were able to communicate with the man using a Long Range Acoustic Device. After approximately four hours of communication the man climbed down from the tower safely and without injury. This person has not yet been identified due to his mental and physical condition. He is being treated at Atrium Main.

“I don’t know what your faith is but I think God was watching over him today” said Foley.

“He’s a very fortunate individual.”

Police also plan to charge someone who flew a drone near the man and the power lines saying it’s illegal and could have interfered in life-saving negotiations.

According to Duke Energy’s website over 12000 people lost power around 3:11 p.m. This map showed less than 1000 people remained without power by 4:10 p.m. as it began to return. By 6:15 p.m. all the power from this outage had returned.

Eastman a 100-year old U.S.-based supplier headquartered in Kingsport TN has taken the cosmetic packaging industry by storm changing the game for copolyester sustainability using their molecular recycling technologies. These innovative technologies enable Eastman to source waste plastic instead of fossil resources to create high-performance new materials—diverting waste from landfills incineration or the environment.The portfolio of Eastman Renew materials for cosmetic packaging enables brands to give their consumers more of what they want: captivating products in crystal clear creatively designed packaging as well as a meaningful sustainability story . The company says they understand that brands may need different routes on their journey to sustainability. With this in mind they offer two distinct paths: Cristal Renew and Cristal One Renew. Eastman’s Cristal Renew portfolio is a full range of the high-performance copolyesters beauty brands have relied on for decades—now with high levels of certified recycled content—achieved by allocating the recycled waste plastic to Eastman Cristal Renew using a mass balance process certified by ISCC. With many material options these resins are formulated to give designers ultimate creative freedom with the same high quality and processing ease of Eastman’s heritage copolyesters. They provide the clarity luster color compatibility and durability that cosmetic packaging demands.Eastman’s Cristal One Renew portfolio of recyclable resins delivers both an RIC1 recycle code and certified recycle content. Both the Association of Plastics Recyclers (APR) in the U.S. and the European PET Bottle Platform (EPBP) have evaluated these materials and deem them compatible with PET recycling streams.Both Cristal Renew and Cristal One Renew can be made with 100% certified recycled content—with standard loadings of 30% and 50% offered. All Eastman Renew products carry ISCC PLUS certification ensuring transparency throughout the value chain and enabling brands to make claims with confidence.One of Eastman’s bedrock principles for these materials is that the carbon footprint will be equal or better with Eastman certified recycled content. The process used to make Cristal Renew and Cristal One Renew results in 20-30% lower GHG emissions than traditional manufacturing processes.These products are enabled by Eastman’s molecular recycling technologies which break down hard-to-recycle plastic waste into its molecular building blocks and use them to create new high-performance materials that are indistinguishable from their heritage copolyesters. According to Eastman this gives the beauty industry the “sustainability without compromise” that consumers demand.“Sustainable solutions in the beauty industry require a ‘more is more’ approach. This is what Eastman Cristal Renew and Cristal One Renew resins offer—many material options and multiple paths to sustainability including recycled content and recyclability—and all of the clarity luster durability and design freedom brands need to continually delight customers” says Tara Cary Eastman segment manager. “We are so excited to showcase the work of these talented molders and for customers to experience ‘sustainability without compromise’ for themselves.”Cary says Eastman became familiar with Beauty Packaging’s Beauty Box last year [the first edition in 2021] and immediately loved the concept. “The beauty industry is all about creating an experience for consumers and putting these products directly in customers’ hands lets them see and feel what we mean by ‘sustainability without compromise’ ” says Cary. “We have been so impressed with the innovative packaging coming from our molder partners and saw the Beauty Box as an ideal way to showcase the exquisite designs they are able to create with Cristal Renew and Cristal One Renew. Beauty Packaging has been a valued partner to Eastman and this is another ingenious way they are bringing value to the industry.”The Cristal Renew and Cristal One Renew portfolios offer a broad range of resins to meet the needs of many types of cosmetic applications including skincare jars—both thin and thick-walled—bottles for a range of cosmetic and personal care products perfume caps color cosmetics such as compacts and lip gloss vials as well as packaging for lipsticks and mascara.Eastman’s molecular recycling technologies are operating at scale at their Kingsport TN operations now and a new facility that will recycle over 100000 metric tons of plastic waste is under construction there and is scheduled to begin operations in 2023. Additionally Eastman has announced plans to build a molecular recycling and polymer production facility in Normandy France with a recycling capacity of 150000 metric tons that is expected to be operational in 2025.“Innovation is at the heart of what we do” says Cary. “We have a long history of serving the cosmetic packaging industry and are continually seeking material solutions to meet the industry’s—and society’s—greatest challenges.” She says they are also continuing to invest in consumer research to better understand the needs and desires of today’s beauty consumers and how best they and by extension their customers can give them what they want.“Sustainability is no longer just a trend in the beauty industry but a guiding force” says Cary. “We are dedicated to working toward solutions to help solve the plastic waste crisis and to create a more circular future for cosmetic packaging. At Eastman we know that it will take all of us to solve these complex challenges and see industry collaboration as a key path forward.”The new Beauty Box from Beauty Packaging features products from 5 molders delivering dynamite packaging—for categories from skincare to lip care—made with Eastman’s groundbreaking materials. The 5 molders are: Inoac WWP Beauty Pinard ShyaHsin and Albea.Here’s some background on these molders and a look at the assortment of problem-solving eco-packaging contained within the sample box.Al Lustrino president of Inoac Packaging Group  saw this year’s B2B Box as a good opportunity to reach customers with the company’s sustainable packaging solutions.Inoac participated in the 2021 B2B Beauty Box and Lustrino says “It was a great success so we decided to participate once again. Getting samples into the hands of existing and potential clients is the best way for them to experience the products we provide.”How did Inoac decide which products to include in this year’s box? Lustrino says “In reviewing the products we’ve molded using the Eastman Renew technology we aimed to include a product that most clearly demonstrates both the transparency of the Eastman Renew resins and the capabilities of Inoac.”The jar they included is molded using Eastman’s 100% Renew PET which is manufactured through their chemical recycling process and uses 100% PCR feed stocks. In addition this jar has very thick sections and demonstrates the glass-like appearance that Inoac is able to achieve using their proprietary heavy-wall PET molding technology.Inoac also included a thin-wall bottle in this year’s Beauty Box. These bottles feature flexible walls that allow for squeeze dispensing lighter component weight a faster cycle time and more. In addition this bottle is also available in the new Eastman Renew PET resins thereby addressing brands’ sustainability objectives.Inoac has been manufacturing sustainable packaging for many years—but Lustrino says Eastman’s materials are the answer to being sustainable while maintaining a brand’s packaging aesthetic. “In the past” says Lustrino “the brands that we supplied were able to make the aesthetic variability associated with mechanically recycled PCR part of their positioning. Today brands want the sustainability positioning without the aesthetic compromise. In response we have worked with Eastman to incorporate their Renew resins which offer a sustainable product without compromise.”Inoac will utilize Eastman’s materials going forward. Lustrino explains “As Inoac continues to transform our company to meet the changing needs of our clients we are continuing to partner with Eastman on other materials they are developing. These materials have application in our current Injection Stretch Blow Molding and additional molding options that we will be bringing to market in early 2023.” WWP Beauty is one of the 5 molders presenting products using Eastman materials in this year’s Beauty Box. They have included two products in order to showcase the Eastman materials they are using. Musa Dias WWP Beauty CMO says “The B2B Box is a great opportunity for existing and new customers to learn about our latest innovations in sustainability and experience how the components look and feel.”In general Dias says WWP is “committed to creating Beauty with Purpose by providing customers with packaging solutions at the forefront of eco-smart designs innovative sustainable materials and technologies besides transparent sourcing and supply chain management.” WWP also uses their proprietary Eco-Analyzer tool to offer customers validated data for each package such as material reduction rates and GHG emissions.“Creating ‘Beauty with Purpose’ takes more than one company” says Dias “so WWP Beauty partners with like-minded sustainable organizations to offer clients sustainability they can trust to make a positive and purposeful impact on the planet.”Dias says Eastman’s molecular recycled technology can recycle materials that have little value or cannot be mechanically recycled and also allows for broader and hard-to-recycle waste curbside material collections without impacting the components’ color and quality as the beauty industry requires. It provides both thin- and heavy-wall packaging with premium clarity luster and radiance “the perfect substitute for virgin plastic materials such as PET PETG ABS SAN and PS.” Furthermore molecular recycled technology enables the infinite ability to recycle polymer helping to create a truly circular economy WWP Beauty’s Eastman Cristal Renew Jar is a glass-like jar designed with 50% molecular recycled content. It features a heavy wall outstanding luster and radiance says Dias.WWP Beauty’s Eastman Cristal One Renew Lip-Gloss is “a lip-gloss with a luxurious look and feel featuring recyclable RIC 1 resin with 50% molecular recycled content.”Dias says they will continue to use these Eastman products—and will be able to provide customers with a “packaging trail.” “In addition WWP Beauty obtained their International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) so that brands can feel confident that they are using certified recycled content for their products that can be traced through the entire development cycle from creation to manufacturing” explains Dias.Milena Lejosne Pinard’s marketing & communication director says Pinard’s inclusion in the Beauty Box is a thick-wall bottle from their standard Elancia Glass Polymer range. With a capacity of 30ml it is made of extruded PET and therefore manufactured with extrusion blow molding technology. She explains “Extruded PET will retain the properties of Classic PET with transparency and similar quality. This solution will also be easier to recycle in the PET sorting sector compared to a classic PETG.” A screen print was made especially for the Beauty Box. It incorporates the Pinard Beauty Pack logo the material the Eastman Cristal One material logo the novelty of this bottle the sorting process and the phrase “Available with 50% certified recycled waste plastic.”ShyaHsin provides multiple solutions to meet customers’ expectations on sustainable packaging not only sustainable material adoption but also advanced designs including refillable  light weight etc.ShyaHsin chose Eastman materials for their “broad sustainable material portfolio for cosmetic packaging. According to Nicky Wang global marketing director ShyaHsin “These materials can be applied on skincare and color cosmetic articles with very good performance and aesthetic as well as meet customers’ sustainability requirement on recyclable or reuse purposes.”Wang said that by partnering with Beauty Packaging and Eastman “We can showcase our sustainable packaging solutions along with the B2B Box to many cosmetic customers.”As far as what they chose to include in the Beauty Box Wang says they decided to include their skincare jar and lip gloss vial in the B2B Box “in terms of advanced design and sustainable packaging solutions.” The jar is made of Eastman Cristal One Pro Renew 50 which is recyclable PET material with certified recycled content which can be applied on “high thickness articles.” The lip gloss vial features Eastman Cristal AN Renew which is PCTA grade with certified recycled content “having very good chemical resistance and beauty appearance as well as a sustainable concept.”Wang says ShyaHsin has been partnering with Eastman on more sustainable packaging projects—development promotion and innovation together—for the skincare category and also for color cosmetics.According to Albéa  “Giving recycled materials a second life and reducing our carbon footprint thanks to mechanical and chemical PCR is key. This B2B box from Eastman showcases a shared commitment to sustainability and the ability to drive circularity in the beauty industry while offering both desirable and responsible solutions.”In addition Albéa says their priority is “to offer a safe and circular packaging with minimal environmental impact. As they have committed to making all their packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025 they are therefore transforming it exploring new materials including PCR and bioplastics adapting injection and decoration processes while reducing overall material use.”Albéa often called the world’s No.1 cosmetic packaging supplier manufactures a wide range of packaging including tubes lipsticks mascara as well as perfume and applicators. They employ 12500 people operating in 35 facilities in Europe Asia and the Americas. Albéa’s global sales totaled $1.2 billion in 2021.For this year’s B2B Beauty Box they chose to include a compact case. The CM-298 is a medium-sized compact that is part of Albéa’s new compact family which contains a smaller and a larger version. The compact is made of PCR plastics (post-consumer recycled) from Eastman. The cover transparency allows the consumer to see what’s inside. The compact also has a slim and flat design which allows for easy handling and “the opening is facilitated with an elegant straight tab.” The CM-298 is ideal for eyeshadows and highlighters.

She might be well on her way. After shooting a pilot for Emperium Studios last summer in Columbus the 11-year-old Lexington girl is headed to Los Angeles next week for a talent tour for modeling and acting.

Savannah was one of 20 out of 500 entrants selected for the talent tour. She will spend time doing workshops with Disney directors culminating with auditioning for about a dozen producers.

Savannah is represented by Model and Talent Management based in Columbus.

She is up for either modeling or acting.

""I feel like I'd like to do more acting"" Savannah said. ""You can always stick some emotions into what you're doing.""

The pilot series she appears in is called ""A Boy Named Bug."" Bug is an 8-year-old computer hacker.

""I'm actually a bully in it"" she said of the production which is available on YouTube.

Savannah's grandmother suggested she try modeling.

""My mom used to model when she was younger"" said Thalia Hoak Savannah's mother of the sixth grader. ""Savannah is tall for her age.""

While Savannah enjoys walking on a runway she says modeling is not that easy.

""You have 10 different types of walks that you need to memorize"" she said.

For the talent tour Savannah has spent two or three hours on Saturdays in Zoom meetings.

She has selected a dramatic monologue for her audition.

Savannah's management company scheduled two photo shoots for her. Hoak was not pleased with the first one.

""She looked way older than 11"" her mother said of her daughter's makeup.

Hoak will be pressed into duty to handle Savannah's hair and makeup for the talent tour.

Savannah has plenty of other interests besides acting and modeling. She plays both indoor and outdoor soccer and is considering volleyball.

She also loves animals. Her family has three dogs and two cats.

In addition Savannah plays snare drum in the school band. She used to play the viola.

In fact she has a concert on Wednesday before she and Hoak head to Los Angeles the next day.

Savannah said she enjoys school.

""It's actually really fun when you think about it"" she said adding math is her favorite subject.

Hoak is on board with emphasizing school.

""I'm all for summer (acting/modeling) jobs"" she said ""but while modeling and being famous would be awesome education is No. 1.""

Eastern principal Michael Grist said Savannah is a pleasure to have in school.

""She always seems to have a smile on her face and is very polite"" Grist said. ""Savannah is the type of student who is eager to do the right thing and will offer ideas that are beneficial to others.""

Both mother and daughter are keeping their hopes realistic for the talent tour.

""I don't have high expectations for Los Angeles"" Hoak said. ""Hardly anybody gets picked right away.""

Savannah added ""If I don't get picked there will be other opportunities to do this.""

The preteen said if she could appear in any genre she would choose horror.

Los Angeles could be an opportunity for TV or movies or it could simply be a learning experience for Savannah.

""I support her in everything that she does"" Hoak said. ""She's a big kid with a big heart.""

The Los Angeles Unified School District is offering at-home COVID-19 test kits in an effort to help families meet the district's testing requirements as the new semester approaches.

When Patrick Kennedy a nightlife performer in New York City recently was exposed to COVID-19 he was desperate to find more rapid tests to not only monitor his health but track when he'd be able to return to work.

""It's impossible to find COVID tests because of the shortage in the city"" said Kennedy who works hourly to pay his bills. ""I want to get back to work but need to make sure I'm taking the right precautions and not exposing anyone else.""

After standing in long lines at testing centers and visiting pharmacies to buy rapid tests to no avail he came across an Instagram post from someone he went to high school with who was offering to sell them to people directly: $20 for each test plus a $5 delivery fee -- cheaper than some tests found in pharmacies. Kennedy bought five.

He is among a growing number of people who've turned to sites such as Instagram Facebook TikTok Craigslist LinkedIn and eBay in search of an at-home COVID test as they sell out at drug stores across the nation and lines at testing centers can be hours-long.

Kennedy's former classmate Joey an electrician who asked to not share his name for privacy reasons bought a stash of 100 test kits from his friend who works at a healthcare company.

""I have to get tested for work so it was getting very annoying to have to wait at urgent care for three hours and sometimes not even get one"" Joey told CNN noting he's paid $45 for two tests at pharmacies. ""It just wasn't sustainable.""

After purchasing them in bulk -- 100 tests for $900 (about $9 each) -- he began offering them on Facebook and Instagram to people in his local community. He said he sold 25 in one night and 45 the following day; many of which were strangers and parents who needed tests to send their kids back to school after the winter break. I was one of them.

A scarcity of COVID tests

After a long winter break my son was set to resume preschool on Monday morning. A negative COVID test was required and the only one we had came back inconclusive. While we self-isolated in the days prior panic washed over me: Where would we find another test amid a shortage in the New York area in time for school the following day? After seeing Joey's post on a local parenting Facebook group I had one 45 minutes later without ever leaving the house. I was left with many questions: Was this ethical? Is the test even real?

""I'm not looking to make a killing"" Joey later told me. ""I had access to the tests -- I wasn't hoarding or overbuying them at a drug store -- and it's almost criminal that people are waiting in lines for hours in the cold probably getting sicker. I decided to deliver them straight to houses.""

Facebook told CNN Business it prohibits the sale of test kits across our platforms and has a system for regulators and law enforcements to report behavior they believe is unlawful or against our rules. eBay TikTok and Craigslist did not respond to a request for comment. LinkedIn's policy is to take down any posts that aim to sell any items whether it's tied to the pandemic or not.

Newsom asks for $2.7 billion to battle COVID-19 pandemic

Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed spending another $2.7 billion to expand testing and boost hospital staffing while calling for a new law to give workers more paid time off if they get sick.

The emergence of COVID test resales comes as frustrated Americans struggle to get tested and face long lines amid an increased demand following holiday travel and gatherings.

Amazon CVS Health and Walgreens are limiting the number of at-home COVID kits customers can purchase. Walmart recently hiked the prices for some of its rapid COVID tests from $14 to $20 for two.

Experts say reselling kits in small numbers and without a large markup price is not illegal -- nor is purchasing these products -- but there are risks for both buyers and sellers.

""We've received reports that unauthorized sellers are trying to profit from the pandemic by selling COVID-19 tests online"" wrote Washington DC Attorney General Karl Racine in a tweet on Tuesday. ""Please beware and only buy tests through authorized retailers do you can ensure the integrity of your test.""

The Federal Trade Commssion recently published guidance around how to avoid buying fake COVID tests online such as vetting the buyers paying by credit card to dispute the charge if scammed and only buying kits approved by the Food and Drug administration.

The Biden administration recently vowed to distribute 500 million free at-home tests but it's unclear when a website will launch for Americans to request these tests and how soon they'll be shipped out. A senior government official told CNN last week it is ""working through all the details. And we'll have those in the coming weeks.""

The administration also said reimbursement for at-home testing will begin next week through insurance companies.

An opportunity for another pandemic secondhand market

In the meantime Joey is doing brisk business. But his efforts were met with mixed reactions; some people on Facebook criticized how he'd make a profit by reselling of tests others came to his defense: ""This kid isn't price gouging at all and he's taking an opportunity to make things easier for people. He's even willing to deliver -- geez!""

Ultimately Joey's post was taken down by the group's moderator. He wasn't notified why.

Arthur Caplan a professor of bioethics at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine said the trend has also emerged on his local Facebook parenting group in Connecticut.

""A black market skewing the availability of testing toward those who can pay is completely a reflection of government failure at the national and state levels to provide adequate testing"" he said. ""Am I surprised that a black market has started to flourish? Not in the least. There are many places that say you can't come here unless you've had a negative test but there are no tests. That's called by most black market people an opportunity.""

Beyond issues of equity buying COVID-19 tests from strangers is subject to fraud -- people don't know who they are or what they're really offering.

""It's unethical to price gouge in the face of panic and in the face of shortage but it will go on"" Caplan said. ""As for people buying them what are they gonna do? They can't find tests any other way. I cannot blame someone for wanting to protect their child but you have to then remember the person who sells you something on the black market could sell you something that's not going to work.""

This isn't the first time a secondary market has emerged during the pandemic. In the spring of 2020 a shortage of protective gear ignited a secondary market. ""We used some of it (at the NYU hospital) but oftentimes it would tear rip or wasn't up to manufacturing standards"" Caplan said. ""Sometimes the black market people took the money and never delivered it at all.""

It's also not the first time these issues of scarcity and equity have played out during the pandemic. Early last year concierge healthcare provider One Medical came under investigation for allowing friends and family members of its executives and its wealthier clients to skip the line to get a vaccine.

Although reselling COVID-19 tests is not overtly illegal Jessica Rich a former FTC official who worked on consumer protection issues said if there is some collusive behavior occurring between entities or individuals or some deceptive claim that is made in connection with the sales then perhaps some state laws the FTC Act -- which prohibits unfit or deceptive practices -- or the Unfair Deceptive or Abusive Acts and Practices (UDAAP) law could apply.

""If someone is selling a small number like a couple dozen a federal agency isn't going to bring action against someone doing this at that scale especially if they're open about the price"" Rich said.

However pandemic profiteering could potentially end badly for sellers. In the early days of the pandemic Matt and Noah Colvin rose to infamy for hoarding and selling hand sanitizer. Marketplaces like Amazon and eBay pulled their listings and warned others they could lose their accounts. They ended up with over 17000 bottles and nowhere to sell them according to the New York Times. (One of the brothers later expressed regret and donated supplies to charity.)

One Craigslist seller who asked to remain anonymous said they began reselling tests after waiting in line for hours missing work and paying a premium for PCR results without insurance hoping to earn some of his money back. ""I do feel a bit crummy inflating the price but COVID has screwed my work up and I need to pay rent"" the listing said. ""Had to call 50+ pharmacies on the drive from DC to find these."" The seller told CNN Business they would personally ""pay double to not deal with the lines and get results quickly if it was available.""

Some like Joey have gotten kicked out of Facebook groups. Russell Schwartz and his wife Katherine Quirk-Schwartz a nurse run a South Florida Facebook page that connects people with COVID-19 related resources. In recent weeks they shifted some of the group's focus from helping people find vaccines to assisting members with locating home test kits. Schwartz said he's kicked people out of the group for attempting to sell tests.

""Our greatest fear is individuals praying on our group because of size population and demographic of older users"" Quirk-Schwartz said.

You may be excused if you cannot tell what type of Chevy you’re looking at because truth be told it has seen much better days but if the Malibu nameplate went through your head then you sir (or ma’am) know your cars.Advertised by a used car dealer based in Ohio southeast of Columbus it was built in 2000 and has 208111 miles (334922 km) under its belt according to the eBay listing which does not reveal much about its condition . However they do say that a picture is worth a thousand words and if you dare inspect it then you will see that it has a big rust problem misaligned headlights a few beat up body panels and one gray (sourced from a Mitsubishi) and three black hubcaps.The interior does not look that promising either but on the bright side it does feature air conditioning which we don’t know if it works four-speaker stereo AM/FM radio power windows and door locks vanity mirrors cruise control with speed limiter airbags power steering andbrakes. That’s what the vendor claims anyway though they did not say anything about the things that do not work. Still for $750 which is the asking price at the time of writing you cannot really complain about anything as long as it drives  can you?Speaking about the driving part we’d suggest taking it for a spin before signing your name on the dotted line and paying for it just to make sure that the engine still has some life left in it. This is a 3.1-liter V6 which used to be good for 170 hp (172 ps / 127) and 190 lb-ft (258 Nm) of torque directed to the front wheels via a four-speed automatic transmission. The 0 to 62 mph (0-100 kph) time is irrelevant but if you must ask then it used to do it in less than 9 seconds back in the day. Top speed was rated at 112 mph (190 kph) though we reckon this one is far from offering decent performance.This Chevy Malibu is definitely not a weekend project but a ride for someone who desperately needs a set of wheels for cheap. And let’s face it it’s not like you could do much better with $750 in your pocket as that’s pretty much the budget for a nice weekend getaway. Also a decent bicycle costs a bit more than that and if I had to choose then a vehicle no matter how beat up it is would always win the battle with bikes public transport ride-sharing companies and taxis. We suspect that most of you feel the same; after all it’s the gasoline-fume addiction that unites us isn’t it?We’ll end this story on a sadder note by reminding you that the Malibu is Chevy’s sole-surviving everyday sedan in the U.S. of A. after the Cruze Volt and Impala were dropped and it could be retired altogether after the 2023 model year  reports claim. For now the 2022 family comprises the LS RS LT and Premier specifications with the most affordable carrying an MSRP of $23400 and the priciest kicking off at a minimum of $33500. The former uses a 160-horsepower 1.5-liter four-pot and the latter is powered by a 2.0-liter engine with 250 hp.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGJpYmxlLmNvbS9jb21tdW5pdHkvZWJheS1sYWJ5cmludGgtY2hyaXN0bWFzLXByZXNlbnQtMjAyMjAxMDnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mum Shocked By Late Labyrinth Worm Christmas Present From eBay,"She ordered the gift on eBay for £6 and even at that price it didn't prove to be value for money

Just like that Christmas has been and gone and we're now wading our way through the dark depths of January reminding ourselves regularly that the days are getting longer.

If you're lucky then you'll have an array of generous gifts to keep you preoccupied - but spare a thought for a mum in Teesside and her daughter.

The mum-of-three - who wished to remain anonymous - scoured the web for a gift relating to the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth which her seven-year-old daughter is obsessed with.

TeessideLive

Eventually she stumbled upon a William The Worm toy on eBay and priced at just £6 she figured she couldn't really go wrong. How wrong she was...

Advert

Despite ordering the gift in November William didn't rock up until 3 January having travelled at a worm's pace from its seller.

Ordinarily you'd say better late than never - but not in this case.

Upon opening the package the Hartlepool mum couldn't believe her eyes.

TeessideLive

She told TeessideLive: ""I saw the little cute worm William which lives in the labyrinth and thought my daughter would love it for Christmas.

Advert

""The picture of the toy looked just like the puppet in the film. So I ordered it at the end of November and was told it would be here by 20 December.

""To be honest I completely forgot about it until it arrived in the post on 3 January.

""On opening it all I could do was laugh. At first I thought it must have been a joke. Or a very poorly constructed dog toy ordered by my husband.

""It looks like a photo of the worm has been printed onto material then stretched across the filling so it's eyes and mouth are all distorted and the blue fluffy tufts are falling to bits.""

Advert

Oh dear. Looks as though the decades since the release of Labyrinth haven't been kind to Will. Perhaps he struggled to land other parts or let the fame go to his head.

TeessideLive

The description of the toy from the eBay seller said there 'might be a bit [sic] color distortions due to different computer resolutions' but that seems to be somewhat downplaying the state of this fella.

Luckily for William it looks like his amusingly poor condition may have just secured his future in the home.

Advert

The mum said: ""When I checked the description it advised that it may look different to the advertised photo - they can say that again!

""My husband thinks I should demand a refund but it only cost £6 and it's given everyone such a good laugh I think I might keep it just for the memories.

""I thought about giving it to the dogs but even they turned their noses up at it.""

Invalid email Something went wrong please try again later.

Something went wrong please try again later.

Lisa Jones and her husband Stephen Thomas (a.k.a. Thomo) were sitting in bed in their home in Muswell Hill on a Sunday morning idly scrolling eBay. Then they saw it.

""I came across this milk float that was up for sale says Lisa. ""I turned to my husband and said: 'Why don't we just do it?'""

Made in 1972 the ageing float had been retired from service delivering milk but it was still operational. It cost £2000.

Before they could talk themselves out of it Lisa had clicked: the milk float was theirs.

READ MORE: From tampons to scouring sponges here are the products we should be avoiding if we want to save the world

When it arrived Thomo set to work restoring the vehicle - before realising that it was an enormous undertaking. They needed a specialist.

There was only one man for the job: John Lenehan who based in Oxford has been repairing milk floats for the past 40 years.

""It's like a milk float graveyard"" says Lisa. ""There's something quite eerie about it - but there's nothing he doesn't know about.""

Around a month later it was ready - and it needed a name.

Inspired by comedian Benny Hill's song Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West) the float was finally christened: Ernie.

""It's not the fastest milk float in the West it has to be said"" says Lisa.

But at 50 years old Ernie is still running on his original battery manages a modest 18 miles per hour and can travel for up to 40 miles before needing to be charged. (This is done like an electric car - he's simply plugged with an electricity cord outside their house.)

Ernie can even make it up Muswell Hill itself says Lisa with pride - although he's often overtaken by pedestrians.

""That's all it needs and it's been chugging on for 50 years which I just find incredible"" says Lisa.

Ernie's purchase might have been spontaneous but it was part of a plan that Lisa and Thomo had been hatching throughout lockdown.

""Like lots of other people my husband and I looked around us and started to reassess on so many levels - our lives our working lives wanting to do something different wanting to do something which contributed and to get involved with our community a bit more"" says Lisa.

""We looked around at what was happening to the planet while we were in lockdown and this sort of tentative attempt to heal itself...dolphins coming back to the Venetian harbour - all of this was incredible. It just goes to show that this is reversible; we can change things.""

Thomo is an IT consultant and Lisa had been working as a food and drink PR and journalist where she'd noticed a shift towards sustainability and independent ethically sourced products.

They decided to combine their skills with Lisa scaling back her work to concentrate on the project full-time.

In August this year they launched The People's Pantry a zero-waste mobile refill store and delivery service selling over 140 ethically-sourced products —including cereals pastas pulses spices cleaning products and household essentials— around eight North London postcodes.

As Lisa puts it: ""This is our small way of trying to be part of the solution.""

(Image: The People's Pantry)

Reviving the old milkman model customers can order products online to be delivered in refillable containers.

When they're finished they can leave their empties outside for Ernie (or Eric the vintage bike) to collect and wash.

Powered by electricity and working a closed-loop refill system the system is anything but old-fashioned Lisa argues. ""You couldn't get more current if you tried!""

Ernie can also be booked for street visits where the intention is for neighbours to get to know each other catch up and stock up on sustainable supplies.

On Sundays they have a regular slot at Alexandra Palace Farmers Market.

With UK supermarkets alone creating 900000 tonnes of plastic waste per year (of which under 10 per cent is recycled) Lisa and Thomo's aim with The People's Pantry is to make it easier for consumers to cut down on single-use plastic.

""What we want to be about is working together to change mindsets"" says Lisa.

(Image: Yoodee)

""It's in a small way of course but I think it's amazing - once you start doing something small like monitoring how much plastic you use you suddenly become very aware of everything else that you're not doing.

""Hopefully it's going to be a stepping stone for people to reassess other areas of their lives as well - whether that's not flying as often or getting on a bike rather than taking the car.""

With 1970s Ernie and the company's focus on community The People's Pantry trades on an element of nostalgia.

""There's a kind of nostalgia at the moment when the future is so crazy. I think we're all looking back to simpler more wholesome more manageable times which has fuelled the vintage vibe.""

She adds: ""I think people have been looking for ways to make a difference - but also ways to engage with each other. I think that was one of the very few positives to come out of the pandemic. We've recognised how important community is and we started meeting our neighbours.""

Lisa is right. With the emergence of Mutual Aid and community groups during the pandemic people began to connect with others around them in the first few months of the pandemic.

According to a study by the ONS over half (50.6 per cent) of adults said that friends family and neighbours had offered to help them if they became unwell rising to 83.3 per cent of over 70s.

But 18 months on is this increased sense of community still catching on?

""We hoped that the street visits would become this very social event and that neighbours would come and meet each other and put faces to WhatsApp feeds. And that's exactly what's happened"" says Lisa. ""It's something we weren't entirely expecting.""

Five months into their venture Lisa says that the reception to The People's Pantry has been positive with locals keen to contribute.

They've seen innovative refillable solutions including a woman who makes bags out of her son's outgrown T-shirts and a customer who has refilled an old bag of Sainsbury's basmati rice five times.

Others have been willing to donate excess supplies - including says Lisa a customer with spare fertiliser from his wormery.

""That's really uplifting - it's exactly what we want it to be about.""

Ernie meanwhile has developed a following. He's recognised in the street and was even sewn a Father Christmas hat by a neighbour.

""He's developed a kind of personality of his own - he's like this comedy character with a serious soul"" laughs Lisa.

On a personal level Lisa and Thomo have enjoyed working together. Thomo has built an e-commerce site for the company and has been working on an app.

(Image: The People's Pantry)

""Actually it was not a bad thing for our marriage because you suddenly realise the strengths and skills that you don't ordinarily see in each other because you're working in different fields...I've been amazed at what he's able to do"" she says.

The couple have four children with varying degrees of enthusiasm for their enterprise. Lisa says their eldest daughter recently told her she was pleased they'd launched the business because it had increased her own awareness and encouraged her to start conversations about sustainability at university.

Their son is helping out with packing and deliveries but insists on keeping some distance from Ernie.

""They're all really supportive. They love the idea - as long as they don't have to be seen sitting in Ernie.""

So far Lisa feels that her career change was the right choice for her. ""I am pleased I made a change and I'm really enjoying it"" she says. ""It does consume our week - but it doesn't really matter when you're doing something that you enjoy.""

For the moment Lisa and Thomo are concentrating on their own community where they have lived for 22 years.

But Lisa is not ruling out the possibility of more Ernies in future - coming perhaps to a community near you.

MAKE A MINT Rare Kew Gardens 50p coin sells for £250 on eBay – how to spot one and make a mint

A RARE 50p coin has sold on eBay 500 times higher than its face value as one lucky bidder managed to claim it for their own with a £250 offer.

In any other circumstance a 50p is worth exactly that - 50p. But this coin features a unique twist that means it's more in demand than any other.

2 The rare coin has the famous Kew Gardens design on the reverse Credit: ebay

2 The eBay listing attracted the attention of 28 bids Credit: ebay

That means collectors who know what they're looking for will offer high prices to get their owns hands on a copy.

It's because the coin is the rarest of them all -according to Change Checker's latest scarcity index anyway.

It's the rare 2009 Kew Gardens 50p of which only 210000 exist.

On the reverse side it features an image of the Chinese pagoda that stands at the heart of the London attraction the coin is named after.

We often see this particular style coin sell for hundreds of pounds on eBay so it's no strange feat and this particular coin managed to catch the attention of 28 bids.

Those were placed within the short time frame of just one day though bids kicked off at a whopping £90 to start with.

We've seen copies of the coin reach £190 in the past and £177 before too so £250 is an impressive price to call the final sale on.

How to spot one and make a mint

It's always worthing having a rifle through your own change to spot any unique designs - if you find one you could make a lot of money from it on eBay.

The Kew Gardens 50p like other commemorative style coins will usually sell for hundreds of pounds so you could definitely make a mint.

Even the odd minting error raises interest too.

They'll all usually be produced in low numbers so demand from collectors is high.

If you look at other listings on eBay you'll be able to determine how much your own change could go for.

But you should also always keep in mind that on eBay a buyer could pull out which means the coin won't have sold for the price it says it has.

Be cautious of fakes too as they'll often show up online.

You can check your change with experts like Coin Hunter or The Royal Mint if you want to know if your change is worth what others are saying."

(January 8th),"Our Pick: Phil Foden (Man City — LW — 87)

This is the 16th TOTW for FIFA 22's Ultimate Team and it features some absolute bangers. N'Golo Kanté is out there with a cheeky little 92-rated card with the kind of tackling and interception numbers to die for. We all know just how potent he can be in FIFA games so if you have money he will be worth the splurge. Next up is Iago Aspas with a 97-rated ST cart for the Celta Vigo man. Now the problem with Aspas has always been his four-star weak foot and three-star skill moves. That isn't solved here but his SIF does boost his number to the point where you can probably take him for a drive with no major issues. Sánchez the Tottenham CB is the featured player this week giving him a double stats boost for the little star above his number. It's a good card that will be as cheap as chips so keep an eye out for it as an option for your budget teams.Phil Foden's second in-form card puts him out on the LW. For many this position will be seen as a con given that he is one of the best CAMs in the real world and FIFA. Here is what the draw is though: because of his position he will be slightly cheaper. For that reason and if you slap a Catalyst chem style on him you are looking at a 97 pace and 90 passing stats boost that really makes him shine. Obviously the other thing to note is that his OTW card is 88-rated and in the middle of the park. So invest as you will but don't ignore this card!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzkyOTA0LWJsdWUtdGlnZXItdW52ZWlscy13b3JsZC1maXJzdC1zb2xhci1wb3dlcmVkLWhlYWRzZXQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blue Tiger unveils world's first solar-powered headset,"Something to look forward to: Blue Tiger recently unveiled a headset that uses solar power for unlimited use without needing conventional charging. The company positions it as a high-grade headset for on-the-go use. It garnered some notice at CES 2022 this week and is set to launch this spring though with no word on pricing.

Blue Tiger's Solare headset uses a Powerfoyle solar cell headband to stay continually charged under indoor and outdoor lighting. Blue Tiger designed it for constant use while driving.

According to Exeger Urbanista and Adidas also have solar-powered headphones that use its Powerfoyle technology. Cycling apparel company POC uses Powerfoyle for the solar-powered integrated lights in its bicycle helmet as well.

The Solare features 97 percent noise canceling can operate at between minus-40 and 122 degrees Fahrenheit and uses Bluetooth 5.1 with a range of 300 feet. It's compatible with Siri and Google Assistant. Blue Tiger also claims the headset meets the MIL-STD-810 military specification for ruggedness in extreme environments but that doesn't necessarily mean it has gone through actual military testing.

The CES 2022 Innovation Awards recognized Solare as an honoree calling it a military-grade headset running on sustainable energy.

“I want to walk through the grounds of Trinity College Dublin to turn the pages of the Book of Kells and I’ll be able to do that in VR” said British futurist Andrew Curry referring to the 800-year-old gospel scrolls housed at Ireland’s top university.

In its fully realized form the metaverse promises to offer true-to-life sights sounds and even smells where a tour of ancient Greece or a visit to a Seoul café can happen from your home Curry said. Decked out with full-spectrum VR headsets smart clothing and tactile-responsive haptic gloves the at-home traveler can touch the Parthenon in Athens or taste the rich foam of a Korean dalgona coffee.

You wouldn’t even have to be you. Members of the metaverse could prowl the Brazilian rainforest as a jaguar or take the court at Madison Square Garden as LeBron James. The only limits are your imagination.

By 2030 “a large proportion of people will be in the metaverse in some way” predicts Melanie Subin a director at The Future Today Institute in New York City.

Some will simply use it “only to fulfill work or educational obligations” she said. Others “will live the majority of their waking hours ‘jacked in.’”

Using a “blend of physical and behavioral biometrics emotion recognition sentiment analysis and personal data” the metaverse will be able to create a customized and enhanced reality for each person she said.

In the future “AR wearables may be as pervasive as smart phones are today” said Patrick Cozzi who runs the 3D tech company Cesium and is heavily involved in enhancing the metaverse.

He and others see a future where headsets like the Oculus — a popular holiday gift this season that invites you to “defy reality” — replace the cell phone altogether used 24/7 as a go-to device for people to hang out with friends shop or travel through the virtual stratosphere.

But the current version of the metaverse for now is somewhat less grand.

Several companies including Snap Amazon Microsoft and Mark Zuckerberg’s company Meta (formerly Facebook) have their own competing versions of this new digital world. (Meta says it will dedicate $10 billion to the effort and it plans to hire 10000 workers just for their European operation.) But while the VR spaces they’ve developed — mostly for socializing and gaming — are colorful and cool none has created an all-encompassing experience that blurs what is real and imaginary.

Nor are the apps games and platforms of the metaverse interconnected. There’s no central meeting ground. Millions of people spend hours a day in their favorite virtual worlds shooting down zombies in the video game “Fortnite” for example or aliens in “Half-Life: Alyx” but they can’t jump from one to the other without logging out and switching platforms.

Still some aspects of the future metaverse are already coming to life.

Recording artists have embraced VR via “Fortnite” a streaming- and cosplay-friendly game where avatars gather en masse on a magical island.

Ariana Grande kicked off her “Rift” tour Aug. 6 with a virtual performance on the free-to-play game her anime alter ego decked out in a dress of broken glass fragments as she wielded a giant crystal hammer. The songs were prerecorded but fans could follow the virtual Grande as she sang and danced swishing her trademark ponytail.

You could even buy and wear her “skin” — the star’s animated look — for your own avatar. She reportedly split the proceeds from in-game purchases to the event with creator Epic Games and pocketed a cool $20 million. Since its release in 2017 the game itself has generated more than $10 billion in revenue.

‘It takes away the risk of certain activities and you can push yourself out of your comfort zone.’ Catherine Allen on testing herself with virtual reality climbs before tackling the real thing

In September Seoul became the first major city to announce plans to go full meta saying it was set to create a fully realized virtual “ecosystem for all areas of its municipal administration such as economic cultural tourism educational and civic service” according to the Seoul Metropolitan Government.

The agency said its most popular tourist attractions would be recreated in the virtual space on a platform it plans to launch starting in 2023.

While the metaverse industry is growing fast fueled by the pandemic keeping people at home it’s an open question as to whether one company will eventually emerge as the dominant force such as Google which now has a near monopoly among search engines.

“We would like it to be a unified system” said Yesha Sivan an author professor and expert on the metaverse who edits the Journal of Virtual Worlds Research. “The key factor is having global standards that would facilitate this.”

“We hope to be able to buy a virtual shirt in world A and take the shirt to world B” he explained.

Because the metaverse frequently involves physical activity — whether you’re chasing aliens or taking a yoga class — it also provides real-world benefits said Catherine Allen who runs the company Limina Immersive.

“It takes away the risk of certain activities and you can push yourself out of your comfort zone” she said.

“I did a VR experience called The Climb during the lockdown and it gave me a sense of body confidence” said Allen an avid hiker. “Then I did a real hike in Madeira and I found I was much more adventurous. This sort of thing can be quite deep on an almost spiritual level.”

Digital fashion is also hot as luxury brands scramble to meet the demand for jazzing up avatars by creating virtual dresses you’ll never actually wear and shoes you can’t put on your real-life feet. And no demographic is being ignored.

LA artist Mason Rothschild created a colorful VR spinoff of the ridiculously expensive Birkin bag and some of his virtual MetaBirkins have sold “for as much as the crypto equivalent of £40000 [British pounds]” Elle reported.” Alas Hermes alleges he did so without permission and the company is suing Rothchild in Manhattan federal court for unauthorized use of the Birkin trademark.

Real estate agencies are going as far as acquiring — and selling — virtual land.

Decentraland an online environment where users can exchange cryptocurrencies for 90000 parcels of land has exploded in popularity of late. In November Tokens.com plunked down $2.4 million for a 116-parcel estate in the heart of Decentraland’s Fashion Street district where the company plans to develop a virtual Fifth Avenue. “Rather than try to create a universe like Facebook I said ‘Why don’t we go in and buy the parcels of land in these metaverses and then we can become the landlords?’” Andrew Kiguel the chief executive of Tokens.com told The New York Times.

11 Buying parcels of land in virtual environment Decentraland (above) is becoming increasingly popular.

Doctors are also taking full advantage of the emerging technology.

Surgical residents at UConn Health are donning Oculus headsets and practicing procedures via VR placing pins in virtual broken bones and learning from mistakes before they actually perform any operations.

In June Johns Hopkins neurosurgeons relied on VR during a spinal fusion operation while wearing Augmedics headsets which have a “see-through eye display that projects images of a patient’s internal anatomy such as bones and other tissue based on CT scans” CNBC reported.

“It’s like having a GPS navigator in front of your eyes” said Dr. Timothy Witham director of the Johns Hopkins Neurosurgery Spinal Fusion Laboratory.

Holographic images and VR technology are already helping train first responders in how to treat victims of heart attacks. Military vets are learning to treat their own PTSD by putting on a headset and with a therapist at their side going back and revisiting the moment they were injured or traumatized on the battlefield.

Plastic surgery will also be less of a guessing game Subin said.

“Rather than asking the patient to try to envision what the changes will look like doctors will use digital twin technology synthetic media haptics and robotics to not only illustrate the changes to the patient but also allow the patient to touch the changes. ‘How does your new nose feel?’”

One of the biggest challenges for companies creating the metaverse is figuring out how to engage all five senses.

“The current VR/AR devices mainly support visual audio and haptic feedback” said Hyo Kang a professor of digital arts and sciences at the University of Florida. “And there are a limited number of devices/tools that support simulating smells and tastes.”

The metaverse faces some real-world challenges too.

On Nov. 26 a female beta tester working for Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta reported that she’d been groped by another user in the company’s Horizon World VR platform. “Not only was I groped last night but there were other people there who supported this behavior which made me feel isolated in the Plaza” the woman posted on The Verge.

Vipp Jaswal CEO of the Interpersonal Intelligence Advisory said harassment is likely to become a growing problem because “there’s no police force in the metaverse — it’s totally unregulated. We’re going to have to have systems and controls in place.”

Another potential problem is the wear and tear on users who spend countless hours roaming the metaverse.

Whirling around your house while wearing a headset poses an actual threat she said because you can crash into walls or furniture. “A man in Russia died by being impaled by a glass coffee table” said Allen of Limina Immersive.

She said going in and out of VR also can be disorienting something she’s experienced herself once after tossing off a headset. “I looked at my hands and they weren’t my hands. It was very strange and it took me a few hours to come back to myself.”

Most people involved in the metaverse are optimistic about what’s coming next — and hope for a rapid development of its technology. But they also recognize that not every promising application is right around the corner.

“In building the metaverse we may be facing the most exciting and difficult technical challenge in history” Cozzi of Cesium said.

“In some ways the metaverse is already here but some achievements are on a 10-year horizon and other advancements may be 50 years away.”

Subin agrees.

“If you’re asking when we’ll all be running around like Neo in the Matrix” she said “I think we’re looking a bit further out than 2030.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9nYW1lcy90aGUtY2FyZHMtb2YtcG9rZW1vbi10Y2ctc3VuLW1vb24tdWx0cmEtcHJpc20tcGFydC0xNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Cards Of Pokémon TCG: Sun & Moon – Ultra Prism Part 17,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/games/the-cards-of-pokemon-tcg-sun-moon-ultra-prism-part-17/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9nYW1lcy90aGUtY2FyZHMtb2YtcG9rZW1vbi10Y2ctc3VuLW1vb24tdWx0cmEtcHJpc20tcGFydC0xNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml3bWJ1enouY29tL2dhbWluZy95ZWFyLWVuZGVyLTIwMjEtbW9zdC1wb3B1bGFyLW9ubGluZS1nYW1lcy1vZi10aGUteWVhci8yMDIyLzAxLzA40gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaXdtYnV6ei5jb20vZ2FtaW5nL3llYXItZW5kZXItMjAyMS1tb3N0LXBvcHVsYXItb25saW5lLWdhbWVzLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyLzIwMjIvMDEvMDgvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Year Ender 2021: Most Popular Online Games Of The Year,"Year Ender 2021: Most Popular Online Games Of The Year

Gaming has always been a primary source of entertainment not just for youngsters and teenagers but also for adults. Everyone wants to chill and relax a bit and take some time off from their busy work schedule and that’s when certain popular and engaging games come into play. Over the years the culture of gaming has developed to a great extent. From games for PC and PlayStations we are now in the generation where online ‘multiplayer’ gaming experience is the way to go forward. 2021 has been a great year for the gaming sector as well. So here’s a quick look at some of the best online games that you must try soonest in case you haven’t already.

Apex Legends: As the name itself suggests this game is truly ‘legendary’ not just for the teenage generation but also for young adults. It is a battle royale-hero shooter game that was developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by giants of the gaming industry aka Electronic Arts. It was first released for Microsoft Windows PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in February 2019 and soon it gained prominence in Nintendo Switch in March last year. The best part? You can play it for free and have an enriching time whenever you want.

Call Of Duty: Warzone: If you are someone who gets really excited whenever it comes to volatile war games involving big arms and tankers this is the one that you need to play. The new feature where ‘warzone skin’ turns players partially invisible is also super cool and fun.

Counter Strike: If you are someone who’s extremely interested in having knowledge about arms and ammunition you must have played Counter Strike at some point of time in your life. It is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games in which you get teams of terrorists battling it out in order to perpetrate an act of terror while counter-terrorists try to prevent it. The series began on Windows in 1999 with the release of the first game and ever since then it has certainly come a long way making it one of the most popular in 2021. The fourth game of the series aka ‘Counter Strike: Global Offensive’ is our favourite multiplayer game pick in case you want to try your hands on this for the very first time.

Dota 2: Another one that has to make it in the list for the year 2021 is Dota 2. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment’s Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. It is one of the most addictive multiplayer games and it gives you a nice ‘virtual reality’ experience of living in history and engaging in royal battles. In case you haven’t played it ever download and start ASAP.

Fortnite Battle Royale: This was one of the most engaging and entertaining games of 2021 without any iota of doubt. It was first launched as a companion game to Fortnite: Save The World which was a cooperative survival game with several construction elements. The best part? It comes absolutely free of cost on iOS Android Xbox and if you are someone who enjoys multiplayer experience you better not skip this.

GTA Online: Ever since the time the brand ‘Grand Theft Auto’ was launched it has only gotten bigger and better with every passing year. As far as GTA Online in particular is concerned the old ‘multiplayer’ feature that grabbed attention all over again in the game is what makes it all the way more addictive. You can enjoy this game on your PlayStation and different Xbox 360 and other variants.

League Of Legends: If you are someone who’s too much into battle arena games and you also prefer high-quality graphics this is a must in your list of installed games. As per reports in Wikipedia the game was inspired from ‘Defence Of The Ancients’ a custom map for Warcraft 3 and it has certainly managed to tick all boxes right as far as online games are concerned. The game might have been released way back in 2009 but all thanks to regular updates and new features it continued to be extremely relevant even in 2021.

Pokemon Go: Well this game has been in the headlines for both right and wrong reasons. Pokemon has been an indispensable part of everyone’s childhood who were born in the 90s and no wonder after many years when a game like this came out it became super addictive worldwide. Such was the addiction that we even heard reports of people having car accidents as they were apparently playing the game while driving. The game focuses a lot on the ‘augmented reality’ experience and it is still one of the coolest games to play if you want to simultaneously explore places around you.

PUBG: The name needs no introduction. This has been one of the most popular and fun online games in the last few years and the virtual reality experience has quite literally impressed one and all. With every passing year new modes are launched along with regular updates in order to enhance the gaming experience. So here’s a shout out to all the ‘winners’ does anyone want ‘Chicken’ for dinner?

8 Ball Pool: Last but certainly not the least we have 8 Ball Pool which is by far the biggest and most engaging multiplayer pool game online. No complications regarding what the game is about. It is a plain simple ‘virtual reality’ experience of snooker/billiards and and for anyone who doesn’t have the luxury of playing real pool this is certainly a good one to try out and get your basics sorted in terms of rules and procedures.

Latest clues and hints,"The Masked Singer has returned to our screens and viewers are already desperately trying to figure out who Mushroom is.

Mushroom was the first contestant to perform during Saturday (1 January) night’s opening show during which she treated fans to a tuneful rendition of “It’s Oh So Quiet” by Björk.

In her VT Mushroom spoke with a northern English accent and dropped hints about doing serious work and having a love of trying new things while also holding a gavel.

However when singing she appeared to have a strong Irish accent leaving both the audience and judge Davina McCall convinced that Mushroom must come from Ireland.

A number of names were frequently raised by viewers at home including comedian Aisling Bea.

Many suggested that Mushroom could be one of the Derry Girls while some said that they thought it was actually Siobhán McSweeney who plays Sister Michael behind the mask.

“Watching last night’s Masked Singer... Early guess Mushroom could be Siobhan McSweeny” one Twitter user wrote.

However a number of viewers guessed that it was actually Pauline McLynn who is most famous for playing Mrs Doyle in Father Ted.

“Just catching up on @MaskedSingerUK Mushroom- Pauline McLynn. If it is nice belt” one tweet read.

After the first two shows Mushroom is currently the bookies’ favourite to win the series with odds of 5/1 at Ladbrokes.

According to Betfair Bea is the most likely to be revealed to be behind Mushroom’s costume. You can see the odds below.

Mushroom odds:

Aisling Bea (5/6)

Laura Whitmore (5/2)

Siobhan McSweeney (7/1)

Vicky McClure (10/1)

Rebel Wilson (12/1)

They said their robots had drawbacks such as running away from customers wearing lots of jewelry.

One robot Amy chatted too much to guests so they had to switch off her interactive functions.

Amy Ella Will and Josh work in a restaurant as servers. They bring food to tables interact with guests and from time to time they roll away to recharge their batteries.

All four of them are robots and they're the main attraction at Robotazia a restaurant in Milton Keynes UK.

Even so Robotazia's owners Joy Gittens and Mark Swannell told Insider they'd never replace all their human servers with machines because the robots have a few notable drawbacks.

They run away from guests wearing lots of jewelry

The robots turn around and roll away from guests wearing lots of metal jewelry which has something to do with signals being reflected off the metal.

Amy. Kate Duffy/Insider

""They'll go over to the table for delivery but not let people take their food off the tray and then turn away"" Gittens said.

Gittens and Swannell said they have to first check if customers are wearing lots of jewelry in order for them to ""get the best experience.""

They chat too much

Amy has an interactive function that allows her to respond to customers' questions. ""We turned that off because you would never get a delivery done as she would stay there having conversations"" Gittens said.

The robots which were manufactured in Japan also spoke in ""an odd sort of English which didn't quite make sense"" Swannell said.

Amy who served my meal spoke with a robotic American accent but she didn't ask any questions or respond to mine. Instead she said ""bon appetit"" before heading back to her base.

They give up work when they're hungry

When the robots need to recharge they make a quick exit.

Ella. Kate Duffy/Insider

""If they have had enough and they feel that their charge is going low they tell you they need to recharge"" Gittens said. ""No matter what they're doing they go off and put themselves at their set points"" she said referring to their charging stations.

Amy did this during one of the restaurant's busiest Saturdays Gittens said. Gittens said she made light of the situation by telling guests that ""at least she knows when she needs a recharge.""

The robots are also capable of displaying certain emotions. For example if a customer gets too close a tear appears on the robot's face.

They can't perform some basic tasks

The robots can deliver food on trays but they can't clear tables. They also can't check if a person is old enough to buy alcohol.

Further they can't clean themselves or change their batteries. Gittens and Swannell employ four humans one for each robot to keep them in working order.

The robots are more expensive to employ than human servers Swannell said. This is partly down to maintenance. Swannell said he fixes or tweaks parts on the robots every Tuesday.

They're not human

Swannell and Gittens say they value their human servers. Robotazia's website says ""people are at the core of our business and the hospitality industry.""

Gittens said: ""Human engagement is still a wonderful thing to have. It's the warmth of that person saying 'How are you? Thank you for coming to Robotazia.'""

The three-storey Appleby Drive building has been without central heat for most of the past 10 days as wind chill values outside reached –50. Residents were moved out Thursday to hotels after the fire inspector was called.

Advocates say the problem should have been fixed much sooner.

""It was very hard for them to keep warm. It felt like nobody cared"" said Bwe Doh Soe a local bank employee and volunteer for fellow Karen refugees who fled persecution in Southeast Asia. He offered to translate for some of the Karen apartment residents who spoke to CBC News Saturday afternoon on condition their names were not used.

Residents say the heater began to cut out intermittently several days before Christmas. It was cold but manageable. They first raised concerns with the management of Calgary-based Mainstreet Equity Corp. Dec. 27 when it stopped completely.

Residents say they were given one space heater per unit. They say they were told it would be fixed right away and they should be patient. The small heaters didn't help they said. A couple of residents left and moved in with relatives elsewhere in Saskatoon but most had nowhere else to go they said.

Bwe Doh Soe an advocate for Saskatoon Karen refugees said apartment residents felt no one cared after they were left without heat for much of the recent cold snap. (Zoom)

Management then told them the holidays were making it difficult to find experts and parts for the repairs. A second space heater was distributed but again made little difference they said.

Eventually someone contacted the fire department. They said a fire marshal arrived Tuesday. The building was declared unsafe and residents were moved to various hotels Thursday.

Residents aren't sure when they'll be able to head home.

Saturday afternoon CBC News went to the apartment in Saskatoon's Meadowgreen neighbourhood to see if repair work had begun. A sign on the front door said the building was closed and ""no one is allowed inside until further notice.""

A security guard answered the buzzer. He said he was the only one in the building and directed questions to the Mainstreet site manager for Saskatoon.

That manager referred questions to the company's Calgary office. They declined an interview request but emailed a response saying the ""comfort and safety of our tenants is our highest priority.""

They tried to fix the problem immediately but ""it was impossible to complete this repair within an ideal timeframe due to COVID-caused staffing shortages supply chain delays and continued extreme weather conditions.""

They say they complied with local authorities and moved residents to the hotels giving them gift cards and food.

""We regret and take any disruption in our customers' enjoyment of their homes very seriously"" read the statement.

CBC News asked Mainstreet why it appeared to take more than 10 days to evacuate the residents but no response was received.

Call fire department for help if needed

Saskatoon Fire Department assistant Chief Yvonne Raymer said all residents should feel safe and warm and shouldn't hesitate to call them for help.

She said they weren't notified until Tuesday but have been working with building managers. She said the task was complicated this week by a rear exterior door forced open freezing other pipes.

Raymer said the fire department gets called often to check on apartment temperatures during cold spells but this is the only building that required evacuation. The most recent update showed the temperature was almost at acceptable levels and she said it shouldn't be long before residents can return.

Saskatoon Open Door Society CEO Ali Abukar said he understands the staffing and supply difficulties caused by COVID-19 and the bitter cold snap but said no one in Saskatoon should be forced to endure those conditions.

Abukar said many refugees and low-income Indigenous residents feel they have no voice and are afraid of consequences if they complain. Many landlords are trying hard to provide safe accommodations at a reasonable price but others take advantage of marginalized tenants he said.

""We can't put profit before people"" Abukar said. ""When your heat goes off in weather like this it's unbearable.""",,,,,,,,,

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods processes algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy structured and unstructured data and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains.

Machine learning instead is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.

Data scientist around the world apply machine learning in order to build models able to predict future events cluster people/objects into similar groups and also identify unexpected anomalies.

Every enthusiastic data scientist knows that the most exciting part of machine learning is to choose the coolest algorithm capable of solve the problem of interest (Supervised or Unsupervised). However one crucial part in machine learning is model evaluation and sometimes is dangerously underestimated.

Even though I know that most of data scientists know how to correctly evaluate a model they always tend to use the same (well-known) evaluation metrics. The purpose of this article is to introduce you to two uncommon evaluation metrics for classification: Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and Brier Score (BS). Moreovere I’ll also try to highlight the reasons you should include them in your data science pipeline.

Model evaluation

Model evaluation is the process of assessing how well machine learning models perform the specific tasks they were designed to do — such as predicting the presence or absence of one disease. Whenever you are building a machine learning model at some point you have to evaluate it in order to ensure good results.

Technically speaking model evaluation consists of splitting your set of data into training and test set train you model (i.e. estimate the model parameters) using the training set and then apply some evaluation metrics using the test set.

Of course model metrics differ in case of Unsupervised and Supervised learning and for Supervised learning in case of Regression and Classification problem. However the idea is the same and pretty straightforward:

Despite the type of evaluation metrics you are going to use a model will perform well iff the predicted outcomes are as similar as possible to the real observations.

Since the goal of this article is to introduce you to MCC and Brier Score which are both used in classification problem in the next section I’m going to summarize some of the most used evaluation metrics in this area. Then I’ll explain you why you should really try these two measures as alternative to the classical ones.

Common evaluation metrics

Let’s say that we trained our awesome classification model on the training set and we would like to evaluate how well it performs given new observations (test set). In a typical binary problem for each element of the test set you have a label stating if the element is positive or negative (1 or 0 usually). Your machine learning model provides a prediction for each element in the test set expressing whether it is positive or negative. It will assign each element to one of the following categories: true negatives (TN) true positives (TP) false positive (FP) false negatives (FN). Ideally a model should maximize the number of TP and TN. In this case your model is able to correctly classify as positive the elements that were positive in the test set without generating false negatives and predict as negative the samples that actually were negative in the test set without generating false positives.

As data scientist you know that to prove how well your model behaves you can take advantage of common evaluation metrics that can synthesize the performance of your model with respect to TP TN FP FN. When it’s time to decide which metrics have to be chosen the majority of people choose:

Accuracy: it is the proportion of correct predictions (TP + TN) among the total number of cases examined.

Accuracy ranges in the interval [0; +1] with +1 best value and 0 worst values.

Precision: it is the proportion of correct positive predictions (TP) among the total number of positive predictions made by the model (TP + FP).

Precision ranges in the interval [0; +1] with +1 best value and 0 worst values.

Recall: it is the proportion of correct positive predictions (TP) among the total number of positive samples in the test set (TP + FN).

Recall ranges in the interval [0; +1] with +1 best value and 0 worst values.

F1 score: it is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

F1 ranges in the interval [0; +1] with +1 best value and 0 worst values.

These four metrics are generally used together in order capture the ability of the model to correctly predicts instances. Accuracy is the simplest choice and it useful to get a first idea about the model performance when the the dataset is well balanced (the proportion of positives and negatives tend to a 50:50 ratio or a 60:40 ratio). Precision is a valid choice of evaluation metric when we want to be very sure of our prediction. Recall is a valid choice when we want to capture as many positives as possible. F1 score tries to synthesize precision and recall into a single measure and it is often used for unbalanced problem.

Of course these are not the only metrics out there. Among the most famous there are also:

Balanced accuracy: a sort of accuracy that can be used in case of unbalanced dataset.

a sort of accuracy that can be used in case of unbalanced dataset. Weighted F1 score: an evolution of the classical F1 score which overcomes to the the main problem of F1 score: giving equal weight to precision and recall.

an evolution of the classical F1 score which overcomes to the the main problem of F1 score: giving equal weight to precision and recall. Log Loss: it is generally used to measure the confidence of the model since it is based on the predicted probability.

Moreover data scientist tend to use a lot ROC Curve and its corresponding measure AUC. ROC Curve is a graph showing the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. AUC stands for “Area under the ROC Curve” and it measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (think integral calculus). However giving an complete introduction of ROC and AUC is out of the scope of this article.

Leave your comfort zone and try these evaluation metrics

Having done this preliminary but necessary introduction let’s deep dive into the main goal of this article i.e. introducing two evaluation metrics that are rarely used: Matthews Correlation Coefficient and Brier Score.

Matthews Correlation Coefficient: it is a special case of the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and measures the correlation of the true classes with the predicted labels.

It ranges in the interval [−1+1] with –1 meaning perfect misclassification and +1 perfect classification while MCC=0 basically means random guessing. The main reason I really invite you to considerate this evaluation metric in your data science project is because MCC produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the confusion matrix categories (TP FP TN FN) proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset. This result has been demonstrated by Davide Chicco and Giuseppe Jurman in their paper.

Moreover let’s consider a test set made of 100 elements where 90% of the instances are positives (imbalanced dataset). Now consider these two scenario:

Scenario A → you don’t know the notion of imbalanced classes and you build a fancy model which accidentaly predicts all the element as positive. You came out with the following values: TP=90 FP=10 TN=0 FN=0. With this numbers Accuracy and Precision will be equal to 90% F1 score will be 9474% and Recall will even be equal to 1 which are all pretty good results. Given that the number of TN and FN is equal to 0 also the denomitator of MCC will be 0 and therefore its score will be undefined. This will be a clear signal that your model is going in the wrong direction signal which is not caught by the other metrics.

Scenario B → you decide to build another model because the first one always predicts positive instances. Now the model also predict negative elements and you are facing this situation: TP=80 FP=10 TN=2 FN=8. In this case Accuracy=82% Precision=88.88% F1=89.89% and Recall=90.9% MCC=0.08. Even in this case MCC is the only metric able to capture the inability of the model to correctly predicts instances.

Takeaway 1: include MCC in your evaluation process! It will help you in capture the real ability of the model to correctly predicts instances.

Brier Score: it is an evaluation metric for determining the accuracy of a predicted probability score. BS is the mean squared error applied to predicted probabilities.

Here N is the total number of instances fᵢ is the probability that was forecast and oᵢ the actual outcome of the event at instance i.

The Brier Score always takes on a value between 0 (best value) and 1 (worst value) since this is the largest possible difference between a predicted probability (which must be between zero and one) and the actual outcome (which can take on values of only 0 and 1). Brier Score is similar to Log Loss because it uses probabilities to measure the confidence of your model. However I personally find Brier Score more informative than Log Loss because its formula is much easier to interpret and its range of values is between 0 and 1 while Log Loss doesn’t have an upper bound.

Since as data scientist I work in the Healthcare and Pharma industry it is pivotal to deploy models which are accurate explainable and also confident. Brier Score is the metric that helps me understand if the model is confident or not. If we consider two models which give us the same value of Accuracy or even better the same value of MCC which one should I rely the most? One possible solution is to use Brier Score to see how confident are the two models. Let’s suppose that in your test set you only have 3 instances (please never do this) 2 positive and 1 negative [1 1 0]. The first model predicts the following probabilities with respect to the positive class [0.6 0.55 0.4] while the second predicts [0.8 0.7 0.1]. The BS for the first model is equal to 0.34 while the second one is 0.14. Even if the two models have the same Accuracy or MCC value by evaluating the Brier Score we can conclude that the second one should be prefered because more confident. In short Brier Score rewards you if you know what you’re doing (i.e. give a high probability to a true outcome) and punishes you don’t know what you’re doing (i.e. assign a high probability to a false outcome).

Takeway 2: include Brier Score in your evaluation process! It will help you understand how confident is the model.

Last but not least scikit-learn has both MCC and Brier Score as evaluation metrics while PyCaret only supports MCC and not yet Brier Score.

Conclusions

Matthews Correlation Coefficient and Brier Score are two great metrics that data scientist not always consider. MCC can be used as alternative to the well-known metrics (Accuracy F1 score Precision and Recall) because (a) it is more reliable in case of imbalanced data and (b) it gives a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the confusion matrix categories (TP FP TN FN). BS instead should be an option if you want to measure how confident the model is about your predictions. BS is easier to interpret than the more famous Log Loss due to its range of values and its formula.

It has been a part of the Abilene Independent School District for decades.

But the building formerly known as Reagan Elementary has a new purpose and its new occupants are looking to make the most out of what's available.

The former school building on Hartford Street in west Abilene now renamed to reflect its address as the Hartford Center is the district's home for all things related to professional development.

Gone are the cafeteria and gymnasium. They're now large-capacity conference rooms where teachers can come for their learning needs.

""The district has needed its own dedicated space for this"" said Ketta Garduno associate superintendent for curriculum and instruction. ""In the past we'd ended up farming out to other buildings in the district. This gives us our own dedicated space.""

That's only a portion of the old school facility though. There's another piece to the puzzle that is Hartford Center. And it's a public-facing one with implications for thousands of school children and their families.

New home same service

Darrin Cox was running out of room in the basement of One AISD Center.

There Cox maintained an elaborate storage room filled with any number of supplies for children. Clothing racks filled with sweatshirts and pants filled a room lined with shelves of sneakers and other shoes. All items in any size that a student at the district could need.

There were also other supplies such as notebooks pens and pencils scissors and glue. And backpacks to put them in.

Those materials aren't available for just any student though. Cox is in charge of the district's response to homeless students as classified under the federal McKinney-Vento Act. There's a process by which students and families qualify for Cox's assistance.

What started a few years ago in a tiny closet next to his office in the federal programs division of the district's administration building has outgrown two large rooms in the underground area of the former downtown shopping mall.

Taking over what was originally the administrative offices of the former Reagan Elementary along with a few of the classrooms closest to Hartford Street Cox now has more room to spread out and improve the experience for those coming to either request his services or repeat.

""Here what's nice about this new space: one of classrooms can be almost a welcome center for those coming in"" Cox said. ""We have some booklets available. It's ... very welcoming. Our families who've used it already stress to me how welcoming it is.""

Room enough for you

In addition to the welcome space Cox said his new location offers three main rooms filled to the brim with supplies.

The first he said will focus primarily on the middle school experience. With those schools requiring standardized dress every piece of the uniform is available in many different sizes. Both for boys and girls.

This room also will have physical education clothing so that students requiring his services won't be without more athletic options during gym classes. Hygiene packs including toothbrushes and toothpaste along with underwear and socks — the two most requested items in his entire store — round out the room's contents.

In room No. 2 other clothing items are available. From jeans and slacks — part of Cox's mission is to make sure his older students have clothing that can help them secure jobs — to all kinds of shirts there's plenty of clothing options available Cox said.

Options are even available for infants he said both for children of homeless students and for families who have newly born siblings.

And the last room?

That's for the feet he said.

""The last room is the shoe room"" Cox said. ""And they're all new shoes ... 99.9% of them are new shoes.""

Last year Cox said his office helped about 1400 students. So far this year the number is about 820. So the extra space is pretty handy.

The shoe room will split space with the array of jackets and coats though as those items didn't fit in the other rooms.

One final room not accessible to the public is the new storage space Cox said. Offering a place to hold items that are essentially excess until the products out on display can be moved out to students it's massive.

""It's as big as our entire storage area I had plus half of the show room at (One AISD Center)"" Cox said.

Thinking ahead

Garduno meanwhile has the end of February circled on her calendar.

That is when the building's other use will get its first huge test.

Though the professional learning programs such as engage2learn's teacher training programs have been operating out of the space since it reopened in the fall there haven't been district-wide events.

More:Abilene ISD standardized testing shows good many bad results from 2020-21

Come Feb. 23 Garduno will know whether the plan works.

""One of the challenges is parking"" Garduno said. 'We're having to look at how can we economically meet our parking needs. There are only 100 spots right now. We need a lot more than that. Maybe we'll use Clack's parking lot. But we're thinking outside the box to try to solve these problems and make sure we're fully utilizing our facility.""

A facility like this one aimed at providing teachers with a dedicated space for their own learning and professional development is an important piece in Garduno's arsenal she said.

It gives coaches a place to call their own with dedicated space for their materials. But it also offers a clear path to getting back to helping teachers become their best professional selves.

Garduno said that was one of the best parts of being a campus principal once she left the classroom behind and entered administration.

""When I was a campus principal one of the things I enjoyed the most was working with teachers including younger teachers who were just out of school"" Garduno said. ""I have missed that day-to-day interaction with those teachers.

""I believe we need to prepare our teachers with the tools they need and by investing in them we are going to be able to prepare our teachers well. Our local universities do fantastic jobs but the field of education is constantly changing. It's our responsibility to help the teachers with what they need. This facility gives us the opportunity to support those teachers.""

One of the biggest pieces evolving the most is technology.

The staff at the center will be well equipped both with the latest products such as applications and the hardware needed to run them Garduno said.

The center has a dedicated computer lab along with 16 rooms for professional learning. Hartford Center also has four mock classrooms where the district's educators can practice what they've seen before taking it to their classrooms.

Gym and cafeteria spaces are also available with 180 seats each as well for the big gatherings.

Out of the dungeon

Because the majority of space on the ground floor of One AISD Center is taken up with offices there were few options in the building for extra things.

Like Cox's homeless students operation or trainings like new teacher orientation in August.

""(We're) not downstairs where it's dark"" Cox said.

""We've done a lot of work using our people"" Garduno added. ""We've put in a lot of work making sure (Hartford Center) is inviting that it's clean.""

Cox's roughly 25 volunteers who help him maintain the stock and appearance of his operation probably appreciate not having to be downstairs practically by themselves he said.

It'll likely make all the difference in the world to anyone even the folks using the service he said.

In a January 06 notice published on the Ministry of Natural Resources website the government invited bids for consultancy services for the review and evaluation of the Field Development Plan (FDP) for the Yellowtail development.

The Yellowtail project is ExxonMobil and partners’ fourth development in the Stabroek Block and is considered the largest undertaking since Guyana became an oil-producing nation. As part of the Yellowtail Project ExxonMobil plans to drill between 40 and 67 wells for the 20-year duration of the investment. It is intended to be the largest of the four developments with over 250000 barrels of oil per day targeted once production commences. Based on the schedule once approval is granted engineering commences in 2022 and production in the latter part of 2025.

Exxon through Environmental Resource Management (ERM) applied to the EPA for an environmental permit to operate in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana. They have since submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and other ancillary documents as part of the process as well as holding public consultations. The statutory period for the public to submit objections expired last month and since then the EPA and the Environmental Assessment Board have been silent as to what the next move will be.

A number of environmentalists and groups submitted objections to the EIA noting that the company fails to address a number of impacts on the environment. Also questions were raised about ERM’s ties to Exxon since it is the same company that did all of Exxon’s EIAs.

In the letter of invitation the Ministry of Natural Resources said that it has received a budgetary allocation part of which it intends to apply for the procurement of consultative services for the Yellowtail project inviting firms to submit technical and financial proposals for the review and evaluation of the FDP.

It added that the purpose of the consultancy is to conduct an in-depth review of the Yellowtail FDP which includes all supporting and reference documentation along with the related environmental and social impact assessments (ESIA) submitted by Exxon and its partners; prepare a report setting out the opinions formed in the evaluation of the FDP and ESIA addressing at minimum compliance or non-compliance with the requirements of the existing legislative and contractual framework particularly the Petroleum (Explora-tion and Production) Act 1986 and the Environmental Protection Act 1996 the Petroleum Agreement and international best practices and industry standards including any deficiencies unresolved issues and areas of additional assessments or technical analysis that the GoG should request from the Licensees before making a determination on the FDP; and support the ministry’s engagements and information exchanges with the Licensees.

Additionally the successful firm would be required to document the field development review process and outcomes including references to international best practices and industry standards in a manner and format to support future reference for similar review exercises and overall improvement of the FDP review process while also supporting the ministry in drafting the Yellowtail Petroleum Production License.

The proposals are to be submitted to the National Procurement and Tender Administration Board (NPTAB) no later than 09:00h on January 20.

Responsive

The contract would be awarded to the lowest responsive bidder provided that they have met the minimum qualification score of 70 points after evaluation. Proposals will be evaluated in a two-stage manner commencing with the evaluation of technical proposals and allocation of merit points and ranking of technical proposals. The ministry said that only those bidders whose technical proposals attain the 70 points minimum would have the financial aspect of their proposal be evaluated.

Based on the evaluation criteria 10 points is for the firm’s general experience in the disciplines forming part of the total assignment with specific reference to experience in Guyana or in similar contexts; 30 points for the adequacy and quality of the proposed work plan and the approach and methodology proposed to implement the TOR; and 60 points for the qualifications experience and competence of the team of key personnel proposed for the assignment.

In relation to key personnel the bidders are expected to have a team comprising of a leader with a minimum qualification of a Master’s degree in petroleum engineering geology or similar discipline along with over 15 years of relevant experience. Other members of the team include a geologist reservoir expert drilling expert subsea/ pipeline operations surface facilities expert economist gas specialist and oil and gas lawyer – all with a minimum of 10 years’ experience in the relevant fields.

“It is estimated that approximately fifty (50) days of service will be required for the assignment. You should therefore base your financial proposal on this figure. However you should feel free to submit your proposal on the basis of man-days considered necessary by you to undertake the assignment. You are required to hold your proposal valid for 120 days from the date of submission during which period you will maintain without change your proposed price. The Procuring Entity is expected to finalize the agreement within this period” the bidding document states.

Further the Ministry stated that it anticipates that negotiations with the selected firm would commence on February 01 with the project starting around February 7. It said that negotiations will only be held if the technical proposal attains the required minimum score adding that firms must be prepared to furnish the detailed cost break-down and other clarifications to the proposals submitted.

Upon successful negotiation the contract would be awarded if not the process would be repeated with the next suitable bidder.

The ministry said that it would dedicate a focal person for the consultant to work with in an effort to achieve its deliverables. Based on the work schedule the consultant would have to provide the ministry with an inception report inclusive of the work plan and schedule for the review of the FDP and ESIA and on-the-job training one week after the contract is signed. In its fourth week the firm would have to provide an FDP review and Draft Evaluation Report of its findings including any particulars related to supporting the drafting of the Yellowtail Petroleum Production License such as conditions schedules; and after the sixth week it would be mandated to produce the final FDP Review Report including any particulars related to supporting the finalisation of the Yellow-tail Petroleum Production License such as conditions schedules etcetera.

“All deliverables in electronic and printed copies will be required in English and will be submitted to the Client for review and approval within the deadlines established. It is expected that certain deliverables may require several drafts to incorporate comments by MNR and any other relevant stakeholders before they are determined to be final” the ministry states.

The ministry further added that the objective of the consultancy is to provide advisory services technical support and training services to the government through the Ministry of Natural Resources and the sector regulator – the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission (GGMC) or the Petroleum Commission (PC) once established – with the aim of enhancing the country’s core capacity to review approve and authorize Field Development Plan(s).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmliYmVhbm5hdGlvbmFsd2Vla2x5LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy91cy1lbmVyZ3ktZ2lhbnQtZGlzY292ZXJzLXlldC1tb3JlLW9pbC1pbi1ndXlhbmEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Energy Giant discovers yet more oil in Guyana,"United States Energy giant ExxonMobil says it has made two more oil discoveries in the Stabroek block offshore the South American CARICOM country of Guyana.

The discoveries add to the previously announced oil estimates for the block of 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels.

The U.S corporation said it struck the high-quality oil and hydrocarbon-bearing sandstone reservoirs at the Fangtooth-1 and Lau Lau-1 wells in the block off Guyana which is a location that remains as one of ExxonMobil’s priority sites for future exploration and production.

“Both discoveries increase our understanding of the resource our continued confidence in the block’s exploration potential and our view that the many discoveries to date could result in up to 10 development projects” said Mike Cousins senior vice president of exploration and new ventures at ExxonMobil.

Meanwhile Guyana’s Natural Resources Minister Vickram Bharrat said the government “remains confident” that these two additional discoveries which add to the 26 commercially feasible finds will further strengthen Guyana’s position as a country with world-class discoveries of high-quality hydrocarbon.

“Therefore the government will continue engaging all stakeholders towards the exponential development of these resources for all Guyanese while maintaining a social economic and environmental balance.

“In addition the government of Guyana is continually examining possibilities to strengthen oversight and management of the exploration programmes of all operators to further expand the sector through commercial discoveries” Bharrat said.

However the discoveries came in the wake of many including the Guyanese-Diaspora group expressing dissatisfaction at late last year’s passing of the Guyana Natural Resource Fund Act without consultation with the parliamentary opposition or other civil society stakeholders.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9hb2EuY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3Mvb2N0ZWNocy1zcGFya3MtaW50ZXJlc3QtaW4tc2FmZXR5LWNhcmVlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OCTECHS sparks interest in safety career,"Interest in health and safety has transformed Genesis Batie’s life and career path.

Batie who recently graduated from Odessa College with a bachelor of applied arts and sciences in leadership is now working for the Texas Department of Health Services as a sanitarian environmental specialist. She also took a degree in occupational safety and environmental technology.

“I go out and I inspect businesses to make sure that they’re following all the protocols and regulations that OSHA puts into place. And I make sure there’s no hazards in the workplace make sure all the foods … are up to date to make sure everybody doesn’t get sick …” to help prevent food borne illnesses Batie said.

The 21-year-old Odessa native has only been with the state health department’s Midland office for a short time but she said it has been difficult because of COVID.

“… We want to ensure that it’s okay our workplaces are safe and everything is all up to date. … We really … try to encourage the employees around us to follow your handwashing protocols make sure you wear a mask. Of course not everybody is going to want to wear a mask but we try to teach the importance of wearing a mask because … a lot of the diseases and things that people catch are mainly airborne. A lot of it can get into foods. It can cause people to get sick and even can contaminate other areas around us even apart from our food like the utensils we eat with the surfaces that we lay our food on. … A little bit of everything (can) contribute to food borne illness so it’s very important that you follow those protocols” Batie said.

Acknowledging that it can make you paranoid Batie said the health department’s job is to make sure everybody is following the rules.

“And we really do try to encourage them. We often go in to inspect; we try to let them know we’re there to work with them and (not) there to criticize the business or give any negative feedback. We’re there to help them sustain the best business they can and follow that into supporting their customers to keep the business up and running” Batie added.

Along with visiting restaurants she also will be going to schools and youth camps. Her territory will cover an area from around Crane to El Paso.

She is expected to take a state board exam at the end of January to become certified. As soon as she does that she can travel all over the region.

“A lot of that falls back into play apart from the food borne illnesses just making sure the overall environment (is) free from hazards …”

For example if she was going to a childcare facility she would make sure there were no cleaning supplies on the counter or food that’s not stored properly which could cause someone to get sick.

“We really try to make sure that they know what foods need to be stored where and the exact temperatures that they need to … keep those types of bacteria and viruses under control” Batie said.

She got interested in occupational safety and environmental technology by attending Odessa Career & Technical Early College High School (OCTECHS) one of Ector County ISD’s early college high schools where students can earn a high school diploma and associate degree at the same time.

“… At the time I didn’t know anything about OSHA I was actually going to be a business major. And after being there for about a month that gave us the opportunity to tour around to see what other programs are offered. Well one of them happened to be OSET. When I got there I got a better in-depth (idea) of what they stand for how they like to protect others and the importance of maintaining the safety and health standards. When I got there and I started doing the classes I found it very interesting. And I thought I want to be a part of the change. I want to try to make sure everybody has a right to a safe work environment because it’s very important in order to keep our businesses up and running. So that’s what really pushed me to start looking out for jobs and … more opportunity where I can really show how I can contribute to changing how the safety world works” Batie said.

No one in Batie’s family has experience in health and safety but she said she was inspired by Jessica Jordan department chair of OSET at Odessa College.

Jordan had decades of experience in the safety field and is now in her sixth year with Odessa College.

Jordan said Batie started off as a shy quiet very reserved young woman. But over the years she blossomed into “a very well spoken young lady and then she moved into our bachelor’s degree and it just took off from there.”

“She thinks about safety and sees things in safety the way some of us that have been in the field for years. She looks at everything very critically and she’s just an amazing student. I think her going to work for the health department is just absolutely fabulous. She’s going to do an amazing job for them” Jordan said.

Jordan added that she thinks the world of Batie and that she has built up confidence over the years to emerge from her quietness.

“… I can’t say enough good about her. If there was one student in my career that I look back and go wow I am so proud of her it’s Genesis. The amazing growth that I have seen in that girl in the last four years it just blows me away” Jordan said.

Something she enjoys about her job is meeting new people from all different cultures and professions.

She added that a lot of the skills she has learned can be applied to other businesses as well.

Batie said she thought the program at OC was really good.

“I think it’s a really good opportunity. A lot of kids today due to not only certain situations … when it comes to money and opportunity they don’t really have the tools and stuff available out there for them to find in order to go higher with their education. I feel like programs like OCTECHS really help establish a foundation for younger generations to go out there and try to continue to push further with the education because it’s very important now especially with our economy growing as fast as it is to really have the tools needed to pursue education of any sort” Batie said.

She said getting a BAAS degree was a key to advancing in her career but it wasn’t only the degree that helped.

“I would really say just the program itself because it really helped me get a head start because when I graduated with my high school diploma I also graduated with my associate’s and that’s what really helped me get the push and kept me motivated to continue …” Batie said.

She added that it’s rewarding to have completed a bachelor’s degree in a short time at OC.

“I feel really accomplished because when I first started I was a little nervous because I … wasn’t really thinking about what I was getting myself into. I thought it was going to be kind of like (a)… piece of cake type of thing. It actually was some work. I had my work cut out for me but as time (went) on I became more confident. I really took my education seriously and I wanted to show others that it’s possible that to go out there …” Batie said.

At the time she was 18 but she was able to do what she needed to do.

“It was a really really great feeling of accomplishment” she added.

Batie has a younger sister and she tried to encourage her to attend OCTECHS but she loves sports which the early college high schools don’t offer.

“So she decided she was going to stay at OHS and continue to her sports over there. She loves soccer so she’s trying to get a scholarship” Batie said.

This short vid isn't about the car though it's about the 6.6-liter twin-turbocharged pushrod V8 that's been nicknamed ""Fury."" The forged steel block is paired with aluminum pistons heads and intake manifold. Those and other ancillaries work together to produce a peak 1817 horsepower at 8000 rpm just 200 rpm short of redline and a peak 1193 pound-feet of torque at 5500 rpm with at least 1000 of those torques available from 2000 to 8000 rpm. Most importantly this is the powerplant that Hennessey will use to try and crack 300 miles per hour.

If doing so were only a matter of ponies the Texas tuner should have the case wrapped up. The Venom sits roughly 200 hp above the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ which has cracked the triple ton and the Koenigsegg Jesko that also aspires to. On top of that the Venom F5 at 2998 pounds weighs 1363 pounds less than the Bugatti 133 pounds less than the Jesko. No matter what happens at the far end of the speedometer specs like a claimed a 0-62 mph time of less than 3 seconds and a 0-124 mph time of less than 5 seconds should be safe bets. Handling won't be neglected either with famed GM engineer John Heinricy signed on to help fine tune the car's driving dynamics.

We're still waiting to see the whole car out on test which should happen imminently if it hasn't already. There will be 24 hardtop examples to come off the line 12 for the U.S. and 12 for overseas each with a price of about $1.6 million.

Imane ‘Pokimane’ Anys has come out in defense of her Twitch ban explaining why it’s “totally fair” she was whacked with a site suspension for watching Avatar and other popular TV series in the last few days.

Twitch has been awash with one thing these past few days: the controversial “TV show” meta where stars flick on long-running series for their entire streams.

Streamers have been watching everything from Gordon Ramsay’s cooking shows to iconic anime franchises like Naruto Food Wars ⁠— one choice Pokimane quickly realized was a mistake ⁠— and Hunter x Hunter and cult show Avatar The Last Airbender the last of which got Pokimane banned.

That shock January 8 ban set the fox among the chickens.

While many declared it “the end of Twitch” banned star Pokimane has actually come out in support of her suspension claiming it was the right thing to do.

Anys who was freed from her 48-hour suspension late on January 9 shocked many by supporting her ban soon after she was blocked from the streaming site.

In fact she was firmly in Amazon’s camp for the whole affair.

The Twitch streamer said she “wasn’t surprised” by her suspension and went on to admit she doesn’t think it is “unfair” either ⁠— it was actually something she was expecting to happen sooner rather than later.

Pokimane’s now-controversial January 8 stream where she watched Avatar The Last Airbender for more than six hours in a row was the first time the Twitch star had joined the TV meta in any major way.

She hit a 30.9k viewer highwater-mark and streamed in ‘Just Chatting.’ Ironically her stream title was “We’re finally gonna do it… hopefully nothin crazy happens.”

Nickelodeon / Netflix The star’s 48-hour ban was due to several Avatar The Last Airbender DMCA claims.

Pokimane is expected to return to her regular Twitch streaming schedule on Monday January 10 where she plans to address everything regarding the “TV meta” her suspension and future broadcast plans.

FRT,Federal Realty,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAxLzA5L2JldHRlci1idXktZmVkZXJhbC1yZWFsdHktaW52ZXN0bWVudC10cnVzdC12cy1yZWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: Federal Realty Investment Trust vs. Realty Income,"Both are good buys. A big determiner is how you want your dividends delivered.

Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) and Realty Income (O 0.64%) have a lot in common that commends them to investors as long-term buy and holds.

They're both real estate investment trusts (REITs) which requires that pay at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. They generate that income from their commercial real estate portfolios counting on their tenants to provide real estate investors with a steady flow of cash and share price appreciation over a period of years.

Notice I said years. What makes Federal Realty and Realty Income such compelling choices is their venerability matched by performance. Both are Dividend Aristocrats which means they're among the 65 members of the Standard & Poor's 500 that have raised dividends for 25 straight years or more. Federal Realty goes a step further. It's one of the 31 companies meriting the title of Dividend King bestowed for 50 straight years of payout increases.

Below we'll look a bit deeper at each of their portfolios and performance.

Realty Income is an 11000-pound giant among retail REITs

Realty Income with a market value of about $40 billion is by far the larger of the two with about 11000 properties under long-term net-lease contracts with 650 different clients in all 50 states the U.K. and Spain. Net-lease contracts require tenants to pay most of a property's operating costs.

Dollar General and Dollar Tree-Family Dollar account for 1462 of those leases and 7.5% of the REIT's rental revenue. 7-Eleven (592 leases) and Walgreen's (246 leases) meanwhile individually account for 5.7% and 5% of rent revenue respectively. Then there's FedEx with only 42 leases but 3.4% of total rent.

As for performance Realty Income has posted annualized dividend growth of 4.5% since joining the NYSE in 1994. Its record actually goes back to 1969 when it was created to provide monthly dividends to shareholders long before it went public.



Realty Income calls itself the ""Monthly Dividend Company"" and right now that payout is $0.246 a share every month good for a yield of about 4.1% based on its recent share price of about $71.

Federal Realty is smaller but also mighty

Federal Realty has a market cap of about $10.7 billion one fourth that of Realty Income and a much smaller footprint. Instead of casting such a wide net Federal Realty focuses on what it calls ""award-winning retail environments and mixed-use neighborhoods in the nation's most desirable markets.""

It has 106 properties with about 3100 commercial real estate (CRE) tenants and about 3200 residential units concentrated in coastal markets such as Washington D.C. Boston San Francisco Los Angeles Chicago and Phoenix.

Federal Realty which pays its dividend four times a year raised its quarterly payout by a penny to $1.07 a share last summer continuing a string of 54 annual increases the longest in the REIT industry. That's good for a yield of about 3.15% based on the recent share price of about $135.



Realty Income has the total return lead and gets the nod here

As an income-focused investor I like to look at total return taking into account dividends and share price growth. Realty Income is the clear winner here as $10000 invested in its stock 10 years ago would now be worth about $32000 compared with about $21000 for Federal Realty.https://ycharts.com/charts/fund_chart_creator/fool/#/?annotations=&annualizedReturns=false&calcs=i[…]=&title=&units=false&useEstimates=false&zoom=10

Realty Income and Federal Realty are both widely held widely respected members of the real estate sector and for good reason. They both have long records of reliable paybacks and decent returns making them ideal candidates for a retiree's portfolio.

As for looking ahead Federal Realty has increased its 2022 forecast for funds from operations (FFO) per diluted share from an estimated $5.45-$5.50 for 2021 to $5.65-$5.85 for 2022 Realty Income meanwhile says it has invested in $1.61 billion in 308 properties and properties under development or expansion including $532.5 million in Europe.

Those are just two of the metrics that point to continued solid returns from these two dividend stalwarts. Stocks like these are often viewed by individual investors as an alternative to low-yielding bonds cash and certificates of deposit. Either of these two will do that just fine.

A big choice is whether you prefer the payout monthly or quarterly of course but there's more. Realty Income's higher yield and stronger returns and its significant investment in revenue growth gives it an edge over its worthy competitor.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Located on a 33-acre site the 251000 square-foot facility is slated to open in fall 2022 according to the Bay Economic Development Alliance. The regional headquarters is being built at the Panama City Port Authority's Intermodal Distribution Center on U.S. Highway-231 in Panama City roughly 107 miles from Tallahassee.

FedEx which has an average of 18 million packages per day and generated $69.2 billion annual revenue in fiscal 2020 was attractive to the site since it has access to major highways and its proximity to customers' distribution centers the Alliance indicated.

“They could have gone anywhere in the Panhandle but they chose us because we had a shovel-ready certified site” Becca Hardin president of the Bay County Economic Development Alliance told the Panama City News Herald. ""It’s a huge capital investment.”

Pleasant,"A locally owned bookstore will soon be coming to downtown Mt. Pleasant.

Jennifer and Riley Justis the owners of Sleepy Dog Books plan to open an official bookstore at 120 E. Broadway Street around the end of April or beginning of May.

Both Jennifer and Riley Justis have studied at Central Michigan University and were both interested in bringing a bookstore to Mt. Pleasant as they’ve felt there is a need for a bookstore in the area.

“It’s been a lifelong dream of mine and my wife’s to open a bookstore” Riley Justis said. “We’re both avid readers and we’ve researched and worked with different lenders.”

Sleepy Dog Books will feature a variety of books from different genres as well as different products from different Michigan based businesses. Some of the products includes cards socks bookmarks and candles among other items.

The couple were able find a lease for a downtown location and have just taken over the lease for the shop at the beginning of 2022. Currently the Justis’ are working on painting the shop and they will soon be adding custom bookshelves.

Sleepy Dog Books has also been able to obtain grant opportunities to further help their business.

This includes Michigan Women Forward’s ’53 Voices’ pitch challenge which is sponsored by Fifth Third Bank where women entrepreneurs can submit a short pitch and receive grant money for their businesses. Jennifer Justis being the primary owner of Sleepy Dog Books came in 3rd place during the competition and received $1000 in grant money.

To further promote Sleepy Dog Books a pop-shop was available to community members during the Downtown Holiday Market in December. The bookstore will also be holding other pop-up shops before the official opening of the store.

While the community waits for Sleepy Dog Books to officially opens a bookstore downtown the store has an online shop where customers can order books to be sent to their homes. The store is powered by Bookshop.org which supports locally owned bookstores.

“We’ve had an extremely positive response from the community” Justis said. “We’re excited with following we’ve gained on social media.”

The company positions it as a high-grade headset for on-the-go use. It garnered some notice at CES 2022 this week and is set to launch this spring though with no word on pricing.

Blue Tiger's Solare headset uses a Powerfoyle solar cell headband to stay continually charged under indoor and outdoor lighting. Blue Tiger designed it for constant use while driving.

According to Exeger Urbanista and Adidas also have solar-powered headphones that use its Powerfoyle technology. Cycling apparel company POC uses Powerfoyle for the solar-powered integrated lights in its bicycle helmet as well.

The Solare features 97 percent noise canceling can operate at between minus-40 and 122 degrees Fahrenheit and uses Bluetooth 5.1 with a range of 300 feet. It's compatible with Siri and Google Assistant. Blue Tiger also claims the headset meets the MIL-STD-810 military specification for ruggedness in extreme environments but that doesn't necessarily mean it has gone through actual military testing.

The CES 2022 Innovation Awards recognized Solare as an honoree calling it a military-grade headset running on sustainable energy.

Throughout the developing world family members — usually women and children — commonly walk long distances to natural water sources to fill up bottles and jerrycans.

These water bodies can be contaminated by anything from feces to chemicals and cause diseases ranging from cholera diarrhea and dysentery to hepatitis A typhoid and polio.

To help address this the Alumor company has developed an appliance that it calls Miriam’s Well after the miracle source that according to Jewish tradition provided water to the Israelites throughout their 40 years in the wilderness.

Powered by solar energy the modern Miriam’s Well requires no electric socket.

It is fitted with advanced ultraviolet technology that kills viruses and bacteria to US National Sanitation Foundation standards and it contains a filter that needs rinsing just a few times a year.

Alumor’s business development director David Waimann a cleantech entrepreneur and trained engineer originally from the UK told The Times of Israel that household members will simply connect the device to a jerrycan or other container via a pipe and press a button.

The device is lightweight uses just four watts of electricity and purifies each liter of water for less than half a cent he said.

It therefore avoids problems that have dogged other water purification systems in the developing world such as a need for professional maintenance backup replacement parts and accessories or materials such as chlorine which are not always easy to find.

Alumor’s designer and chief technical officer Eldad Maziel formerly worked for the Strauss Group brand Tami4 one of Israel’s most popular suppliers of countertop water purification appliances.

CEO Dr. Yacov Malinovich is a physicist with other team members including a hydrologist and an entrepreneur Yosef Abramowitz who built Israel’s first solar energy field and is helping with marketing.

Identifying a potential market of 250 million households Alumor is hoping to sell its devices at cost through nonprofit organizations.

It has completed the product development stage thanks to a government grant and prize and now seeks $1 million to fine-tune the device increase its purification capacity from one liter to two liters per minute pilot it and begin first series production.

According to World Health Organization figures (from 2017) 144 million people collect untreated surface water from lakes ponds rivers and streams with 435 million people taking their water from unprotected wells and springs.

Chances are of course it’s abundant in the Universe only we haven’t been able to detect it.

There are a number of ingredients that have to be present on a planet to give birth to life as we know it based on carbon. Chemically there’s got to be carbon (duh!) nitrogen phosphorus sulfur among others. You also have to have a sun just at the right distance away from the planet enough asteroid stability in the region to safeguard the existence of life and enough time for all of those chemical elements to come together in just the right way.There are however two elements that not only have to be present separately but must also combine to form water. In fact this liquid that comes to be thanks to the relationship between hydrogen and oxygen is perhaps the most important one for the existence of life again as we know it.Until not long ago although we knew of the existence of hydrogen and oxygen out there people have been reluctant in saying for sure water is a given in our solar system let alone the Universe. Yet now NASA not only acknowledges the existence of water it said from as far back as 2015 “the Solar System and beyond is awash” in it.According to the agency its missions deep into the solar system “have provided a wave of amazing findings related to water in recent years” giving the people doing this for a living hope “we may very well finally answer whether we are alone in the solar system and beyond.""Although direct observation of water has not been achieved so far NASA says signs of it are everywhere from the giant molecular clouds between the stars to the disks of material of newborn planetary systems and in the atmospheres of giant planets.Generally speaking water is only present in the form of either ice or vapor but there are a few places out there we know of with a degree of certainty to possess liquid water under the surface like Ceres a dwarf planet located in the Asteroid Belt and some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn namely Ganymede  Europa Callisto Enceladus and Titan.Closer to home in places that are utterly hostile to life like the first planet from the Sun Mercury signs of water were discovered in permanently shadowed craters. The same kind of locations on the Moon are thought to contain it as well.Mars the planet that is without a doubt the one we’ll be visiting first as a race once we’re capable had abundant water sometime in the past – studies show it had enough water for an ocean one mile deep (1.6 km) and large enough to occupy half of the northern hemisphere.Although it lost all of the thing in liquid form some of it remains as ice at the poles and possibly even underground.So what does the knowledge of that much water being available all over the place does for us?First NASA says finding water distributed like this helps us better understand how everything around us even Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago.Then given how it’s believed the solar system was extremely hot in its early days preventing water from condensing into a liquid it’s probable water was brought here by asteroids and other pieces of floating rocks.

CLEVELAND — Entering the 2022 offseason Jarvis Landry stands out as one of the Cleveland Browns' likeliest salary cap casualties.

But if the 5-time Pro Bowl wide receiver is playing in his final home game at FirstEnergy Stadium on Sunday he's already made it a memorable one.

While the 7-9 Browns have already been eliminated from postseason contention that didn't stop several of Cleveland's key players -- including Landry -- from playing in the team's regular-season finale vs. the Cincinnati Bengals. And if there was any question about the Browns' effort in a seemingly meaningless game it appeared to disappear on Cleveland's third offensive drive of the game.

Starting in place of quarterback Baker Mayfield who is preparing to undergo offseason shoulder surgery backup Case Keenum engineered a six-play 79-yard drive which culminated with Landry catching a 26-yard touchdown pass to give the Browns a 7-0 lead. The touchdown catch marked Landry's second of the season although the LSU product also scored on a pair of rushing touchdowns.

Currently in his fourth season in Cleveland Landry is scheduled to enter the season of the five-year $75.5 million contract he signed with the Browns after being traded from the Miami Dolphins in 2018. Cleveland however has the ability to save $15.1 million by waiving the 30-year-old Landry which would result in just $1.5 million in dead cap money.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vcGhpbnBoYW5hdGljLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzA5L2Jha2VyLW1heWZpZWxkLW1ha2VzLW5vLXNlbnNlLW1pYW1pLWRvbHBoaW5zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baker Mayfield makes no sense for the Miami Dolphins,Next.

And the last time the Eastern Conference powers had met was in the regular-season opener at Fiserv Forum which was a dominating Bucks victory on their championship ring night.

Friday’s game had a much different feel in that there was a lack of “big game” energy in the arena but the result was the same in a 121-109 Bucks victory.

The Bucks have now won four straight regular-season games over the Nets.

Box score:Bucks 121 Nets 109

More:Milwaukee Bucks point guard Jrue Holiday enters NBA's COVID-19 protocol

Milwaukee led throughout and pushed their margin to as many as 24 when the starters were on the court and looked confident throughout despite the Nets cutting it to 13 early in the fourth quarter.

Both teams were without their star point guards as Milwaukee’s Jrue Holiday entered the league’s health and safety protocol Thursday and Brooklyn’s Kyrie Irving isn’t allowed to play home games due his vaccination status. Assistant Darvin Ham once again was the acting head coach for the Bucks as Mike Budenholzer remained in the league’s health and safety protocol and he had to manage a backcourt that was without starters Holiday and Grayson Allen along with reserves Donte DiVincenzo George Hill and Pat Connaughton.

To help offset that loss of talent in the backcourt the Bucks added guards Langston Galloway and Jeff Dowtin on 10-day hardship contracts before the game. It was also the first game the Bucks played since releasing DeMarcus Cousins.

Despite those personnel challenges star power remained for Milwaukee as Giannis Antetokounmpo returned from a one-game absence due to illness to pair with Khris Middleton and the duo shined brighter than the pair of Durant and James Harden to help the Bucks improve to 26-15 overall. Brooklyn dropped to 24-13.

The next time the two teams will meet is Feb. 26 in Milwaukee and Irving will be able to play.

“Huge win” Ham said. “We won the battle today but this war is far from over with that club on the other side. That’s a top level elite basketball club that we faced tonight. It happened to be our night tonight but this saga will indeed continue.”

The Bucks head to Charlotte to take on the 20-19 Hornets on Saturday night.

Despite early foul trouble Antetokounmpo finished with 31 points nine assists and seven rebounds while Middleton heated up after a slow start to finish with 20 points. Middleton who also drew the assignment of defending Harden and had increased ball-handling responsibilities added six rebounds and five assists.

“It brought me back to my high school days a little bit playing straight up point guard” Middleton said with a smile. “Just trying to organize the team make sure everybody’s in the right spots just making sure we get a good shot down.

""Giannis and I were joking during the game that this was the slowest paced game we played in a while at least us to out there because we just knew were down a couple bodies we needed to make sure we were always in the right spots and everybody was organized. Sometimes we just had to slow it down get our set just make sure everybody is in the right spots so we can play and execute.”

Durant also had to navigate foul trouble but scored 29 points on 10 of 19 shooting. He also pulled down nine rebounds and handed out seven assists as Harden struggled all game long on offense. Harden scored 16 points but needed 15 shots to do so. He also contributed nine rebounds and seven assists. Nic Claxton had 14 points and Cam Thomas added 14 off the bench for Brooklyn.

Bobby Portis provided a huge lift in notching his 13th double-double of the season with 25 points and 12 rebounds on 9 of 16 shooting. Wesley Matthews who drew the task of defending Durant for most of their time on the court together added 12 points and seven rebounds. Second-year wing Jordan Nwora started for the seventh time and added 13 points.

Portis didn’t score in the second half until 6 minutes 59 seconds remained but it was a three-pointer that pushed the Bucks' lead to 110-90 capping a 9-0 run that ended whatever comeback hopes the Nets had after closing to within 13. That forced Nets head coach Steve Nash into a timeout and he pulled his starters off the floor.

Ham kept Antetokounmpo Portis Matthews and Nwora in as the Bucks have had some struggles closing out teams after building big leads but the Nets’ bench wasn't able to mount a comeback. Antetokounmpo and Portis were pulled after a three by Antetokounmpo made it 117-95 with five minutes left.

Milwaukee expanded an 11-point halftime lead to as many as 24 in the third quarter before taking a 98-80 lead into the final period.

Brooklyn got to 68-59 with 9:19 to go before Antetokounmpo and Middleton combined for 16 straight points to put the Bucks up 87-63. The run began with Antetokounmpo converting a three-point play and causing Durant’s fourth foul. Durant didn’t shy away on the next possession as he tied up Antetokounmpo on his next drive – but Antetokounmpo won the jump ball which led to Middleton making a four-point play.

Antetokounmpo then walked into a transition three-pointer to force the Nets into a timeout. Claxton ended the 10-0 run but Middleton and Antetokounmpo kept the pressure on. The best the Nets could do was cut the lead to 18.

“I heard I think a very good advice when I had foul trouble from Wes"" Antetokounmpo said. ""He said you’re going to be the most rested guy in the second half. So come out in the second half and play hard be aggressive make the right play. Sometimes like everything happens for a reason. I know I got into foul trouble but at the end of the day I still tried to enjoy the game as much as possible.

""My teammates were playing great and knocking down shots. I knew that I had to come in the second half and try to be in the moment as much as possible enjoy it be aggressive and stay out of foul trouble which I did I think. I didn’t have another foul in the second half.”

Despite foul trouble for Antetokounmpo and a rough shooting start for Middleton the Bucks went into the half up 60-49 thanks to Portis and a tremendous closing stretch by the bench.

Portis scored 20 points on 7 of 12 shooting and had nine rebounds to lead the Bucks offense and the defense limited the Nets to 39.1% shooting.

“I’m just having fun playing with swag playing with confidence let the game come to” Portis said of his first half. “If I see a matchup I like try to attack. Was able to get the ball on the block a little bit and show my game there off the dribble a little bit. So just being a basketball player make the game come to you but still knowing the bigger picture.

""Giannis got three fouls early so I had to come in and be a little more aggressive then I probably I would normally be.”

Middleton and Portis helped fluster Harden into 2 of 10 shooting and fellow starters Duke Jr. Claxton and Mills combined for 11 points. That left Durant to do much of the heavy lifting for the Nets as he scored 19 points on 6 of 11 shooting.

But his solo effort wasn’t enough to make up for the Bucks’ team play especially when Antetokounmpo went to the bench for good with 9:24 to go in first half. When he sat down with his third foul the Bucks led 34-30. Portis then scored seven straight points to push the lead to 41-32 and a Middleton three made it 47-36.

Middleton and Matthews were subbed out at the 4:24 mark and then Nwora and Hood gave the Bucks a 13-point lead with 3:46 to go. Shortly thereafter Portis was subbed out in favor of rookie Sandro Mamukelashvili leaving Nwora as the lone starter in with Hood Galloway Thanasis Antetokounmpo and Mamukelashvili.

For nearly three minutes that group nearly played the Nets even with Durant and Harden on the court. Brooklyn barely dented that lead cutting it to eight at one point but still trailed 58-47 when Middleton returned to close out the final 56 seconds of the half. Mamukelashvili then closed the scoring with a putback off a Nwora miss to give the Bucks an 11-point halftime lead.

“It was huge"" Middleton said of that group holding the lead. ""Everybody that played tonight played a huge part in one getting that lead and getting that win. I mean it was obviously to say the focal point would be me and Giannis but what those guys did even Langston coming in first hours with us and he’s playing a game that we needed to win everybody was huge just moving the ball getting the best shot available for the team and not just themselves. Just communicating out there.

""It was huge that those guys played well and was ale to (hold) that lead for us.”

Despite playing just 11 minutes Giannis Antetokounmpo had 12 points and three assists. Middleton had five points on 2-for-9 shooting as he drew Harden on the defensive end. Nwora added eight points. Thomas had nine points for Brooklyn in the first half.

Milwaukee got 10 points each from Portis and Antetokounmpo in the first quarter to go up 29-21 after one quarter. Portis was a force drawing two fouls and Durant and helping the Bucks stretch a 13-9 lead to 23-13 when Antetokounmpo was resting. Portis scored eight of the Bucks’ 10 points in that stretch.

Brooklyn never led in the first half and the game was tied just two times.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vYW1lcmljYW5zb25nd3JpdGVyLmNvbS9ib24tam92aS1yZXZlYWxzLTIwMjItdG91ci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bon Jovi Reveals 2022 Tour,"Bon Jovi is getting back on the road in 2022.

G.M. and Ford closed one factory after another — sometimes for months on end — because of a shortage of computer chips leaving dealer lots bare and sending car prices zooming. Yet Tesla racked up record sales quarter after quarter and ended the year having sold nearly twice as many vehicles as it did in 2020 unhindered by an industrywide crisis.

Tesla’s ability to conjure up critical components has a greater significance than one year’s car sales. It suggests that the company and possibly other young electric car businesses could threaten the dominance of giants like Volkswagen and G.M. sooner and more forcefully than most industry executives and policymakers realize. That would help the effort to reduce the emissions that are causing climate change by displacing more gasoline-powered cars sooner. But it could hurt the millions of workers thousands of suppliers and numerous local and national governments that rely on traditional auto production for jobs business and tax revenue.

Tesla and its enigmatic chief executive Elon Musk have said little about how the carmaker ran circles around the rest of the auto industry. Now it’s becoming clear that the company simply had a superior command of technology and its own supply chain. Tesla appeared to better forecast demand than businesses that produce many more cars than it does. Other automakers were surprised by how quickly the car market recovered from a steep drop early in the pandemic and had simply not ordered enough chips and parts fast enough.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9jYXJzLzIwMjIvMDEvMDgvZm9yZC1sZXR0ZXItd2FybnMtZi0xNTAtbGlnaHRuaW5nLWRlYWxlci1zYWxlcy85MTQyNTgzMDAyLz9nbnQtY2ZyPTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford to dealers: Stop 'threatening customers' by upselling F-150 Lightning reservations,"Ford Motor concerned about its reputation and customer complaints related to the upcoming launch of the F-150 Lightning warned dealers not to upsell reservations for the popular EV truck and the company wants customers to sign a contract preventing them from reselling the vehicle within a year.

If a dealer chooses to add a no-sale provision provided by Ford to its contracts the buyer will have to agree to “not sell offer to sell or otherwise transfer ownership interest in the Vehicle prior to the first anniversary of the date hereof.” The notice also warns dealers against trying to raise the prices of the trucks themselves.

CNET and Teslarati note that Ford’s message to dealerships also warns dealers that they might not receive any Lightnings in 2022 if they ask customers for extra deposits or payments which the memo says is seen as “threatening customers by withholding their opportunity to convert reservations to orders.”

Ford’s not being as strict with its customers — whether they have to agree to the no-sale provision is up to the dealer. A Ford spokesperson told CNET that the “requirement is between a dealer and their customer” and said that it was the dealer’s choice whether to include the provision if it’s legally allowed in their state. In a screenshot (originally posted on the F150 Gen14 forum) reporting to show the message sent to dealers it is clear that it’s optional — but it also says that Ford is “offering support” for the provision.

Ford says it’s gotten around 200000 deposits for the electric pickup

Ford’s upcoming electric pickup seems to be hotly anticipated — the company said that around 200000 people had put down $100 deposits for it between May and December 2021. The company has also stopped taking reservations for the truck which is meant to start shipping in the first half of this year.

The market is flooded with a multitude of options with varying features and prices to suit everybody’s needs. Unfortunately manufacturers’ claims and marketing gimmicks do not always relate accurately to what the golfer thought he was buying.

In this article we carry out an Izzo Swami Golf GPS Review and Comparison focusing on 3 models namely the 4000 5000 and top of the range 6000.

Izzo Swami Golf GPS Review

1. Izzo Golf Swami 4000+ Pros Larger 18” color screen for an easy read

Shot distance measurement

Easy to use with only 4 buttons to operate

Cost

Great introductory GPS

Bright colors Cons Distance to fixed points at the front middle and back of green only

No graphics

Not MAC compatible

Slow for lock-on distance

The 4000+ is an upgrade on the previous 3000 model and Izzo Swami has added a few upgrades as can be expected on any new model. It is a very basic GPS that will suit players looking for limited information from a GPS system. Cost is another factor and here the value for money is well worth it. Text distances to fixed points are provided for the front center and back of the green. There are no graphics and this is a negative for the 4000 model. Other features missing on this basic model are the inability to keep score and no hole handicap information. MAC users will be disappointed as Izzo does not support them and this could be problematic if and when course updates are required.

Looking at the upgrades in more detail the increased color screen size of 1.8” will be most welcome by all players especially the older player or players with diminished eyesight. No scrambling for glasses or squinting away from the sun to see the readings on the screen. Shot distance measurement is a serious upgrade and no more debating in the 4-ball who hit the furthest drive! Besides this it will assist golfers to understand the actual distances they hit each club in the bag which will improve game strategy and scores tenfold. An Auto-Advance feature between holes is also added.

The Izzo Swami 4000+ provides the battery level time and hole number on the color distance screen. The device is fairly thick and when carried in the pocket is rather uncomfortable. Satellite communication was also lost when in the pocket but a belt clip is provided to overcome this issue. The Izzo Swami 4000+ whilst limited in advanced features is still a great entry-level GPS for first-timers and those who have budget constraints. Amortize the cost of a caddy over the year and the purchase becomes a no-brainer!

What you get in the Box:

USB cable

AC Charger

Protective soft bag

Belt Clip

Pros Accurate distances to front center and back of green

Accurate layup and carry distances for hazards and doglegs

New Scorecard feature to save and view up to 10 rounds

Shot distance measurement

Larger 2” color screen

Longer battery life

Durable and waterproof

Easy to use Cons Magnetic charge cable

The belt clip is not great

The intermediate 5000 model in the Izzo Swami range is an upgrade from the 4000 model with advanced features that will appeal to the golfer that wants just a bit more than the standard information when out on the course. This model is one of the easiest to operate handheld Golf GPS devices with super-fast speed on the market today. The new features are well worth the additional cost and the increased information will assist to lower scores on the track.

A slimmer profile is an improvement for the golfer who does not like to carry bulky objects in the pocket when out on the course. The larger more vibrant 2” color screen just made it easier to obtain quick readings without slowing up play. Increased battery life of over 12 hours is a great positive and a scorekeeper that allows the player to store and view the round history.

Best of all the improvements is the added feature of producing distance readings to flags hazards and bunkers dogleg carry and layup areas. This feature is a must for the golfer who plays precision golf and relies on accurate distances for setting up each shot on the hole in play. Playing a strange course just got easier and with over 30000 courses worldwide preloaded will take the guesswork out of many shots especially on undulating courses where “dead” ground often causes misjudgment. Navigating the usage with a choice of 4 different languages is extremely easy.

How Does the Izzo Swami GPS Range Compare to Others?

Comparisons in any form are always subjective by nature and it is difficult to compare Apples with Apples. Below I have listed a few options available in the market that are within the price range and also offer good value for money.

5. Golf Buddy Voice 2 GPS Pros Shot distance measurement

Dynamic green view shows real front center and back of the green

Clip-on to cap or belt for easy reference

Voice message for distance readout Cons Small size

Voice can be irritating and disturb other players

The Golf Buddy GPS has been around for a while and upgrades continue to move into the market. The Golf Buddy Voice 2 is a very light and easy-to-use device that will provide sufficient course information to assist all levels of golfers to improve their game. Shot distance measurement lifetime updates on golf courses automatic course and hole recognition all come standard with this model. The Dynamic Green View shows the real front center and back distance measurements to the green. The GPS clips to the belt or the cap for easy location during play. The voice reads out the distances before the shot and is very handy. The downside is the voice often gives a reading while other players in the 4-ball are preparing to play their shots! Be careful where you stand while your partners are playing or bear the brunt of some unsavory comments!

Handheld GPS Devises vs GPS Watches

Manufacturers have understood the simplicity of creating GPS watches to challenge the leading handheld devices on offer worldwide. The benefit and advantages of wearing a watch rather than carrying a GPS is a debatable issue. The watch is easier to reference for distances and will not hold up play. The chances of leaving the handheld device at home in the rush to the golf course are for many much greater. Pricing is generally on par so the debate will never be settled. It is purely player preference.

Senior golfers would more than likely choose to wear a watch rather than carry a GPS device on the course. Losing the watch is far more difficult than dropping the handheld!

Final Thoughts

The GPS market has a device for any level of golfer who deems this a necessary part of his equipment. There is no doubt that the correct use of the GPS will make the round smoother and less stressful by knowing the distances to the green and hazards along the fairway. It should be mentioned that the GPS will work as well as the signal from the satellite permits. Downloads can be slower on various courses and can be a bit frustrating.

There are a few downsides to using a GPS on the course and the main one is slowing down the speed of play. Every golfer would have experienced the frustration of playing behind a player or 4-ball that fidget and walk from the ball to the bag a few times before pulling a club. This is probably the main reason for not allowing the devices into tournament play although it can be said that with all the information books and distance charts the professionals do take their time before committing to a shot. However slow play is monitored and in the tournaments players get put “on the clock” if they fall behind in the field.",,,,,,

An annual study by Facemoji Keyboard – an app developed by Chinese tech company Baidu – shows 80 per cent of the most used emojis in the world expressed positive emotions like laughter love and affection.

Despite the coronavirus pandemic and political and economic uncertainty the world over texters in 2021 preferred to keep it light when it came to the emojis they used.

Other heavy hitters included the “rolling on the floor laughing” emoji the heart and a sobbing face. The “pleading face” (the one that looks like puppy dog eyes) jumped into the top 10 most used icons for the first time.

The “face with tears of joy” continued a six-year streak of being the most used emoji this past year. Photo: Shutterstock

The study also included the most used emojis for different messaging and social media platforms. Perhaps surprisingly the heart emoji was less likely to appear in dating apps like Tinder Hinge and Bumble  with users opting instead for the sweaty laughing face or a blushing face.

Emojis have been around for more than 20 years. A Japanese artist named Shigetaka Kurita invented emojis in the late 1990s  and his original 176 icons are on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Since then the use of emojis has exploded as smartphones and digital communication became an integral part of everyday life. Messengers now have some 3633 options to choose from according to the Unicode Standard – a digital encoding system.

About 92 per cent of the online population uses emojis and the Facemoji report found that overall usage continues to grow. Last year the Unicode Consortium the non-profit organisation responsible for emoji development announced 37 new emojis – mostly facial reactions hand gestures and icons for nature food drink and activities.

How people relate to emojis varies widely. According to a study by researchers from Renmin University of China emojis can provide insight into how someone is feeling or make messages more appealing for those on the receiving end.

The emojis one chooses vary depending on individual characteristics culture the platform being used and the context of the situation. For example Chinese users are more likely than Spanish users to express negative emotions using emojis according to the Renmin study.

The pandemic was a worldwide concern for the whole year and that also influenced emoji users.

According to Facemoji Keyboard the use of Covid-19-related emojis – such as a medical syringe a face blowing its nose a hospital and toilet paper – continued to increase in 2021.

The syringe hit peak popularity between March and May as more people became eligible for their first and second Covid-19 vaccine doses. The use of the masked face emoji went through a significant drop from July reaching a 20 per cent decrease in November.

The most-used emoji in China is the “grinning face with sweat” according to the website Emojiall. It is also favoured by emoji users from other areas and ranked seventh in Facemoji Keyboard’s report.

According to Emojiall Chinese users are increasingly sending the “hand with pinched fingers” – it is currently ninth on the list of most popular emoji in the country.

In Italy this gesture tends to be used in disagreement frustration or disbelief and can mean “What do you want?” or “What are you saying?”. It is used in China when you ask someone for money.

The white heart emoji is the most-used emoji in Hong Kong according to Emojiall but it was not mentioned in the Facemoji Keyboard report. The red heart was the third most used emoji of 2021 in the world.

Hongkongers though share the same love for the pleading face emoji as others do – it came fifth in the most used emojis on both reports by Emojiall and Facemoji Keyboard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlZmVuY2Uvdmlldy13aWxsLXRoZS1uZXh0LTkvMTEtYmUtYS1jeWJlci1hdHRhY2svYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODg3OTExNjQuY21z0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvZGVmZW5jZS92aWV3LXdpbGwtdGhlLW5leHQtOS8xMS1iZS1hLWN5YmVyLWF0dGFjay9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODg3OTExNjQuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,View: Will the next 9/11 be a cyber attack?,"

What began just a few years ago as an organic gradual and sometimes cautious migration of communications operations and data of various corporations to the virtual world of cloud storage and remote operations has now accelerated exponentially due to the pandemic. Even those corporations which adopted decidedly measured or even reluctant approaches to the early migratory patterns were forced to forgo any misgivings or operational realities in their blind leap to accommodate the new realities imposed by the COVID–19 scenario. This seemingly overnight transformation from office-based activity to remote work across the globe now screams for the adoption of robust cyber security protocols and therefore is more critical and time-sensitive than ever before. Undoubtedly this unprecedented paradigm shift was crucial in mitigating the spread of the physical virus; in doing so it has left many organisations or say corporations  vulnerable to viruses of an electronic nature such as malware and ransomware.The World Economic Forum ’s Global Risk Report for 2021 placed cyber security failure among the greatest threats facing humanity within the next decade. The WEF report states “…attackers could trigger a breakdown in the systems that keep societies functioning.” Industry and critical infrastructure which need to be running continuously - such as Nuclear Power plants Banking operations IntensiveCare Units in hospitals and Cold Storages which protect COVID vaccinations among others - could be potential targets for hackers whether they are small groups or state actors. Concerns exist that nation-state actors will test the pressure points of critical infrastructure through hacks with the aim of sowing seeds of more chaos by disrupting the supply chains during future periods of geo-political conflict. At such times targeting food and energy supplies of an adversary will be a classic strategy to begin with.The hacking of the Colonial Pipeline in May 2021 which controls 45 percent of fuel in the Eastern US led to panic buying of petrol by consumers which in turn escalated fuel prices on the entire Eastern coast. A month later a ransomware attack on the world’s biggest meat processing company JBS shut down 20 percent of the meat supply of the United States and Canada escalating concerns about the potential for a spike in meat prices and highlighted food supply as a national security threat.“Calling the past month a tumultuous one for world’s digital policy might be an understatement” said Lt. Col. Bryan Miranda a security specialist and former Indian Army officer who served with Cyber Intelligence Acquisitions for the Military Intelligence and is now the co-founder at Cipher one of the premier cyber-security firms of the country. “Cyber security is a topic that often fails to get the attention of the public until a headline hits about a company that has their personal information becoming the victim of a hack. But over the past year a different threat has taken precedence that goes much deeper into the psyche and impacts the daily lives of ordinary citizens. The criminals have started to dig deeper into critical national infrastructure and such attacks demonstrate the reach of these events. Who could imagine that attacking and shutting down meat plants in Australia would impact meat prices in North America?”For years government security specialists have predicted the inevitable “Cyber 9/11” an event originating as a digital attack that spills over into other aspects of society causing widespread harm to people and the global financial sector. Fear sells. So it can be really hard to know what experts really fear might happen versus hype meant to market tickets to a new security conference or drum up attention on social media towards cyber-crimes perpetrated by groups with alleged links to Russia or China.But there are some nightmarish scenarios that have precedents. These are the scenarios that truly concern independent cyber security experts. They fall into three common themes - physical attacks that shut off or damage some aspect of critical services financial attacks that spin out of control and lead to bank runs and hackers changing data in a way that shakes our trust in the economy and critical institutions in the nation. Cyber-attacks much like the JBS Meatpacking and Colonial Pipeline hacks that cause major disruption to public services have occurred many times in the real world. But it is easy to imagine how a similar attack could shut down basic services such as electricity or water supply which can and will adversely affect millions of people. In 2015 Ukraine’s power grid faced massive outages after a cyber-attack just two days before Christmas in the middle of a cold wave. Around a quarter of a million residents were left without power in the middle of the winter.In the second scenario financial regulators often talk about the risk of a “contagion” as a result of an attack on banks or institutions such as the National Stock Exchange. The fear is that a cyber-attack could create mass hysteria which will send customers rushing to banks in a panic to pull out their funds. An attack with significant impact to financial systems resulting in people being unable to get to their money can cause just as much distress to the system as a major network outage. Imagine a crippling attack that just ripples through the financial sector. If common citizens are unable to access ATM machines or if credit cards and other banking functions stop working it would be very problematic and create mass panic which may even result in emergency-like situations.In the third scenario criminals or nation-states could also change data like financial information on balance sheets. There is some precedent here too. In 2015 the international investment bank BNY Mellon faced a technical glitch that mispriced some of their securities. This jammed the algorithms that are used for executing automated trades and the result was a swift 1000-point drop in the stock market.Tom Kellerman a former top Cyber Security Officer for the World Bank and Chief Cyber Security Officer of security firm Carbon Black in an interview with CNBC agreed that he was most afraid of data being altered instead of stolen or lost. “Integrity of data is key. If you lose your ability to trust the information that is coming out of the financial sector that is when things can turn dark and very quickly” he said. It is interesting to note that the US government even ran a training exercise in 2015 called the Jade Helm 15. It involved four out of the five branches of US military preparing for a scenario wherein the banking sector goes under a cyber-attack from a foreign regime resulting in changing or loss of people’s financial data.Still rising from all these digital threats is the potential for better policy and outcomes as the cyber realm has now come from being a world of techies to the world of geo-politics. Political leaders all over the world have stood up and taken a note of the seriousness of the threats posed by cyber warfare. The Huawei 5G saga is an example where companies all over the globe policy makers and governments especially of Denmark India Japan and South Africa have raised issues about the geopolitical neutrality and the subsequent threat to sovereignty from private corporations involved within the cyber realm.In the case of Huawei it is alleged that the Chinese telecom company’s 5G equipment is a vector for the Chinese government to stage espionage. However several realities exist simultaneously. Many countries have not issued a complete ban on Huawei 5G technology and the company gains more ground by the day in markets where its low pricing is a key selling point. Yet global supply chain entanglement also means Huawei is not the last time such questions will be raised about a digital infrastructure supplier. What is needed is a sensible deep but not too generic cyber security regulation.On an enterprise level the crucial challenge which India faces in terms of making a concrete cyber infrastructure can be solved by adopting the Zero Trust Architecture . The increase in Work from Home (WFH) Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Internet of Things (IoT) and hybrid cloud blurs the border between what is on premises and what is beyond the perimeter. Old school hardened network perimeters alone are no longer effective for maintaining enterprise security.Zero Trust is a design approach to creating an information technology environment that could reduce an organisation’s risk exposure in a borderless world. In layman’s terms Zero Trust Architecture treats all users and all nodes as the potential threat and thus verifies every single point with utmost priority. Implementing Zero Trust Architecture with a proper DevOps approach will certainly contain the damage as it tests everything and trusts nothing. Hedera Hashgraph  a Zero Trust network architecture protocol partly owned by the likes of Google LG Tata Communications Wipro Boeing IBM among others negates the issue with most centralised networks that is a single point of failure.Adopting Hedera Hashgraph as a security layer is cost effective easy to implement energy efficient public but privacy-enabled solution which can be adopted by institutions enterprises and individuals world over today. The likes of NASA Standard Bank IIT Madras Shinhan Bank are already implementing the network within their own information technology environment and even Reserve Bank of India in a recent working paper referred to the Hashgraph technology as a possible solution for all their rotary secure funds transfer and storage needs.For common citizens like you and I industry experts have encouraged best practices and a greater awareness of the threats. Therefore on an individual level to protect your data from cyber breach the advice more or less remains the same. Do not click on unknown attachments; always use strong and unique passwords; enable two factor authentication; update your Operating System and other apps regularly and also keep an up-to-date backup of all your important files. Because even if it is not visible right away it appears that ransomware is here to stay.(Lt Gen Abhay Krishna (Retd) Former Army Commander of South Western Eastern and Central Commands has been International Associate Arbitrator.

Johnson (DDG 1002) Zumwalt-class destroyer (DDG-1000) for the U.S. Navy is ready to leave GDBIW Bath Iron Works in Maine and head to Ingalls in Mississippi for the final fitting out.

The USS Lyndon B. Johnson (DDG-1002) is the third and final Zumwalt-class destroyer built for the United States Navy. The contract to build her was awarded to Bath Iron Works located in Bath Maine on 15 September 2011. The ship was launched in December 2018 and christened on 27 April 2019.

According to a U.S. Congress Report the United States Navy procured three DDG-1000 class destroyers in FY2007-FY2009 (FY Fiscal Year) and plans no further procurement of DDG-1000s.

The DDG-1000s are multi-mission destroyers with an originally intended emphasis on naval surface fire support (NSFS) and operations in littoral waters. Consistent with that mission orientation the ship was designed with two new-design 155mm guns called Advanced Gun Systems (AGSs). The AGSs were to fire a new 155mm gun-launched rocket-assisted guided projectile called the Long-Range Land-Attack Projectile (LRLAP pronounced LUR-lap).

In November 2016 however it was reported that the Navy had decided to stop procuring LRLAP projectiles because the projected unit cost of each projectile had risen to at least $800000. In December 2017 it was reported that due to shifts in the international security environment and resulting shifts in Navy mission needs the mission orientation of the DDG-1000s will be shifted from an emphasis on NSFS to an emphasis on surface strike meaning the use of missiles to attack surface ships and perhaps also land targets.

In April and May 2021 it was reported that the Navy plans to remove the AGSs on the three ships and replace them with vertical launch tubes for the Navy’s new hypersonic Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) missile with a goal of fielding CPSs on a DDG-1000 class ship by 2025.

The future USS Lyndon B. Johnson (DDG 1002) is a Zumwalt-class destroyer (DDG-1000) designed as multi-mission stealth ships with a focus on land attack. It is a multi-role class that was designed for secondary roles of surface warfare and anti-aircraft warfare and originally designed with a primary role of naval gunfire support.

The DDG-1000 incorporates a significant number of new technologies including a wave piercing tumblehome hull design for reduced detectability30 a superstructure on the first two ships but not the third that is made partly of large sections of composite (i.e. fiberglass-like) materials rather than steel or aluminum an integrated electric-drive propulsion system31 a total ship computing system for moving information about the ship automation technologies enabling its reduced-sized crew a dual-band radar (that was later changed to a single-band radar) a new kind of vertical launch system (VLS) for storing and firing missiles and two copies of a new 155mm gun called the Advanced Gun System (AGS).

The propulsion system of the DDG 1002 incorporates two Rolls-Royce Marine Trent-30 gas turbines two 2 Rolls-Royce RR4500 gas turbine generators and two 34.6MW advanced induction motors (AIM). The ship can reach a top speed of 30.3 knots (56.1 km/h). With an estimated full load displacement of 15656 tons the DDG-1000 series design is substantially larger than the U.S. Navy’s Aegis cruisers and destroyers which have displacements of up to about 9700 tons and are larger than any Navy destroyer or cruiser since the nuclear-powered cruiser Long Beach (CGN-9) which was procured in FY1957. The ship has a length of 182.9 m a beam of 80.7 m and a draft of 27.6 m. The ship has a crew of 175 sailors including 147 sailors to operate the ship plus 28 people for the aviation detachment.

The DDG 1002 is armed with 20 MK 57 VLS (Vertical launching System) modules with 4 vertical launch cells in each module 80 cells total. Each cell can hold one or more missiles depending on the size of the missiles.



The ship can launch Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) surface-to-air missiles Tactical Tomahawk Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC) cruise missiles. The ship is also armed with two 155 mm Advanced Gun Systems and two Mk 46 Mod 2 Gun Weapon Systems.

The rear part of the DDG 1002 is fitted with a large aviation deck and a hangar capable of housing two SH-60 LAMPS helicopters or MH-60R helicopters or three MQ-8 Fire Scout VTUAV unmanned helicopters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3Qvd2h5LWItMjEtcmFpZGVyLWNvdWxkLWJlLWFybWVkLWFpci1haXItbWlzc2lsZXMtMTk5MTg00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the B-21 Raider Could Be Armed With Air-to-Air Missiles,"Here's What You Need to Remember: The A-12 was designed to carry two AIM-120 medium-range air-to-air missiles in addition to air-to-ground weaponry. But the U.S. Defense Department canceled the A-12 in 1991. The U.S. Air Force’s new B-21 Raider stealth bomber could fly as early as 2021. And at least one Air Force general believes the new Northrop Grumman-made bomber could gain air-to-air capabilities in order to help it fight its way to its target. There is some precedent for a bomber aircraft with a secondary air-to-air mission. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the U.S. Navy paid General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas billions of dollars to develop the A-12 Avenger II a stealthy carrier-launched medium bomber that was supposed to replace the Navy’s A-6 Intruders. The A-12 was designed to carry two AIM-120 medium-range air-to-air missiles in addition to air-to-ground weaponry. But the U.S. Defense Department canceled the A-12 in 1991. What went wrong? For one the world changed -- and the secrecy surrounding the A-12 didn’t help either according to James Stevenson former editor of the Navy Fighter Weapons School’s Topgun Journal. “After the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989 pressure for a ‘peace dividend’ increased” Stevenson wrote. In July 1990 one month before Iraq invaded Kuwait Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney asked Congress for more A-12 money but his request was rebuffed — an indication that the military budget decline was serious. After Iraq invaded Kuwait the budgeteers had to scramble for even more money. This fight for funds combined with the impending military action guaranteed that some programs would be radically slowed reduced or eliminated. The A-12 ended up as one of those terminated programs. Cheney withdrew his support for the A-12 contract on Jan. 5 1991 freeing more than $500 million for the impending war effort that began 10 days later. On the other hand the F-22 squeaked through even though the Air Force did not procure its original requirement of 750 F-22s. It eventually managed to squeeze 187 of them out of the budget. In this case when black and gray programs competed the gray program — a lighter shade at that — survived in Darwinian fashion. Even though the A-12 was predicted to cost much less Congress bankrolled the F-22 while the Navy watched in tears as its A-12 program was carted away. And since the A-12 was secret the branch couldn’t mount a public defense. Which is not to say the A-12 program was in good shape otherwise as David Montgomery explained in Air Force magazine in 1991. In fact workers were having a hard time building the prototypes. “The biggest problem say officials stemmed from the difficulties of creating and applying highly advanced composite material in the radar-evading stealth plane” Montgomery wrote. The two contractors had inadequate experience with this material to carry out the project smoothly and with a minimum of delay. Evident mutual suspicion between the two contractors compounded the problem. One Pentagon analyst who studied the issue said the two A-12 contractors appeared loath to share sensitive technology to further the A-12 program. The reason: They were competitors on another project -- the program to build the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter. ""There were technologies that could have helped in the overall [A-12] effort but they weren't willing to share those"" said the analyst. ""If you have a technological advantage how willing are you to share that if ... it could help you in some other program?"" An overly ambitious schedule exacerbated the problem. Under the original timetable the contractors planned first flight for June 171990. They mapped out a design-to-assembly schedule of only nine months far shorter than the fourteen months normally allotted for such an effort. Workers in top-secret areas of plants operated by General Dynamics in Fort Worth Texas and by McDonnell Douglas in Saint Louis Missouri would spend four and a half months on subassembly. Sections would be shipped to Tulsa Oklahoma for final assembly. According to the report the manufacturers were only feeling their way along. They lacked proper tooling missed key target dates at various steps in the development process and were forced to issue ""stop work orders"" because of engineering problems. Delays in the arrival of parts further delayed production. By contrast the Air Force insists that B-21 development is proceeding without any major complications. Of course the B-21 program also is highly secret meaning it’s impossible for outsiders to verify the Air Force’s sanguine claims. But if the B-21 does fly in 2021 as planned and ends up including the air-to-air capabilities that have been proposed it could finally fulfill the A-12’s multi-role promise from nearly 30 years ago.

Considering we are currently in the midst of the first runDisney marathon weekend in 2022 we have once again seen an influx of Guests at the Parks ready to run.

As we know when it comes to a marathon weekend at Walt Disney World Resort we see Guests come in from all over the world so that they can set their alarms to wake them up at 3:00 a.m. and head to the start line so that they can race through Magic Kingdom EPCOT Disney’s Animal Kingdom and Disney’s Hollywood Studios — depending on their race length and track. For some of the races back roads on Disney property are used with fun visuals and characters set up along the way.

During the Disney’s Wickedly Delicious Wine & Dine Marathon we saw the extinct Magic Kingdom attraction 20000 Leagues Under the Sea make a triumphant return as one of the photo-ops for runners. After the marathon ended however it seemed that we had to say goodbye to the Nautilus once again. Now it appears that we have once again found the attraction pop back up!

While driving through Disney property one of the back roads was seen to have the massive ride vehicle sitting there barren and empty. The abandoned-looking photo-op area would have likely seen a lot more life to it while runners were snapping selfies as they ran by earlier in the morning!

Take a look at the video captured by Touring the Galaxy below!

As we have noted in the past:

20000 Leagues Under the Sea: Submarine Voyage is an extinct Magic Kingdom attraction that used to reside in Fantasyland. The ride opened in the Park’s opening year 1971 and remained in place in 1994. The ride idea was brought from Disneyland but was meant to be even bigger when created at Magic Kingdom Park. It has been said that the ride did not open with Magic Kingdom but two weeks later due to infrastructure problems.

When discussing the now-extinct attraction Disney Fandom states:

By the time development work for what is today Walt Disney World began Disney imagineers had already been working out a rough concept for a sister attraction to Disneyland’s Submarine Voyage. It was one of the biggest and most expensive Disney attractions ever conceived. The Florida version had 12 submarines (14 counting two submarines which grappled with giant squids on either side of the track). It is popularly believed that the Magic Kingdom attraction was originally intended to have been installed in place of the Submarine Voyage at Disneyland in 1959 as the two attractions were identical except for the theming and some elements of the plot. It is also believed that the ride’s corporate sponsor General Dynamics preferred to keep the original concept and so the Submarine Voyage opened in 1959 with a non-specific theme and with nuclear as opposed to Victorian submarines.

After closing Disney auctioned off many parts of the ride brought some to Castaway Cay in the future and it seems that they have also kept one ride vehicle for themselves! Because of the far-out placement of the attraction vehicle it seems likely that not all runDisney racers would have seen the photo-op spot but rather those running the longer distances which is where those roads become necessary.

What extinct attraction would you like to see return?

According to the U.S. Army the NGSW program is currently in a competitive prototyping iteration with three vendors for weapons and ammunition including Sig Sauer General Dynamics – OTS and Textron Systems; as well as two vendors for fire control Vortex Optics and L3Harris. The competitive prototyping has included prototype testing which was meant to serve as a “diagnostic test” to inform the weapon and ammunition vendors on their current performance. The program has been met with delays due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

New Winchester Ammunition Contract For NGSW

Despite those past delays it seems that the program is back on track as Winchester announced that the U.S. Army has awarded the company a total of $20 million in cost-plus and firm-fixed-price contracts related to ammunition development manufacturing facility requirements analysis and production capacity planning for the 6.8mm NGSW program.

“Winchester is honored to have been selected by the U.S. Army to execute NGSW program activities at Lake City” said Brett Flaugher president of Winchester Ammunition. “The NGSW program represents our military’s significant investment in the future U.S. warfighter and the work being performed under these contracts is the genesis for generations of NGSW programs to come.”

Winchester which was founded in 1866 and is currently owned by the Olin Corporation is the world’s largest small caliber ammunition enterprise. Work on the U.S. Army contract will be performed at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (LCAAP) in Independence Missouri the United States’ only government-owned contractor-operated small caliber ammunition production facility.

The 3935-acre facility was originally established by Remington Arms in 1941 and is now part of the U.S. Army Joint Munitions Command. The government-owned plant provides small caliber military ammunition for both training and combat purposes and also serves as a national test center for ammunition performance and weapons firing.

LCAAP has been operated by Winchester Ammunition since October 2020 under an $8 billion contract which had an initial term of seven years and could be extended by the U.S. Army for up to three additional years. Winchester had previously held the contract to manage and operate LCAAP from 1985 to 2001. From 2001 until 2020 Alliant Technosystems ran the facilities.

Last month Winchester was also awarded an additional $13 million contract for the development of a manufacturing process for the 7.62-millimeter NATO cartridge. Winchester Ammunition manufactures every caliber of small arms cartridges used by the military including 5.56-millimeter 7.62-millimeter .50-caliber and 20-millimeter loads.

Despite the trend cereal manufacturers are forging ahead with innovations and continuing to release new products.

Companies like UK-based Crispy Fantasy are adding to the cereal category with better-for-you alternatives. Crispy Fantasy which is backed by the founders of Halo Top and RXBAR launched a chocolate cereal formulated with agave syrup unsweetened cacao powder soy and pea protein and avocado oil.

“I’ve tasted the other ‘healthy’ cereals and Crispy Fantasy’s product blows all of them away; it’s truly the ‘Halo Top’ of cereal” said Doug Bouton co-founder of Halo Top a reduced-calorie ice cream brand now owned by Wells Enterprises. “Halo Top is sold in more than 30 countries and I’m incredibly excited to partner with Crispy Fantasy as an investor and adviser to help them build a global brand anchored by mind-blowingly great products.”

Also entering the cereal category is the Quaker Oats Co. a division of PepsiCo Inc. with its own flagship brand. The Quaker puffed granola cereal is available in apple cinnamon and blueberry flavors. The flavors feature a granola blend with oat flakes crispy brown rice puffs and dried fruit pieces.

Quaker also is proving that cereal can be for children and adults alike in a collaboration with DC Comics. The companies released a strong berry flavor under Quaker’s Cap’n Crunch cereal that comes in two boxes: one featuring Supergirl and another featuring Superman.

Also taking cereal in that direction is the Kellogg Co. who has partnered with Nickelodeon to debut Apple Jacks Slime cereal in a green apple flavor.

“Kids and adults alike will recognize the fun and spontaneity of Nickelodeon Slime from many of their favorite Nick shows” said Priya Mukhedkar senior vice president toys and packaged goods Paramount Consumer Products. “We are excited to bring our iconic green Slime to fans in a whole new way with Kellogg’s Apple Jacks Slime.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbG1hcnRpbWVzLm5ldC9saWZlc3R5bGUvc3RvcnkvMjAyMi0wMS0wOC9kZS1hbnphLWNoYXB0ZXItZGFyLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtdGhlLXNwaXJpdC1vZi1naXZpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,De Anza Chapter DAR celebrates the spirit of giving,"Over 40 members of the De Anza Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution gathered to celebrate the holidays and women veterans. Their December meeting was dedicated to the “Spirit of Giving” collecting items to support and honor women veterans during the holiday season. The chapter collected an abundance of toys diapers baby clothes t-shirts socks and knitted hats for The Foundation For Women Warriors and the San Diego Veterans Village respectively.

The meeting was packed with events including awarding the NSDAR Women in American History Award to Agnes Tizard the voice of Betty Crocker and Valley Center resident. Tizard who passed away in 1979 was a home economist and nutrition consultant and one of several women who created and tested recipes and wrote cookbooks for what would later become known as General Mills. She became the voice of Betty in 1924 for the first radio broadcast of a cooking show. Accepting the award on behalf of the Valley Center Historical Museum was Sharon Bartholomew who also serves as Regent for the Valley Center Chapter of the DAR.

De Anza welcomed speaker Cory Woodrow from Resounding Joy who spoke about their Semper Sound program which provides music therapy to military service members and veterans. The program helps service members and veterans address symptom management including PTSD traumatic brain injury and anxiety. Cory movingly spoke on the impact the program on injured veterans.

NSDAR is a service organization comprised of members whose patriot ancestors served during the American Revolution. The De Anza Chapter serves the community in a variety of ways such as supporting veterans through donations and service to the Foundation for Women Warriors the San Diego VA Hospital and Operation Rebound Surf Clinic as well as actively participating in the national Wreaths Across America program and San Diego Honor Flight. Other projects in the areas of education serving local schools and programs and historic preservation keep chapter members busy throughout the year.

Base officials canceled the event due to “competing mission priorities” according to a press release.

""For now Whiteman Air Force Base will focus our resources on executing nuclear operations and global strike…anytime anywhere"" the statement read.

“This decision was not made lightly as we know many of our service members their families and our surrounding communities look forward to such an exciting event” said Col. Daniel Diehl 509th Bomb Wing commander. “We plan to devote the next few years to creating the best possible airshow experience for all participants and visitors in 2024.""

The press release went on to say that Whiteman AFB plans to host the next “Wings Over Whiteman Air and Space Show” in 2024.

So it looks like it will be about two-and-a-half years before you can expect to see another air show at Whiteman. The last one happened June 15 2019. So that's a time span of five years with no air show at Whiteman.

There are other options however.

Those who grew up on Saturday morning cartoons barely blink an eye at the bizarre phenomenon that is monster-themed children's cereal. So how exactly did these boxes of sugary cereal end up featuring blueberry ghosts strawberry Frankensteins and a vampire with a predilection for all things chocolate come to be? According to Mental Floss the originator of these spooky breakfasts was a man named Tony Jaffe who sought to come up with a competitor for the wholesome Cap'n Crunch and Tony the Tiger mascots that were so popular at the time.

Laura Levine was a copywriter who worked for Jaffe at the time. She recalls Jaffe's concept focusing on monsters a popular media trend at the time. History Daily explains that during the 1970s monsters were hot. The Addams Family and The Munsters dove into the darkly comical everyday lives of monster families living in the American suburbs while movies like Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell packed theaters with moviegoers looking for a scare.

Count Chocula and Franken Berry hit supermarket shelves in March of 1971 and were a hit from the jump but much like movie monsters the story arc of these cereals was dotted with strange twists and turns. The first bump in the monster cereal road came the following year when the red dye used in the Frankenstein-themed box sent several children and parents into panic mode when something called ""Franken Berry stool"" occurred but we'll leave that one to the medical professionals."

G.M. and Ford closed one factory after another — sometimes for months on end — because of a shortage of computer chips leaving dealer lots bare and sending car prices zooming. Yet Tesla racked up record sales quarter after quarter and ended the year having sold nearly twice as many vehicles as it did in 2020 unhindered by an industrywide crisis.

Tesla’s ability to conjure up critical components has a greater significance than one year’s car sales. It suggests that the company and possibly other young electric car businesses could threaten the dominance of giants like Volkswagen and G.M. sooner and more forcefully than most industry executives and policymakers realize. That would help the effort to reduce the emissions that are causing climate change by displacing more gasoline-powered cars sooner. But it could hurt the millions of workers thousands of suppliers and numerous local and national governments that rely on traditional auto production for jobs business and tax revenue.

Tesla and its enigmatic chief executive Elon Musk have said little about how the carmaker ran circles around the rest of the auto industry. Now it’s becoming clear that the company simply had a superior command of technology and its own supply chain. Tesla appeared to better forecast demand than businesses that produce many more cars than it does. Other automakers were surprised by how quickly the car market recovered from a steep drop early in the pandemic and had simply not ordered enough chips and parts fast enough.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3Nqb3VybmFsZGFpbHkuY29tL21hcnktYmFycmEtc2V0cy1hbWJpdGlvdXMtZXYtZ29hbHMtZm9yLWdtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Barra Sets Ambitious EV Goals for GM,"Barra Sets Ambitious EV Goals for GM

DETROIT — General Motors Chairwoman Mary Barra left little on the table Jan. 5 as she emphatically set the course for the automaker’s future.

“Visionary investments made over the last decade in electrification software-enabled services and autonomous driving have enabled GM to transform from automaker to platform innovator” she said during a virtual keynote address of at the CES Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “One with the vision the people and the technology to change the world.”

Barra vowed to bring the company to carbon-neutral status by 2040 and invest $35 billion to launch 30 electric and autonomous vehicles by 2025. By 2035 GM plans to convert all new light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles in its portfolio to electric.

GM plans to transform half of its production in North America and China to an electric platform by 2030 evidenced currently at plants such as Factory Zero in Detroit and its assembly plant in Spring Hill Tenn.

Central to this program is Ultium Cells LLC – a joint venture between GM and Korea-based LG Energy Solution – that is building a $2.3 billion electric vehicle battery cell manufacturing plant in Lordstown. A second plant is under construction in Spring Hill. Two additional plants are in the planning stages.

“We believe we have one of the most vertically integrated supply chains in the industry” she said noting GM is also pursuing closer relationships with semiconductor manufacturers. “These actions are all part of a broader initiative to build a more secure EV supply chain.”

Moreover Barra said that GM plans to invest nearly $750 million by 2025 to expand EV charging in the United States and Canada.

Barra also announced that GM has secured two deals with its BrightDrop program which offers electric light commercial vehicles for fleet markets. Walmart has signed on to purchase 5000 EV600 and EV410 electric delivery vans for last-mile service while FedEx has reserved another 2000 EV vans in addition to the 500 units it announced last year.

Among the highlights of 2022 CES was the introduction of the Chevrolet Silverado EV a light duty pickup intended initially for fleet customers.

The standard work version of the vehicle has a range of 400 miles on a single charge and is expected to launch in the spring of 2023. Shorter-range models are also in the works Barra said including a base model that starts at $39000.

Two major customers Quanta and Enterprise have expressed interest in the Silverado for their fleets.

“We expect a lot of early interest in this truck” Barra said.

The Silverado will also be the first GM vehicle to feature Ultifi a tech platform that allows for cloud access.

“Chevrolet will be front and center in our mission to provide EVs for everyone” Barra said. “We’re expecting this to be a massive year for Chevrolet’s EV future.”

A new EV Chevrolet Equinox for example is slated for next year at a price point of around $30000 Barra added while an EV Blazer will be introduced later in 2022 and made available in 2023.

“These SUVs will have high appeal with both retail and fleet customers ready to embrace an EV future further expanding the breadth of the Ultium platform” Barra said.

Back in 2019 I received an email from Brad Currey about economic inequality — passionately calling for early education and quality childcare to lead people out of poverty.

That was Brad Currey — a leader who was willing to address Atlanta’s biggest challenges — from the environment to race relations to business excellence – over more than six decades.

Currey first got on my radar in 1991 when Susan Neugent then a senior vice president at the Metro Atlanta Chamber offered to give me background info on Atlanta’s business leaders. Since I had just become a business columnist for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution she wanted to keep me honest and make sure I didn’t get co-opted by corporate spin. Neugent let me know which leaders were the good guys (yes they were almost all men) and which ones were not.

Then she said there was one great man who was in a class all by himself — Brad Currey.

“What a leader! What a good soul! What a friend to so many! How much good can one person do?” Neugent wrote me in an email when she heard Currey had died. “The good he did would be an extraordinary measure for anyone.”

Accolades poured in as the word got out among Currey’s admirers.

“We have lost and Heaven has gained one of the very finest men that our world contained” wrote Tom Johnson retired president of CNN. “It isn’t the age at which Brad died. It is how he lived those years the Good Lord gave him. Always Kind. Thoughtful. Generous. Humble. Selfless. Determined to help others. He was my Atlanta mentor for 31 years. He exemplified integrity doing what is right service to his community. I will do my best in my 8th and 9th inning to make Brad proud of me. I loved him.”

The first time I went to interview Brad Currey he was CEO of RockTenn (now WestRock). As we sat in his office with a large picture window facing railroad tracks we could hear a train coming. Currey interrupted the interview to swivel around to watch the train go by — counting the number of engines carrying railroad cars.

“That’s how I know how the economy is doing” he told me. If there were four engines the economy was booming. If there was one we were in a recession. That day Currey was happy to see three engines letting him know the economy was in good shape.

Over the years I counted on his wisdom guidance and support — knowing there were many of us who relied on him as we tried to navigate issues in Atlanta and Georgia.

Currey was instrumental in the renovation of St. Luke’s Episcopal Church where Bill Bolling founded the Atlanta Community Food Bank – leading to a friendship that lasted decades.

Brad’s death saddens me greatly” former Emory University President Jim Laney who served as U.S. ambassador to South Korea wrote in an email. Laney said they bonded when Currey agreed 40 years ago to join the Emory board of trustees. “I was especially touched and grateful for the most generous scholarship program he funded in the College in my name for Korean students. Our annual lunches with those students are forever etched in my memory.”

When Bill Bolling and I first had the idea more than five years ago to establish the Atlanta Civic Circle a nonprofit civic journalism site Currey was the first to make a donation — even before we had our nonprofit tax status. Currey continued to be our most consistent donor giving us significant grants every year including one we received in December.

The last time I saw Brad Currey was when my colleague Britton Edwards and I went to Canterbury Court to visit with another great leader — Howell Adams. I told Britton we should go to see Brad since we were there. When we visited his apartment we were told he was in the exercise room. There we found Brad pedaling hard on an exercise bike — delighted to see us and as endearing as always.

Laney spoke for all of us in his email to Currey’s family.

“I shall miss him more than I can say” Laney wrote. “He was dear friend counselor and partner. His integrity strength of character and profound sense of service gave him enormous influence in our region through the institutions he loved. He was in every sense one of a kind a gentleman of honor and Christian discipleship.”

The services for Brad Currey will be held on Saturday Feb. 19 at 11 a.m. at his beloved St. Luke’s.

Here is the email about economic inequality that Brad Currey sent to me on July 10 2019 through his longtime executive assistant Catherine Grist:

Maria

Please think about writing a column about economic inequality being the product of a failure of education and child care. We absolutely know that every child can learn. Parents and the community must start early. When a child is born both parents need to cradle them in their arms start reading to them even before they learn to speak provide books pictures good music newspapers and turn off the television . If the parents cannot then the community needs to find a way. They need to start formal education as soon as possible and continue it vigorously as long as possible. As the second of seven children six of whom grew up I know this because I watched my mother read to each of us almost from birth. My father didn’t finish high school went to work as a “runner” in a bank at age 14 in 1901 and except for two years in the U.S. Army in World War I worked in banks in Nashville Tennessee New York City and Chattanooga until retiring at age 67. He took us all walking from about age 4 on the CCC trails around Chattanooga and taught us about all the different varieties of trees plants and animals in the world. All six of us became college graduates! The girls were both Phi Beta Kappa smarter than all four of their brothers. My mother had no formal education but was taught at home by her father a lawyer and her mother born in 1867 and then given to and raised by an old maid aunt schoolteacher. (My mother’s three older sisters went to school but my mother and her young sister were taught at home because the sixth child was a boy and they started saving money to send him to school eventually getting him into West Point!)



Child care is just as important as education. Both save big money in the long run and should be considered public responsibilities.



Obviously I feel strongly about all this.

Brad Currey

Here is the family’s obituary which was largely written by Brad Currey himself:

Longtime Atlanta resident civic leader volunteer and businessman Bradley Norton Currey Jr. died January 6 2022 at home in Atlanta Georgia. He was 91.

Brad Currey (second from left) on April 8 1974 at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium honoring Hank Aaron’s 715th home run. (Special: Currey family.)

Throughout his life Brad loved civic and business work but also activities outside of work such as playing with children and grandchildren swimming hiking gardening and listening to music. He used to say he was the “luckiest guy that ever lived.” Since the early 1980s he has spent time with family in the north Georgia mountains where he walked the woods; read Jack Tales and Pogo to beloved grandchildren nieces and nephews; built roaring fires in the winter and in summertime took very long swims. He loved people eschewed extravagance cared about the community and was generous with his time and resources.

Brad graduated from Princeton University in 1951 with an A.B. degree from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He then enlisted in the U.S. Army serving as an infantry soldier (RA 14401949) and armor officer (01937889) during the Korean War. He saw no combat his service spent going to and teaching in Army Schools. He declared infantry basic training and infantry leaders’ courses in the recently-integrated Army the “best possible antidote to four years at Princeton University.”

He loved his work from boyhood on. His first management job was head busboy in the dining halls at Princeton University. He joined Trust Company of Georgia in late 1953 as a trainee rising from teller to credit analyst securities analyst commercial lender bond portfolio manager head of Atlanta commercial banking head of marketing controller strategic planner chief financial officer and member of the board of directors of the bank and bank holding company – in short a wonderful and productive banking career. In 1976 he joined Rock-Tenn Company of which he had been an outside director for nine years. He and A. Worley Brown led the company until Brown became disabled in the late 1980s after which Brad served as CEO until retiring in 2000. The company grew from $12 million in sales in 1967 to $1.3 billion in 2000. He and Worley Brown built the Rock-Tenn Team and by his report “had more fun than the law allowed.” Throughout his remarkable career he led by example listened mentored and cultivated talent. The list of people who are grateful that Brad Currey coached encouraged motivated cajoled and inspired them to give their best may be as long as the Atlanta phone book in 1953 the year he arrived in Atlanta.

From the mid-1950s through 2000 Brad was an active and influential volunteer. He helped lead Community Chest and United Way campaigns headed the Graduate School of Banking of the South at Louisiana State University from 1971-74; and chaired the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce in 1974 the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra board in 1976-78 and the Woodruff Arts Center board in 1983-85. From 1983-88 he served the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta as deputy chairman then chairman of the board. He was an outside director of Genuine Parts Company and Brown & Brown Inc. Standard-Coosa-Thatcher Company Dempster Brothers Inc. and Enzymatic Deinking Technologies LLC. He also served on the boards of the American Paper Institute the American Forest and Paper Association and the Paperboard Packaging Council and was a founder of the Paper Recycling Coalition. In education he was a trustee of Randolph-Macon Woman’s College The Lovett School and Emory University where he served as chair from 1994-2000.

Immediately following “retirement” he went to work on water policy in Georgia and the so-called water war between Georgia Florida and Alabama that started in 1990. Three governors appointed him to committees and councils charged with problem-solving related to water supply and conservation. He was particularly proud of contributing to the accomplishments of the ACF (Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint) Stakeholders a board of fifty-six people from three states. He recruited key board members helped raise the money for engineering studies and computer modeling and worked to keep the economic development interests and environmental interests all in the same tent. After five years of hard work all fifty-six people on that board agreed that they “could live with” a Sustainable Water Management Plan for the ACF basin. The plan did not stop the litigation which reached the U.S. Supreme Court but it did show that stakeholders who depend on the river basin from all three states and all four sub-basins could agree on a practical solution to the twenty-six-year-old water war.

As much as he valued his work Brad was most proud of his big family: his brothers and sisters his wife and children nieces nephews and grandchildren. Beyond work and family the things that mattered the most to him were the following: First St. Luke’s Episcopal Church’s acquisition of the full two blocks of land on which the church is located. Second working with L. L. Gellerstedt Jr. Ivan Allen III George Goodwin and others to roll out the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce slogan “Atlanta the World’s Next Great City” in the early 1970s. This same group traveled the world securing foreign consulates and persuading international airlines to initiate service to Atlanta. Third his work with Mrs. Betty Sands Fuller to keep Robert Shaw as the genius leading the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus when he was at risk of being fired. Fourth establishing the Paper Recycling Coalition as the voice for paper recycling in the USA. And lastly the Sustainable Water Management Plan completed in 2015 by the ACF Stakeholders that proved that intractable differences can be resolved by stakeholders using facts science engineering and the willingness of the participants to recognize that as Brad would say “nobody gets everything they want!”

GPN,Global Payments,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vZW5nYWdlLnNpbmNoLmNvbS9ibG9nL3ZpYmVyLXBheW1lbnRzLWxhdW5jaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Viber to launch payments: Users will be able to pay with wallet and transfer money,"The messaging app Viber who is owned by the Japanese tech company Rakuten is launching ""Payments"". The new fintech service enables users to pay for goods and services with a wallet and transfer money directly in the app.

According to McKinsey the global payments could generate 2.5 trillion US dollars in revenue by 2025 — and the messaging app Viber is ready to get a slice of that. Rakuten the Japanese company who is behind Viber has now announced that it will launch a new payment service ""Payments on Viber"" first in Europe then globally.

As TechCrunch reports the payments services will first launch in Greece and Germany. Other countries throughout Europe will follow and Viber wants to roll out Payments globally later in 2022 and 2023.

What can you do with Viber's Payments?

Payments on Viber will allow users to set up a wallet in the app. This wallet will be linked to the user's bank account or credit cards. The wallet can then be used to pay for goods bills and also to transfer money to other individuals. All of this will be possible directly in the app.

The peer-to-peer launch will be the first option to start and will be free of charge. Payments to businesses will most likely include a fee.

Why will Viber Payments first launch in Greece and Germany?

Given that Russia and Ukraine are Viber's biggest markets it seems surprising that Rakuten is launching the fintech service in Greece and Germany. However due to the current unstable political situation Rakuten decided to focus on other countries first.

In Greece the Viber messenger app is in fact also very popular. It's installed on 91 percent of the country's smartphones. This comes out to roughly seven million users (out of a population of 10.7 million). Germany on the other hand only counts three million Viber users as most Germans prefer WhatsApp as a messaging service. However Viber CEO Ofir Eyal described Germany as a ""strong corridor"" for Viber payments to Greece.

Will Payments replace other Viber finance services?

The new Viber Payments are not the first fintech service the app offers its users. In some countries such as Ukraine or Hungary users are already able to send money transfers and use chatbot payments in the messaging app. According to the company these services will remain in place for now but will eventually be replaced by Payments.

For the new launch Rakuten has partnered with Rapyd a fintech-as-a-service company who will manage the first two launches.

Rakuten's move into the payment space of messaging app is the latest in a row of messenger services that are looking to monetize the growing usage of messaging apps around the world. WhatsApp for example has been working on launching a payment service in Brazil and India Instagram has just announced a new in-chat payment feature on Instagram Direct and other messaging services like Telegram or Signal are even rolling out first cryptocurrency payment features.

As customers are moving from social media channels to messaging apps to talk to businesses many messenger app providers have been adding fintech features. The idea is to offer more convenient in-chat services that can help companies grow their business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL3NpZ25hbC1jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS1wMnAtcGF5bWVudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Signal's cryptocurrency P2P payments have quietly gone global,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL3NpZ25hbC1jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS1wMnAtcGF5bWVudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93aHktd2UtdXNlLW1vcmUtY2FzaC10aGFuLWV2ZXItMTAyMDA4NzQ0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why we use more cash than ever,"Last week I returned from a two-week trip to Europe where I didn’t spend any money at all. Or at least not any cash.

To be clear I visited Finland Sweden and Denmark without using any paper money (or coins). I never used any euros or krona or krone. And not only that I never saw anyone spending money period. Meaning I didn’t see anyone fumbling around in their pockets for bills or heaven forbid change. (Not even that drunk guy at the 7-Eleven in Copenhagen.) Everyone used cards and phones.

It really hit me and so I decided to explore this notion of an increasingly cash-free world. Will money completely disappear? If so how far along are we? And how is COVID-19 and the rise of crypto shaping this shift? Now I understand the concept of a cashless society isn’t especially new and that cash is hardly dead. Having said that there are some decidedly new elements here.

First consider how our thinking about money and cash has changed over recent history. I remember neighbors paying me cash to shovel snow as a kid. After that I remember getting a paycheck in 1974 from my first job as a dishwasher at the Sir Walter Raleigh Inn Steakhouse in Bethesda Maryland. Then there was the changeover from checks to direct deposit at Fortune Magazine sometime in the 1980s.

In short I haven't been in cash since I was a kid. And of course today I pay the young guy in Maine who cuts my grass — and sells me eggs — by Venmo (PYPL). To be sure in some instances cash is still king (some places in NYC still accept only cash). Some people can’t afford or don’t want bank accounts. Some merchants bridle at credit card fees. And bad guys prefer cash. But the trend is going the other way.

So is cash really dead? It depends on what you mean by “it's dead” says Kenneth Rogoff a professor of economics at Harvard and the author of ""The Curse of Cash."" “It’s certainly less and less used at the corner grocery. Cash used to dominate small transactions and that's increasingly not true. Debit cards especially— and smartphones credit cards — are pushing cash increasingly out of small transactions.”

It also appears the decline of cash is accelerating. This from a JP Morgan report in October titled ""Payments are eating the world."" (Yes the Andreessen trope again.) “In 2010 the fastest way to move money on the same day from New York to London was to catch a flight from JFK to Heathrow and deliver it yourself. Now you can initiate a secure real-time payment that’s sent and received into your account in seconds at virtually no cost and in any currency.""

Story continues

Cellphone adoption has sped things up too the report notes: “In 2016 there were 3.67 billion smartphone subscriptions. That figure has now doubled — and by 2026 91% of the global population will have a smartphone.”

Yes debit cards have become a force. “Last year debit had a 28% share of all payment used” says Jeremy Balkin global head of innovation & corporate development payments at JPMorgan and co-author of the above report. “That’s higher than credit cash and any other form. Quite remarkable.”

Now layer on COVID. Like so many facets of our lives the pandemic is altering our relationship with money. Home-bound shoppers created a huge wave of cashless transactions at a time when even handling money was thought to be unsafe. Bloomberg reports that “COVID-19 shifted $5 trillion in global retail sales from offline to online”—a good chunk of which was cash or “47% in the euro area” for instance. The chart from McKinsey (below) hints at that.

So the amount of currency the U.S. mint is printing must be going down right? Not exactly. Before we get into that it’s important to understand the difference between (1) how much the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (or BEP as it’s known by the cognoscenti) is printing and (2) how much currency is in circulation which has continued to grow substantially. So while BEP printed 1.7 billion $1 bills in 2013 and expects to print only 1 billion this year there were still 13 billion $1 bills in circulation in 2020 versus 7.7 billion in 2000. (NB: There were 47.3 million more people living in the U.S. in 2020 versus 2000.)

Now let’s look at the big picture. In 2000 the BEP printed 9 billion total bills worth $67 billion. This year it expects to produce between 6.8 billion and 9.6 billion bills worth between $310 billion and $356 billion. So around the same amount or perhaps fewer bills than 2000 but worth some five times more. How to explain that?

Very simply: A massive surge in the printing of Benjamins aka $100 bills. The math: In 2000 there were 3.8 billion $100 bills in circulation but as of 2020 there were 16.4 billion worth respectively (duh) $380 billion and $1.6 trillion. And BEP plans on printing another 2.4 to 2.2 billion $100 bills this year. The total amount of all U.S bills in circulation is around 2.2 trillion so you can see that the value of $100 bills now dwarfs other currencies.

Rogoff says there are a number of reasons for this insatiable demand for $100 bills. “One is that interest rates are really low. Holding cash isn’t really different from holding treasury bills” he points out. “I’ve argued that a large part of cash holdings are explained mostly by tax evasion but also of course by illicit activity like drug dealing arms dealing you name it. But it’s mostly tax evasion.”

Darrell Duffie a professor of economics at Stanford's Graduate School of Business who focuses on financial innovation concurs. “Those hundreds are going to international and national stockpiles of illegal stores of paper money” he says. “If you’re a criminal or you have some other reason to avoid being on the grid then you’re going to stack your money up in hundred dollar bills.""

“It’s great for the government in the sense a lot of this money sits around for a long long time and nobody claims it against the U.S. government. The U.S. has more of this than any other country by far. On the other hand it supports criminal behavior. It’s a tradeoff. The government tolerates it because paper money is a pretty popular anonymous instrument.” So maybe that guy flying from JFK to Heathrow with the satchel of money doesn’t really care if it’s not the fastest way.

Speaking of money going overseas just how many of these $100 bills are leaving our shores? More than half it appears (see chart below.)

A chart that shows the growth of foreign holdings of U.S. dollar banknotes. (Source: U.S. Treasury Department) (Yahoo Finance)

Of course no one knows how many $100 bills are in some Belgian bank that's holding hundreds in lieu of some ultra-low yielding Euro bond versus in the vault of some narco-arms-dealing terrorist. But it is the case that the U.S. Treasury is supplying both.

(A million dollars in $100 bills in case you’re wondering weighs about 22 pounds they say. A double stack would be about 21.5 inches high by 12.28 inches by 2.61 inches. You could carry it in a big briefcase or as I suggested a satchel.)

Another point to dig into here is the degree to which the cash and non-cash worlds are increasingly becoming like so many things today bifurcated in this case along economic lines. Meaning poor technology-deprived populations use cash much more than wealthy technological-rich groups.

A somewhat opaque report from Merchant Machine a British payment information website ranks “The Countries Most Reliant on Cash In 2021"" as: Romania Egypt Kazakhstan Bulgaria Ukraine Morocco Philippines Peru Hungary and Vietnam. Not exactly the developed world and all except Hungary below the world average in GDP per capita of around $11000 per annum.

There are predictably cash advocates. Check out Cash Matters — A pro cash movement that “is proud to work closely” with (and perhaps funded by) what appears to be European ATM printing and transaction trade groups as well as “JA til kontanter” a Norwegian group (“Yes to Cash” in English.) (Here we go with the Nordic countries again.) This organization exists “with the goal of defending cash in Norway's payments landscape by getting as many members as the SV Party” the latter that country’s Socialist Left Party which “is opposed to European Union membership and supports republicanism in Norway.”

No matter what you think of that it’s not all bunk. Or as the site notes: “Smart and online technologies are changing the way we pay however cash is still the most attractive means of payment for a huge majority of people worldwide.” The site then goes on to “look at 10 key reasons for the relevance of cash.” Saying: “Cash ensures stable currency systems. It is not only the most secure means of payment and resilient in terms of crisis it also reflects a nation’s identity as banknotes and coins are often a nation’s calling card valued by people beyond their monetary worth.”

So you can look at it in one of two ways (or both) that cash is only used by poor people and they need to change and it will be good for them and it’s a great business opportunity. Or that we should be mindful and careful that these people have access to money and be wary of the change that might leave them behind.

A 'less cash' society decade

Now let’s quickly look at the role crypto plays. Clearly it’s an accelerant but to what degree is unclear. Two of the countries on the biggest cash user list above Egypt and Morocco are also two of eight countries that have banned crypto. On the other hand some other developing countries may soon be using crypto as legal tender as El Salvador does.

You see a few companies accepting crypto but as Darrin Peller a stock analyst at Wolfe Research who covers payment companies Visa and Mastercard says: “Using crypto to go to the store to buy a shirt is fixing a problem that doesn't exist. Is there a problem using money today to buy a shirt at a store? Why use bitcoin for it or other blockchain technology if everything works well for the consumer now? Number two the technology behind crypto blockchain on a per transaction basis isn’t as efficient. It’s more expensive slower uses more computing power and has a lot of issues relative to what we have today in domestic processing. That might change over time but it’s a problem to fix. And another problem is the volatility of crypto.”

There’s a kind of halfway between crypto and fiat currency (as old-school money is called) which is known as central bank digital currency (or CBDC) which countries see as a way to co-opt the trend to digital currency as well as combat tax evasion and criminal activity. Right now as many as 87 countries are exploring a central bank digital currency.

“That scenario is basically the government saying ‘I don’t want us to lose control of our monetary system to crypto which is a decentralized system so I'm going to offer a centralized alternative stabilized by my own currency’” says Peller.

“No question it’s a response to crypto” Rogoff adds. “Governments realize they need to regulate. In the case of bitcoin they’ll probably ban its use in transactions. They find it difficult politically to do that until they’ve provided an alternative.”

Duffie of Stanford says the tradeoffs are really big with CBDCs. “On the positive side with the decline of paper money the government wants to be a part of the payment system and this is the substitute. They want payments to be easier and more inclusive for people without bank accounts. The downsides are also pretty big. When was the last time the government did a massive piece of technical infrastructure really well? The other downside is huge: Americans are concerned when a government agency has all their private data in a giant database.”

As I said this has been going on for quite some time. Barron’s did a cover story titled “The End of Cash?” by Alexander Eule in December 2012 which hits the mark. The big takeaway was that Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) were then in the catbird seat. The article noted one analyst who had a price target of $611 on Mastercard and $172 on Visa. How did the stocks do? Well. Very well. Mastercard now trades for $376 a share but the stock split 10 for one in January 2014 (or $3760 taking accounting for the split.) As for Visa it now trades for $223 but it split four for one in March 2015 (which would be $892 split adjusted).

That was then and this is now though. The stocks of both Visa and Mastercard underperformed last year and some including billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya say the glory days for these companies have passed. Of course not everyone agrees but Palihapitiya argues that the companies are a ""completely contrived duopoly that doesn't need to exist” citing Amazon’s recent ban of Visa credit cards in the UK because of what Amazon indicates are high transaction fees. It’ll be interesting to see how V and MA trade over the next five years.

For those who will miss real cash fear not. The U.S. Mint makes all kinds of currency and collectibles: paper sheets of bills (all sold out perhaps after former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s wife Louise Linton upped their profile) as well as ""The Lucky Money Collection"" featuring “distinctive artwork that celebrates Chinese symbolism and numerology.”

(There are also coins and medals of Barbara Bush Barack Obama and Donald Trump as well as Negro Leagues Baseball players — just out this past Thursday! — Kennedy Half Dollars Peace Silver Dollars Native American $1 Coins the American Innovation $1 Coin Program and the American Women Quarters Program. Truly something for everyone.)

Where is this all headed? Probably not to a cashless society (at least not for a few decades) but a “less cash” society decade as Shelle Santana of the Harvard Business School wrote not long ago. We still need cash. For instance USA Today reports some 25% of Americans are either unbanked or underbanked (they use financial products and services outside the banking system). “That means about 25% of all Americans would be unable — or limitedly able — to participate in a cashless system” the USA Today article noted.

“I don't think it’ll ever disappear. I think it’ll go down to a very small percentage after many many years” Peller says. “I think there will be the ability to have digital transactions over 90% in the next decade.”

“I think we’ll have some form of paper currency with us for a long time but it will become increasingly vestigial” Rogoff says. “As it gets harder to launder paper currency demand for it will drop. If you’ve got $5 million in hundred dollar bills — people offered that for a house for example — and want to keep it under the radar screen you have to be able to gradually spend it down.”

Criminals of all stripes use many types of money and payments but it’s interesting the bad guys now seem to use both the oldest (i.e. cash) and the newest (crypto) forms as their preferred vehicles these days. The common denominator of course is both are difficult to track. Curbing their behavior would require more regulatory oversight and many Americans are often uncomfortable with that.

There’s a trade-off and a cost to everything right?

(A previous version of this story stated that the BEP expects to print only 1 million $1 bills this year. In fact it expects to print 1 billion. The article has been corrected.)

On this date in baseball history former Texas Rangers pitchers Ferguson Jenkins and Gaylord Perry were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Jenkins and Perry became the first two players to wear a Rangers uniform to reach the Hall of Fame though both wore different caps on their induction plaques. Jenkins wore his Chicago Cubs hat while Perry settled on the San Francisco Giants.

Jenkins played for the Rangers from 1974-75 and again from 1978-81. He became the franchise’s first 20-game winner in 1974 during which he was named the American League Comeback Player of the Year and finished second in AL Cy Young voting. That season Jenkins led the Rangers with 25 wins 328 innings pitched and 29 complete games all of which were new team records. In his career with the Rangers he went 93-72 with a 3.56 ERA in 197 starts throwing 90 complete games and 17 shutouts. He struck out 895 batters and walked 315.

For his career Jenkins went 284-226 with a 3.34 ERA 267 complete games 49 shutouts 3192 strikeouts and 997 walks. He also played for Philadelphia and Boston. He won the National League Cy Young in 1971 with the Cubs.

Perry played 22 seasons and spent time with San Francisco Cleveland Texas San Diego the New York Yankees Atlanta Seattle and Kansas City. With the Rangers from 1975-77 along with 1980 Perry went 48-43 with a 3.26 ERA 55 complete games 12 shutouts 575 strikeouts and 190 walks. At the time of his election his ERA with the Rangers was the second-lowest in club history.

For his career Perry went 314-265 with a 3.10 ERA 303 complete games 50 shutouts 3354 strikeouts and 1379 walks. Perry won 20 games in a season five times and was one of a handful of pitchers to win 100 games in each league.

Built on a cluster of islands in the Venetian lagoon with centuries-old buildings rising from the canals in all their decadent glory Chioggia is called “piccola Venezia” or little Venice. Locals beg to disagree: If anything they say it’s nearby Venice that should be described as Chioggia’s larger doppelgänger and it’s true Chioggia is older. Venice is so worried about being overwhelmed once again after the pandemic that it is planning to resort to surveillance cameras and cellphone data to control the crowds; visiting other culturally rich places like Chioggia can help relieve the pressure. Today Chioggia is popular with Italian and German visitors drawn both by the architectural beauties in the historic center and the family-friendly beaches of its mainland suburb Sottomarina. The city which has preserved a rough maritime vibe can serve as an ideal base for bicycle tours. It is also known for its radicchio. During a time of increased awareness of overtourism this miniature Venice is a delightful alternative for travelers looking for a lesser-known destination.

Marcio Jose Sanchez | AP

The Buffalo Bills are seeking a new $1.3 billion National Football League stadium. The Chicago Bears are spending $197 million to acquire land that could eventually be their new home. FedEx Field is falling apart and Washington Football Team is lobbying for a new stadium in Virginia. A few Major League Baseball teams including the Kansas City Royals Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays want new parks. In the National Basketball Association the Los Angeles Clippers have already started to build their $1.2 billion arena. The Philadelphia 76ers are angling the Dallas Mavericks could be lurking. And then there's the National Hockey League with the Phoenix Coyotes. Teams are are seeking venue upgrades and could invest more than $10 billion for development by 2030. The bigger U.S. sports leagues have already secured national media revenue so now teams want to increase revenue in other areas. New and revamped arenas are one way they can. Sports clubs can attract lucrative naming rights and sponsorship deals with new buildings. There's also a potential real estate play with franchises including the Atlanta Braves and Milwaukee Bucks using their new buildings as anchors for massive real estate projects. That development helps generate even more money for teams. Still there remains a debate about who should fund sports projects and what will be different in a post-pandemic environment. CNBC spoke to executives about the sports stadium and arena landscape and what's to come.

Smaller venues more experiences

In the last 20 years teams maximized arena revenue by adding larger corporate suites club and general admission seating. However the ongoing Covid pandemic is changing that thinking. Bill Mulvihill the head of U.S. Bank sports and entertainment group assisted in financing the Los Angeles Rams SoFi Stadium which cost $5 billion. He echoed others who predict smaller venues on the horizon for the next generation of stadiums and arenas. Mulvihill said more clubs are creating plans for in-arena spectators and TV viewers. ""The idea is to have some unique fan experiences not just drive up the total number of people in your building"" he said. ""I think the talk and the trend are smaller capacities overall when talking about arenas"" added Rob Tillis of investment firm Inner Circle Sports. ""The bigger NFL stadiums will maintain large capacity."" To enhance the value proposition of attending games you may notice your favorite team is leveraging seating experiences like the NFL's field-level suites. The Texas Rangers incorporated new seating options for Globe Life Field – their $1.2 billion ballpark. It includes suites on the field and two field-level lounges along the first and third baseline. CNBC took a tour of the Rangers' new park last August. The field suites were pretty enjoyable and sitting in the lounges felt like watching a baseball game while at a local sports bar with the field actual field nearby. ""These new buildings are focused more on providing a variety of premium seating projects to meet the demands of the market"" said Dan Barrett president at CAA Icon the stadium and arena planning division of agency CAA Sports. ""We're competing against the 80-inch television in your living room"" said New York Islanders owner Jon Ledecky who in November 2021 opened the $1 billion UBS Arena. ""All these new arenas will have to give fans a reason to get up – go to their car and come to the event. If we don't have a first-class experience they're going to watch the game at home"" Ledecky added. To paint a picture of future experiences Mulvihill pointed to Madison Square Garden and New York Knicks owner James Dolan's project in Las Vegas. The MSG Sphere a $1.8 billion entertainment venue will feature tech that allows spectators to hear concerts in different languages and an infrasound haptic system – a vibrating floor. ""I think some of the ideas he's talking about how to view a concert in a different way could carry over to the sports space"" Mulvihill said. ""If that technology is slick and works it could be transferrable to other venues.""

Sustainability grab-and-go technology

UBS Arena was built during the pandemic which caused delays. But development firm Oak View Group rose to the challenge and invested $2 million in germ-killing air flirtation systems something more teams will consider installing. Another 2021 Oak View project is Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle where the NHL's Kraken play. Executives praised the Kraken's new home noting it's carbon-neutral and powered by solar and electricity. ""Almost every arena will try to be carbon-neutral going forward"" said Oak View CEO Tim Leiweke. ""I think you're going to see more of a commitment toward sanitation."" The arena also uses grab-and-go tech from Amazon that lets customers pay for items automatically without having to check out with a cashier. (Amazon pioneered this technology in some of its convenience and grocery stores.) Barrett from CAA Icon — which oversaw Climate Pledge and the Golden State Warriors' Chase Center in San Francisco — thinks facial recognition tech automated concessions and robotics will also expand. ""Climate Pledge and [Chase Center] have set the bar high from a technology standpoint fan engagement and fan experience"" he said. ""That's until the Clippers building comes online. I'm sure given Ballmer's background he'll want [Intuit Dome] to be the model going forward.""

Intuit Dome will include a double-sided Halo video board with 44000 square feet of LED lights and use walk-out tech for concessions. ""In five to 10 years when Ballmer is done some of the older buildings are going to look really old really quickly"" said Tillis. ""They're going to look like dinosaurs and won't have the additional revenue-generating capabilities.""

But who pays the bill?

Technological enhancements aside there are still debates surrounding who should fund sports venues. In 2016 the Brookings Institute published a paper against using public dollars to fund stadiums. The report estimated from 2000 to 2014 more than $3 billion in tax revenue was lost on tax-exempt municipal bonds used to finance pro sports venues. Leiweke who aligned the Islanders with private money to build UBS Arena agrees that it's best to avoid public funds. ""Municipalities and states need to be spending their money on schools education transportation and life safety"" said Leiweke. ""Now there is an ever-evolving thinking going on about how we [privately] finance these buildings and operate these teams to find new revenue streams going forward"" he added. In most circumstances teams have leverage when soliciting public dollars and sometimes threaten to relocate if they don't get the money. That can hurt local economies. But after St. Louis sued the Rams for departing in 2016 – receiving a $790 million settlement – teams will probably think twice before relocating.

Hence in western New York the NFL's Buffalo Bills owner Pegula Sports and Entertainment is expected to split the cost of a new venue with the state. Engineering firm AECOM released a report estimating a $1.35 billion price tag for a new venue near the existing Highmark Stadium and projected a minimum of $300 million more for a downtown stadium. The Bills' lease at Highmark expires in July 2023 and the team's goal is to be operating in a new 60000-seat field by 2027. Asked if inflation worries could impact financing for sports owners Mulvihill responded: ""These are long-term 20 30-year decisions for owners cities and states. The 10 percent increase in the cost to build is not materially changing those decisions."" Barrett projected up to $15 billion would be invested in new pro sports venues over the next 15 years. That estimate increases to $20 billion when calculating renovation projects. Both Barrett and Mulvihill suggest more teams will remodel than start new. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Green Bay Packers are among the NFL teams looking to remodel. In the Packers' case they raised money by issuing $90 million of public stock to help fund a $250 million renovation project to Lambeau Field. ""You're going to see significant investments over the next 10 to 15 years"" said Barrett adding Major League Soccer franchises including champions NYCFC among teams lurking for new stadiums.

Fintech and crypto looking to spend

Should clubs line up private financing which they usually do more revenue awaits. The Clippers aligned nearly $1 billion in naming and partnership deals for Intuit Dome which is scheduled to open in 2024. Paul Danforth president of CAA Sports said fintech and crypto companies are particularly eager to spend money on sports to establish their brand in a digital age. Danforth cautioned markets like Buffalo shouldn't expect megadeals like Los Angeles teams ""but it's still a great opportunity for a brand in upstate New York and into the NFL."" Said Danforth ""In the past they couldn't afford to buy naming rights. But some of these businesses are growing at such a rapid pace that it's accelerating their opportunity to be in those conversations. And these opportunities don't come around that often. So that's why brands want to be associated with them"" he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS92aWRlby9nb2xkZW4tZ2xvYmVzLXJhY2hlbC16ZWdsZXItcmVhY3RzLTA1MjAxNjczNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Golden Globes: Rachel Zegler reacts to Best Actress win for West Side Story by sharing 'strange' coincidence,"West Side Story star Rachel Zegler has reacted to winning a Golden Globe by sharing a “strange” coincidence.

The actor 20 won the Best Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Musical award on Sunday (9 January) for her role of Maria in Steven Spielberg’s film.

Zegler wasn’t present at the ceremony due to as Hollywood boycott of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) that led to NBC pulling the event from its television schedules.

She became one of the first winners to react to their victory though writing on Twitter that she won the award three years to the day she was cast in West Side Story.

“I got cast as Maria in West Side Story on 1/9/1 and I just won a Golden Globe for that same performance on 1/9/22” she wrote adding: “Life is very strange.”

Ariana DeBose won Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film which went on to win Best Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.

Reddit first announced that it had quietly filed for an IPO back in December and is now aiming for a valuation of over $15 billion USD. Its last private funding round led by Fidelity investments in August of 2021 had the company valued at $10 billion USD.

In an earlier announcement Reddit shared that it had made more than $100 million USD in ad revenue in Q2 of 2021 marking a 192 percent increase from its figures last year. “We’ve grown up in the shadow of Facebook and Google and pretty much every dollar we make we’ve had to fight for” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told The New York Times in an interview.

The price range and the number of shares offered have yet to be determined. Stay tuned for more information to be announced soon.

Jill Su's Life Mattered,"In 2014 a wealthy south Florida woman Jill Halliburton Su was murdered:

The wife of a prominent professor and a relative of the founders of the billion-dollar Halliburton oil empire Su lived in an upscale mansion in a gated Florida community. In her spare time she read to the blind and raised money for various charities. But everything changed Monday when Su 59 was found dead in a bizarre murder mystery that is raising more questions than answers. “She was always involved in helping others. She was the first person to volunteer for anything” says her friend Theresa Randolph who she has known for more than a decade. “Just a very sweet kind giving woman.” On Monday morning Dr. Nan Yao Su a professor of entomology at the University of Florida’s Research and Education Center in Fort Lauderdale tried to watch the live feed of his home’s security cameras. When he was unable to see the feed he called home. Receiving no answer he called his adult son and asked him to check on the house. When the son arrived at the waterfront mansion he found a chilling scene. A glass door had been broken; shards of glass covered the ground. At least one room had been ransacked. And worst of all his mother was lying dead in a bathtub.

Police eventually arrested Dayonte Resiles for the murder. His DNA was found on the murder weapon. He went on trial late last year. He is black; his victim was white. The result:

Dayonte Resiles killed Jill Halliburton Su by stabbing her to death and leaving her lifeless body in a bathtub in her Davie home — on that much jurors could agree. But they couldn’t agree on a murder charge according to the jury forewoman because three members refused to sign off on a verdict that would send a young Black man to prison for the rest of his life. For a short time the nine who wanted a first-degree murder conviction were willing to budge. A manslaughter conviction would send Resiles to prison for 15 years not for life. All 12 jurors signed off on manslaughter late Tuesday. But that according to the forewoman would not have been justice. Not for her. Not for the defendant. Not for the victim. “What have I done?” she thought. In an interview Thursday night the forewoman who asked not to be identified by name shed light on what happened in the deliberation room in the days leading up to the hung jury and mistrial describing a cauldron of anger mistrust betrayal and underscoring it all accusations of racial and anti-police bias. It came to a head Tuesday night when the manslaughter verdict was read and the forewoman was faced with the usually-routine question of whether she agreed with the group’s decision. Only a few seconds passed but the forewoman’s mind was racing. She thought of the victim and the family left behind. She felt the eyes of the judge and the prosecutor and the victim’s husband boring into her. She was torn between her agreement with her fellow jurors and her firm belief that the prosecution proved Resiles guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt. “I just got a knot in the pit of my stomach. I looked at the defense table. They were just cheering and patting him on the back like he graduated high school or made the winning touchdown at a football game” she said. “I thought what have I done? Is this the world I am creating for my children a world where someone can get away with murder because of the color of their skin?” Finally she recalled the advice her husband gave her before the trial started: “Follow the law. Don’t cave.” She was convinced Resiles did not commit manslaughter on Sept. 8 2014 — he committed murder. Manslaughter was not her verdict. “No” she told the judge. She didn’t agree. Her answer prompted the judge to send the jury back to the deliberation room. Her fellow jurors were incensed she recalled. “If I do leave here with friends that would be great” she recalled saying. “But at the end of the day I’m not here to make friends. I’m here to give justice to Jill. This was about her.”

The holdout juror who is a mixed-race Puerto Rican said that some black jurors accused her of not caring about the life of a black man who would go to prison for life if he were convicted of murder (versus manslaughter). Her refusal at the last minute to affirm the manslaughter charge made it possible to retry Resiles. Jury selection for the retrial began this month. (Another juror this one a white man later claimed that there was no racial animosity among jurors though he did not explain why he believes that Resiles was guilty of murder but he agreed to the manslaughter verdict.)

Richard Hanania observes:

Exactly. And this is why the further along we get in mainstreaming CRT the closer we will come to civil war. You cannot expect people to sit back and accept that the murderer of their loved one should get a lesser sentence because of the color of his skin. Black people in this country had to live with that for many years. It was monstrously unjust. It always will be unjust to dole out justice on the basis of race wealth or anything else other than individual guilt or innocence. Our legal system cannot survive jurors who are willing to send people to prison and keep them out of prison on the basis of the defendant’s race. While we will never be able to achieve a system capable of producing perfect justice we can get closer to that ideal. The Florida jury’s verdict is a huge step backward. It would be possible to look at this as an aberration except for the fact that as Hanania points out that immoral verdict is what you would expect under Critical Race Theory.

CRT and its implementation by institutional elites is tearing this country apart. While the media obsess over the MAGA yahoos of January 6 the real destruction of the American project is advancing through the law through medicine through business and through the education system. And it is a project of the illiberal Left.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been a part of the Abilene Independent School District for decades.

But the building formerly known as Reagan Elementary has a new purpose and its new occupants are looking to make the most out of what's available.

The former school building on Hartford Street in west Abilene now renamed to reflect its address as the Hartford Center is the district's home for all things related to professional development.

Gone are the cafeteria and gymnasium. They're now large-capacity conference rooms where teachers can come for their learning needs.

""The district has needed its own dedicated space for this"" said Ketta Garduno associate superintendent for curriculum and instruction. ""In the past we'd ended up farming out to other buildings in the district. This gives us our own dedicated space.""

That's only a portion of the old school facility though. There's another piece to the puzzle that is Hartford Center. And it's a public-facing one with implications for thousands of school children and their families.

New home same service

Darrin Cox was running out of room in the basement of One AISD Center.

There Cox maintained an elaborate storage room filled with any number of supplies for children. Clothing racks filled with sweatshirts and pants filled a room lined with shelves of sneakers and other shoes. All items in any size that a student at the district could need.

There were also other supplies such as notebooks pens and pencils scissors and glue. And backpacks to put them in.

Those materials aren't available for just any student though. Cox is in charge of the district's response to homeless students as classified under the federal McKinney-Vento Act. There's a process by which students and families qualify for Cox's assistance.

What started a few years ago in a tiny closet next to his office in the federal programs division of the district's administration building has outgrown two large rooms in the underground area of the former downtown shopping mall.

Taking over what was originally the administrative offices of the former Reagan Elementary along with a few of the classrooms closest to Hartford Street Cox now has more room to spread out and improve the experience for those coming to either request his services or repeat.

""Here what's nice about this new space: one of classrooms can be almost a welcome center for those coming in"" Cox said. ""We have some booklets available. It's ... very welcoming. Our families who've used it already stress to me how welcoming it is.""

Room enough for you

In addition to the welcome space Cox said his new location offers three main rooms filled to the brim with supplies.

The first he said will focus primarily on the middle school experience. With those schools requiring standardized dress every piece of the uniform is available in many different sizes. Both for boys and girls.

This room also will have physical education clothing so that students requiring his services won't be without more athletic options during gym classes. Hygiene packs including toothbrushes and toothpaste along with underwear and socks — the two most requested items in his entire store — round out the room's contents.

In room No. 2 other clothing items are available. From jeans and slacks — part of Cox's mission is to make sure his older students have clothing that can help them secure jobs — to all kinds of shirts there's plenty of clothing options available Cox said.

Options are even available for infants he said both for children of homeless students and for families who have newly born siblings.

And the last room?

That's for the feet he said.

""The last room is the shoe room"" Cox said. ""And they're all new shoes ... 99.9% of them are new shoes.""

Last year Cox said his office helped about 1400 students. So far this year the number is about 820. So the extra space is pretty handy.

The shoe room will split space with the array of jackets and coats though as those items didn't fit in the other rooms.

One final room not accessible to the public is the new storage space Cox said. Offering a place to hold items that are essentially excess until the products out on display can be moved out to students it's massive.

""It's as big as our entire storage area I had plus half of the show room at (One AISD Center)"" Cox said.

Thinking ahead

Garduno meanwhile has the end of February circled on her calendar.

That is when the building's other use will get its first huge test.

Though the professional learning programs such as engage2learn's teacher training programs have been operating out of the space since it reopened in the fall there haven't been district-wide events.

Come Feb. 23 Garduno will know whether the plan works.

""One of the challenges is parking"" Garduno said. 'We're having to look at how can we economically meet our parking needs. There are only 100 spots right now. We need a lot more than that. Maybe we'll use Clack's parking lot. But we're thinking outside the box to try to solve these problems and make sure we're fully utilizing our facility.""

A facility like this one aimed at providing teachers with a dedicated space for their own learning and professional development is an important piece in Garduno's arsenal she said.

It gives coaches a place to call their own with dedicated space for their materials. But it also offers a clear path to getting back to helping teachers become their best professional selves.

Garduno said that was one of the best parts of being a campus principal once she left the classroom behind and entered administration.

""When I was a campus principal one of the things I enjoyed the most was working with teachers including younger teachers who were just out of school"" Garduno said. ""I have missed that day-to-day interaction with those teachers.

""I believe we need to prepare our teachers with the tools they need and by investing in them we are going to be able to prepare our teachers well. Our local universities do fantastic jobs but the field of education is constantly changing. It's our responsibility to help the teachers with what they need. This facility gives us the opportunity to support those teachers.""

One of the biggest pieces evolving the most is technology.

The staff at the center will be well equipped both with the latest products such as applications and the hardware needed to run them Garduno said.

The center has a dedicated computer lab along with 16 rooms for professional learning. Hartford Center also has four mock classrooms where the district's educators can practice what they've seen before taking it to their classrooms.

Gym and cafeteria spaces are also available with 180 seats each as well for the big gatherings.

Out of the dungeon

Because the majority of space on the ground floor of One AISD Center is taken up with offices there were few options in the building for extra things.

Like Cox's homeless students operation or trainings like new teacher orientation in August.

""(We're) not downstairs where it's dark"" Cox said.

""We've done a lot of work using our people"" Garduno added. ""We've put in a lot of work making sure (Hartford Center) is inviting that it's clean.""

Cox's roughly 25 volunteers who help him maintain the stock and appearance of his operation probably appreciate not having to be downstairs practically by themselves he said.

It'll likely make all the difference in the world to anyone even the folks using the service he said.

""We have a small group of little old ladies who've been helping for the last two years"" he said. ""I really think the tide of this community is going to be strengthened with us (at Hartford Center).

By Ronni Newton

Rockledge Golf Course is closed to golfers for the season but the course is open to use for other purposes during the winter months.

The winter trails are now open for hiking cross country skiing or snowshoeing. And while dogs are permitted West Hartford Animal Control has received complaints about the behavior of dogs and their owners.

“Unfortunately we have to post some guidelines about dogs at Rockledge Country Club in town” a post on the West Hartford Animal Control Facebook page last week stated.

Complaints have included reports of dogs being off leash and rushing at other dogs and their owners dogs off leash destroying the greens and dog feces being left on the course. Officers have increased their patrols as a result.

“Please be respectful of each other and the wildlife that use this course” the post stated. “West Hartford residents have this wonderful privilege of being able to use this course for outdoor fun in the winter. These rules are the same rules that apply to other parks and school yards in town year round.”

Guidelines include:

Park only in the Rockledge Golf Club parking lot off South Main Street.

Trails are open from dawn to dusk every day.

Trails start and end at the Pro Shop. Do not cut across greens to reach trails.

Stay on the designated trails to avoid hazardous areas and prevent damage to the greens and tees.

Bicycles snowmobiles ATVs and motorized vehicles of any kind ARE NOT ALLOWED.

Dog waste must be bagged and removed from the area.

There are three marked trails: yellow trail (0.6 mile) red trail (1.6 miles); and the blue trail (2.2 miles). All three trails start and end at the Golf Shop and are clearly marked with colored markers spaced 0.1 mile apart.

Beaut’s got main character energy for days… and she’s given me the best year of my life. I love you my darling girl. 🦌♥️🌹”

One day later Schroeder enlisted a slew of her fellow Pump Rules alumni (and their own little ones) to help celebrate Hartford’s special day.

“Some birthday fun went down today” the Next Level Basic author shared via her Instagram Story on Saturday January 8 alongside snaps of Hartford wearing a fancy party dress next to her parents: Schroeder and husband Beau Clark. In succeeding slides Hartford is seen posing for snaps with the likes of Lala Kent Brittany Cartwright and Scheana Shay and their respective babies.

“The birthday girl all chic AF” the “Give Them Lala” podcast host 31 shared via Instagram Story on Saturday alongside a pic while she was holding the birthday girl.

Kent for her part also brought 9-month-old daughter Ocean — whom she shares with ex Randall Emmett — to the celebrations where the little one enjoyed playing in a pearl-inspired ball pit and taking selfies with mom.

The “Scheananigans with Scheana Shay” podcast host 36 and daughter Summer — whom she welcomed with fiancé Brock Davies in April 2021 — also attended. “Baby Swap” Shay captioned an Instagram Story snap on Saturday with Schroeder and the Kentucky native 32 as Shay held Ocean and Cartwright — who shares son Cruz with husband Jax Taylor — cradled Summer. “HBD Hartford!!!”

Schroeder’s party featured plenty of Hartford-themed decor including wrapping paper made of her portraits a gallery wall of photos and lots of mirrors and balloons.

“It’s the perfect present for Hartford” Schroeder gushed in a video sharing a delicate pair of hoop earrings from Kent. “It’s so special! I can’t they’re baby hoops!”

The Give Then Lala founder for her part explained at the time: “I wanted to get Hartford her first pair of hoops!”

Nearly one year after Clark 41 proposed to Louisiana native Us Weekly broke the news in June 2020 that Schroeder was expecting their first child. Hartford Charlie Rose Clark was born in January 2021.

“I’m ready to have a baby” she previously told Us in June 2019 about the possibility of having kids. “I’ve never really been someone that’s like dreamt about her wedding … but I always knew that I wanted to be a mom. So I feel like I’m in a place in my life where I make my own decisions and forge my own path. I know I want to be a mom so I would rather get knocked up before I waited to have a wedding.”

Jan. 8 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Healthcare workers across California are expressing shock and anger at the January 8th guidance issued by the California Department of Public Health allowing acute care hospitals psychiatric hospitals and skilled nursing facilities to bring healthcare workers back to work after they have tested positive for COVID-19 or been directly exposed without any testing or isolation periods.

Caregivers predict that compromising common sense safety requirements for testing and isolation will increase workplace outbreaks and put vulnerable patients at grave risk.

""For healthcare workers on the frontline it is very disappointing to see the State of California cave to employer pressure to bypass common sense safety measures"" said Gabe Montoya an emergency room technician at Kaiser Medical Center in Downey. ""No patient wants to be cared for by someone who has COVID-19 or was just exposed to it. There is testing available at our facilities and we should be able use that testing and test negative before returning to work if we are exposed or have tested positive. Caregivers need to be able to trust that the CDC and the State are putting the safety of patients and healthcare workers first.""

""Hospital workers cannot take much more"" adds Gisela Thomas a respiratory therapist at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs. ""Rather than compromising workplace safety precautions we need bolstering from state policy makers. California healthcare workers need paid COVID sick leave to support us when we contract COVID-19 while caring for patients and recognition bonuses to keep people on the job in the face of massive staffing shortages.""

SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW) the union representing 100000 California Healthcare workers vowed to protest the new guidance. The guidance is not binding on hospital employers who are allowed to maintain stricter precautions such as a requirement for a negative test before a COVID-19 positive or exposed healthcare worker returns to work.

""Our union will fight for safe working conditions for hospital workers who have continuously put their lives on the line during this pandemic"" says Dave Regan president of SEIU-UHW. ""We intend to expose any hospital employer who knowingly puts patients at risk by forcing COVID positive caregivers back to work.""

SEIU-UHW members include frontline workers such as respiratory care practitioners dietary environmental services and nursing staff who live and work throughout California from the Bay Area to Sacramento and Los Angeles to the Central Valley.

SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW) is a healthcare justice union of more than 100000 healthcare workers patients and healthcare activists united to ensure affordable accessible high-quality care for all Californians provided by valued and respected healthcare workers.

Memic Innovative Surgery announced this week that three U.S. facilities acquired the Hominis robot-assisted surgical system. HCA Florida Healthcare’s Kendall Regional Medical Center Advent Health Celebration and The Women’s Hospital at Jackson Memorial are the first U.S. facilities to acquire the Hominis surgical system.

Tel Aviv Israel-based Memic’s Hominis system will now be used at the facilities in single-site natural orifice laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal benign gynecological procedures including benign hysterectomy. The company touts Hominis as the first and only FDA-authorized surgical robot with miniature humanoid-shaped arms with shoulder elbow and wrist joints that provide human-level dexterity and 360-degree articulation.

Memic which in August 2021 confirmed its plans to go public in a SPAC merger designed the Hominis system to replicate the motions and capabilities of a surgeon’s arms requiring a smaller footprint with lower costs than conventional robotic systems the company said.

The system received FDA de novo clearance in February 2021. It raised $96 million in Series D funding in April 2021.

“We are proud to partner with these leading healthcare providers to empower surgeons with a better user experience and help them better serve the thousands of women who undergo gynecologic surgery each year” Memic Co-Founder & CEO Dvir Cohen said in the release. “These sites establish a strong foundation for expanding market adoption of Hominis including a leading robotic surgery center of excellence a 450-bed hospital owned by one of the largest U.S. hospital systems and a 1550-bed nonprofit teaching hospital affiliated with an acclaimed medical school.

“With their support we are expanding our commercial footprint to increase the reach of our proprietary technology and have a positive impact on the Florida region and elsewhere as we work to expand adoption of Hominis worldwide.”

After months of basketball games that exclusively allowed friends and family of team members in the stands students were the first fans permitted back inside of one of Vanderbilt’s most sacred sites.

When the pandemic arrived at a crossroads in February 2021 and nationwide cases declined sharply Memorial Gymnasium’s doors were opened back up to students the backbone of Vanderbilt’s home-court advantage.

After nearly a year of student support in stadiums and gyms the world has met another fork in the seemingly never-ending road that is the pandemic with the omicron variant. Despite taking necessary precautions which included various testing vaccination requirements and a delayed second semester we—students—are now the first ones being forced out of our own home gym this January.

As COVID-19 once again spreads rampantly throughout the United States Vanderbilt and its peer institutions have had a choice to make. Duke University elected to take classes online for the first week of the second semester but not restrict on-campus activities. Harvard University announced they would begin the second semester on-time on Jan. 24 but would restrict certain on-campus activities including attendance at athletics events until at least Jan. 23.

Vanderbilt took a different course of action. A course of action that was out of the hands of athletic director Candice Storey Lee and the Vanderbilt athletics department. A course of action even more extreme than many of its peer institutions. A course of action that is set to make it the most money while punishing its own students in the process.

As part of the University’s Commodores Care period that restricts in-person activities until Jan. 24 not a single student is permitted to claim their free ticket and step foot in Memorial Gymnasium for the next five Vanderbilt men’s and women’s basketball games combined. As students start to head back to campus for the start of classes on Jan. 18 none will be permitted to attend many of the most important basketball games of the year.

What won’t change on Saturday as the Vanderbilt men host South Carolina is the general public’s ability to attend Vanderbilt athletic events. Memorial Gymnasium will operate at 100 percent capacity for each of these five games.

No new restrictions exist on who can attend games—with proof of vaccination or a negative test anyone is permitted inside the gym. Instead of students sitting in sections G through K paying customers will grace the wooden bleachers where students have slapped the floor of Memorial Gymnasium for decades.

Currently for the asinine price of $200 the general public can watch Vanderbilt play Kentucky on Jan. 11 from the best seats in the house: the student section. The University restricted student section tickets to season ticket holders for $20 per ticket while saying they were unavailable for resale. Nonetheless they are still being resold on secondary platforms despite Vanderbilt’s urge against it.

Instead of upgrading season ticket holders to better seats for free donating tickets to community members or putting a cover over the student section completely effectively anyone with a vaccination card or proof of a negative test who is willing to pay will be able to sit in the student section over the next five home games.

Think about that for a second: Anyone except for Vanderbilt University students can attend Vanderbilt University basketball games through Jan. 24.

Vanderbilt has done an incredible job of keeping students staff and teachers healthy throughout the pandemic with positive case rates never rising above 0.6 percent last semester among the 96 percent of vaccinated Vanderbilt community members. Every step of the way I have been thankful for the University’s rigorous approach to COVID-19 prevention. It has allowed me to have the semblance of a healthy final two years at a place that has become a second home to me.

But this decision makes me sad.

It’s sad that the work that Lee Jerry Stackhouse and Shea Ralph have done to put Commodore basketball back on an upward trajectory won’t be rewarded with hundreds of students cheering for some of their most important games of this season. This decision straight from Kirkland Hall is rooted in no common sense or rationale and once again puts into question leadership’s alignment with Lee and athletics’ goals as a department.

Furthermore this decision demonstrates palpable hypocrisy and reflects shortsightedness from leadership that continues to fuel fans’ long-broadcasted concerns regarding the possibility for athletic success at Vanderbilt.

If restricting student attendance in Memorial Gym was truly a community health decision then I wonder why Vanderbilt still allows all members of society to attend our basketball games. How is the university choosing who is safe to attend a game?

Students are required to be vaccinated and subject to regular testing if they aren’t boosted. Students are mandated to provide proof of a negative test before arriving on campus for the second semester. Students had to wait an extra week to return as the opening of residence halls was delayed to allow for a buffer between holiday travel and return to campus.

Who is safer right now than students? If anyone at all should step inside Memorial Gymnasium over the next couple weeks it should be us.

If you want to limit attendance in stadiums fine. Why not go to 50 percent capacity in athletics facilities as many Canadian arenas have done? Limit attendance to just friends and family of the teams like peer universities such as Harvard have done. Or return to a system that permits students and friends and family only like last spring. But whatever you do don’t kick out those who should be your most prized constituency while maintaining full occupancy for others.

Vanderbilt won’t allow its healthiest and most protected fans into the building but it will open its doors in full force to elderly immuno-compromised unvaccinated and other vulnerable groups.

Any way you spin it it just doesn’t make sense.

We were the first ones welcomed back last February. We complied with twice-weekly testing last spring adhered to vaccine requirements on campus dealt with a new student ticketing process throughout the fall and as early as last week shifted our schedules to accommodate starting school a week later on just 10 days notice. Now we will arrive back to campus and not be able to go support our classmates and peers as they continue competing amidst a global pandemic.

Not only has Commodores Care overstepped its bounds for the regular student but it also impacts every student-athlete on campus as well. Student-athletes will maintain their rigorous training playing and travel schedule without the support of their student body in the crowd. It’s devastating for the coaches as well who each have their teams playing their best basketball in years.

Seniors won’t get to experience their final home men’s and women’s games against rival Tennessee as students. They won’t get to slap the court and help bring back Memorial Magic with the eyes of the nation watching on ESPN on Tuesday night as Stackhouse and the men battle Kentucky. They have once again been told by University leadership where athletics and supporting your classmates should sit in their list of priorities. And it’s far too low.

If nothing else it’s maddening that Vanderbilt couldn’t even use a bit of common sense in this decision.

While Commodores Care applies to all students 50 percent of Vanderbilt’s population lived off-campus in 2020-21. That likely leaves 2500 students at least not directly under university control despite the supposed “quiet” period of Commodores Care. Does the university believe that off-campus students will restrict themselves to their bedrooms for nine days at the beginning of the semester?

Instead of remaining on campus to go support their basketball teams over the next two weeks students will find other outlets for their down time. The nation will tune into ESPN and SEC Network for Commodore basketball games and see a student section full of everyone but students making the university look that much more foolish.

Vanderbilt athletics will once again appear as the laughing stock of the SEC as orange and blue paint the stands of Memorial Gymnasium. Vanderbilt leadership’s attempt to demonstrate a dedication to student health will only make recruits cringe force alumni to roll their eyes and drive students to find something else to do on a night in Nashville; this decision doesn’t prioritize students and it’s not making anyone any safer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzIxODg2LWhlcnNoZXktcmFpc2VzLWZ1bGwteWVhci1vdXRsb29r0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hershey raises full-year outlook,"HERSHEY PA. — The Hershey Co. overcame persistent supply chain disruptions to deliver double-digit sales growth across each of its business segments in the recent quarter.

“Second-quarter growth was broad-based with each segment delivering double-digit sales growth resulting in strong earnings per share” Michele G. Buck president and chief executive officer said in pre-recorded remarks ahead of a July 28 earnings call. “Organic net sales growth of 14% was driven by both price and volume gains while acquisitions contributed another 5 points of growth. Despite persistent broad-based supply chain disruptions our teams were able to increase production output and inventory levels during the quarter. This not only bolstered sales growth but also drove improvements in marketplace share performance and will enable us to more fully activate our portfolio in the second half of the year.”

While inflation is pressuring many Americans consumers are still purchasing branded snacks and candy rather than lower-priced private label items in those categories Ms. Buck said.

“I think across snacking what we tend to see is consumers very much like their brands” Ms. Buck said. “So if you look across total food as budgets are tighter certainly private label brands have grown share versus with across snacking private label has not and consumers tend to like their brands.”

In the second quarter North America Confectionery segment income increased 12% to $618.9 million behind pricing and volume gains that were partially offset by higher supply chain costs acquisitions costs and increased trade show and travel expenses versus the prior year. The segment’s net sales advanced 13% to $1.9 billion versus the same period last year. Candy mint and gum sales in the United States increased 5% driven by steady consumer demand and price increases.

“As we look to the second half we expect our higher inventory levels and increased advertising and merchandising to drive strong everyday sales and share performance” Ms. Buck said. “Chocolate media spending is projected to grow double digits in the second half and quality merchandising is also expected to increase.

“Seasonal consumer engagement is expected to remain high and we expect high single-digit sales growth for both our Halloween and holiday seasons. Despite this strong growth we will not be able to fully meet consumer demand due to capacity constraints.

“Given many of our everyday and seasonal products are made on the same line we have needed to balance production over the past several months to improve everyday on-shelf availability and build seasonal inventory at the same time. While this will likely result in second-half seasonal share pressures we expect our everyday share trends to remain strong behind higher inventory levels and more advertising and merchandising.”

North America Salty Snacks segment income jumped 44% to $37.4 million as pricing gains and higher volumes offset unfavorable mix acquisition-related costs and higher supply chain costs. Segment net sales soared 100% to $256.3 million largely driven by the Dot’s and Pretzels acquisitions as well as to a lesser extent net price realization.

“Our salty snacks brands continue to deliver tremendous growth and share gains” Ms. Buck said. “Over the past 12 weeks SkinnyPop retail sales grew 17% and share of the ready-to-eat popcorn segment increased 130 basis points to 24%. Growth is led by higher household penetration and stable buy rates as new pack sizes have enabled us to capture incremental occasions.

“Pirate’s Booty also continues to gain households via distribution gains while velocities remain strong resulting in 32% retail sales growth in the latest 12-week period. And Dot’s Pretzels growth continues to significantly outpace the pretzel category with 45% retail sales growth and 340 basis points of share gains over the past three months.

“To support this sustained elevated growth we continue to advance our strategic planning to optimize our salty snacks supply chain for additional capacity and margin efficiencies.”

Hershey’s International segment profit was $30.7 million up $3.1 million from the year-ago period reflecting volume gains and net price realization partially offset by higher supply chain and logistics costs advertising investment salary and benefit inflation and increased travel expenses. International segment net sales increased 21% to $207.2 million from the year-ago quarter.

“Consumer demand has remained strong across markets with distribution and innovation driving double digit growth in each market during the quarter” Ms. Buck said highlighting Hershey’s Kisses in India and better-for-you innovation in Mexico as top performers.

For the full year executives now expect net sales growth of 12% to 14% for the year up from the previous guidance of 10% to 12%. Reported earnings per share growth is expected to be in the range of 9% to 12% compared to the previous guidance of 8% to 11%.

In November of this year at the Hoosier Gym a version that was put together with the deleted scenes was shown at the 35th anniversary of the film. The gym’s assistant events coordinator Zoey Hunsinger spliced and edited the movie for showing.

Why was Barbara Hershey so upset about several deleted scenes in the film? Those clips were of Myra Fleener and coach Norman Dale’s developing romance.

From Indianapolis Monthly article (11-22-2016) –

David Anspaugh: Barbara Hershey [“Myra Fleener”] was miserable a lot of the time. I don’t know whether it was Indiana or the weather. It was grim and depressing. And there were really no other women in the movie. She was kind of out there by herself. I think she thought the movie was about her and Gene and forgot about the other people.

Angelo Pizzo: I don’t believe Barbara had much respect for what we were doing for us as filmmakers for the script for much of anything. She took the job to work with Gene Hackman. I’m sure she was disappointed that three of her scenes were cut from the movie—in fact I know she was. She has refused to do publicity or make a single comment about the film ever since.

Angelo Pizzo Talks ‘Hoosiers’ Director’s Cut

Pizzo told the Indianapolis Star in November 22 2021 –

“That’s my goal to actually do it. We’re going to do it at some point.”

Adding the deleted scenes will complete the movie the way it was meant to be seen. Fans will be happy to watch and enjoy it in its new form…let’s hope Barbara Hershey will be happy with the additions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMucGVubmxpdmUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvcGVubmxpdmUvbmFtZS9yb3ktc2lwZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMjA3Mjg5MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roy Sipe Obituary (1924 - 2022) - South Hanover Township PA - Patriot-News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.pennlive.com/us/obituaries/pennlive/name/roy-sipe-obituary?id=32072892 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMucGVubmxpdmUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvcGVubmxpdmUvbmFtZS9yb3ktc2lwZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMjA3Mjg5MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The landmark Caleta a four-star hotel built into the cliffs overlooking Catalan Bay closed its doors on December 31 after almost 60 years and will be demolished to make way for the new Hilton.

Plans for the new hotel were filed by the Hilton Group last week at Gibraltar’s Development and Planning Commission and include designs for a 12 storey building that will include 166 rooms as well as a dining room ballroom and Spa.

There will also be a terrace and outdoor pool area.





The new development will also include two luxury residential blocks flanking the new hotel. Plans for the north block show it will comprise 40 apartments over eight floors that will be earmarked for professional Gibraltarian families.

However the south block will comprise 88 apartments and duplexes over 13 residential levels which will be open to those who seek to move to Gibraltar in the finance and gaming sectors. In this way developers hope to boost investment on the Rock.

Once approved the project is expected to take three and a half years to complete. It has the backing of the Gibraltar authorities who welcome Hilton as the second international hotel chain to invest on the Rock.

Caleta Hotel manager Bruno Callaghan said the changes were ‘bittersweet’ recalling that it was his grandfather who opened the original Caleta Palace on the site in 1964.

Since then the hotel has always been run as a family business and has hosted events such as Miss Gibraltar and the International Chess Festival.

Anglin according to previous News-Times reporting was originally arrested on July 23 2021 on two counts of manslaughter and one count of tampering with physical evidence related to the death of 32-year-old Brooklin M. Hinkle of Hampton.

Hinkle was found dead July 23 inside her vehicle in the parking lot of Home Depot 507 W. 19th where she worked according to an El Dorado Police Department statement in July.

Investigators confirmed at the time that Anglin placed the call to 911 dispatchers but was not on the scene when officers arrived. Capt. Scott Harwell of the EPD's Criminal Investigative Division also told the News-Times in late July that Hinkle a U.S. Army veteran who served in Iraq was nearly six months pregnant at the time of her death.

Harwell told the News-Times on Thursday that Hinkle's death was confirmed as a drug overdose by the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory in Little Rock.

Anglin's bond conditions were originally set on Aug. 3 2021. According to court records those conditions included that Anglin would be admitted to SOZO Addiction Center in Jessieville Arkansas; subject to a range of limitations including not being in possession of drugs alcohol or firearms; and maintaining weekly contact with defense counselors among others.

Bond was set at the time at $50000.

The bond conditions also state that an arrest warrant will be ""immediately issued if Defendant leaves the facility"" referring to the rehabilitation clinic before completing the program.

The modification motion submitted by Anglin's defense last month provides several updates and asks for bond modifications that would allow Anglin to accept a job offer from a member of SOZO's board of directors.

According to a letter attached to the motion signed by SOZO Executive Director Bob O' Dowd Anglin ""has made remarkable strides in all aspects of our program."" The letter goes on to state that an ""important part of [SOZO's] recovery process for our clients is their being able to work in this area while living on campus and continued with their rehabilitative activities.""

No response from special prosecutor Jack McQuary is currently available in court records.

According to previous News-Times reporting because Anglin is linked to someone who works in the 13th Judicial District Prosecuting Attorney's Office the office has recused itself from the case and special prosecutor Jack McQuary was assigned to it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vY2xlYW5pbmctcHJvZHVjdHMtaG9tZS1zaGluZS1hY2NvcmRpbmctMTIwMTAwNzc5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These cleaning products will make your home shine in the New Year according to a former hoarding technician,"Fiona Mills is a former hoarding technician and current ramp-up coach at Spaulding Decon.

Mills shared her favorite cleaning products that homeowners can use to freshen up their homes.

She previously told Insider her favorite cleaning tips and tricks that she uses while on the job.

Most people either clean their homes weekly or whenever enough dirt piles up but for Fiona Mills cleanliness is a part of her daily life. Mills is a former hoarding technician and franchise Ramp-Up Coach with Spaulding Decon a company that tackles everything from homicide and suicide cleaning to mold remediation.

Last November Mills shared her favorite cleaning hacks with Insider. Now she's told Insider which cleaning products are prime to get the job done.

Mills' go-to cleaning solution is hot water and trisodium phosphate or TSP

According to Mills TSP is a ""heavy degreaser"" that can cut through just about any mess including bathroom build-up.

""TSP works wonders for tough bathtub stains"" Mills told Insider. ""Mix a teaspoon of TSP with some hot water and spray into the bathtub rub with a sponge and rinse well.""

Homeowners can purchase a $4 TSP powder or a $6 liquid TSP spray at Home Depot.

Mills also mentioned The Pink Stuff Microban and Mrs. Meyer's cleaning products.

The Pink Stuff Miracle Cleaning Paste sells for $8 on Amazon. Microban 24's Multi-Purpose Cleaner can be found on Amazon for $12. Most of Mrs. Meyer's multi-purpose cleaners can be purchased from their website for $4.

""Between those three and hot water – I can clean anything"" she said.

There are also several cleaning products for homeowners shopping on a budget

Mills pointed towards products that can be found in most Dollar General stores including LA's Totally Awesome All-Purpose Cleaner for $3.50 Fabuloso All-Purpose Cleaner for $2 and Lysol's Toilet Bowl Cleaner for $2.

Mills also mentioned Pine Glo Antibacterial Disinfectant Cleaner which sells for $0.84 at Walmart and white vinegar which can be boiled on a stovetop to get rid of smelly odors.

Mrs. Meyer's Cleaning Products and these other brands are environmentally friendly

In addition to Mrs. Meyer's cleaning products Seventh Generation is another brand that sells a plethora of cleaning wipes sprays and detergents.

Homeowners can purchase Seventh Generation products at Home Depot or Amazon.

However be careful with chemical products like bleach

Mills suggested that homeowners use bleach and similar products with a healthy amount of discernment.

""Be mindful with bleach or ammonia – make sure there is good ventilation"" Mills said. ""Do not use bleach if rust is present anywhere – it only makes it worse.""

Hong Kong China Electric Appliance Manufacture Company (HKC) is recalling various ceiling fans as the blades can fly off and cause damage or even injuries to people in the room. The company included two types of fans in the recall the Harbor Breeze Belleisle Bay and Honeywell Rio ceiling fans.

Urgent ceiling fan recall

HKC recently issued the ceiling fan recall via the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). You can see the full announcement here.

The company sold nearly 78000 recalled ceiling fans from February 2018 through August 2021. The Harbor Breeze Belleisle Bay and Honeywell Rio ceiling fans cost about $150 each. They were available online from various retailers including Amazon Build eAccess Hayneedle Houzz Lowes Menards Overstock and Wayfair.

HKC issued the recall after receiving 60 reports of the blades detaching from the fan. Three of those caused property damage to drywall but customers have not reported any injuries at this point.

The Harbor Breeze Belleisle Bay ceiling fans come in two models. One has a brushed nickel housing finish (model number 40650) and the other has an oil-rubbed bronze housing finish (model number 40651).

The Honeywell Rio ceiling fans are available in five models: Oil-rubbed bronze housing finish (model number 50514) champagne housing finish (model number 51623) pewter housing finish (model number 51624) brushed nickel housing finish (model number 50195) or a white housing finish (model number 51030).

Both types of fans feature matte black blades and a frosted white glass bowl light. Also all the fans that have been recalled feature a 3-speed reversible motor as well as a remote.

You’ll find the model numbers of the fans in the recall on the silver rating label on the top of the fan housing assembly.

What you should do

If you have one of these HKC fans at home you should stop using it right now. The company advises users to confirm their fans are part of the recall via email. They’ll have to take photos of the fan and the date code.

The company will then instruct customers to disconnect the fan and provide a photo of it. They can then throw the fan in the garbage or recycle it. HKC will send buyers a free replacement through the mail.

Unfortunately you can’t get a refund for the potentially malfunctioning product. The company is only offering replacements at this time.

HST,Host Hotels & Resorts,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL25ld3MvaG9zdC1ob3RlbHMtaHN0LWFjcXVpcmVzLWFsaWRhLTE5MzUwNzkwNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Hotels (HST) Acquires The Alida Hotel for $103 Million,"Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. HST has acquired a fee simple interest in The Alida Savannah for approximately $103 million in cash. The 173-room boutique hotel was opened in October 2018 and continues to benefit from soft branding in Marriott’s Tribute Portfolio.

Host Hotels expects stabilization for The Alida in 2024-2025 with roughly 11-12x earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and expects it to deliver roughly $240 of revenue per available room (RevPAR). The stabilized EBITDA for the property is in line with Host Hotels’ estimate of normalized 2019 operations and adjusts for construction disruption to the surrounding Plant Riverside District and the initial ramp-up of the hotel operations.

The property is situated in Savannah’s historic district and is adjacent to a newly developed entertainment district which includes the Plant Riverside District. Savannah is a drive-to leisure destination for fast-growing markets in the Southeast and enjoys increasing number of travelers through the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport. Hence with the resumption of travel and recovery in leisure demand the acquired hotel is likely to attract leisure travelers.

The hotel offers 11570 square feet of meeting space four F&B outlets with a rooftop bar an outdoor pool and a street-front retail space. Besides the property will provide a $271-million convention center expansion to be completed in 2024. This will enable the property to attract in-house and out-of-house group demand and offers scope for higher group and business bookings.

In addition Host Hotels is making efforts to enhance its portfolio quality through dispositions of non-strategic properties. It sold leasehold interest in the 305-room W Hollywood for a total sales price of roughly $197 million which includes $3 million for the furniture fixtures & equipment replacement funds. The sale price reflects a 25.0x EBITDA multiple on 2019 EBITDA consisting nearly $33 million of estimated foregone capital expenditures over the next five years.

Per management “We continue to be very active on the capital allocation front as we target new markets. Year to date we have invested $1.3 billion in early-cycle acquisitions. The blended EBITDA multiple on our six hotel acquisitions in 2021 is 12.9X which compares favorably to the nearly $750 million generated from our six hotel dispositions at a 16.0X EBITDA multiple including foregone capital expenditures.”

James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

BALANCE SHEET

The Company maintains a robust balance sheet and completed several transactions in March and April of 2024. These transactions include:

Net draws of $215 million on the revolving credit facility (including a $300 million draw in March as well as a $65 million draw and $150 million repayment subsequent to quarter end).

The following are the results for transient group and contract business in comparison to 2023 performance for the Company's current portfolio:

Quarter ended March 31 2024 Transient Group Contract Room nights (in thousands) 1314 1103 172 Percent change in room nights vs. same period in 2023 (1.9 %) 4.1 % 7.5 % Rooms revenues (in millions) $ 456 $ 324 $ 35 Percent change in revenues vs. same period in 2023 (4.7 %) 5.3 % 18.2 %

This spend is separate from payments for capital expenditures which are considered investing activities.



Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

For a discussion of items that may affect forecast results see the Notes to Financial Information.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

HP: Founded in 1939 the US company is a major server and printer manufacturer and one of the leading IT companies in the world. Until 2015 the company was called Hewlett-Packard Company. After a split the computer division was renamed HP Inc.

In 2023 HP had an approximate market share of 22% of global PC sales making it number 2 after Lenovo.

Modern games should be playable with these graphics cards at low settings and resolutions. Casual gamers may be happy with these cards.

Intel UHD Graphics 620: Integrated GPU (GT2 24 EUs) found on some Kaby-Lake-Refresh CPU models (15 W ULV series). Technically identical to the previous Kaby-Lake GPU called HD Graphics 620.

» Further information can be found in our Comparison of Mobile Graphics Cards and the corresponding Benchmark List.

Intel Core i7: The Intel Core i7 for laptops is based on the LG1156 Core i5/i7 CPU for desktops. The base clock speed of the CPUs is relatively low but because of a huge Turbo mode the cores can dynamically overclock to up to 3.2 GHz (920XM). Therefore the CPU can be as fast as high clocked dual-core CPUs (using single threaded applications) but still offer the advantage of 4 cores. Because of the large TDP of 45 W / 55 W the CPU is only intended for large laptops.

i7-8565U: Whiskey Lake based low power quad-core processor (technically identical to Kaby Lake but produced in a further improved 14nm++ process). The four cores are clocked between 1.8 and 4.6 GHz (Turbo Boost) and support HyperThreading.

Intel Comet Lake:

i7-10810U: Comet Lake based low power hexa-core processor (technically identical to Whiskey Lake and still produced in 14nm++). The CPU cores can clock between 1.1 and 4.9 GHz with HyperThreading (12 threads). The integrated memory controller supports DDR4-2666 and using cTDP up/down the performance can be adjusted by the OEM (12.5 - 25 Watt possible 15W default). The CPU supports vPro (as a difference to the i7-10710U).

i7-10610U: Comet Lake based low power quad-core processor (technically identical to Whiskey Lake and still produced on 14nm++). The CPU cores can clock between 1.8 and 4.9 GHz (unverified) with HyperThreading (8 threads). The integrated memory controller supports DDR4-2666 and using cTDP up/down the performance can be adjusted by the OEM (10 - 25 Watt possible 15W default). Compared to the similar Core i7-10510U the 10610U supports vPro.

James “Jim” Anthony Hepp of Hygiene Colorado at the age of 82 died Tuesday January 4th 2022 at Boulder Community Hospital from Covid Pneumonia and Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). Jim was born on August 27th 1939 in Denver Colorado. He was the oldest of eleven children to parents Anthony John Hepp and Josephine Agatha VonFeldt. He worked on the farm and at various jobs to help support the family while in school. Jim graduated from Brighton High School in 1957 and enlisted in the Navy from 1960 to 1964. On April 7th 1961 Jim graduated from the Aviation Electronics Technician School Antisubmarine Course with top scholastic honors. He was a veteran of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

On June 26th 1965 in Lafayette Colorado Jim married Gayle Gene Mosnik. Together they had two children Laura Anne and Brian James. Jim started his career at Hewlett-Packard (HP) as a purchasing agent while attending night school at CU Denver. In 1973 Jim invested in Colorado Time Systems (CTS) a company that created swimming timers and sports scoring systems. In the late 1980’s CTS began creating tape backups for computers. This was a revolutionary new concept that the computer industry needed. This company turned into Colorado Memory Systems (CMS) which sold to HP in 1992. Since then Jim has been involved in well over 100 businesses including Blackfox LLC and its subsidiaries. His latest endeavors included Colorado Tri-Flo Systems which sells heaters that kill bed bugs along with air purification systems to kill off the current virus and ZeoMedical a medical company developing a product that helps arthritic patients manage their pain without drugs. Jim also established the Hepp Foundation which has helped the poorest of the poor for decades. Jim never stopped working and was “semi-retired” since 1992.

Jim loved God and life; his whole life was devoted to Jesus Christ. Every morning Jim prayed his Rosary and went to Mass. Because of his love of God Jim strived to serve and help people. Everything in his life was because of his deep love of and trust in God. Before he died he told his daughter that when he got out of the hospital he was going to do more for God and that all he wanted to do “was get under the fence” into Heaven. He told his son he was giving his suffering to God in the hopes God would use it for the good for others. Monday he told Gayle he was terminal and although he didn’t want to go he was ready to be with our Lord Jesus Christ if that was his will. Jim’s most worthy aspiration was he wanted to pull as many people up to heaven as he could. Thinking about the prayer circle praying for him Sunday night there were around 500 people that he lifted up with him at that moment. When he died Jim knew he was going home to be with Jesus.

He was a loving husband father grandfather brother friend mentor and the rock of the whole family. He loved to golf with his brothers and friends and fly fish with his son and grandsons. He smoked cigars with his poker buddies and loved to stay up in Wyoming at his cabin. He was a farmer at heart and had a garden so he could give everyone vegetables every year. He made wine applesauce pickles salsa sauerkraut and hot sauce. His latest was brandy from the many fruit trees on his property.

Jim is reunited with his parents Anthony and Josephine Hepp his brother Gary Hepp in-laws Edmond and Josephine Mosnik brothers/sisters-in-law Leroy Hoffman Larry Luellig Dean Zaffree Sharon Hepp Cindy Hepp and Carol Hepp and nephew Mark Hepp and many other friends and relatives.

He is survived by his loving wife Gayle Hepp (Hygiene) daughter Laura (Steve) Schechter of Longmont and son Brian (Stacy) Hepp of Loveland; grandchildren Jenna Hepp of Loveland Alex Hepp of Denver Sarah Schechter of Longmont and Ryan Schechter of Longmont; siblings Jeanette Hoffman Nick (Mary) Hepp Paulette Luellig Sam Hepp Linda (Paul) Eccher Chuck (Lory) Hepp John (Erica) Hepp Nancy Zaffree Anthony (Barbara) Hepp Jon (Sandy) Hepp

When attending the Rosary and Funeral please understand Gayle is recovering from cancer and there will be no hugging or kissing; her immune system is vulnerable and we want to prevent sickness.

Jim’s Catholic Rosary is Tuesday January 11th 2022 at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church 3791 Pike Rd Longmont CO 80503. From 5:30-6:30 p.m. is the viewing followed by Catholic Rosary at 6:30 p.m. Here is the livestream information: https://youtu.be/8aVuyvxL-a4

At CES we saw HP's new cases with a chamber for cooling a versatile looking gaming monitor with the HP Omen 27u and now we're getting a look at HP's first new desktop PC with the gamer on a budget in mind.

At least we hope it is as the Victus by HP 15L Desktop doesn't have any list prices as yet. What we do know is some of the configurations on offer. These PCs come with a choice of up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti or the AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT GPU. These can be paired with up to either a 12th Gen Intel Core i7 or the AMD Ryzen 7 5000G Series processors with up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM.

Best gaming laptop: perfect notebooks for mobile gaming

As it is 2022 and this is a gaming PC the Victus 15L Desktop also has a customisable RBG logo on the front. Otherwise the case has a sleek looking box design with white and black options.

There are four USB A and one USB C and headphone ports that look easily accessible on the front. The bezels boast post-consumer recycled plastic and the paint is water-based with sustainability in mind. The unit is also Energy Star certified and EPEAT Silver Registered. HP lists its Omen Obelisk desktop PC as only having a bronze EPEAT rating so for the budget and energy conscious this unit could be a good choice.

Looking at similar PCs available at the moment they can range between a bit over $1000 and $2000 USD. Without knowing the exact configurations of these parts plus other options like the SSD it's really impossible to guess where this will sit on the pricing front. Given HP is marketing this as a cheaper option to the current Omen series we’re hoping it’ll live up to its name. HP’s Victus 15L Desktop is set to come out in February so at least we won’t have long to wait to find out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9hdWRpLXI4LWdldHMtc2l4LXNwZWVkLWdhdGVkLW1hbnVhbC1hbmQtMTUwMC1ocC10d2luLXR1cmJvLWtpdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Audi R8 Gets Six-Speed Gated Manual And 1500-HP Twin-Turbo Kit,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9hdWRpLXI4LWdldHMtc2l4LXNwZWVkLWdhdGVkLW1hbnVhbC1hbmQtMTUwMC1ocC10d2luLXR1cmJvLWtpdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

McCool Jr. (LPD 29) Huntington Ingalls Industries’ (HII) Ingalls Shipbuilding division announced Jan 7 the successful launch of amphibious transport dock Richard M. McCool Jr. (LPD 29).

Huntington Ingalls Industries press release

Richard M. McCool Jr. the 13th LPD in the San Antonio class of amphibious assault force ships will support U.S. amphibious assault special operations and expeditionary warfare missions through the first half of the 21st century.

Kari Wilkinson president of HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding division said:

“The LPD class ships like all of our programs are critically important to U.S. national security. In addition thousands of Americans from engineers to electricians have worked on LPD 29 over the years. Ingalls Shipbuilding is proud to build them and even more proud of the talented people that make up our shipbuilding team.”

With the assistance of tugs Richard M. McCool Jr. came off the floating dry dock Wednesday morning after first being translated via Ingalls’ rail car system. The dock was moved away from the pier and then ballasted to float off the ship.

Launching Richard M. McCool Jr. is the first of a series of significant milestone events in bringing the ship to life and eventual delivery to the U.S. Navy which is planned for later next year.

Ingalls Shipbuilding is building the entire San Antonio class of ships the newest addition to the Navy’s 21st century amphibious assault force. The 684-foot-long 105-foot-wide ships that displace 25000 tons are used to embark and land Marines their equipment and supplies ashore via air cushion or conventional landing craft and amphibious assault vehicles augmented by helicopters or vertical takeoff and landing aircraft such as the MV-22 Osprey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZGVmYnJpZWYuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMDkvdXMtbmF2eS1sYXVuY2hlcy1maW5hbC1mbGlnaHQtaS1zYW4tYW50b25pby1jbGFzcy1sYW5kaW5nLXBsYXRmb3JtLWRvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Navy launches final Flight I San Antonio-class landing platform dock,"US shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries has launched the 13th San Antonio-class landing platform dock for the US Navy.

Future USS Richard M. McCool Jr. (LPD 29) is also the final Flight I ship in its class with work already underway on the Flight II hulls that will be more affordable ships with reduced capabilities.

It is worth noting that similarly to USS Fort Lauderdale (LPD-28) LPD 29 is a “transitional ship” already incorporating design features of the Flight II vessels with a more traditional mast being one of the more distinctive features.

The LPD 17 San Antonio class is the functional replacement for over 41 ships including the LPD 4 Austin class LSD 36 Anchorage class LKA 113 Charleston class and LST 1179 Newport class amphibious ships.

The newly designated LPD Flight II ships (formerly LX(R)) will be the functional replacement for the LSD 41/49 Whidbey Island-class.

The 684-foot-long 105-foot-wide Flight I ships displace 25000 tons and are used to embark and land Marines their equipment and supplies ashore via air cushion or conventional landing craft and amphibious assault vehicles augmented by helicopters or vertical takeoff and landing aircraft such as the MV-22 Osprey.

The San Antonio-class has a ship’s company of 383 sailors and three marines along with an embarked landing force of 699 troops with surge capacity of 800.

The follow-on Flight II ships will have a more traditional mast in place of the two advanced enclosed mast/sensors and an updated deckhouse and boat valley design. The ships will carry fewer troops up to 631 according to the navy and have slightly less vehicle stowage space but still have greater capacity than the legacy Whidbey Island-class they are replacing.",,,,,,,,,

IBM which has been in this field for 50 years continues to hand in its basic innovation answers this year. According to the company “2nm chips will allow smartphones to be charged every 4 days”. At the MEET2022 Smart Future Conference Dr. Xie Dong Vice President of IBM shared how IBM is accelerating technological innovation and working with partners to achieve a sustainable future.

Here are the highlights of his speech

Highlights:

In the next ten years the top three business risks faced by enterprises are related to the environment. This will include extreme weather failure of climate action and man-made environmental damage. Under the dual-carbon goal sustainable development is not only the social responsibility of all enterprises. It is also a strategic issue that enterprises must face.

IBM proposed this year to achieve net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2030. The application of quantum computers in AI/ML optimization molecular structure analysis and simulation has shown great advantages and the future of large-scale commercial use will not be too far.

One of the highlights of this speech is the capacity of a 2nm chip. According to IBM 2nm chips will make it possible for smartphone charging to be once in four days. Presently depending on the user and battery capacity smartphone charging is usually once a day. Heavy users charge their smartphones multiple times daily.

Sustainable development is the common task of all mankind

In the era of rapid economic and technological development the various challenges facing mankind are still extremely severe. For example the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters caused by climate change are ravaging the world. In fact government enterprises investors and consumers are paying more and more attention to sustainable development issues related to the environment.

The United Nations adopted a sustainable development goal with 17 sub-topics in 2015 as an initiative to eradicate poverty protect the planet and ensure that all people can enjoy peace and prosperity. This is not only an advocacy and appeal but also a program of action. At present under China’s dual carbon goals sustainable development is not only the social responsibility of all companies but also a strategic issue that companies must face.

How should companies face these challenges? Like big data artificial intelligence hybrid cloud and the upcoming quantum computing new technologies will bring significant changes and improvements to sustainable development.

San Francisco: Tech giant IBM could reportedly be looking to sell the Watson Health division for more than $1 billion media reports say.

According to Axios IBM spent more than $4 billion to build Watson Health via a series of acquisitions.

The business now includes health care data and analytics business Truven Health Analytics population health company Phytel and medical imaging business Merge Healthcare.

IBM first explored a sale of the division in early 2021 with Morgan Stanley leading the process the report said.

WSJ reported at the time that the unit was generating roughly $1 billion in annual revenue but was unprofitable. Sources said it continues to lose money.

The report mentioned that IBM in late 2021 engaged BofA Securities to find a buyer for Watson Health. Bids were due last week according to one source who said IBM hopes to select the winner by month’s end.

IBM and BofA declined to comment but last year IBM CEO Arvind Krishna acknowledged that sometimes the company has promised more than it has delivered.

“Watson was one of IBM’s highest-profile initiatives in recent years and a big bet on the growing healthcare sector though results disappointed in part because physicians were hesitant to adopt artificial intelligence” a report said last year.

“IBM is studying alternatives for the unit that could include a sale to a private-equity firm or industry player or a merger with a blank-check company” the report added citing sources.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYWxvbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8wOS9yZWdyZXQtY2FuLWJlLWFsbC1jb25zdW1pbmctLWEtbmV1cm9iZWhhdmlvcmFsLXNjaWVudGlzdC1leHBsYWlucy1ob3ctcGVvcGxlLWNhbi1vdmVyY29tZWl0X3BhcnRuZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Regret can be all-consuming – a neurobehavioral scientist explains how people can overcome it,"A friend of mine – we will call him ""Jay"" – was working for IBM in New York City in the early '90s. He was a computer programmer and made a good salary. Occasionally competitors and startups approached Jay to join their companies. He had an offer from an interesting but small organization in Seattle but the salary was paltry and most of the offer package was in company shares. After consulting with friends and his parents Jay declined the offer and stayed with IBM. He has regretted it ever since. That small company was Microsoft.

Regret is a very real reaction to a disappointing event in your life a choice you made that can't be changed something you said that you can't take back. It's one of those feelings you can't seem to shake a heavy and intrusive negative emotion that can last for minutes days years or even a lifetime. Imaging studies reveal that feelings of regret show increased activity in an area of the brain called the medial orbitofrontal cortex.

Dealing with regret is even more difficult because of the other negative emotions connected to it: remorse sorrow and helplessness. Regret can increase our stress negatively affect physical health and throw off the balance of hormone and immune systems. Regret is not only unpleasant. It is unhealthy.

As a licensed clinical psychologist at the University of Virginia School of Medicine I conduct research on stressful emotions. Through this work I help patients overcome regret move on with their lives and grow. And that is the good news: Regret can be overcome through interventions like therapy and evidence-based strategies.

A 'sense of stuckness'

There are basically two ways to experience regret: One is what researchers refer to as the action path and the other is the inaction path. That is we can regret the things we did – or we can regret the things we did not do.

Research suggests that action-related regrets although painful spur people to learn from their mistakes and move on. But regret related to the inaction path – the things undone the opportunities lost – is harder to fix. This kind of regret is more likely to lead to depression anxiety a sense of ""stuckness"" and a feeling of longing over not knowing what could have been.

As with other negative emotions it doesn't work to avoid deny or try to squash regret. In the long run these tactics only increase negative feelings and prolong the time you suffer with them. Rather than stay stuck people can manage these emotions in four steps: First accept the fact that you are feeling them; determine why you are feeling them; allow yourself to learn from them; and finally release them and move forward.

You can help release these feelings of regret by practicing self-compassion. This means reminding yourself that you are human you are doing the best you can and you can learn from past decisions and grow. Showing this compassion to yourself can help you accept and move past the regret.

Accepting that you have feelings of regret does not mean that you like these feelings. It just means you know they are there. It also helps to identify the specific emotion you're feeling. Instead of telling yourself ""I feel bad"" say ""This is me feeling regret."" Simple as it sounds the semantic difference has a big emotional impact.

Accept acknowledge and forgive yourself

Acknowledging your thoughts and feelings can bring relief from strong negative emotions. In Jay's case he could remind himself that he had no crystal ball. Instead he made the best decision he could given the information he had at the time and given the same circumstances most of his contemporaries would have made the same decision.

This method of noticing and then restructuring your thoughts is sometimes called cognitive reappraisal. Seeing the situation in a different way may help reduce regret and help you make future decisions.

Forgiving yourself for actions taken or not taken is a powerful step toward overcoming regret. This has been formalized into a commonly used cognitive psychological model called REACH which asks people to recall the hurt (face it) empathize (be kind and compassionate) altruistically offer forgiveness (to oneself) commit publicly (share it) and then hold on to that forgiveness and stay true to the decision. Research shows that six hours of work with a trained professional using this model can have a positive impact.

More knowledge = less regret

At first Jay pushed away his feelings of regret. He continued to struggle with thoughts of what he missed. He did not change until he approached and explored his feelings of regret first with a friend and ultimately with a therapist.

Eventually he accepted the pain of not knowing what might have happened but also reminded himself of his rationale at the time which was actually quite reasonable. He demonstrated compassion towards himself and spoke to himself kindly the way he would when talking to a loved one or close friend. Practicing this self-compassion allowed him to build resilience move on from the negative emotions and ultimately forgive himself.

On making future decisions Jay recognized the importance of obtaining as much information about opportunities as possible. He challenged himself to learn about the big players in the field. Doing so allowed him to overcome his regret and move forward. New opportunities came along. Jay currently employed by another giant computer engineering company is doing quite well for himself and has been able to move beyond the regret of his past decision.

The race for quantum supremacy which in the context of the hybrid cold war had become one of the key fronts in the technological and ideological struggle between the United States and China also entered a new phase after Chinese physicists unveiled the world’s fastest photonic quantum computer Jiuzhang in December of 2020. 100 trillion times faster than conventional computers this computer is the result of 20 years of hard work by the country’s top specialists. Note that quantum processors are based on two different systems photonic and electronic: room temperature is sufficient for photon-based quantum computers to work efficiently while electron-based superconductor quantum devices require a rather low temperature. Basically the Jiuzhang processor designed to perform functional operations of quantum chemistry is also an optical quantum computer based on photonic technology with a rather complicated operating principle.

In general quantum technology designed to be used in quick and accurate solution of fundamental and complex problems in medicine chemistry logistics finance physics communication pharmaceutics climate ecology space and dozens of other fields creates enormous opportunities in particular in navigation financial optimization and drug production to accelerate relevant tests and processing of their results.

Operations that take conventional digital supercomputers hundreds of thousands of years can be performed by new-generation quantum computers in a matter of seconds. Incidentally because of strategic importance privacy protection and security measures quantum research has been increasingly entrusted to military institutions in recent years. The Pentagon also launched a program to develop quantum supercomputers starting in the first quarter of 2020. At the first stage the Pentagon administration plans to upgrade atomic clocks and quantum sensors used for military purposes. Quantum atomic clocks and inertia sensors can play an extremely important role in accurate navigation and timekeeping which is vital in military missions. They are expected to be an alternative to the traditional GPS navigation system something ground forces cannot do without in regions with challenging terrain. Therefore there is a need to adapt the vast majority of existing laser optical and other components to the new technology which leads to additional costs and loss of time.

Official Washington which for the last decade has been working on the development of quantum technologies on domestic budget last August through the US National Science Foundation announced $625 million over the next five years to establish five research centers under the Department of Energy for the next five years. In addition to experiments these centers will focus on the production and application of quantum networks sensors computing and relevant materials and components. The laboratories which will operate in a coordinated manner are expected to contribute to a multidisciplinary efficient and competitive nationwide ecosystem recycling industry and supply chain in quantum technology. The National Quantum Initiative Act which took effect during the Trump administration in 2018 and has a total budget of $1.2 billion is working toward this goal. In addition in April of this year two quantum-related bills The Quantum Network Infrastructure and Workforce Development Act of 2021 and QUANTUM for National Security Act of 2021 were introduced in the US Senate during the 117th Congress.

In the private sector key players include such giants as IBM Google Rigetti Honeywell Amazon and Microsoft. The Sycamore programmable superconducting qubit processor created by Google engineers in 2019 is considered one of the first and most powerful in the field.

As for the biggest rival of the US—the People’s Republic of China the next (14th) five-year plan launched in last March under “China 2035” the project of modernization of socialism a special place is given to the development of local innovative technologies. Thus along with the development of semiconductor microchips quantum technology is one of the priority goals in the country’s 2025 state plan. Last October the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale of the University of Science and Technology of China unveiled the Zuchongzhi 2.1 programmable quantum computing system. According to data published by the Chinese the Zuchongzhi 2.1 quantum computer is 10 million times faster than the most powerful supercomputer to date. Thus its computing power is 1 million times greater than that of Google’s Sycamore superconducting quantum processor. Zuchongzhi 2.1 which performs operations that would take a conventional computer 30 trillion years in about 1 millisecond has greatly increased China’s advantage over its competitors in quantum technology paving the way for it to become the world leader in both superconducting quantum computing technology (Zuchongzhi 2.1) and photonic quantum computing technology (Jiuzhang 2.0) for the first time. In 2016 China’s National Space Agency (CNSA) launched the first quantum artificial communications satellite Micius into low-Earth orbit. Micius can transmit intercontinental messages and information faster and more securely using quantum encryption.

It seems that the rapid development and effective adoption of ultra-fast quantum processors which will hopefully have an impact on many areas from the mapping of molecular structures and chemical reactions to the multi-aspect application of complex algorithms the building of artificial intelligence capabilities Big Data processing and improving the computational efficiency of complex statistical data will take an important place among long-term national strategic interests and goals of both the United States and China.

Thus we are witnessing the transition of the quantum from the domain of science to the military-strategic sphere race on the background of complex political maneuvers. This technology which is beginning to occupy a central place in international relations national security economics and geopolitics will continue to be one of the main subjects of struggle in the fierce competition for leadership in the field of high technology between the United States and China in the coming years.

Now Intel is using CES as a platform to announce its 12th Gen Intel Core processor for mobile and IoT applications. The company also has plans to highlight its automotive solutions including Mobileye and Mobileye EyeQ which are designed for advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) system-on-chip (SoC) designs. For high-definition graphics for gaming image and video processing applications the company will release its Alchemist solution the first of Intel's Arc graphics.

Together these announcements support Intel's key focuses moving into 2022: high-performance cloud-to-edge infrastructure artificial intelligence and pervasive connectivity.

Intel's Latest 12th-gen Processors

Intel says the 12th Gen Intel Core processor family is built for computing designs across several PC product segments ranging from ultra thin-and-light laptops to heavy desktop gaming workstations. By offering up to 5.2 GHz max turbo boost and 16 and 24 cores and threads respectively this processor family comprising 60 processors is purported to boost performance for enthusiastic gamers and professional creators alike.

Intel has incorporated a ""performance hybrid architecture"" into this processor family. This architecture allows flexible system designs that adapt to the complex foreground and background blending-intensive workflows.

With the latest additions to its 12th-Gen processor family Intel now provides a platform specifically for IoT-related healthcare digital safety manufacturing and retail applications. The company code-named this processor family Alder Lake S-series and H-series and upgraded it for the edge. These devices offer the conventional performance hybrid architecture that is found in the Intel Thread Director Performance-cores and Efficient-cores.

In addition to the processors' computing specs Intel says these new additions are flexible enough for use in heavy IoT workloads accelerated deep learning and AI capabilities in the absence of additional hardware. Other stated benefits include extra hardware-based security support for 4K and 8K displays with integrated graphics processing units (GPUs) and high reliability.

Intel envisions these devices offering workload convergence and interactive displays across a number of IoT-focused applications including retail banking hospitality and education. They can also be used for advanced ultrasound imaging endoscopy and clinical devices in healthcare.

For digital safety and security the new family can be used to drive higher results from AI box analytics video recorders and video walls. The additions are also said to support machine vision systems industrial PCs and edge servers for industrial manufacturing.

Intel Boosts Its Automotive Efforts with Mobileye

The autonomous vehicle industry is set to reach up to $70 billion by 2030 and Intel has taken note.

Since acquiring Mobileye through its subsidiary Cyclops Holdings in 2017 Intel has been working to achieve automated driving solutions. By unveiling its latest chip technology Mobileye EyeQ the company will reveal its progress on radar and LiDAR technology. The Mobileye EyeQ SoC is a purpose-built chip ""for end-to-end autonomous driving."" Intel claims the SoC maximizes efficiency at 176 TOPS (tera operations per second) making it the industry's leanest AV chip.

Hardware present at the event include:

EyeQ 4-100 (1.7MP) used in Honda's 100° front camera

Mobileye EyeQ pairs four classes of task-specific proprietary accelerators with ISPs GPUs and CPU cores. Due to its comparatively higher efficiency the EyeQ SoC is also said to deliver a balance of performance and price-point for consumer-level AVs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNueC1zb2Z0d2FyZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8wOC90ZHAtdnMtcGJwLXRoZXJtYWwtZGVzaWduLXBvd2VyLXZzLXBicC1wcm9jZXNzb3ItYmFzZS1wb3dlci1kaWZmZXJlbmNlcy_SAXZodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbngtc29mdHdhcmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMDgvdGRwLXZzLXBicC10aGVybWFsLWRlc2lnbi1wb3dlci12cy1wYnAtcHJvY2Vzc29yLWJhc2UtcG93ZXItZGlmZmVyZW5jZXMvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TDP (Thermal Design Power) vs PBP (Processor Base Power) – Are there differences?,"TDP (Thermal Design Power) metric has been used for years to help manufacturers design appropriate cooling solutions for Intel/AMD processors and give an idea of their power consumption. But I did not immediately catch up that TDP was gone from the recent Alder Lake IoT processors announcement and Intel is now using PBP (Processor Base Power) instead while somehow cTDP (configurable TDP) down/up numbers are still provided.

Beyond the announcement if we look into the Intel Ark database older processors still show TDP while it’s completely gone for new processors with the specs instead listing Processor Base Power (PBP) and for the ones with Turbo mode “Maximum Turbo Power” (MTP) is also included.

But what do those mean exactly? Intel “explains”:

TDP definition:

Thermal Design Power (TDP) represents the average power in watts the processor dissipates when operating at Base Frequency with all cores active under an Intel-defined high-complexity workload. Refer to Datasheet for thermal solution requirements.

PBP definition:

The time-averaged power dissipation that the processor is validated to not exceed during manufacturing while executing an Intel-specified high complexity workload at Base Frequency and at the junction temperature as specified in the Datasheet for the SKU segment and configuration.

MTP definition:

The maximum sustained (>1s) power dissipation of the processor as limited by current and/or temperature controls. Instantaneous power may exceed Maximum Turbo Power for short durations (<=10ms). Note: Maximum Turbo Power is configurable by system vendor and can be system specific.

I wrote “explains” in quotes because Intel does not provide any information about the “high-complexity workload” so we are left to guess. In the past a processor was just comprised of the CPU cores but those are now SOCs with GPU for 2D/3D graphics and hardware video acceleration as well as AI or other accelerators. So it may be important to know if the workload makes any use of those. I initially thought TDP and PBP looked similar enough to me except the junction temperature was specified. But tkaiser commented that “all cores” was removed from the PBP definition and this suggests Intel might be using the other IP blocks as well also noting that TDP has become meaningless to estimate the power consumption of a processor as explained in an ExtremeTech article.

Let’s check out Alder Lake processors datasheet to find out if we can find additional information.

Nearly every mention of “Processor Base Power” is followed with “a.k.a TDP” so from Intel’s perspective both are the same. What we still don’t get is a clear explanation of how the numbers are calculated so Intel must consider this confidential information.

If we look into the second part of the Alder Lake datasheet this is even more clear as somebody at Intel decided to rename a bunch of terms…

cTDP Down power is now minimum assured power cTDP Up power is maximum assured power Small Core has become “E-Core” (Efficient) and Big Core is P-Core (Performance). I think the reason for the change from “Thermal Design Power” to “Processor Base Power” is to offer a way to differentiate with the new “Maximum Turbo Power” metric since the former relies on the base frequency and the latter on the turbo frequency. So unless new information comes up I’d consider TDP and PBP to represent the same metric.

The Intel Core i3-1210U is a low power mobile CPU for thin and light laptops based on the Alder Lake architecture. It was announced in early 2022 and offers 2 performance cores (P-cores Golden Cove architecture) and 4 efficient cores (E-cores Gracemont architecture). The P-cores support Hyper-Threading leading to 8 supported threads when combined with the E-cores. The clock rate ranges from 1 to 4.4 GHz on the performance cluster and 0.7 to 3.3 GHz on the efficient cluster. The performance of the E-cores should be similar to old Skylake cores (compare to the Core i7-6700HQ). All cores can use up to 10 MB L3 cache.

Performance

While we have not tested a single system built around the 1210U as of August 2023 we fully expect its multi-thread performance to be pretty much identical to that of the i3-1215U. Which is pretty fast for an entry-level chip as of mid 2023.

Your mileage may vary depending on how high the CPU power limits are and how competent the cooling solution of your system is.

Features

The integrated memory controller supports various memory types up to DDR5-4800 DDR4-3200 LPDDR5-5200 and LPDDR4x-4267. The Thread Director (in hardware) can support the operating system to decide which thread to use on the performance or efficient cores for the best performance. For AI tasks the CPU also integrates GNA 3.0 and DL Boost (via AVX2). Quick Sync in version 8 is the same as in the Rocket Lake CPUs and supports MPEG-2 AVC VC-1 decode JPEG VP8 decode VP9 HEVC and AV1 decode in hardware. The CPU only supports PCIe 4.0 (x8 for a GPU and two x4 for SSDs).

reports repeatedly failed to forecast Capitol riot,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Intelligence reports compiled by the U.S. Capitol Police in the days before last year’s insurrection envisioned only an improbable or remote risk of violence even as other assessments warned that crowds of potentially thousands of pro-Trump demonstrators could converge in Washington and create a dangerous situation.

The documents obtained by The Associated Press underscore the uneven and muddled intelligence that circulated to Capitol Police officers ahead of the Jan. 6 riot when thousands of Donald Trump loyalists swarmed the Capitol complex and clashed violently with law enforcement officers in their effort to disrupt the certification of the results of the 2020 presidential election. The intelligence reports in particular show how the police agency up to the day of the riot itself grievously underestimated the prospect of chaotic violence and disruptions.

The contradictory intelligence produced by law enforcement leading up to the riot has been at the forefront of congressional scrutiny about the Jan. 6 preparations and response with officials struggling to explain how they failed to anticipate and plan for the deadly riot at the Capitol that day. The shortcomings led to upheaval at the top ranks of the department including the ouster of the chief though the assistant chief in charge of protective and intelligence operations at the time remains in her position.

There was according to a harshly critical Senate report issued in June “a lack of consensus about the gravity of the threat posed on January 6 2021.”

“Months following the attack on the U.S. Capitol there is still no consensus among USCP officials about the intelligence reports’ threat analysis ahead of January 6 2021” the report stated.

The documents known as a “daily intelligence report” and marked “For Official Use Only” have been described over the last year in congressional testimony and in the Senate report. The AP on Friday evening obtained full versions of the documents for Jan. 4 5 and 6 of last year. The New York Times highlighted the Jan. 4 report in a story last year on intelligence shortcomings.

On each of the three days the documents showed the Capitol Police ranked as “highly improbable” the probability of acts of civil disobedience and arrests arising from the “Stop the Steal” protest planned for the Capitol. The documents ranked that event and gatherings planned for Jan 6. by about 20 other organizers on a scale of “remote” to “nearly certain” in terms of the likelihood of major disruptions. All were rated as either “remote” “highly improbable” or “improbable” the documents show.

“No further information has been found to the exact actions planned by this group” the Jan. 6 report says about about the “Stop the Steal” rally.

The Million MAGA March planned by Trump supporters is rated in the document as “improbable” with officials saying it was “possible” that organizers could demonstrate at the Capitol complex and that though there had been talk of counter-demonstrators there are “no clear plans by those groups at this time.”

Another event by a group known as Prime Time Patriots was similarly described as having a “highly improbable” chance for disruption with the report again stating that “no further information has been found to the exact actions planned by this group.”

Those optimistic forecasts are tough to square with separate intelligence assessments compiled by the Capitol Police in late December and early January. Those documents also obtained by AP warned that crowds could number in the thousands and include members of extremist groups like the Proud Boys.

A Jan. 3 2021 memo for instance warned of a “significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike” because of the potential attendance of “white supremacists militia members and others who actively promote violence.”

“Unlike previous post-election protests the targets of the pro-Trump supporters are not necessarily the counter-protestors as they were previously but rather Congress itself is the target on the 6th” the report states.

Adding to the mixed intelligence portrait is a Jan. 5 bulletin prepared by the FBI’s Norfolk field office that warned of the potential for “war” at the Capitol. Capitol Police leaders have said they were unaware of that document at the time. FBI Director Chris Wray has said the report was disseminated through the FBI’s joint terrorism task force discussed at a command post in Washington and posted on an internet portal available to other law enforcement agencies.

Capitol Police officials have repeatedly insisted that they had no specific or credible intelligence that any demonstration at the Capitol would result in a large-scale attack on the building. Despite scrutiny of intelligence shortcomings Yogananda Pittman the assistant chief in charge of intelligence at the time of the riot remains in that position.

The current police chief J. Thomas Manger defended Pittman in a September interview with the AP pointing to her decision when she was acting chief to implement recommendations made by the inspector general and to expand the department’s internal intelligence capabilities so officers wouldn’t need to rely so heavily on intelligence gathered by other law enforcement agencies."

TO GO WITH ""Roundup: UK households face energy bill crisis as gas prices soar"" (Photo by Ray Tang/Xinhua)

LONDON Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- As wholesale gas prices in Britain remain more than four times higher than the same time last year households across the country are facing a soaring energy bill in 2022.

According to the data from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) the price of UK Natural Gas Futures is about 220 pence (about 2.99 U.S. dollars) per therm Friday down from a record of 416 pence (about 5.65 dollars) in December but remains at high levels. By comparison the price was only about 50 pence (about 68 cents) at the same time last year.

While the energy price cap is due to be revised by Britain's energy regulator the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) this February experts are expecting a rise of around 50 percent in consumers energy bills by April.

""The default tariff energy price cap looks set to rise by 47 percent in April pushing up Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation to 6.2 percent"" said Samuel Tombs chief UK economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics an economic research consultancy.

""The rise will be larger if suppliers are immediately compensated for acquiring failed competitors' customers"" Tombs added.

Since last August more than 20 British energy companies have gone bust as ""record global gas prices have exposed the vulnerability of some energy suppliers to price shocks"" the Ofgem said.

The Ofgem said they have protected more than 4 million customers as companies have ceased trading by making sure customers have a supplier and that household credit balances are honoured.

Britain's energy industry has called for the government to take urgent intervention to protect consumers from escalating energy bills but the government has not announced any measures yet.

""The government's new year's resolution should be to prevent a more immediate living standards catastrophe taking place"" said Torsten Bell chief executive of Resolution Foundation an economic think tank.

""The top priority is to do something about an energy bill surge of 600 pounds (about 814.84 dollars) or more for a typical household given this will be particularly difficult for those on lower incomes to manage"" Bell noted. ■

IFF may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.



That is because International Flavors is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for IFF in this report.



In fact the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 97 cents per share for IFF compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for IFF giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +15.59% heading into earnings season.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Why is this Important?

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).



Given that IFF has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.



Clearly recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for International Flavors and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

Read this article on the Outside app available now on iOS devices for members! Download the app .

“Like monkeys” a review of the neural and psychological foundations of social hierarchy explains “we tend to use certain cues like physical strength to make status judgments.” This is presumably why running messageboards like Letsrun feature seemingly never–ending debates about the precise thresholds that distinguish “serious” “sub-elite” and “elite” runners from the unwashed masses. “Elite” according to one typical if slightly hyperbolic poster is “the time that sets a world record and/or wins. Everything else is hobby jogging.”

But figuring out these thresholds isn’t just about pissing contests. As a new paper in the International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance puts it “the term ‘elite subjects’ might be one of the more overused and ill-defined terms in the exercise science literature.” That matters because the results of a training study on semi-fit college students may not apply to Olympic athletes and vice versa. Beet juice for example reliably boosts performance in recreational athletes but doesn’t seem to help elite athletes to the same degree. The same appears to be true of training with deliberately depleted carbohydrate levels. To interpret the results of an exercise study you need to know who the subjects were and have a consistent way of classifying them.

That’s the goal of the new IJSPP paper which comes from a team of prominent sports scientists in Australia Canada Spain and the United Kingdom led by Alannah McKay of Australian Catholic University. They’ve put together a detailed framework to classify athletes into six distinct categories based on exercise patterns and athletic ability across a broad variety of sports.

It’s an inherently intractable challenge since the characteristics of say well-trained table tennis players marathoners and archers are so different. But they’ve tried to make the framework flexible enough to work in different contexts by anchoring it in population statistics. You don’t get elite status by running a certain time or training a certain number of hours; it’s based on where you stand relative to everyone else.

Here are the categories:

Tier 0: Sedentary

~46 percent of the global population

This one is pretty straightforward. If you’re not hitting the World Health Organization recommended minimum level of physical activity—150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week plus a couple of muscle-strengthening activities—then you’re sedentary.

Tier 1: Recreationally Active

~35-42 percent of the global population

In this tier you’re hitting those WHO guidelines and may participate in a few different sports or activities but you’re not focused on training or competing in a specific sport.

Tier 2: Trained/Developmental

~12-19 percent of the global population

Now we’re getting more serious. In this tier you identify with a specific sport and you’re probably training three or more times a week for the purpose of competing. You might represent a local club play in a rec league or be on the junior varsity high school team.

Tier 3: Highly Trained/National Level

~0.014 percent of the global population

There’s a huge drop-off from Tier 2 to Tier 3: not many people meet the requirements of being highly trained. You’re competing in state- or national-level tournaments and competitions or perhaps for an NCAA Division II or III team and you’re training not just for fitness but to improve sport-specific skills. For sports measured in time or distance you’re typically within about 20 percent of the top performance in the world.

Tier 4: Elite/International Level

0.0025 percent of the global population

At this point you’re likely training as hard as anyone in your sport trains. You dream of the Olympics (or whatever the pinnacle of your sport is). You might be an NCAA Division I athlete or a member of your national team. You’re probably ranked somewhere between 4th and 300th in the world in your event and you’re within seven percent of the top performances in the world.

Tier 5: World Class

<0.00006 percent of the global population

This is what I think of as the Spinal Tap tier: a notch above elite. Crunch the numbers and you find that there are fewer than 5000 people in the world across all sports in this category. To join the club you’re probably an Olympic medalist or at least a finalist or an all-star in a professional team sport. You’re within two percent of the world record or yearly top performance.

The last three categories remind me of the cliché about the Inuit having dozens of words for different types of snow. Put together tiers three to five total less than a couple hundredths of a percent of the population so a very rarefied group. But to sports scientists those distinctions matter. The higher up the ladder you climb the closer the subjects are to their maximum adaptive potential and the more likely that any study you try will find no meaningful improvement. Under this microscope the difference between a good college athlete and an Olympic medalist is substantial.

Of course there are an infinite number of nuances. If your classification depends on comparison to your peers then the competitive depth of your sport matters. A lot more people compete in running than in say dressage or sailing. In freestyle snowboarding the authors suggest that you need to be a medalist at a major international event to be in the top tier while making the final eight puts you in Tier 4. In track and field making the final (which means placing in the top 8 to 15) at a major international competition puts you in Tier 5 because the competition is much deeper. If you want to dig into these nuances the paper is freely available to read online.

As for the eternal Letsrun debates about what counts as elite the paper includes a table of running times that delineate the various tiers based on a combination of Olympic winning times gap from world record gap from top yearly time world ranking and other measures. To be world class in this formulation a male marathoner would need to run 2:04:33 and a female marathoner 2:20:01. For elite it’s 2:12:15 and 2:31:03; for highly trained 2:27:54 and 2:50:41. Those are pretty lofty thresholds and I can’t help wishing that there were a few more rungs to climb between “trained” and “highly trained.” For practical classification purposes I’ll probably stick with the sliding scale I’ve been using for the past few decades: the definition of “fast” is a half-step ahead of me.

The visitor center looks nothing like the high-tech offices of Jason Bourne and Carrie Mathison. Instead the entry to America’s best-known intelligence agency has more of a shabby post-office feel. There are teller windows with bulletproof glass soda machines and an old-fashioned black landline phone mounted on the back wall. Once cleared by security visitors head back outside where they can walk down a winding road or take the rambling shuttle bus to the old headquarters building. There lobby security has no retina scanners or fancy fingerprint devices just a few turnstiles and a friendly security guard who takes cellphones and hands out paper claim checks.

The only clue that this is not a typical government building is the burn bags: Because classified documents cannot just be thrown away instead of trash cans striped burn bags that look weirdly like Trader Joe’s holiday shopping bags are scattered around the building to make incineration easier.

This post is excerpted from Zegart’s forthcoming book.

The National Counterterrorism Center is another story. Created after 9/11 to fuse terrorism-threat reporting across the U.S. NCTC has an ultramodern operations center with giant wall monitors an open floor plan and computer stations tracking bad guys around the globe. It looks like it came straight out of Hollywood. Because it did. Government officials hired an engineer from Walt Disney Imagineering to design the agency’s offices right down to the sleek consoles and lunchroom chairs.

In intelligence art is imitating life and life is imitating art. The implications of this shift are far more serious than they appear. In the past two decades the amount of spy-themed entertainment or “spytainment” has skyrocketed while spy facts remain scarce and university professors teach courses on just about everything other than intelligence. The result: Spy-themed entertainment is standing in for adult education on the subject and although the idea might seem far-fetched fictional spies are actually shaping public opinion and real intelligence policy.

Most Americans don’t know much about the secret world of intelligence because they have never come into contact with it. Although many are concerned about the growing gulf between civilians and the all-volunteer military far more Americans interact with soldiers than with intelligence officers. On a typical American street military veterans live in two out of every 10 houses. But outside of the Washington D.C. area almost no one lives next door to an intelligence official—or if they do they don’t know it. Intelligence isn’t very present in Congress either. In 2020 just 18 of the 535 representatives and senators serving in Congress had ever worked in an intelligence agency.

Amy Zegart: American spies are fighting the last war again

In 2009 I started hunting for polling data about Americans’ knowledge of intelligence as well as their attitudes toward intelligence issues. I didn’t find much so I decided to gather my own small sample of rough data surveying UCLA undergraduates enrolled in my U.S.-intelligence-history class. The results were illuminating. My students even those who followed the news closely knew almost nothing about intelligence agencies and how they worked. What’s more the data seemed to show a disconcerting connection between students’ ideas about intelligence and their consumption of spy-themed television. Those who said they regularly watched the hit show 24 which depicted torture often and favorably were statistically more likely than their peers to approve of harsh interrogation methods such as waterboarding which simulates drowning and which many regard as torture.

Of course the survey couldn’t prove that watching 24 caused these attitudes; my sample size was only about 100 and it was hardly representative. Maybe the show attracted viewers who had been more pro-waterboarding all along. In 2012 and 2013 I ran two national surveys through YouGov a polling firm gathering data from about 1000 respondents per survey from a nationally representative pool.

The YouGov findings echoed my less-scientific student poll. I found that Americans’ knowledge of intelligence is generally poor. A majority of Americans did not know who the director of national intelligence was or how much of the information in a typical intelligence report came from secrets. Perhaps most interesting I found that even in 2013 when the media was saturated with stories about secret NSA programs revealed by the former contractor Edward Snowden most Americans still had no idea what the NSA actually did. Many (wrongly) thought that the agency interrogated detainees and ran operations to capture or kill suspected terrorists. One in four Americans thought that the NSA built spy satellites (it doesn’t). The NSA does make and break codes—but only half of Americans knew that. The biggest crisis in NSA history was unfolding against a backdrop of widespread public misperception and ignorance. (The NSA intercepts and analyzes foreign signals intelligence including email telephone calls and encrypted data transmissions and is also as its website declares “home to America’s codemakers and codebreakers.”)

Findings from my 2012 and 2013 YouGov polls also resonated with my student survey about the real influence of fictional spies. I found that the more frequently American viewers watched spy-themed TV shows and movies the more likely they were to support aggressive counterterrorism tactics. Frequent spy-TV watchers were more willing than infrequent viewers to support assassinating known terrorists (84 percent versus 70 percent) and transferring suspected terrorists to a country known for using torture (60 percent versus 45 percent) and were more likely to believe that waterboarding suspected terrorists was the right thing to do (38 percent versus 28 percent).

Spytainment-viewing habits were also highly correlated with opinions about the NSA. The more that people watched spy-themed television shows and movies the more they liked the NSA the more they approved of NSA’s telephone- and internet-collection programs and the more they believed that the NSA was telling them the truth about its surveillance activities.

Whatever one thinks about these activities—whether they are effective or ineffective morally right or morally wrong—the fact that fiction may be significantly influencing public attitudes about them is unsettling.

There is good reason to believe that the relationship between spytainment and beliefs about intelligence could be causal. We know that entertainment has influenced popular culture and attitudes on plenty of other subjects. In the 1980s law-school applications shot up when L.A. Law became a hit television show. Prosecutors have bemoaned the “CSI effect”—the way the popular television show has led jurors to expect fancy forensic evidence in court and to assume that the government’s case is weak without it. And the 1986 blockbuster Top Gun became a Navy-recruiting bonanza boosting enlistments and applications to the Naval Academy. The film made the Navy so popular that recruiters even began setting up tables outside of movie theaters. If art can affect life in the legal profession criminal investigations and the military imagining that the same thing could be happening in intelligence is not much of a stretch.

Evidence suggests that this is the case. Spytainment has ballooned in the past 20 years becoming the predominant and often only way for Americans to understand the intelligence agencies that serve them.

Spy-themed entertainment is everywhere these days—in Robert Ludlum novels Tom Clancy video games the James Bond and Jason Bourne movie franchises and hit television shows such as Homeland and 24.

To be sure spies have been big business for a long time. Bond first appeared in Ian Fleming’s 1953 novel Casino Royale and has been around so long that seven different actors have played him on the big screen. Clancy’s CIA hero Jack Ryan first turned up in the 1984 novel The Hunt for Red October and Bourne first forgot his shady CIA past back in 1980 when Ludlum published The Bourne Identity. In fact America’s first-ever best-selling novel was a fictional account of a double agent during the Revolutionary War that was published in 1821 and aptly titled The Spy.

The difference today is the quantity and variety of spy-themed entertainment surrounding us. A hundred years ago American readers first discovered the allure of spytainment. Now they can’t get away from it.

Spies today corner a larger share of television and movie audiences than before. In the 1995–96 television season only two shows remotely related to intelligence—The X-Files and JAG—made Nielsen’s list of the 100 most-watched programs. In the 2005–06 season there were 12 spy shows on the list. As households have switched from traditional TV to internet streaming services spy-themed shows have followed them—Jack Ryan made his Amazon Prime debut in 2019. Today Hollywood studios are releasing twice as many spy blockbusters as they did in the 1980s.

Real spies have always had a complicated relationship with fictional ones. On the one hand intelligence agencies have been courting Hollywood for decades in the hopes of getting favorable portrayals. On the other hand they decry the negative and unrealistic depictions that often result.

No one promoted an agency’s reputation in the entertainment industry more assiduously than former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Presiding over the Bureau from 1924 until his death in 1972 Hoover was a one-man public-relations machine who cooperated only with producers and reporters who portrayed the Bureau in a positive light. By the 1930s there were FBI-themed radio shows comic strips bubblegum cards and especially movies including the Warner Bros. film G-Men starring the biggest tough guy in Hollywood James Cagney. These films glorified FBI agents as intrepid heroes guns in hand who worked the streets to solve crimes and always got their man. Although Hoover was quick to say that he did not officially endorse G-Men the Bureau was flooded with fan mail after the movie’s release.

Today the FBI CIA and Defense Department all have public-affairs officers or entertainment-industry liaisons who work with Hollywood writers directors and producers behind the scenes to try to get them to favorably portray their organizations. In 2008 the FBI sponsored a special public-relations seminar called FBI 101 for the Writers Guild of America. The CIA has developed and pitched its own list of story lines for screenwriters to consider. The Army Navy Air Force and Marines have deployed to Los Angeles setting up entertainment-liaison offices there.

Movie posters decorate the public-affairs conference room at Langley. In 2004 the CIA had the Alias actress Jennifer Garner appear in a recruitment video. For years the CIA’s kid website featured a cartoon spy Junior Officer Ava Shoephone who wore bright-red lipstick and a trench coat and spoke through a secret telephone embedded in her high-heeled shoe. The agency even named its venture-capital firm In-Q-Tel after Q the gadgets master from the James Bond series.

At the same time the CIA dislikes the sinister depictions of agency life that ride shotgun with all the Hollywood glamour. Perhaps no movie captures the risks that arise when Hollywood writes history like Zero Dark Thirty the Academy Award–nominated film about the CIA’s 10-year hunt for Osama bin Laden. The film received significant assistance from the CIA and portrays the agency in a very flattering light. According to declassified documents CIA officials met with the movie’s makers on repeated occasions reviewed draft scripts and provided access to a number of key people involved in the hunt for bin Laden. Yet when the film was released it generated so much controversy about what was real and what wasn’t that the then-acting director of the CIA Michael Morell had to issue a memo to his workforce clarifying the facts.

“The film creates the strong impression that the enhanced interrogation techniques that were part of our former detention and interrogation program were the key to finding Bin Laden. That impression is false” Morell wrote. This was a big deal. Both the efficacy and morality of harsh interrogation techniques have been the subjects of intense debate: Defenders argue that these methods produced some useful information that contributed to finding bin Laden and critics emphasize the way that harsh interrogations produced false and misleading information that hindered progress and raised deep ethical concerns. Reality is nuanced. The movie was not. The result was deeply misleading.

Yet the film’s writer Mark Boal and its director Kathryn Bigelow marketed Zero Dark Thirty as a faithful reporting of the facts calling it a “reported film” and a “docudrama.” The film’s opening frame declares that it is “based on first-hand accounts of actual events.” These are strong words. Bigelow kept using them including when she went on the comedy show The Colbert Report. It was a surreal moment: a filmmaker masquerading as a journalist telling a comedian masquerading as a news anchor that her fictional film masquerading as a documentary was a “first draft of history.”

The proliferation of spytainment has generated two policy problems. The first is a public mindset that sees intelligence agencies as far more powerful capable and unaccountable than they actually are. In its most extreme form the tendency to believe that intelligence agencies are omnipotent has fueled conspiracy theories that a “deep state” is out there running rogue. The second problem is a policy-making elite that invokes fictional spies and unrealistic scenarios to formulate real intelligence policy. From the heartland to the Beltway a little knowledge of intelligence turns out to be a dangerous thing.

Conspiracy theories may make for great entertainment but they are also believed by more and more Americans. A 2006 Scripps poll found that 36 percent of Americans considered it “likely” or “somewhat likely” that U.S. government officials either carried out the 9/11 attacks or knowingly allowed them to occur. Ten years later a YouGov/Economist survey found that 25 percent of Americans still believed it was “probably” or “definitely” true that the “U.S. government helped plan the attacks of 9/11.” There’s absolutely no evidence that this is true and overwhelming evidence that it’s not.

Scratch the surface of any conspiracy theory and you’ll find a prevailing belief that intelligence agencies are too high-tech too powerful too secretive and reach too far to make mistakes. Bad events don’t just happen. They are intended and carefully planned. The government’s penchant for secrecy is used as further proof; conspiracy theorists argue that if government officials were telling the truth they’d let us see the classified documents.

More recently connective technologies have created an online ecosystem tailor-made for spreading false narratives at lightning speed and unprecedented scale. The internet has become a misinformation superhighway where conspiracy theories can be conjured up by anyone posted on social media spread by hashtag amplified by bots and picked up by mainstream media—all at the touch of a button. In this new arena conspiracy theories are being peddled by everyone from radical bloggers to Kremlin cyberproxies.

The 2020 election revealed the powerful grip of conspiracy thinking and the very real dangers that it poses. The following year Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Marco Rubio a Republican from Florida was so concerned about myths and misperceptions that he gave a short tutorial about what intelligence actually is during the committee’s public intelligence-threat hearing. “There’s a lot of TV shows about intelligence there’s a lot of movies” warned Rubio. “The work of our intelligence agencies is depicted in all kinds of ways in the popular culture in the media in the darkest recesses of the internet.”

I do not mean to suggest that intelligence agencies and officials never overstep their legal authorities keep information from Congress or engage in objectionable activities. They have. And even programs deemed to be legal—such as CIA drone strikes targeting American citizens without judicial review—bring up unsettling issues related to ethics and policy. But the allure of conspiracy theories and deep-state thinking raises serious questions about how well intelligence agencies will be able to fulfill their mission in the future if large swaths of the public and even the president view them with such suspicion.

So long as citizens believe that intelligence agencies can track anyone go anywhere and do anything—whether for good or for ill—real intelligence weaknesses are less likely to get fixed and real excesses are more likely to go unchecked.

Fictional spies are influencing policy makers too from soldiers fighting on the front lines to justices sitting on the nation’s highest court.

In the fall of 2002 Lieutenant Colonel Diane Beaver the staff judge advocate general at Guantanamo Bay ran a series of brainstorming sessions to come up with interrogation techniques that could be used on terrorist detainees held there. She later admitted that Jack Bauer the lead character on 24 “gave people lots of ideas.” On the show Bauer a federal counterterrorism agent played by Kiefer Sutherland repeatedly used torture to elicit information that would save the United States from an imminent terrorist attack using the mantra “Whatever it takes.” Beaver ultimately approved the use of dogs sexual humiliation waterboarding and other controversial interrogation techniques. The dean of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point Army Brigadier General Patrick Finnegan became so concerned that 24 was hurting cadet training by glamorizing the efficacy and morality of torture that he visited the show’s creative team in Los Angeles to request that they produce episodes where torture backfires. (In a truth-is-stranger-than-fiction moment the show’s crew thought that General Finnegan who came wearing his military uniform was an actor.)

Other military educators became similarly concerned that soldiers in the field could not differentiate what they were seeing on television—in shows that included 24 Lost The Wire and Alias where interrogators faced imminent threats and torture always worked—from how they were supposed to behave in the field. Military leaders and FBI interrogators have long argued that other tactics work better; academic studies for example have found that prolonged sleep deprivation makes respondents unable to provide accurate information even if they want to. Rising concerns about spytainment’s influence on the military eventually led to an unusual partnership among military educators Hollywood producers and writers and the nonprofit organization Human Rights First to create a military-training film aimed at educating junior soldiers about the differences between fictionalized interrogations and their real-life jobs.

The military is not suffering this problem alone. Members of Congress presidential candidates and even former CIA Director Leon Panetta have all debated serious issues of policy by contemplating Jack Bauer plotlines particularly ones involving so-called ticking-time-bomb scenarios in which a suspected terrorist in custody is thought to hold vital information about an imminent threat to large numbers of people. In reality these ticking-time-bomb situations have never occurred and national-security experts have long argued that they are unrealistic.

And yet both Jack Bauer and ticking time bombs have been real considerations in the creation of national-security policy. In 2005 the Senate Judiciary Committee delved into ticking time bombs during its confirmation hearing of Alberto Gonzales the nominee for attorney general. In a 2006 Heritage Foundation panel discussion of 24 former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff praised Jack Bauer and the show as “reflecting real life.” John Yoo the George W. Bush–administration lawyer who wrote the memos justifying the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques wrote a book about his time in government that referenced Jack Bauer and considered the ticking-time-bomb scenario to be plausible. The late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia even suggested—twice in public—that he would sometimes turn to TV operative Jack Bauer to resolve legal questions about interrogation methods.

One week during the 2008 presidential campaign Jack Bauer was a major topic of conversation on Washington’s most venerated Sunday news show Meet the Press. The guest was not a Hollywood producer or actor but former President Bill Clinton who was asked to comment on public statements made by his wife the presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on interrogation policy. In 2009 several members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence pressed Panetta about what interrogation techniques he might use if confronted with a “ticking-time-bomb situation.” Panetta took the hypothetical seriously telling the intelligence committee that he would seek “whatever additional authority” he needed to get information that would protect Americans from imminent harm. The press quickly dubbed the policy the “Jack Bauer exception” to President Barack Obama’s ban on the use of harsh interrogation techniques.

Spy fiction has also affected congressional policy making. Tom Clancy’s Red Storm Rising inspired Vice President Dan Quayle’s support for the development of anti-satellite weapons during his time in the Senate. Of Clancy’s stories Quayle said “They’re not just novels … They’re read as the real thing.” Quayle later recommended Clancy as a consultant for the White House Space Council.

Spytainment isn’t all fun and games. Mounting evidence suggests that fiction too often substitutes for fact creating fertile ground for conspiracy theories to grow and influencing the formulation of real intelligence policy. Most Americans including members of Congress cabinet officials and judges making policies that affect national security don’t know much about the secret world of intelligence. The costs are hidden but significant.

In the 21st century the tip of the spear isn’t a spear. It’s intelligence—the ability to find acquire and analyze information to give us decision advantage against adversaries in physical space outer space and cyberspace. But secret agencies in democratic societies cannot succeed without trust. And trust requires knowledge. As the former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden once put it “The American people have to trust us and in order to trust us they have to know about us.”

At first glance the very concept of deepfake videos or voices appears criminal. Someone using deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) to simulate the face and voice of a person can’t be considered acceptable or legal.

Social media companies are struggling with various types of manipulated media which often are used to support fake information.

However a pioneering set of companies is using simulated videos and voices for genuine objectives. Much like ethical hackers who work for good these companies have created digital avatars for various applications including public awareness campaigns and marketing initiatives apart from education and training.

At first glance Singapore has beaten the odds having surpassed gross domestic product (GDP) estimates for 2021. But not everyone was impressed by the figures.

The city-state revealed that 2021 GDP had surged 7.2% reversing a contraction of 5.4% in 2020.

The growth also went beyond initial estimates of a 6-7% GDP increase by Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and marks the largest recorded growth since 2010.

However asset managers noted that Singapore equities lagged developed market benchmarks and that the strong GDP growth could drive up already high valuations.

Clara Cheong

JP Morgan AM

“Despite the strong growth numbers we’ve seen Singapore as well as the broader Asia Pacific ex Japan equities lag versus the developed markets in 2021” said Clara Cheong JP Morgan Asset Management’s Singapore-based global market strategist.

“Most of the underperformance is attributable to the more stringent restrictions on mobility as the virus evolved and the ensuing impact on the service sector” she added.

One-year returns for the MSCI Singapore index were 10.8% as of November 30 compared with MSCI World’s 25.18% returns which covers large and mid-cap equity performance across 23 developed markets. The MSCI AC Asia Pacific ex-Japan Index recorded a paltry 1.89% return over the same time period.

Mercer Singapore’s wealth business leader Chong Chee Loong concurred with this view saying that “Asia particularly Singapore have been slower to normalise compared to other regions such as Europe and the US. This is due to the government’s cautious approach in order to not overwhelm our healthcare services with an increase in Covid cases followed by further tightened restrictions.”

Nevertheless business sentiment among institutional investors for 2022 seems relatively positive primarily due to the rising vaccination rates in Singapore.

Chang Hwan Sung Invesco

“Even though the Omicron variant has brought additional uncertainties Singapore is in a stronger position with higher level of vaccination rates now and we expect Singapore to enjoy above-trend growth in 2022 albeit slowing down from 2021” said Chang Hwan Sung Invesco’s portfolio manager for Investment Solutions.

Cheong echoed this view saying that as vaccination rates increased Singapore and the Asean region should be in a stronger position to continue to reopen.

Mercer’s Chong was more specific as he expects certain sectors to pick up.

“Overall we expect the impact of Covid to become less important in 2022. Once the Omicron surge subsides we expect continued normalisation and the economy to open up in the rest of 2022” Chong said.

“This will benefit Singapore’s aviation and tourism industries which have been heavily impacted by the pandemic in the last two years.”

Interest rate hike

With the Singapore economy now back in the black on 2022 GDP growth expected at 3-5% according to official estimates Asian institutional investors also expect interest rates to rise in tandem.

“Alongside moderately stronger core inflation (the growth) should support higher rates as the economy continues to heal. As financials make up more than 40% of the Singapore equity market higher rates should be supportive of net interest margins” said JP Morgan’s Cheong.

Invesco’s Chang expects the US Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates in 2022 and said they will continue to maintain their positive view on the Singaporean stock market compared to other developed markets.

“However we believe other emerging markets in the Asean region such as Indonesia and the Philippines can benefit more from the recovery from Covid-19 in the long term and recommend a diversified portfolio in the region” he added.

Meanwhile Mercer’s Chong expects banks to perform well this year “as they benefit from interest rate normalisation (with at least two 25bps rate rises expected in the US in 2022) and the potential write back of provisions made during 2021.”

He noted that the Singapore stock market is quite concentrated and weighted towards financial stocks.

Higher valuations expected

Singapore’s expected steady growth in its GDP could drive up company valuations which would make it more expensive to invest in even if it meant more stable returns according to Asian institutional investors.

“We note that the Singaporean stock market is no longer cheap and is now fairly valued given the macro conditions such as local inflation levels and interest rates” said Invesco’s Chang.

“With above-trend growth and elevated inflation levels we expect it to deliver a high single-digit total return over the next market cycle. And in the long term we expect a strong dividend yield of around 3%” Chang added.

JP Morgan’s Cheong agrees that valuations are high but the returns could outweigh the costs.

“With consensus next twelve months price to earnings (PE) trading around 16x which is about +1 standard deviation valuations are not screamingly cheap” she said.

“However we expect the earnings outlook to continue to improve which would have the effect of lowering the PE ratio as the denominator expands” she added.

She expects Singapore equities’ earnings per share growth to be around 35% over the next 12 months - a higher rate than the Asia Pacific region ex-Japan at 22% and developed equities at 18%.

“As supply chain issues continue to ease globally and demand remains strong Asean companies should be able to grow earnings and hopefully avoid too significant of a margin squeeze.”

As for Mercer’s Chong he feels that the overall valuations of Singapore stocks are reasonable compared to the wider markets in Asia ex-Japan and the rest of the world.

“Singapore as a small open economy should benefit from the continued normalisation of economies in 2022 compared to those in Asia which have been less quick to loosen restrictions” said Chong.",,,,,,

However the ruling laid out in detail how the company sought to hold off the unionization effort and questioned its strategy and tactics.

The decision was handed down last week by an administrative law judge at the National Labor Relations Board Arthur J. Amchan. It involves Quickway Transportation which lost a unionization vote for employees based out of the Louisville KY distribution center operated by supermarket giant Kroger (NYSE: KR). Teamsters Local 89 won an election held between May and June 2020 with the workers voting to be represented by the union by a 25-17 vote.

Quickway is described in the judge’s ruling as an “affiliate” of Paladin Capital. It served the Louisville facility along with several other companies including Transervice Logistics and J.B. Hunt. (NASDAQ: JBHT).

Negotiations undertaken after the union vote did not produce a contract. In December 2020 Quickway terminated its contract to service Kroger–after some initial Kroger resistance–and the Quickway workers were laid off along with workers at two sub-terminals elsewhere in Kentucky. But the company kept the tractors used to service the Kroger account and they were distributed to other affiliates of Paladin Capital.

Judge Amchan rejected the union’s argument that the closure of the Quickway operations at Louisville was a violation of the National Labor Relations Act. Citing an earlier precedent Judge Amchan said that a 1965 decision Textile Workers Union of America vs. Darlington Manufacturing held that “closing an entire business does not violate the Act even if done for discriminatory reasons.”

But he added that a “partial closing” could be in violation if it was “motivated by a desire to chill unionism.”

In the Textile Workers Case the company liquidated itself. But as Judge Amchan notes Quickway didn’t “liquidate anything other than getting rid of some trailer cabs that were at the end of their shelf life.” Other assets were transferred within Quickway or Paladin actions that could be considered a “partial closing.”

Quickway was making money on its Kroger deal; the judge referred to the operation as “highly profitable.” It still has the lease at Louisville and “there is substantial incentive for (Quickway) to return to Louisville without any obligation to honor its former employees’ organizational rights.”





But Judge Amchan ultimately concluded that his reading of the Darlington precedent gave Quickway the ability to end its operations at Louisville legally.

Additionally “chilling” union organizing activities at other Paladin affiliates can not be seen as a goal undertaken by Quickway Judge Amchan wrote. The record of what happened in Louisville “only establishes (Quickway”s) determination not to bargain with the union in Louisville and a determination not to take chances on a strike…if it failed to reach agreement.”

In the judge’s decision there is evidence of Quickway management expressing concern about how a successful unionization drive at Louisville might affect any potential Teamsters efforts at a Quickway facility in Murfreesboro Tennessee. Work was shifted away from there so that Louisville drivers would not be visiting that facility and according to the words of one Quickway executive “infecting” the Tennessee drivers.

Although Judge Amchan ruled in favor of Quickway on the key legal question of whether it violated law by shutting its Louisville operations his decision leans more toward criticism than exoneration.

For example he suggests the company likely violated the law by not negotiating with the Teamsters to an impasse. “Respondent did what it did to avoid collective bargaining or even on the best interpretation of its motives to avoid a perfectly legal strike” he wrote.

He also criticized Quickway for not pursuing other steps to get around the impact of a strike like hiring replacement workers or setting up a “reserve gate” at the Kroger facility that would have allowed drivers from other companies to transport product in and out of the facility without crossing a Teamsters picket line.

Although Quickway’s actions were found not to have violated the National Labor Relations Act Judge Amchin did rule against two Quickway executives for their actions with employees in the months leading up to the unionization vote.

Jeff Curry Quickway’s Louisville terminal manager and Chris Cannon its vice president of operations were singled out as having violated the Act. McCurry was found to have illegally “interrogated” employees about their union sentiments. Cannon was charged with “condoning” surveillance of employees.





But the penalty is only a requirement that Quickway agree to no longer conduct those sorts of activities.

The surveillance of the Quickway workers involved taking photos of workers’ private vehicles with union stickers attached. Those pictures were then forwarded to management. Judge Amchan ruled that while Cannon was not involved in the photography he was aware of it and did not dissuade it.

In recapping the history of the unionization battle the review by Judge Amchin spells out several of the actions taken by Quickway management to discourage unionization efforts.

–Discipline against a driver perceived as anti-union was possibly lighter than against others solely because of his views about the Teamsters organization.

–Kerry Evola Quickway’s operations manager was said to have told several employees that if the union came to the Louisville operations the company would shut down. Evola denied that in testimony. But in a recording made by an employee Evola also told employees that a pro-unionziation vote would lead to Quickway no longer making contributions to an employee stock plan.

–Lori Brown the office manager for Quickway in Louisville took notes on driver conversations regarding unionization and was encouraged by Cannon through an intermediary to continue to do so.

Judge Amchin also noted that Cannon sent an email to William Prevost CEO of Paladin and Quickway suggesting the company hire the Labor Relations Institute to help fight unionization. Quoting an email from Cannon the LRI would be used because “the advantage of these companies is they have the legal right to say what our company cannot say during a union campaign” which Cannon went on to describe as “the negative effects if the drivers form a union.”

“This email not only evidences anti-union animus but indicates a willingness to violate” a section of the Act Judge Amchin wrote. That section 8 (a) (1) lists actions that management can not take during a unionization drive.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""

From thousands of stocks 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5 Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand soaring 2022 earnings estimates and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares retail investors could jump in at any time.

This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

April 29 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Jack Henry & Associates Inc.® (Nasdaq: JKHY) announced today that deconversion revenue for the fiscal third quarter ended March 31 2024 was $0.8 million. Based on these results deconversion revenue estimates remain at $16 million for full year fiscal 2024 guidance. For more information about how guidance will be further updated for deconversion revenue estimates please see Jack Henry's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 3 2023.

The majority of deconversion revenue is generated when one of Jack Henry's customers agrees to be acquired by another financial institution resulting in the termination of the customer's contract with Jack Henry. In these circumstances Jack Henry's recognition of deconversion revenue is driven by factors outside Jack Henry's control and this revenue does not represent the true operations of Jack Henry's ongoing business of providing services to customers. As a result Jack Henry excludes deconversion revenue from non-GAAP revenue reported in its quarterly and annual earnings releases.

Four men in black tactical gear pinned him his face to the concrete to cuff his hands behind his back.

He did not resist. He couldn’t. He was so gravely dehydrated he would be dead by their next shift change.

“I didn’t do anything” Mr. Johnson moaned as they pressed a shield between his shoulders.

It was 1:19 p.m. on Sept. 6 2019 in the Danville Correctional Center a medium-security prison a few hours south of Chicago. Mr. Johnson 21 and serving a short sentence for gun possession was in the throes of a mental collapse that had gone largely untreated but hardly unwatched.

He had entered in good health with hopes of using the time to gain work skills. But for the previous three weeks Mr. Johnson who suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia had refused to eat or take his medication. Most dangerous of all he had stealthily stopped drinking water hastening the physical collapse that often accompanies full-scale mental crises.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA1L2pvaG5zb25zLXRyZWF0bWVudC1ub3QtdHJhdW1hLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtcGxhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Optimism doubt ahead of Johnson's Treatment Not Trauma mental health plan,"Belmont Cragin residents were filing into the cafeteria at Prieto Math and Science Academy last month to weigh in on Mayor Brandon Johnson’s signature plan to overhaul Chicago’s mental health system when they got unexpected evidence that the bold still largely theoretical plan remains a focus at City Hall.

Into the school walked Johnson an unannounced guest at the community forum surrounded by a flock of leading administration officials.

“It’s one of our top priorities” he told attendees before talking about his older brother Leon who dealt with untreated mental illness and died addicted and unhoused. “Our ultimate goal our primary goal is that we provide mental health services without barriers. That when where and however individuals and families need these services the city of Chicago shows up.”

Despite the mayor’s words however the actual progress on his campaign promise to install the so-called Treatment Not Trauma plan remains difficult for Chicagoans to see. The City Council tasked a working group with answering many of the toughest implementation questions: where to open facilities what to ask for in the budget how many people to hire and more. Beyond that few changes have materialized.

But the path forward should soon become clearer: A year into Johnson’s first term the working group’s report outlining the plan’s future will be published later this month. For the coalition of activists who have spent a decade pushing for the policy and dogging mayors to enact it the city’s report should finally prove whether or not Johnson is truly offering a different path for mental health care in Chicago.

The people working to implement Treatment Not Trauma remain optimistic about the potentially sweeping policy’s future. But some of its proponents looking in from outside the bureaucratic process worry the long-awaited proposals are moving too slowly and will not live up to the bold vision championed by years of community organizing.

Johnson quickly passed an ordinance to launch the city’s working group once in office but to move forward the policy needs “active leadership” from City Hall not “infinite working groups infinite consensus buildings and no movement” said Eric Reinhart a public health law and psychiatry anthropologist and physician who co-drafted the “white paper” report published by the activist coalition that pushed for the policy.

“I think it’s quite disappointing to all of us that a year into this administration that even on the campaign stage held up Treatment Not Trauma as one of its core priorities we still haven’t made any steps forward” he said. “Everybody’s getting a working group but where are we seeing implementation?”

But Reinhart’s white paper co-author Arturo Carrillo expressed optimism after the Prieto Academy event. A member of the working group preparing the policy’s path forward Carrillo is also a social worker who directs violence prevention and health initiatives for the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council part of the broad Treatment Not Trauma coalition.

“It’s almost like we are playing catch up” Carrillo said. “This should have been started four years ago. Under the last administration. We were constantly being told no we were constantly seeing barriers put up. Complete resistance to any input. Now we absolutely see the wheels of government moving.”

The plan took its first steps toward concrete action in November when Johnson’s 2024 budget included $15.9 million to double non-police emergency response and another $5.2 million to reopen two of the 14 city-run mental health centers closed by past mayors. Nearly six months later the clinics have yet to reopen.

Johnson’s policy chief Umi Grigsby and Deputy Mayor of Community Safety Garien Gatewood defended the slow progress as proof the city is carefully gathering input across the city and “going at the pace of community.” So far the city has hosted 15 public feedbacks centered on the plan which remains on track to follow the timeline set by the City Council.

“This process has been very intentional” Gatewood said. “We are trying to do things that folks have never done before. Instead of coming in and prescribing to folks ‘This is what you need’ we are building together in real time.”

Grigsby and Gatewood declined to share specifics about the city’s Treatment Not Trauma plan in an interview last week citing the need to wait for the working group to first share its report with the City Council. But the two administration leaders helping to steer the fledgling policy hinted at its scope.

“Our goal is to expand mental health services. And so that means that we have to look at staffing we have to look at career pipelines we have to look at budgeting in the long term” Grigsby said.

Johnson’s administration plans to add the first two clinics by the end of the year and expects more clinics after this year Grigsby said.

The clinic reopenings are also a goal of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees a strong Johnson labor ally whose members lost jobs when Mayor Rahm Emanuel shuttered six city-run clinics in 2011.

The AFSCME International Union PAC contributed $100000 to Johnson’s mayoral campaign last year according to state campaign finance records. And AFSCME Illinois Council 31’s PAC contributed $56750 to Johnson in 2018 during his successful run for Cook County commissioner.

Many activists claim city-run centers are a better option than the private nonprofit clinics that serve many Chicagoans because the city clinics have more oversight focus on outcomes over cost and have a more substantial community connection.

It is so far unclear where the clinics will reopen though Johnson promised they will come “in neighborhoods with the highest unmet needs.” City leaders have also recently said they may expand mental health care by layering services into existing Chicago Department of Public Health clinics.

Johnson also intends to continue building out the Crisis Assistance Response and Engagement or CARE program piloted by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot Gatewood said.

The program sends non-police first responders to 911 calls regarding mental health crises substance use and homelessness issues currently using a handful of teams operating in selected neighborhoods. Gatewood declined to say how common CARE responses could become across the city but described expansion as a way to relieve pressure on overworked police.

“There are areas and spaces that police shouldn’t be responding to right? We know that they know that and a lot of community members know that too” he said.

The two leaders had little to say about a proposed third pillar of the Treatment Not Trauma plan: a new expansive network of nonprofessional “community care workers” employed by the city to work in neighborhood-based teams.

The so-called care corps would mark a dramatic shift away from clinic-based mental health services. Its workers would be tasked with finding ways to meet smaller needs through daily outreach in a bid to prevent mental health crises before they occur.

The positions were not specifically discussed as a series of city leaders spoke at the Prieto Academy gathering though speakers did reference a need for “extensive community outreach.”

And Gatewood and Grigsby shared few thoughts when asked about the role care workers would play in the policy’s implementation but flagged the need to build mental health outreach worker training pipelines alongside city colleges and schools.

“It’s about growing and expanding not only the services but the people who are able to provide those services” Grigsby said.

If the city does not implement a large-scale care corps as a part of Treatment Not Trauma it will fall short of the standards set forth by activists who started to push for the policy after Emanuel closed the clinics Reinhart said.

The policy’s original vision was not “just creating a bunch of city-run mental health centers where people can see psychiatrists and therapists” Reinhart said. Instead it was to have a whole new model — one that uses traditional clinic-based care and the alternative emergency response aspect but also relies heavily on care workers.

“Simply expanding the existing model that’s not TNT. That’s something else and it’s already failed” he said. “My biggest concern is that pieces of the vision will be closed off and touted as TNT without the whole vision. But you need the whole thing for it to work.”

Ald. Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez 33rd the policy’s chief City Council proponent tried unsuccessfully for years to move it forward under Lightfoot’s administration. The gradual process to “make it a reality” now allows for it to be “rooted in community” she said.

“There is a lot of work to do” Rodriguez Sanchez said. “What we are trying to do does not exist anywhere in the country.”

Makers of consumer durable products are hiking prices due to the rising input costs. Here's how costlier electric appliances are going to get.

Dearness Alert! The new year has seen a rise in the prices of air conditioners refrigerator. Makers of electronic consumer durable products have increased the retail prices due to the rising input costs. Due to this increased raw material and freight costs will engulf another essential appliance in the price rise as washing machines will likely become costlier by 5-10% later in January or by March 2022.

As reported by news agency PTI some brands like LG Panasonic and Haier have already revised prices of their products while other big brands like Godrej Sony and Hitachi are set to follow suit by end of the ongoing quarter.

Consumer durable products may see an industry-wide hike between 5-7% between January to March as per Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA).

Haier Appliances India has “taken steps” to hike prices of products in refrigerator washing machines and AC categories by 3 to 5%.

Panasonic has increased AC prices up to 8% and is still deciding on other product lines. LG has hiked prices in home appliances category. Due to “inevitable” price rise Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning will hike prices of its brands up to 10% by April in phased manner.

Other brands still to decide whether they will undertake price revisions include Sony and Godrej Appliances.

Some industry leaders are also wary of hurdles like delay in manufacturing due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s resurgence that could impact manpower and weekend and night curfew restrictions. However the prices could even come down by April-May if demand in the market remains sluggish.

Joey Romeo — a Princeton-educated buyout executive who married his Harvard Business School sweetheart Julia Dimon in 2011 — is part of a group of Apollo execs accused of luring Varun Mishra into a partnership that eventually turned sour with Mishra alleging he got cheated out of $21 million according to an explosive arbitration claim Mishra filed last month.

5 Julia Dimon and Joey Romeo have been together since their days at Harvard Business School. Facebook

After tapping Mishra’s expertise on natural gas and petroleum to build an energy business Romeo and other Apollo executives allegedly pushed him out as CEO — a coup that came shortly after Mishra raised questions about millions of dollars that Romeo had ordered be charged to the company’s expense accounts according to the filing.

5 Varun Mishra has expertise in the energy business.

People close to Apollo denied that any expenses paid by Varun’s company were inappropriate.

The spat offers a rare glimpse inside not only the rough-and-tumble world of private-equity deals but also the business of family members of the billionaire boss of JPMorgan Chase who have mostly kept a low profile.

Romeo now in his late 30s owns a $7 million 3825-square-foot unit in a Park Avenue luxury tower. Located two floors below the legendary banking tycoon the spread is the former home of iconic furniture designer Vladimir Kagan property records show.

Aside from a few wedding snaps on social media one of the few publicly available photos of Romeo surfaced in a controversial December 2013 Christmas card in which Dimon and his family romped around their palatial apartment hitting tennis balls. In one shot Romeo was caught leaping barefoot over furniture.

Romeo has been at Apollo since 2013 — and was brought on board at the urging of the late legendary JPMorgan dealmaker Jimmy Lee according to sources. Before Apollo Romeo had been an associate at GE Capital’s Energy Financial Services business.

“Jimmy called a lot of people to say ‘Hire Joey’” a source with knowledge of Apollo told The Post. “Joey did not go through the normal recruitment process.”

5 Joey Romeo (middle) appears on a 2013 Dimon family Christmas card.

MIshra meanwhile claims that Romeo got snooty and sarcastic as their business relationship steadily went south.

“Joseph Romeo can be described as a person who constantly belittles you” Mishra a 41-year-old Indian immigrant who came to the US as a student said in a written statement to The Post. “Without knowing me — or my immigration history — he commented on me that ‘Isn’t it too easy for you all to make money?’”

Romeo who is named as a defendant in the arbitration claim along with Apollo and other various current and former employees at the firm didn’t respond to The Post’s request for comment.

An Apollo spokesman told The Post that Mishra was “disgruntled” and that he had been fired “for cause.” The spokesman added that Mishra had engaged six different sets of lawyers and filed a previous arbitration demand “which he voluntarily withdrew.”

“We strongly support our team and categorically reject Mr. Mishra’s false defamatory and constantly changing allegations” the Apollo spokesman said.

Mishra told The Post he withdrew a previous arbitration claim because he believed it gave him a better chance to settle with Apollo. After that settlement fell apart Mishra said he filed the current one.

5 Joey Romeo and Julia Dimon married in 2011.

According to Mishra’s claim Apollo executives approached him in 2015 to offer at least $400 million to build out a business that would eventually become American Petroleum Partners. Under the agreement Mishra would contribute Pennsylvania wells he’d amassed and serve as CEO on an H1-B visa while Apollo would provide the capital for expansion.

But the next year Apollo and Romeo pulled the rug out from under Mishra axing a deal for APP to acquire a major natural gas fracking company for $360 million — only to turn around and scoop up the company through another firm in which some Apollo principals were “likely direct or indirect beneficiaries” according to arbitration papers.

Despite allegedly getting shortchanged by Apollo on the fracking deal Mishra had already committed his wells to the APP venture according to the complaint.

By that time Mishra told The Post he noticed Romeo had been approving expenses for Apollo executives’ limousines and other high-end travel to be paid for out of American Petroleum. According to Mishra’s suit Romeo was siphoning “multiple millions of dollars” out of Mishra’s business to pad the accounts of Apollo and its affiliates.

Mishra alleges that Romeo had directed Collin King then APP’s chief financial officer to “make substantial payments to Apollo without Mishra’s knowledge or approval.”

“Before he was fired to my knowledge he never alleged that the company reimbursed expenses — to Apollo or anyone else — that were not 100% legitimate company expenses” King who now works for APP’s successor company High Road Resources told The Post. “Romeo never directed me to approve any inappropriate expenses and I never did so.”

Mishra and his attorney both told The Post that he had indeed raised the issue of inappropriate expenses with King and with Romeo directly.

Mishra claims he rang alarm bells bringing it to Romeo’s supervisor’s attention but his protests blew up in his face. On Nov. 7 2019 Romeo traveled to Canonsburg Pa. with his boss Olivia Wassenaar to confront Mishra. They demanded he resign and accept a “paltry” payout — saying otherwise “he would be terminated for cause” the filing claims.

Mishra refused noting in his arbitration filing that he’d never been reprimanded or warned — let alone disciplined — for his performance as APP’s president and CEO nor had he received any written notice of any violations of his employment agreement.

The allegations come as Apollo is under a consent decree from 2016 after the Securities and Exchange Commission said an Apollo senior partner improperly charged expenses to certain company-run funds. If Mishra’s claims are found to have merit they could trigger another SEC probe of Apollo’s practices sources told The Post.

Ernest Badway a partner at law firm Fox Rothschild said the optics of the allegations “look awful” but added that they’re not necessarily illegal. “Sadly it would be misallocating expenses” if Apollo partners charged travel and other outlays to APP instead of the firm itself Badway said.

“The SEC has started investigations with much less than this” he said. Still Badway said SEC regulators will focus on who was potentially harmed by Romeo and Apollo’s alleged actions; if investors didn’t suffer any losses — and only Mishra did — regulators might be less apt to probe the situation.

Meanwhile Apollo sold APP’s assets in 2020 to Quantum Energy Partners-owned Tug Hill Operating for around $30 million the arbitration claim alleges. In May of last year Quantum sold its assets — including the former APP’s — to Premier Natural Resources for $6 billion the claim alleges.

Mishra received around $700000 for his APP stake after the Tug sale but he claims he should have received $21 million based on what the assets resold for — including the $10 million in capital he put up when he inked a deal with Apollo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L2Jpei8yMDI0LzA1LzYwMl8zMjE5MDAuaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTMyMTkwMA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No jab no job: Citigroup to fire unvaccinated staff this month,"

Boca Raton Fla. for $550 million. Celsius is a manufacturer of energy and fitness beverages sold under the Celsius brand.

The investment also includes a distribution agreement that will transition Celsius’ current US distribution system to PepsiCo. PepsiCo also will become the preferred distribution partner globally for Celsius according to the company.

“We are extremely pleased to partner with Celsius and excited about the opportunity for our two organizations to drive growth and innovation in the energy beverage category” said Kirk Tanner chief executive officer of PepsiCo Beverages North America. “The Celsius brand’s growing momentum coupled with the strength of PepsiCo’s portfolio and go-to-market capabilities create a combination we believe will be very compelling and valuable to retailers and consumers. We are looking forward to seeing the impact these two outstanding organizations can make together to more fully capture energy occasions.”

John Fieldly chairman and CEO of Celsius added “We believe the opportunity to partner with a global best-in-class distributor provides Celsius with significant near-term additional shelf space in both existing retailers as well as new expansion within the independent retailers that represent a significant portion of the US convenience and gas channel where approximately 70% of energy drinks are sold.

“It also provides a strategic partnership that is expected to accelerate growth for both companies globally. In addition this partnership will drive efficiencies allowing our teams to consolidate sales marketing and distribution efforts with associated cost benefits which we expect to recognize once the initial transition is completed.”

The investment in Celsius continues PepsiCo’s efforts to gain share in the market for energy beverages. The company acquired Rockstar Energy Beverages in 2020 for $3.85 billion.

That same year PepsiCo entered into an agreement with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. Weston Fla. the maker of the Bang Energy drink portfolio to distribute the beverages in the United States. That agreement later turned acrimonious and led Vital Pharmaceuticals to sue PepsiCo to terminate the agreement.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fox Crossing - My beloved husband father and grandfather has been taken home to Heaven on January 5 2022. Martin Francis Vander Wielen was born to Joseph and Elizabeth Vander Wielen on September 2 1934. Martin and Patricia Ayers met in a music store and were married on September 13 1956. Music continued to be the foundation in their faith family and service. We are questioning how we can live without him.

He was passionate in his role as Choir Director for both the Seraphim Choir at St. Bernadette parish and The Men's Choir at Sacred Heart parish. Marty proudly served in the Army National Guard and worked at Kimberly-Clark as an engineer. In his early years Marty fulfilled his musical dream by writing music and formed Marty Martin and His Orchestra. He was continuously spreading the joy of music with Pat by volunteering their talents at retirement homes hospitals school and church fundraising events Christmas caroling and family singing and dancing gatherings at Minnesota Thanksgivings.

Marty was a loyal friend; family was his priority. His self-appointed mission in life was to care for his wife children and grandchildren. He is survived by his loving wife Patricia: three children Julie (Kirby) Scott (Christine) Sarah (Mike) seven grandchildren: (Jennifer and Andrew; Kaila and Breana; Rachael Catherine and Laura). Siblings: sister Jane (Chuck-deceased) (Kerry Mark Lisa-deceased Ann and Kim) and brother Ken (Mary Ann) (Jody Jacci Rachel and Beth). He is further survived by many loving friends and caring neighbors.

The funeral liturgy for Marty will be held at 12:00 PM (Noon) on Saturday January 15 2022 at St. Bernadette Catholic Church 2331 E. Lourdes Drive Appleton WI with Fr. Joe Dorner officiating. Visitation will be held from 9:00 AM until Noon at church preceding the funeral liturgy. The family would like to extend gratitude to the doctors nurses and medical staff at Appleton Medical Center.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Dubbed Hotel Indigo the six-story project will replace three single-story commercial structures right by the Holly Street intersection with 101. RYS Architects a San Francisco-based firm is responsible for the design.

Along with detailed renderings the City of San Carlos has announced that the Environmental Impact Report is being prepared for Hotel Indigo. The Local Public Review Period will continue until February 3rd of this year. According to the city “comments should focus on discussing possible impacts from construction and operation of the project on the physical environment ways in which potential adverse effects might be minimized and alternatives to the project in recognition of the EIR’s intent to provide helpful and accurate information about aforementioned factors.”

The proposal would replace three single-story commercial structures plus surface parking spanning 2.09 acres. Construction will see an intricately designed six-story addition with 188 guestrooms amenities and a landscaped courtyard. The structure will be stepped down to three floors along Industrial Road where the property borders a shorter residential neighborhood.

The six-story structure will yield 119000 square feet with 188 guest rooms a lobby a dining area and meeting spaces on the second floor. Parking will be included for 152 vehicles and long-term storage will be offered for ten bicycles with short-term spots for 20 bikes.

RYS Architects is the project architect. Facade materials will include aluminum fiber-cement panels laminated panels limestone and cement plaster. Various opportunities will also be included for green walls to provide a natural characteristic to the exterior.

The hotel’s central amenity and selling point will be the landscaped courtyard designed by KLA. Covering 11430 square feet the design will create a functional area catering to the needs of hotel guests in a cloistered environment. Uses can include dining outdoor entertainment recreation and informal gatherings.

Public documents show Holly Hotel Group LLC is sponsoring the project though Faustus Capital has also claimed credit for managing the project. The firm is a private equity real estate investments and funds management group founded in 2009 based both in San Francisco and Shanghai. Faustus is focused on a wide variety of projects including hotels housing offices and mixed-use development.

According to Faustus Capital “with the plethora of future biotechnology and technology office developments in the city of San Carlos the subject property will be a much-appreciated addition to the hospitality landscape in Silicon Valley.”

Faustus Capital has also worked with the Oceanwide Group in Los Angeles on Fig Central or Oceanwide Plaza. The Los Angeles project unlike the SoMa Oceanwide Center plan by Oceanwide has actually topped out with construction underway as last reported by LAYIMBY. Faustus Capital was not involved with the Oceanwide Center plans in San Francisco.

The property will be near an In-N-Out and immediately adjacent to the Residence Inn by Marriott Redwood City which is confusingly in San Carlos.

An estimated groundbreaking date has not been updated though construction is expected to last between two to three years.

Base officials canceled the event due to “competing mission priorities” according to a press release.

""For now Whiteman Air Force Base will focus our resources on executing nuclear operations and global strike…anytime anywhere"" the statement read.

“This decision was not made lightly as we know many of our service members their families and our surrounding communities look forward to such an exciting event” said Col. Daniel Diehl 509th Bomb Wing commander. “We plan to devote the next few years to creating the best possible airshow experience for all participants and visitors in 2024.""

The press release went on to say that Whiteman AFB plans to host the next “Wings Over Whiteman Air and Space Show” in 2024.

So it looks like it will be about two-and-a-half years before you can expect to see another air show at Whiteman. The last one happened June 15 2019. So that's a time span of five years with no air show at Whiteman.

There are other options however.

The Spirit of St. Louis Air Show is scheduled for June 11-12 in Chesterfield.

The Tarkio “Greatest Little Air Show” is scheduled for July 9 at the Gould Peterson Municipal Airport in Tarkio.

The Kansas City Air Show is scheduled for Sept. 3-4 at New Century Air Center in Gardner Kansas.

The McConnell Air Force Base Air Show and Open House is scheduled for Sept. 24-25 om Wichita Kan.

If you're inclined to drive to Arkansas there's the Wings Over Bryant Air Show scheduled for June 25 at the Saline County Regional Airport in Bryant Ark. and the North Little Rock Air Show scheduled for Oct. 21-22.

There's four air shows slated for Illinois in 2022.

There's the TMB Avenger Reunion at the Illinois Valley Regional Airport in Peru Illinois May 20-21 There's the “Cavalcade of Planes” at the Bolingbrook Airport June 4-5. There's “Wings Over Mattoon” at the Coles County Airport Aug. 20. And there's the Chicago Air & Water Show at Lake Michigan Waterfront Aug. 20-21.

If you like your air show mixed with pyrotechnics go see the Dubuque Air Show and Fireworks July 3 at “Lock & Dam #11” on the Mississippi River.

If you happen to be driving to Oklahoma on the first of October don't miss the Altus Air Force Base Open House and Air Show.

If you want to see the USAF Thunderbirds in 2022 there are about 33 dates scheduled at various air shows across the US.

The United States Navy Blue Angels also have exactly 33 dates scheduled at air shows around America.

This all according to milavia.net.

About Listeria infections

Food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has eaten any recalled products and developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure.

Also anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop.

Symptoms of Listeria infection can include vomiting nausea persistent fever muscle aches severe headache and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose Listeria infections which can mimic other illnesses.

Pregnant women the elderly young children and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses life-threatening infections and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild flu-like symptoms their infections can lead to premature delivery infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.

More than 28000 pounds of ground beef is being recalled after possible E. coli contamination.

Customers who purchased ground beef from Kroger Walmart Albertsons and WinCo Foods in several states are encouraged to check their products.

E. coli infection can cause severe stomach cramps diarrhea and vomiting according to the CDC.

Retailers Kroger Walmart Albertsons and WinCo Foods are recalling more than 28000 pounds of ground beef over possible E. coli contamination.

Packages of ground beef produced by Interstate Meat Dist. Inc. of Clackamas Oregon on December 20 are being recalled after a sample tested positive for E. coli according to a statement released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service website on Thursday.

The beef was shipped out to retailers in Arizona California Nevada Oregon Utah Washington and Wyoming according to the FSIS.

""FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers' refrigerators or freezers"" the statement says. ""Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.""

The recalled beef has the establishment number ""EST.965"" inside the USDA mark of inspection or printed next to the time stamp and use or freeze by date. All recalled product labels can be found on the USDA's website.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said more than 28000 lbs. of ground beef products are included in the recall.

The items were shipped to retail locations in Arizona California Nevada Oregon Utah Washington and Wyoming.

The products include WinCo WalMart Kroger and Albertsons brands.

The raw ground beef items were produced on Dec. 20 2021. The products subject to recall and the labels can be viewed here.

The issue was reported to FSIS after a package of ground beef was purchased and submitted to a third-party laboratory for microbiological analysis and the sample tested positive for E. coli.

E. coli is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days on average) after exposure the organism the FSIS reported. Most people recover within a week but serious illness can occur.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

This story was reported from Detroit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpYmVyYXRpb25uZXdzLm9yZy9rcm9nZXItd29ya2Vycy1pbi1jb2xvcmEtdm90ZS10by1zdHJpa2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kroger workers in Colorado vote to strike – Liberation News,"On Jan. 3 King Soopers grocery store workers who are members of UFCW Local 7 voted to go on an Unfair Labor Practices strike in stores across Colorado. Stores that held strike votes reported “yes” votes of more than 98 percent. Workers are set to strike this Wednesday Jan. 12. Other local unions such as BCTGM local 26 and Teamsters local 455 have already offered solidarity with the UFCW strike.

The Unfair Labor Practices strike is a result of King Soopers offering high pay to non-union workers to perform union jobs as well as other “effort[s] to prevent workers from securing a new contract advancing wages health and retirement benefits and [not] ensuring a safe place for employees to work and customers to shop.”

King Soopers workers are also in the middle of contract negotiations and their current contract expired at midnight on Jan. 8. During contract negotiations King Soopers has attempted to hire non-union temporary workers refused to share information they are legally required to refused to bargain in good faith and slandered the union. UFCW local 7 also filed a lawsuit against King Soopers last week for breaching the union contract over vendors in stores.

Service workers including grocery store workers have faced COVID head-on for the last two years. In 2020 alone Kroger made $2.6 billion in profit while a worker working 40 hours a week would have only gotten a measly $640 from those record profits while being put in danger every day. Even while profits continued to grow throughout the pandemic King Soopers management halted their $2/hour “Hero Pay” increase in May 2020 only two months after beginning it.

To add insult to injury 55 percent of grocery workers in America say they do not have paid sick leave. These workers are left with the choice between risking their job and their ability to pay their bills by calling out using what little personal time off they have to recover if any or going to work while still infected.

As Kim Cordova VP of UFCW and President of UFCW local 7 in Colorado and Wyoming said “Local 7 will not rest until we secure a contract that respects protects and pays these essential grocery workers.”

Less than a month ago UFCW local 555 workers in Oregon went on strike against grocer Fred Meyer also owned by Kroger. Before the picket line went up the company illegally hired temporary workers without informing them of the impending strike among other labor law violations. Despite the company’s illegal strikebreaking attempts the agreement won by the strike includes “significant wage increases added workplace protections a secure retirement and quality healthcare” according to UFCW Local 555.

King Soopers has already begun hiring scab workers at $18 an hour significantly more than their current average hourly wage of $15. Kroger has also begun trying to improve their contract offers attempting to stave off the strike. Both of these actions reveal the truth: Kroger has plenty of money that they could use to pay their employees a living wage and ensure safer working conditions but they would simply rather funnel as much money as possible to their shareholders.

The base is among the first in the U.S. Air Force to deploy a new Explosive Ordnance Disposal robot platform the L3Harris T7 Multi-Mission Robotics System.



As the first two units in the Air Force to begin working with the new platform Hurlburt EOD part of the 1st Special Operations Civil Engineer Squadron trained with Eglin Air Force base’s EOD team Aug. 22 - 26 at Eglin AFB Florida.



The new platform will be used by EOD units across the Air Force to remotely perform operations on hazardous devices. The T7 will replace the Remotec F6A a nearly 20-year-old system.



Dennis Carson EOD logistics program manager and T7 product manager for the Air Force Civil Engineer Center at Joint Base San Antonio Texas explained that nearly every feature of the T7 has improved capabilities compared to the F6A.



Carson added that the new robot is twice as fast as the F6A and that it’s capable of lifting objects up to 250 lbs. Additionally the robot features enhanced capabilities when it comes to vertical and horizontal reach among other improvements including an extended battery life.



“All of these features allow the EOD operator to deal with larger hazardous devices in

less time than before which ultimately improves the safety of EOD personnel” Carson said.



Hurlburt and Eglin’s EOD teams spent the week learning how to operate the robot perform preventative maintenance and how to utilize capabilities including traversing slopes climbing stairs lifting objects and interrogating vehicles.



U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Paolo Pineda an EOD technician with the 1st SOCES at Hurlburt Field noted that the T7 stands out as a capability upgrade for Air Force EOD.



“With this new robot it’s larger - it can interrogate vehicles such as SUVs trucks and vans” Pineda said. “And then it has the manipulation to be able to even open up a zipper on a backpack.”



Pineda added that the new capabilities can be helpful to respond to situations similar to previous events at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Travis Air Force Base in California involving attempted gate breaches.



“This will be able to interrogate those vehicles” Pineda said. “With it being larger and having all of that manipulation it will cut down our overall mission time when we are on scene.”



In addition to Hurlburt and Eglin’s EOD units other installations working with the robot in coming weeks include Patrick Space Force Base Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida.

For the student from Queen’s College a government school studying abroad at an elite institution had long been a distant dream.

Now about three years later the 21-year-old has achieved yet another rare opportunity. He has been awarded the extremely competitive and prestigious Rhodes Scholarship to pursue a master’s degree in migration studies at Oxford this fall.

Blind student at the University of Cambridge shares why she wants to be a layer

“I hope to help people emigrating from Hong Kong to maintain their identities abroad” the Rhodes Scholar said.

For a local student to attend a top university in Britain it would seem that Lam’s academic journey must have been smooth sailing but that was not always the case.

Looking back he said it was his passion for competitive debate that drove him to improve his English – and inspired him to study Philosophy Politics and Economics for his bachelor’s degree.

“Many debate topics are related to politics and economics and [debating] also trained my spoken English” explained Lam.

His first debate competition was in Form Two and he faced a team from an international school. Even though he was studying in an elite secondary school his English was not nearly as fluent as his opponents’.

He lost the competition.

“I felt a huge gap between myself and the international school students. It seemed like I would never reach their level” he recalled.

The setback pushed Lam to work harder on his English language skills but when he saw teams from other local schools with even less support than he had it raised his awareness about educational inequality in the city.

“Some local schools might not even have the networks or money to hire a trainer for debating” he said. “I realised the inequality in resources and this planted a seed in my heart to help local students.”

In Form Five he joined a programme at Access Abroad Hong Kong an organisation run by student volunteers from Oxford and Cambridge University to help pupils in Hong Kong apply to these elite institutions.

Is Hong Kong an ideal learning environment for students?

With their help Lam successfully enrolled at Oxford. He became a co-director of the group and organised events to share tips for applying to foreign universities.

“There are gaps in information aspirations and resources [at local schools] … The syllabus is very limited as it does not encourage students to explore subjects outside the exam requirements” he said adding that local pupils often did not know they could apply to overseas universities.

“Some students say to me ‘I don’t think I can be like you’ … I didn’t expect to make it to Oxford … but I gave it a try.”

How to make new friends when you go to school abroad

For the other Hong Kong winner of the 2022 Rhodes Scholarship Andre Chan Lok-sang receiving the award to study music was not what he would have expected as a child.

“It was quite late [when] I started getting into music and finding my love and passion for it” recalled the 22-year-old who graduated from Columbia University last year and will pursue a postgraduate degree in music at Oxford this fall.

“It’s not a very common thing to see a Rhodes Scholar pursue music … [especially] in Hong Kong.”

Andre Chan said he discovered his passion for music quite late. Photo: Andre Chan

When he was young playing instruments was just a part of building his portfolio to get into a good school.

But after moving to the United States for high school he started to find his passion. He played for the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra and joined his school’s choral groups. During that time he explored the wide breadth of classical music which awakened his curiosity.

In 2017 Chan travelled to Poland and visited a bookshop where he found the book Forbidden Music. In it he read about Hans Gál a Viennese-Jewish composer whose career was destroyed by the Nazi regime.

Do you need to go to university to be successful?

After more research Chan decided to perform the composer’s Serenade for String Orchestra Opus 46 (1937).

To his surprise news of his performance in 2018 spread to the composer’s daughter Eva Fox-Gál who was living in Britain. In conversations with Fox-Gál over Zoom he learned more about her father’s life.

“Through her words I got to know his music from a personal point of view” he recalled.

The Jewish composer was relatively famous in the 1920s but his career was wiped out overnight because of the Nazis. Many of his loved ones died at the time.

At Oxford Chan will continue researching Gál’s music and fighting for the legacies of other censored and forgotten composers.

“You find [in] his music a lot of hope” Chan said. “And I think that’s how music can inspire us – to feel the hope in life.”

After finishing its third consecutive year of double-digit percentage gains in 2021 the S&P 500 started off 2022 with a down week.

On Friday the Labor Department reported the U.S. economy added just 199000 jobs in December well short of economist estimates of 422000 jobs. U.S. wages grew 4.7% from a year ago and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.9%.

The Federal Reserve released its latest meeting minutes on Wednesday which suggested the Fed is planning to begin selling off bonds held on its balance sheet sometime after it begins raising interest rates in 2022. The Fed is projecting three interest rate hikes this year and the bond market is currently pricing in a greater than 70% chance the first rate hike will come in March.

Rising U.S. Treasury yields weighed on tech stocks. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes climbed to 1.79% on Friday up from 1.5% at the end of 2021 and 1.12% a year ago.

On Monday Theranos founder and former Silicon Valley billionaire Elizabeth Holmes was found guilty of four out of 11 charges in her criminal fraud trial. Theranos reached a peak valuation of $10 billion in 2013 but the company dissolved in 2018 after failing to deliver on claims it had developed revolutionary blood-testing technology.

Hot potatoes

Shares of frozen potato product specialist Lamb Weston gained more than 10% last week on the strength of better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings numbers and impressive gross margins amid elevated potato prices.

In the week ahead fourth-quarter earnings season kicks off with reports from Delta Air Lines on Thursday and big banks JPMorgan Citigroup and Wells Fargo on Friday.

Analysts are predicting 21.3% S&P 500 earnings growth for the fourth quarter according to FactSet.

Only MGM remains with a firm bid and even they seem to lack the enthusiasm they once had. How and why did it all go so wrong in Japan? And does Japan have any way to save the day?

In May 2018 I chaired the Japan Gaming Congress a major international conference in Tokyo produced by the organizers of the world’s largest gaming exhibition ICE London. The approximately 600 delegates represented a veritable who’s who of the international IR business community as well as a plethora of Japanese conglomerates and potential local suppliers – all looking to get a cut of the Japan IR action. Industry chatter about Japan ramped up through the 2010s. In 2014 and again in 2015 Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party said they were trying to get IRs open in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. In December 2016 Japan passed the Integrated Resort Promotion Act which the Financial Times described as “fulfilling a cherished ambition of [then Japanese Prime Minister] Shinzo Abe and firing the starting gun on a race to control a potential $40 billion Japanese gaming industry.”

The Integrated Resorts (IR) Implementation Act passed in July 2018. Just about every major IR operator in the world and plenty of second and third-tier operators too were salivating at the prospect of operating in what some described as the last great untapped IR market – the planet’s third-largest economy with a GDP around US$5 trillion and a population of 125 million. Many Japanese cities and prefectures created “IR promotion offices” tasked with exploring the opportunity.

IR concepts started surfacing taking advantage of Japan’s exquisite dining beautiful design esthetic and fascinating cultural mix of the ancient and historic with the modern and technological. Despite the most expensive IR anywhere in the world thus far costing around US$4 billion or US$5 billion suddenly investment amounts of US$10 billion or even more were bandied about.

Even IAG took the plunge and launched its IAG Japan brand in January 2019 adding Japanese to our language portfolio staffing a dedicated Japanese office and signing a strategic partnership with a long-established Japanese B2B hospitality industry media company. Yours truly travelled to Japan monthly throughout 2018 and 2019.

In 2019 IAG Japan covered no less than a dozen potential IR locations across the length and breadth of the country – from as far west as Nagasaki right up to Hokkaido in the very north. We also covered around 20 potential operators bidding for up to three licenses including all the industry tier-one names: Caesars Galaxy Genting Melco MGM Sands and Wynn – as well as a gaggle of other contenders such as Japanese company Sega Sammy Philippines IR operator Solaire Macau-based SJM and Suncity tribal gaming operators Hard Rock and Mohegan Sun and many more from across the globe.

A PROPHETIC WARNING

Amongst all this optimism in 2019 I asked a respected executive with over 40 years of industry experience his thoughts about Japan. I anticipated an enthusiastic response given all the excitement. What could possibly go wrong?

He looked at me much as an experienced and level-headed grandfather might look upon an exuberant youngster and sagely said “I have never been able to successfully do business in Japan or with the Japanese. Usually whatever deal you are working on falls through and when it doesn’t you wish it had. It always starts out looking rosy but by the time the dust settles they have ended up with everything and you’re left standing there wondering ‘what happened?’”

How prophetic those words were to be!

ABANDON SHIP

Fast forward to today. Just about every major IR company in the world has abandoned what used to be called “The Japan Opportunity” and might now be called “The Japan Folly.”

The waning interest started when Caesars pulled out of the Japan IR race in August 2019 ostensibly to focus on completion of its US$18 billion merger with Eldorado Resorts. Later in February 2021 when Caesars withdrew from its interest in developing a Korean IR CEO Tom Reeg stated “You should expect that over time [our Windsor management contract in Ontario Canada] will be the extent of our non-US business” signalling a lack of interest in operating anywhere outside North America.

Despite this in September 2021 Caesars was named as casino operator for Clairvest Neem Ventures’ IR development in Wakayama although Caesars was quick to point out this was with “no capital commitment” – so it seems Caesars merely lent their name to boost the Clairvest bid.

Las Vegas Sands was next to withdraw in May 2020. Then-Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson simply stated “The framework around the development of an IR has made our goals there unreachable.” In August 2020 Wynn closed its Yokohama office with CEO Matt Maddox saying the company had been “pulling back its efforts in Japan since March 2020.”

In November 2020 Genting Singapore noted it was still interested in Japan “if conditions meet the group’s investment criteria.” It was the first time the company had felt the need to add such a qualifier. Genting Singapore was forced to withdraw from Yokohama after the August 2021 election of new mayor Takeharu Yamanaka who promptly cancelled Yokohama’s bid to host an IR honoring his campaign’s popular anti-IR stance. After that Genting did not actively pursue any other bid in Japan and then quietly dissolved all its Japanese subsidiary companies in late December seemingly signalling a complete withdrawal from Japan once and for all – or at least the foreseeable future.

In May 2021 Suncity withdrew from its Wakayama IR bid citing the COVID-19 pandemic expected further delays and uncertainty surrounding the Japanese IR process.

Melco Resorts also a victim of the Yokohama cancellation says it remains fully committed to pursuing an IR license in Japan when the “right opportunity” emerges. Apparently so far it hasn’t.

Like Melco Galaxy has not publicly or officially withdrawn but has effectively done so by not pursuing any Japan IR opportunity right now. Galaxy is known to be reducing its staff on the ground in Japan from a peak of over 25 people to just a single employee.

Mohegan Sun too withdrew from the process after partnering with the Oshidori bid in Nagasaki – a bid which lost in highly controversial circumstances with Oshidori crying foul and accusing the Nagasaki prefectural government of lying and corruption. In a December 2021 interview with IAG Mohegan International President Bobby Soper said of Japan “It definitely evolved much differently than many thought it would. The regulatory requirements the short term of the license – there are a lot of reasons it didn’t make sense for a lot of companies.”

MGM Resorts was the most Japan gung-ho of the world’s major operators. Under former Chairman and CEO Jim Murren MGM spent considerably on its “Osaka-first” campaign. IR investment numbers well north of US$10 billion were quietly whispered amongst industry insiders. But rivals Galaxy and Genting Singapore withdrew their Osaka bids in February 2020 leaving MGM as last-man-standing in Osaka and now last-man-standing of the tier-one operators in all of Japan. Murren departed in March 2020 replaced by long-time MGM executive Bill Hornbuckle as CEO and President.

Under Hornbuckle MGM’s interest has been more measured. In July 2020 the new CEO described MGM Resorts as “not all-in on this investment” commenting “We will only make this investment if we think it’s going to be prudent if we think it’s going to pay the kind of returns that we need to meet our expectations. There is a long way to go.” In January 2021 analysts at brokerage Sanford C Bernstein speculated that potential acquisitions by MGM Resorts in the iGaming space could result in the company either reducing its stake in a Japanese integrated resort or exiting Japan entirely.

Even if Hornbuckle has since reaffirmed MGM’s commitment to Osaka the days of tossing about US dollar investments in the eleven figures are long gone with MGM now estimating the total cost at JPY 1 trillion (US$9.1 billion). In August 2021 Hornbuckle told investors MGM was prepared for a much more manageable US$2 billion to US$2.5 billion investment split over three years from 2024. That investment is expected to be matched by MGM’s major consortium partner ORIX with a further US$4.1 billion to US$5.1 billion to be funded predominantly by debt but also potentially by minor consortium partners contributing up to US$1.8 billion.

In March 2021 Japan’s Minister of Land Infrastructure Transport and Tourism Kazuyoshi Akaba said operators would not submit applications if they did not think IRs would be profitable. Perhaps he wishes he could eat his words because that is precisely what has transpired.

So what happened?

Why did most of the world’s major IR companies give up on Japan? There are many answers. Firstly the Japanese government has not done a good job selling the benefits of IRs to the Japanese people. Unlike Singapore in the noughties where the government was able to change the public’s vernacular from “casinos” to “IRs” Japanese people still often refer to the proposed IRs as “casinos” and the two words they most closely associate with “casinos” seem to be “addiction” and “gangsters”. The average Japanese impression of a casino is more like a smoky pachinko parlor a Yakuza-run underground casino or something out of a 1990s Hong Kong gambling movie than the modern-day luxurious resort offerings to be found in Macau or Las Vegas. Supporting IRs has therefore been politically unpopular as we have seen in Yokohama.

There have been several scandals associated with the development of IRs in Japan. The most well-known was the infamous 500.com scandal which saw an online sports lottery service provider in mainland China bribe Japanese House of Representatives member Tsukasa Akimoto who was serving as State Minister of the Cabinet Office at the time. Akimoto was jailed for four years in September 2021 for receiving bribes and offering to bribe witnesses in his own case. Two changes of Prime Minister since Shinzo Abe started championing the policy of legalizing Japanese IRs haven’t helped. While Prime Minister Abe’s replacement Yoshihide Suga and his replacement Fumio Kishida are both from the same ruling Liberal Democratic Party as Abe each change of leadership takes us a further step away from the original IR champion making it easier to bail on the policy for political expediency reasons.

Almost every economic factor in the Japan IR model has gone against the operators. Just a few examples are the relatively high 30% gaming tax the imposition of a Singapore-style entrance fee for locals a gaming floor maximum limit of 3% by area effectively short license periods and the imposition of surrounding public infrastructure costs on IR operators. All of these have impacted returns in the operators’ financial modelling.

Further exacerbating potential returns from Japanese IRs is the recent approach of mainland China towards countries targeting its citizens for play in casinos. In February 2021 Japanese House of Representatives member Kenji Eda referred to the mainland China blacklist system restricting travel to foreign cities with casinos targeting Chinese visitation noting “… if we build casinos (IRs) in Japan we cannot have expectations that foreigners and especially Chinese tourists will be able to visit.”

Cultural clashes between the Japanese business style and that of the international IR operators have been revealing. Behind closed doors international operators refer to the “unreasonable expectations” of the Japanese while the Japanese grow frustrated at what they deem foreigner’s lack of understanding of the Japanese way of doing business. This may go some way to explaining why no major new international industry has emerged in Japan since the 1970s.

Japanese jingoism has also played a role. Some believe that Japanese animosity toward China means no Chinese-based company (including those from Hong Kong or Macau) can hope to win an IR license in Japan. There is evidence to suggest this may have affected potential operators Galaxy Melco and Oshidori all of which are based in Hong Kong.

In January 2021 Vitaly Umansky Kelsey Zhu and Tianjiao Yu of brokerage Sanford C Bernstein summed it up simply stating “The Japan opportunity has been plagued with delays … and we maintain concerns around the high cost of development required and the potential returns.”

Despite all the negativity three locations in Japan do remain in the running for the up to three licenses to be issued by the national government – Wakayama Nagasaki and Osaka.

WARY WAKAYAMA?

In June 2021 Clairvest was “selected” as the operator partner of Wakayama for its bid – selected from a list of one that is as all other previously interested parties had withdrawn from the process. A basic agreement between Wakayama and Clairvest was signed in August 2021.

Also involved in the Clairvest consortium is AMSE Resorts connected to casino executive William Weidner and Mario Ho of the famous Ho casino family in Macau. Clairvest has announced Caesars as their operator partner but Caesars has not committed to any of the JPY 470 billion (US$4.3 billion) claimed capital investment. Neither Wakayama prefecture nor Clairvest have disclosed any further details on consortium members project partners or funding. Clairvest’s entire market capitalization is under US$1 billion less than a quarter of the project’s investment capital.

There have been political concerns expressed at the Wakayama Prefectural Assembly particularly relating to the lack of detail around financing such a large project and not-so-cryptically questioning if at least one Prefectural Assembly member is “too involved” in IR development.

In November Wakayama Prefecture announced the postponement of scheduled resident briefing and public feedback sessions due to information supplied by Clairvest being deemed “insufficient.”

Worse still a Wakayama resident group has collected 20833 signatures calling for a referendum on the IR bid saying “there was no opportunity for citizens to vote despite the fact this is a serious issue for citizens.” The petition consists of more than triple the minimum number of signatures required to hold a referendum and is expected to be submitted to the City Council in January 2022.

In May 2021 Wakayama Governor Yoshinobu Nisaka suggested that the prefecture may opt against taking part in Japan’s IR selection process should it deem Clairvest unlikely to win national approval.

NAUGHTY NAGASAKI?

On 6 August 2021 Nagasaki selected Casinos Austria International Japan (CAIJ) as its preferred partner and just 24 days later the parties hurriedly signed a basic agreement. The development cost is said to be JPY 350 billion (US$3.2 billion) with plans to attract 8.4 million visitors annually an extraordinary number which seems impossible to achieve given the extent of historical inbound tourism to Japan and Nagasaki’s reputation of being “too far away” to visit.

The operator selection process in Nagasaki was particularly bitter with rival bidders Oshidori International Development and NIKI Chyau Fwu (Parkview) Group both controversially claiming Nagasaki Prefecture pressured them to withdraw from the process. In August 2021 an Oshidori spokesman speaking directly to IAG said “The Nagasaki Prefecture has no other option at this point than to lie to cover up its corruption” while NIKI representatives are on record as saying they “object to this process in its entirety” and that Nagasaki Prefecture “refused to provide any information in what is [a] very troubling process.”

The project renderings offered by Oshidori and CAIJ didn’t help to quell suspicions amongst industry experts. Oshidori’s proposal titled “The Sails at Omura Bay” seemed like a spectacular and inspired IR project an iconic set of buildings resembling shimmering sails encrusted with one hundred thousand lights twinkling in the night sky. By contrast CAIJ’s modest and square buildings failed to impress.

The Nagasaki IR site at Huis ten Bosch in Sasebo City has weak access infrastructure. There is no bullet train so visitors must endure a near three-hour slow train journey from the nearest major airport at Fukuoka. The drive from Fukuoka is nearly two hours. Sources tell IAG that CAIJ is expected to pay around JPY 15 billion (US$136 million) in infrastructure costs in the area surrounding the IR an amount more than the entire net assets of CAIJ’s parent company Casinos Austria International according to the last set of financial accounts seen by IAG.

CAIJ is yet to publicly disclose its source of financing and intended partners and as a result IAG understands many prefectural assembly members are questioning the entire project. CAIJ does not have any internationally acknowledged or experienced IR expert or executive representing them publicly in Japan.

A public comment period for residents started on 21 December and will continue until 17 January and this may generate additional political pressure. In December the current pro-IR governor Hodo Nakamura announced he will be seeking re-election in Nagasaki’s upcoming gubernatorial election to be held on 20 February 2022 but the national-government-ruling Liberal Democratic Party has in fact thrown its weight behind one of his opponents Kengo Oishi who is yet to declare his stance on integrated resorts in Nagasaki.

ONLY OSAKA?

Given that neither Clairvest at Wakayama nor CAIJ at Nagasaki have given any detail on how they intend to fund these enormous projects multiple times larger than the value of their entire companies and the grave ROI concerns expressed by industry analysts about the regional IR projects it seems quite possible that neither of them will be approved by a prudent Japanese national government. But even if they are execution will be a herculean task to be taken on by companies with no experience in Asia let alone Japan.

Many commentators believe only one IR will be approved for the foreseeable future the MGM Resorts property in Osaka. At least that proposal has an internationally recognized top-tier IR company behind it and is located within a major metropolis. The surrounding Kansai regional population totals nearly 25 million people – the kind of population base needed to support a multi-billion US dollar integrated resort.

In September 2021 Osaka confirmed the MGM/ORIX consortium as its IR partner – again from a list of just one applicant. The US$9.1 billion project is planned to contain 2500 hotel rooms across three hotel brands with 730000 square feet of MICE space and tourism facilities. It is now planned to open in 2029 but given Japan’s track record of numerous delays don’t be surprised if we must wait until well into the 2030s to see the doors open. The many construction issues include the complete lack of subway access and a soil pollution problem at the Yumeshima site.

So much for Japan IRs opening before the 2020 Olympics!

WHERE TO FROM HERE?

The national government’s deadline for submission of development plans from the three prefectures is 28 April 2022. The national government then has the right to select up to three locations. It can even reject them all should it choose to do so. There is currently no official guidance regarding how long the national government will take to make these decisions.

Most commentators agree that MGM’s proposal for Osaka should be selected. However if either of the other two locations are selected the Japanese government will be making a grave mistake. Given the inexperience in major IR development of the selected operators the scale of the developments for such small regional locations and the problematic processes so far either of these regional sites will end up as enormous white elephants.

Can Japan pull itself out of the hole it has dug for itself in its IR development process? Yes but it will require a major rethink. The Japan government should use COVID as an excuse and go back to the drawing board learning from the mistakes made thus far and re-writing the rules to make Japanese IRs a more attractive economic proposition to the international IR community. The fact that just one major IR company is currently in the running and even then in a much less enthusiastic manner than previously should be a massive red flag to Japan.

The question is has Japan’s leadership got the ability to be introspective acknowledge the errors made and completely rework its IR development offering? I very much doubt it.",,,,,,

En Cómo hablar de los libros que no hemos leído Pierre Bayard realiza una interesante reflexión acerca de los diferentes modos que tenemos de relacionarnos con los libros. Uno de esos modos y puede que el no más infrecuente es el olvido que acaba desdibujando las fronteras entre los libros leídos y los no leídos. Ciertamente hay libros que sólo recordamos haber leído cuando vamos por la mitad (y otros que aseguramos estar releyendo cuando nunca los empezamos); y hay libros que recordamos siempre aun cuando no los hayamos leído o al menos no desde la primera a la última página como sucede con la Biblia o ciertos clásicos que más que libros son atmósferas o con obras como el Ulises de Joyce o En busca del tiempo perdido de Proust que en palabras de Borges fueron escritos para ser analizados mas no leídos. También puede suceder que recordemos un libro no tanto por su contenido como por haber quedado asociados a algún momento o lugar entrañable o por habernos hecho el don de alguna frase o idea feliz. Vaya por delante que El niño filósofo de Jordi Nomen me ha regalado varias de esas cosas. Destaco sólo dos. La primera haberme instado a ver con mis hijos una película como L’esquive (La escurridiza) de Abdellatif Kechiche en la que se contrastan los modos lingüísticos de unos adolescentes que viven una banlieue francesa con el lenguaje preciosista del Juego del amor y del azar (1730) la obra teatral de Pierre de Marivaux que deben representar en el instituto. La segunda una anécdota aquella que recoge o inventa Heródoto en su Historia donde afirma que Ciro el Grande se burló en cierta ocasión de los griegos por tener “la costumbre de dejar en el centro de sus ciudades un espacio vacío al que acuden todos los días para intentar engañarse unos a otros bajo juramento.” Comenta Jordi Nomen siguiendo a Carlos Fernández Liria que no hay mejor símbolo del espíritu democrático que aquel espacio vacío del ágora donde no había dioses ni reyes ni amos ni siervos sino solo ciudadanos (y hoy también ciudadanas) relacionándose de igual a igual. Ahora que lo pienso esa es una buena historia para el grupo de Espai en blanc (Espacio en blanco) que crearon hace ya muchos años Santiago López Petit y Marina Garcés (a muchas de cuyas reuniones tuve la suerte de asistir). En todo caso este tipo de regalos de los que está lleno el libro de Jordi Nomen le van a valer un hueco en mi propio juego del olvido y el azar.

""Se trata pues de aprovechar la tendencia filosófica que parecen presentar los niños de forma natural""

El niño filósofo (2018) es el primer libro de una trilogía compuesta también por El niño filósofo y el arte (2019) y El niño filósofo y la ética (2021). El proyecto queda propuesto en el primer volumen de la serie. Dicho libro que marcó la estructura de los siguientes se dividía en dos partes. En la primera el autor presentaba algunos de los conceptos fundamentales que asocia a su propia idea de una filosofía para niños inspirada en la de Matthew Lipman creador del programa Philosophy for children quien se inspiró a su vez en John Dewey; y en la segunda proponía doce actividades prácticas que involucran conceptos o actitudes filosóficas.

En esa primera parte el autor aclara que no concibe al “niño filósofo” como “una condición profesional” sino como “la posibilidad de que utilizando cualidades que son indispensables para crecer se estimule en los niños una nueva visión: la mirada filosófica.” (2018: 14) Se trata pues de aprovechar la tendencia filosófica que parecen presentar los niños de forma natural tal y como sugiere la siguiente cita de El mundo de Sofía de Jostein Gaarder que Jordi Nomen utiliza como epígrafe:

Para los niños el mundo —y todo lo que hay dentro suyo— es nuevo: es sorprendente. La mayor parte de los adultos ve el mundo como algo absolutamente normal. Los filósofos son en este sentido una notable excepción. Un filósofo no acaba nunca de acostumbrarse al mundo. Para él o ella el mundo sigue siendo un poco absurdo incluso un poco desconcertante y enigmático. De esta manera los niños y los filósofos comparten una facultad básica. El filósofo tiene una sensibilidad igual que la de un niño que le dura toda la vida.

Comento que existe toda una tradición que ve en el niño a un ser contemplativo. Tradición de probable origen romántico puesto que antes los niños apenas existían o apenas eran percibidos que decidió ver en el niño a un ser natural y libre que la realidad o la sociedad (a la que Lautréamont llamará “el gran objeto exterior”) se empeñaba en esclavizar. El niño aún libre del principio de realidad y poseedor de un ligero sentido del tiempo o del no tiempo semejante a esa eternidad que Borges parecía añorar pueden dedicarse a la contemplación metafísica que exige una desconexión de la mirada utilitaria. Entran ganas de decir que cada vez que decimos “venga niño no te eternices” se muere un filósofo.

""Así que un niño no necesita que le enseñen filosofía o poesía puesto que es filósofo o poeta de la forma más genuina posible. Por eso algunos afirmarán no sin acierto que el niño es el último buen salvaje""

Esa tradición filosófico-literaria que en algún lugar he dado en llamar “puerofilia” (porque el término “paidofilia” estaba lamentable ocupado) y que consiste en idealizar a los niños en tanto que seres más perfectos sabios y felices que los adultos será continuada por autores como Rubén Darío Jorge Luis Borges Julio Cortázar Alfredo Bryce Echenique y tantos otros. Las modulaciones son múltiples desde el brillante Ortodoxia de G. K. Chesterton hasta el terrible Claus y Lucas de Agota Kristof pasando por Madurar a hacia la infancia de Bruno Schulz Días de lectura de Proust Ferdydurke de Witold Gombrowicz o Criaturas del aire y La recuperación de la infancia de Fernando Savater.

Pensemos por ejemplo en un cuento como “Los venenos” de Julio Cortázar donde el narrador un niño de unos ocho años dice tras quedarse mirando un pájaro: “Yo de golpe me daba cuenta por qué se llamaba pavo real.” Y luego: “Me trepé al sauce a leer y a pensar.” ¿En qué? “Pensaba en muchas cosas pero sobre todo en las hormigas ahora que había visto lo que eran los hormigueros me quedaba pensando en las galerías que cruzaban por todos lados y que nadie veía… llenas de hormigas y misterios que iban y venían.”

No es extraño que para Rousseau no fuese necesario educar a los niños. Bastaba con seguir el precepto hipocrático del primum non nocere esto es “lo primero es no hacer daño”. Así que un niño no necesita que le enseñen filosofía o poesía puesto que es filósofo o poeta de la forma más genuina posible. Por eso algunos afirmarán no sin acierto que el niño es el último buen salvaje…

"" Algunos se verán tentados de decir que hoy se estropean antes como si en el pasado los niños que trabajaban en las minas o en el campo esto es casi todos fuesen unos pequeños geniecillos llenos de curiosidad y alegría""

Debo decir que el autor que hace gala de poseer grandes dosis del menos común de los sentidos no cae en ningún momento en este error. Cree con el Paulo Freire de La educación como práctica de la libertad que “el docente debe estar presente en su obligación de poner límites al alumno y a su vez reconocer la legitimidad de su rebeldía en los supuestos que la avalen. Por eso enseñar exige libertad y autoridad no libertinaje y autoritarismo.” (2021: 55) Y yo también.

¿No es cierto por otra parte que los niños se estropean o los estropeamos muy pronto? Algunos se verán tentados de decir que hoy se estropean antes como si en el pasado los niños que trabajaban en las minas o en el campo esto es casi todos fuesen unos pequeños geniecillos llenos de curiosidad y alegría. Sea como sea los niños hoy o siempre se estropean pronto y como decían los clásicos pessima corruptio optimis ‘la corrupción de lo mejor es lo peor’. Porque nada más triste que ver a un niño sin capacidad de admiración y asombro. Si no recuerdo mal Hesíodo decía en Los trabajos y los días que el mundo se acabará el día que los niños tengan cara de viejos. Huidobro expresará esa caída en Altazor uno de los mejores poemas que conozco leer en lengua española:

Altazor ¿por qué perdiste tu primera serenidad? ¿Qué ángel malo se paró en la puerta de tu sonrisa con la espada en la mano? ¿Quién sembró la angustia en las llanuras de tus ojos como el adorno de un dios?

He leído con mucho interés las reflexiones que el autor realiza en El niño filósofo acerca del proceso que lleva a los niños a perder su capacidad de admiración. El niño tiene la suerte o la desgracia de vivir sumido en una ignorancia casi absoluta acerca del mundo que le rodea maravillosa y amenazadoramente y por eso se hace preguntas. “Desgraciadamente cuando encuentre a su paso personas adultas que resten valor a su ignorancia irá recubriendo la curiosidad con una especie de velo de pretendida ‘sabiduría’ que impedirá progresivamente que se admire por todo y dejará de hacerlo como tributo al crecimiento que obliga a ‘preocuparse’ por problemas ‘serios’.” (34) Las prisas las preocupaciones normalmente económicas o laborales no nos permiten explorar las preguntas de los niños que ya están cegadas en nosotros de modo que lo que hacemos es devolverles “respuestas directas que cierran su campo de admiración” (2018: 33).

""Como padre apresurado de tres hijos a los que me gustaría introducir de forma progresiva e indolora en el culto a la filosofía siento que necesito una panoplia de respuestas o contra-preguntas realmente filosóficas a sus preguntas o intuiciones proto-filosóficas de los niños""

Los adultos no tienen tiempo de explorar sus ignorancias las han tapado porque son poco útiles porque son lentas. Para admirarnos debemos reaprender a recrearnos en nuestra propia ignorancia pero no hay tiempo por eso nuestras preguntas se limitan a enfrentarse a lo que Kuhn llamaría problemas “normales” y nunca “revolucionarios”. Decía Ortega y Gasset: “las ideas se tienen en las creencias se está”. El adulto corre sobre sus creencias a toda velocidad rezando por que no le alcance el geiser de lo inesperado. Como decía Quino lo urgente nos impide lo importante. En los adultos se produce una reducción progresiva del campo de atención de la sensación de potencia de la ligereza de lo que Nietzsche llamaba “inocencia del devenir” todo lo cual va generando una impotencia estructural que se confunde con la tristeza.

Los niños no cejan de hacer “preguntas de lógica epistemología metafísica o ética que a menudo nos obligan a buscar todos nuestros recursos filosóficos si queremos darles una respuesta bastante elaborada más allá del simple ‘ya lo entenderás más adelante’.” (2018: 43) Por eso es importante pensar bien lo que le respondemos a los niños. Las suyas son preguntas “que nos desconciertan (porque hemos olvidado que nosotros también las hacíamos) y provocan un cierto reajuste mental en nosotros los adultos que vivimos a su alrededor. No sabemos por dónde cogerlas.” (43) Pero en este punto el autor se resigna a decir que: “Quizás podemos devolverles las preguntas que nos hacen: ‘¿Y tú por qué crees que es? ¿Por qué piensas que pasa?’” (44) Para cerrar a continuación con un diálogo de Alicia en el País de las Maravillas de Lewis Carroll que consiste en una serie de juegos y perplejidades más poéticas que filosóficas.

""Literatura para niños no es literatura mala. Es literatura buena que puede ser comprendida por los niños""

Como padre apresurado de tres hijos a los que me gustaría introducir de forma progresiva e indolora en el culto a la filosofía siento que necesito una panoplia de respuestas o contra-preguntas realmente filosóficas a las preguntas o intuiciones proto-filosóficas de los niños. Una especie de tropos de Enesidemo o Agripa una especie de tetraphármako epicúreo una especie de adagios erasmistas que pueda tener siempre a mano procheiron para suplir mi falta de tiempo ingenio o imaginación.

Esas respuestas además deberían tener una fuerza persuasiva esto es retórica o literaria para lo cual sería necesario recurrir a la buena literatura. Debo decir que el libro incluye páginas muy potentes como aquella en la que el autor reflexiona acerca de los diferentes tipos de belleza y que no puedo evitar transcribir:

“Siento que la admiración de la belleza es la mejor forma de alabar la vida y su diversidad pero no entiendo la belleza como la adecuación a un canon de proporción y armonía. Esto sería menospreciar la belleza de lo caótico de lo irregular y de lo incompleto. Existe la belleza de la rudeza y la de la finura la belleza de lo sereno y de la furia. Hay belleza escondida acurrucada en el fondo de las arrugas de las personas mayores y belleza en los michelines de los pequeños. Hay belleza en lo extraordinario y belleza en lo cotidiano. Hay belleza en la decadencia; tanta como en la juventud. Bello es lo que nos conmueve sea cual sea la textura de la piel que lo recubre. Lo contrario de la belleza no es la fealdad sino la crueldad que desprecia lo que no aprueba. Hay belleza en la sonrisa carcomida del mundo porque la belleza intuyo no depende de lo admirado sino de la calidad de la mirada que lo percibe o el sentido admirativo que se recrea y de la pureza del corazón que lo siente. La belleza está en los ojos que miran en los oídos que escuchan allí donde no llegan los sentidos allí donde vive la admiración. Por ello hay que proponer el arte como recurso filosófico con los niños.” (2018: 62)

Sin embargo creo que el autor se equivoca cuando recurre a textos de Paulo Coelho o fábulas alegóricas que rozan peligrosamente la autoayuda. Literatura para niños no es literatura mala. Es literatura buena que puede ser comprendida por los niños. A eso se refería C. S. Lewis cuando decía que “la literatura infantil” es aquella literatura que también podían leer los niños. Se trata ciertamente de un trabajo difícil del que yo no sé si saldría victorioso. Pero creo que hay páginas de Cortázar de Stevenson de Chesterton de Paul Éluard de Nicanor Parra de Robert Desnos de Gloria Fuertes de Michael Ende o de Jacques Prévert que podrían haberse incluido. “Los poetas de siete años” de Arthur Rimbaud por ejemplo. No creo que pueda escribirse una literatura ad hoc para enseñarle filosofía a los niños. No he leído El descubrimiento de Harry Stottlemeyer (1971) de Matthew Lipman pero me parece significativo que cincuenta años después de su publicación no sea una obra demasiado conocida ni siquiera entre los especialistas. Me la imagino alegórica maniquea e infantiloide. Ojalá me equivoque.

""Podríamos llegar a decir que la filosofía es hoy profundamente anticapitalista y en todas las épocas antiutilitaria. Por esa razón el capitalismo ha pretendido capturarla mediante la literatura de autoayuda""

Otro punto fundamental de los libros de Jordi Nomen es el antiutilitarismo. El autor se muestra consciente de que nuestro modo de vida turbocapitalista impide toda concentración filosófica: “La reflexión requiere soledad en algunos momentos una buena gestión del silencio el goce y la administración estéticos el cuidado del cuerpo la práctica del diálogo la contemplación y la meditación la gratuidad y la solidaridad… dificultades que encuentra este tiempo de reflexión para prosperar en un mundo que siente horror ante el silencio la soledad y la lentitud a las que opone de forma casi imperativa el ruido el gentío y la prisa con un ‘activismo’ que deja poco margen para disfrutar con detenimiento de la actividad.” (67) Este punto me parece especialmente importante pues abre toda una vía de repolitización de la filosofía. Una condición necesaria aunque no suficiente para la actividad filosófica sería la reducción de las diferencias socioeconómicas y una cierta emancipación temporal mediante leyes efectivas de conciliación laboral y una nueva cultura de la gratuidad. Podríamos llegar a decir que la filosofía es hoy profundamente anticapitalista y en todas las épocas antiutilitaria. Por esa razón el capitalismo ha pretendido capturarla mediante la literatura de autoayuda o eliminarla haciéndola desaparecer de los planes de estudios.

El autor también le da mucha importancia a la perspectiva lúdica en la enseñanza de la filosofía. Se inspira en el Homo ludens de Johan Huizinga que fue libro de cabecera de Julio Cortázar para afirmar que: “el juego se configura como una herramienta de primer orden para aprender roles diferentes para entender que nuestra propia identidad es una construcción permanente”. (2018: 46) Según Huizinga las tres funciones esenciales del juego son la libertad el aislamiento y la reglamentación diferente “que nos permitirían huir de las normas cotidianas e implicarían concentración y alegría”; todo lo cual lleva a Nomen a afirmar que el juego es también “un camino hacia la reflexión filosófica” (58).

""En otras ocasiones me parece que el estilo de Nomen se acerca peligrosamente a la autoayuda. Antes de nada quiero decir que este es un problema general con el que todos aquellos que devolverle a la filosofía un sentido práctico nos encontramos""

Coincido con el autor en la importancia al componente lúdico pero no puedo evitar sentir cierta por no decir mucha desconfianza cuando oigo hablar de gamificación que me suena a pantallita y a saltar en pelotas para hacer pilates. Entiendo lo que el autor propone y entiendo también que lo dice de buena fe. Pero ¿no sería mejor pensar con Cortázar Chesterton Diderot o Voltaire que no paran de jugar que con dos o tres pedagogos cuyos escritos además de trascendentalmente aburridos suenan sospechosamente armónicos con el neoliberalismo? A nadie se le escapa que la estética lúdica y festiva a lo Historias de Cronopios y de Famas de Julio Cortázar ha sido reciclada por empresas como ING-direct Yoigo o las grandes tecnológicas de Silicon Valley. Resulta más que significativo que el célebre “Preámbulo a las instrucciones para dar cuerda a un reloj” de Cortázar en el que se denuncia de qué modo los objetos nos poseen fuese utilizado para el anuncio de una conocida marca de coches de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme. Dice Zygmunt Bauman en Modernidad líquida que el sueño de los movimientos progresistas de los años sesenta que veían el estado la burocracia la rutina y el trabajo de por vida como obstáculos para una vida libre y creadora ha desembocado en nuestra época en la pesadilla de la desregularización la temporalidad y la precariedad del trabajo y las relaciones humanas. Creo que algo semejante es lo que está ocurriendo con la famosa gamificación. Resulta pues necesario arrancar el espíritu lúdico de las garras de esos pedagogos que consciente o inconscientemente están adaptando la educación a lo que Fredric Jameson dio en llamar “lógica del capitalismo tardío”.

Tampoco creo que necesitemos recurrir a una teoría seudocientífica como es la de las inteligencias múltiples de Gardner quien propuso siete tipos de inteligencias (lingüística lógico-matemática musical cinética-espacial interpersonal e intrapersonal) a las cuales añadirá igual que los astrónomos medievales añadían nuevas esferas para explicar el movimiento errático de los planetas una octava inteligencia natural (que gestionaría la relación entre los humanos y el ecosistema) y una novena inteligencia existencial que sería la que por fin parece tener algo que ver con la filosofía. Creo que Jordi Nomen podría haber prescindido perfectamente de esta nueva teoría de los humores para recurrir a otros marcos teóricos más consistentes. Como no soy un especialista en este tema no me atrevo más que a recomendar a aquellos autores en cuyo criterio me he acostumbrado a confiar como son Marina Garcés Andreu Navarra Gregorio Luri Catherine L’Écuyer o Pascual Gil Gutiérrez. ¿Y por qué no recurrir también la Paideia de Jaegger De la utilidad de los coloquios de Erasmo “De la educación de los niños” de Montaigne o el Antimanual de filosofía de Onfray?

""Hay autores como Marina Garcés que buscan escapar de esos peligros mediante la politización del discurso. Otros prefieren adscribirse a corrientes filosóficas no oficiales como Michel Onfray""

En otras ocasiones me parece que el estilo de Nomen se acerca peligrosamente a la autoayuda. Antes de nada quiero decir que este es un problema general con el que todos aquellos que devolverle a la filosofía un sentido práctico nos encontramos. Yo también. Lo cierto es que tras ser secuestrada por la religión cristiana (véase La edad de la penumbra de Catherine Nixey) la filosofía perdió sus competencias prácticas (véase La filosofía como forma de vida en la Antigüedad de Pierre Hadot) y aunque trató de recuperarlas en el Renacimiento (con Erasmo y Montaigne a la cabeza) volvió a caer en el teoricismo salvo algunas excepciones (como Nietzsche Bergson Alain Hadot o el último Foucault) de modo que cuando se secularizaron parcialmente nuestras sociedades la reflexión sobre los modos existenciales se transformó en una especie de tierra de nadie que se disputan hasta hoy la religión la autoayuda la psicología la propaganda y un poco también la filosofía.

No es fácil en este contexto hallar unas formas de expresión propiamente filosóficas que no suenen a religión o a autoayuda. Se trata de un problema colectivo al que nos enfrentamos entre todos. Un problema léxico estilístico en fin literario. Hay autores como Marina Garcés que buscan escapar de esos peligros mediante la politización del discurso. Otros prefieren adscribirse a corrientes filosóficas no oficiales como Michel Onfray. Otros utilizan como cortafuegos la erudición clásica. Y otros prefieren los tecnicismos la abstracción o el humor. Cada una de esas propuestas tiene sus virtudes y defectos. Y lo mismo sucede con la interesante propuesta de Jordi Nomen que tiene frases páginas y expresiones que son utilísimas en este aspecto a la vez que ha explorado otras vías que creo que sería mejor abandonar. Pienso por ejemplo en las páginas en las que el autor trata de reapropiarse del término “triunfo”. Coincido totalmente con el contenido y la intención del autor pero no me convence la forma. Sigue sonándome a autoayuda. Como diría el marqués de Sade: “¡Un último esfuerzo republicanos!”.

""Los tres libros de Jordi Nomen presentan una segunda parte en la que se resumen conceptos importantes de la filosofía que se acompañan con propuestas de lectura preguntas para el debate e incluso juegos o películas relacionados con el tema en cuestión""

Personalmente las partes que más he disfrutado de los libros de Nomen son aquellas en las que el autor habla con su propia voz. Liberado de Lipman de Gardner de Rossem y de todas esas listas de inteligencias competencias y objetivos que me hacen pensar con horror en planes docentes unidades didácticas y autoinformes Nomen realiza interesantísimas reflexiones sobre los tipos de belleza (2018: 62) la capacidad de la filosofía para ampliar el mundo de las preguntas a aquellas zonas a las que no llega la ciencia (67) las diferentes formas de aprender (69) la paz como autoviolencia (2018: 73) o la voz de los otros que hay en nosotros (78).

Pienso también en el fragmento en el que se niega a reducir la filosofía a una mera actividad contemplativa:

“Al niño filósofo que defiendo en este escrito no lo imagino inmóvil y místico sentado en una roca junto al mar contemplando el universo —aunque no hay nada de malo en ello—: lo imagino como persona luchadora y rebelde que reflexiona para saber qué debe escoger pero se apasiona por cambiar lo que considera injusto y se presta a equivocarse para aprender a acertar. Como una persona crítica y creativa cuidadosa e implicada en su realidad. (…) Este niño filósofo debe creer que el mundo puede mejorar que tiene posibilidades reales de cambiarlo.” (2018: 80)

Como decíamos los tres libros de Jordi Nomen presentan una segunda parte en la que se resumen conceptos importantes de la filosofía que se acompañan con propuestas de lectura preguntas para el debate e incluso juegos o películas relacionados con el tema en cuestión. Es lo que Erasmo llamó en su Paráfrasis del Nuevo Testamento (1516) “elaboración del pan evangélico”. A pesar de mi alergia autoculpable hacia las unidades didácticas son propuestas muy interesantes que estoy seguro que voy a volver a consultar. En El niño filósofo (2018) por ejemplo habla del “mito del carro alado” que aparece en el Fedro de Platón (96-102); de la noción de bien en Aristóteles (103-110); del concepto epicúreo de placer (111-118); del memento mori estoico en Séneca (119-126); de la noción de alegría en Spinoza (127-134); de la noción de amistad en Montaigne (135-144); de la idea de perfectibilidad del ser humano y educación en Rousseau (145- 151); de la noción de deber en Kant (152-158); de la idea de poesía y creatividad en Nietzsche (159-165); de la depuración lingüística y el aprendizaje del silencio en Wittgenstein (166-174); de las reflexión sobre el mal y la banalidad del mal en Hannah Arendt (175-185); y del binomio tener o ser en Erich Fromm (186-194).

II.-

Paso a continuación a ocuparme brevemente de El niño filósofo y la ética (2021). El libro empieza con una reflexión acerca de la importancia del ejemplo en la enseñanza: “Los valores no se aprenden en abstracto como un contenido teórico más. Por su doble esencia cognitiva y afectiva los valores se aprenden sobre todo con el ejemplo. Por eso la familia y la escuela fuentes de los primeros valores deben ser espacios de ejemplo y práctica de los valores que se defienden como principios de conducto. Quien no es paciente jamás favorecerá que otro lo sea. Los valores no se enseñan se muestran se transmiten en un ambiente que los concreta y los hace aterrizar desde las alturas.” (2021: 16) Como dicen en Captain Fantastic: “Nos definen nuestras acciones no nuestras palabras.”

""Me interesa por ejemplo el debate que Nomen establece con Lawrence Kohlberg discípulo de Jean Piaget quien distinguió tres fases en el desarrollo ético de los niños: fase preconvencional convencional y posconvencional""

Igual que me pasó con el libro anterior he disfrutado más de aquellas páginas en las que el autor aventura sus propias ideas. Considero por ejemplo innecesario que recurra nuevamente a Matthew Lipman para definir lo que éste dio en llamar “pensamiento cuidadoso”. Según el resumen de Nomen el pensamiento cuidadoso “es ‘apreciativo’ porque valora (añade el aprecio a lo que se estima); es ‘activo’ porque se moviliza para conservar lo que aprecia; es ‘normativo’ porque intenta traducir el ideal que lo mueve en pautas; es ‘afectivo’ porque enjuicia lo que sentimos y es ‘empático’ porque basa la comprensión en el intento de ponerse en el lugar del otro” (2021: 15). La verdad es que al leer este tipo de consideraciones que me suenan más a escolástica pedagógica que a verdadera filosofía no puedo evitar recordar a Erasmo quien dijo en su Banquete religioso que “Más lamentaría faltarme un libro de Cicerón o Plutarco que todo cuanto escribieron Escoto y sus pares no porque los condene sin remisión sino porque siento que con la lectura de los unos me vuelvo mejor en tanto los otros me dejan más frío para la auténtica virtud y más querencioso para las disputas”. Y no lo digo por Jordi Nomen sino por Matthew Lipman.

Me interesa por ejemplo el debate que Nomen establece con Lawrence Kohlberg discípulo de Jean Piaget quien distinguió tres fases en el desarrollo ético de los niños: fase preconvencional convencional y posconvencional. Para Nomen esta división implicaría que “habría que esperar a ser casi adultos para adentrarse en el pensamiento cuidadoso” lo cual sólo puede ser “fruto del prejuicio de que los niños no son capaces de pensar por sí mismos” lo cual puede llevarnos a subestimar como hicieron Kohlberg y Piaget “el papel de la educación y en particular de la filosofía para desarrollar el pensamiento cuidadoso a edades tempranas.” (2021: 19-21)

Son también interesantes sus reflexiones acerca de “la pereza intelectual” que Kant entronizó junto al miedo como uno de los dos enemigos de la ilustración (30); su rechazo del mal uso de las nuevas tecnologías (34); sus consideraciones acerca de lo que aporta el diálogo filosófico a la construcción de la ciudadanía (36-39) y sobre los modos en que debería practicarse (40-43). Pienso también en Oscar Brenifier o en Tomi Ungerer.

""También es interesante el capítulo que le dedica a la pedagogía de la paz que se niega a definir como ausencia de conflicto o ausencia de violencia""

También he subrayado con profusión las páginas que le dedica a la dimensión social de la educación. Coincido con el autor cuando dice siguiendo a Robert Castel que la pobreza es “un fracaso de la sociedad que lo permite y no lo señala como una prioridad. La vivienda la salud la educación el acceso a servicios básicos como el agua y la electricidad deberían ser nuestras prioridades políticas. No podemos establecer una sociedad que admita la existencia de ciudadanos de segunda o tercera categoría sin perder en esa segregación el sentido de la democracia que decimos defender. Del mismo modo no podemos culpar a los propios excluidos de su exclusión. Sería un ejercicio de cinismo inadmisible que no tiene en cuenta las causas que han llevado a dicha exclusión algunas derivadas de una contingencia inevitable y otras fomentadas por la desigualdad de oportunidades.” (2021: 49)

También me han interesado las páginas que le dedica a la “pedagogía de la ternura” término que toma de A. Cussiánovich y C. Schmalenbach. Frente a la cultura del triunfo y la competitividad que “genera un individuo asocial que desconoce el bien común y se rige por intereses individuales que priman y dirigen sus acciones sin ninguna empatía” Nomen propone esa pedagogía de la ternura que “implica sensibilización ante lo frágil y a la vez respuesta cordial cálida agradable (…) La ternura se alza frente a los prejuicios y estereotipos frente a la insensibilidad que a menudo acompaña a las prisas y el estrés que padecemos frente al qué dirán frente al autoritarismo.” (53) No ternura como debilidad o ingenuidad no ternura sólo en la esfera íntima y familiar: “La ternura es una línea de defensa ante la violencia cotidiana el contrapunto a la agresividad que reina en la esfera social. (…) La tarea fundamental de la escuela y el hogar es favorecer la razón y la emoción a la vez.” (54)

""Me recuerda también la interesante distinción que hace Marina Garcés entre los antagonismos que son necesarios en toda sociedad a menos que nos dejemos tentar por las fantasías de una comunidad ideal plenamente reconciliada y las hostilidades que son radicalmente violentas""

También es interesante el capítulo que le dedica a la pedagogía de la paz que se niega a definir como ausencia de conflicto o ausencia de violencia puesto que “ambas definiciones pecan de lo mismo la definen por lo que no es. Y eso es así porque la paz tanto si se entiende en la esfera personal como en la colectiva resulta difícil de describir. La ausencia de conflicto es una entelequia pues el ser humano diverso siempre está en conflicto. En ese sentido la paz consiste mucho más en la gestión efectiva del conflicto mediante la negociación y el compromiso que en su ausencia.” (60) La paz sería violencia contra uno mismo. Ilustra el oxímoron con un artículo de Santiago Gamboa en el que se cita a un delegado de Palestina ante la Unesco quien habría dicho en cierta ocasión: “Es más fácil hacer la guerra que la paz porque al hacer la guerra uno ejerce la violencia contra el enemigo mientras que al construir la paz uno debe ejercerla contra sí mismo”.

Lo cual me recuerda también la interesante distinción que hace Marina Garcés entre los antagonismos que son necesarios en toda sociedad a menos que nos dejemos tentar por las fantasías de una comunidad ideal plenamente reconciliada y las hostilidades que son radicalmente violentas. Según Nomen “la paz es el resultado de la negociación y el acuerdo en los conflictos no la ausencia de estos. Suele dejar en los interlocutores un cierto malestar porque nunca se alcanza en plenitud. La pedagogía de la paz debe afrontar y aceptar como inevitable ese algo de malestar.” (2021: 61)

La segunda parte de El niño filósofo y la ética nos ofrece una serie de reflexiones y ejercicios que buscan familiarizar al niño con once conceptos éticos fundamentales: el concepto de armonía en Confucio (94-102) la humildad y el concepto de tao en Lao-Tse (102-114) el concepto de verdad en Sócrates (114-126) la libertad y la dignidad humanas en Pico della Mirandola (126-135) la noción de motivación humana en Tolstói (135-144) la idea de feminidad en Mary Wollstonecraft (144-155) la compasión en Martha Nussbaum (155-166) la doctrina de la no violencia en Mahatma Gandhi (166-179) la lucha contra el racismo en Martin Luther King (179-187) el perdón y la filosofía africana ubuntu en Nelson Mandela y Desmond Tutu (187-197) y la idea de deshumanización en Eduardo Galeano (197-206). Los resúmenes preguntas propuestas de lectura y visionado de películas resultan muy útiles y debo confesar que ya he echado mano de varios de ellos para tratar algunos de estos temas con mis hijos. No imagino una razón mejor para recomendar la lectura de este libro.

New GPS III Follow-on satellites — or GPS IIIF for short — will continue to improve the constellation’s accuracy and protection against jamming.

GPS III satellites are already a substantial upgrade to the current constellation providing three times greater accuracy and eight times better anti-jamming capability than their predecessors. In addition to introducing a new civil signal that is compatible with other navigation satellite systems the five GPS III satellites on orbit completed the space component of M-code — an even more secure and accurate signal for military use.

The Space Force has launched five of the planned GPS III satellites and three more have been declared “available for launch” but are waiting in storage with prime contractor Lockheed Martin. The remaining two are undergoing testing.

The Space Force has a contract with Lockheed for up to 22 GPS IIIF satellites. The service already exercised contract options for seven GPS IIIF satellites with the most recent award taking place in October 2021 when Space Systems Command issued $737 million to the company for three more satellites.

GPS IIIF satellites will be more advanced than their predecessors. Most notably the new space systems will prove a new Regional Military Protection capability a steerable M-code signal that can concentrate the effect in a specified region. RMP can provide up to 60 times greater anti-jamming measures helping ensure soldiers can access critical position navigation and timing data in contested environments.

Other new features include a laser retroreflector array to increase accuracy; an upgraded nuclear detection detonation system payload; and a search and rescue payload.

Starting with the third GPS IIIF space vehicle the satellites will be built with Lockheed’s LM2100 Combat Bus specifically designed for military use. The company claims its new bus which will also be used for the Space Force’s next missile warning satellites will have greater resiliency and cyber protections more power and better propulsion.

And thanks to a new port option on the LM2100 bus it could be possible to upgrade GPS IIIF satellites on orbit. The company’s Augmentation System Port Interface essentially works as a USB port for the satellite allowing the Space Force to launch new payloads into space that can be plugged into the system.

This modernization for the Egyptian Air Force includes Lockheed Martin’s Gen III Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor (Gen III TADS/PNVS) and the Gen III Day Sensor Assembly (Gen III DSA).

The award is part of an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (ID/IQ) contract signed with the U.S. Army. The ID/IQ serves as the contracting vehicle to provide Gen III DSA and Gen III TADS/PNVS systems and services.

Under the order Lockheed Martin is delivering the upgraded sensor kits as part of a remanufacture effort to upgrade D-model Apaches to E-models.

“Lockheed Martin is committed to a strong and sustained partnership with our customers in the United States and around the world” said Tom Eldredge Director of Lockheed Martin’s Missiles and Fire Control Rotary Wing Sensors program. “This contract enables us to respond rapidly to Egypt’s emerging defense needs including requirements for new sensor systems and upgrades.”

The work will be performed at the Boeing Apache Helicopter Plant in Mesa Arizona with an estimated completion date of July 2024.

Gen III TADS/PNVS known as the “eyes of the Apache” provides pilots with long-range precision engagement and pilotage capabilities for safe flight during day night and adverse weather missions. Gen III DSA increases Gen III TADS/PNVS designation and ranging capabilities to fully accommodate current weapons and those planned for the future.

The upgraded sensor enables Apache pilots to see high-resolution high-definition near-infrared and color imagery on cockpit displays. Gen III DSA also provides a new laser pointer marker that improves coordination with ground troops and an updated multi-mode laser with eye-safe range designation that supports flight in urban environments and critical training exercises.

Every year seems to be historic for the space industry but the last few have been exceptionally so.

In May 2020 astronauts launched from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade. Since then billionaires have taken sub-orbital joyrides a crew of non-professional astronauts spent three days in space and the long-awaited James Webb Space Telescope began its journey to explore the origins of the universe.

This year promises to be just as exciting thanks to launches of new mega rockets the first step to returning humans to the moon and a look at a rocket that might someday carry astronauts to Mars.

Here are some space highlights to look forward this year.

Artemis I

After more than a decade in development NASA's upcoming Space Launch System rocket is finally slated to launch this year. Most of its timeline remains foggy as teams first need to roll the massive 322-foot rocket to Kennedy Space Center's pad 39B then perform a fully integrated fueling test known as a ""wet dress rehearsal.""

The test is currently scheduled for no earlier than February as teams work to replace engine controller hardware in the Vehicle Assembly Building so expect the uncrewed test flight no earlier than March or April. The rocket will take an Orion capsule to lunar orbit an Apollo 8-like precursor to eventually putting astronauts on board and doing the same for Artemis II.

SLS' core stage is built by Boeing while the Orion spacecraft is manufactured by Lockheed Martin. The Artemis program aims to put two NASA astronauts on the lunar surface no earlier than 2025.

SpaceX crewed missions

SpaceX meanwhile is set to continue its pace of launching Crew Dragon capsules to Earth orbit complete with crews destined for the International Space Station.

Now set for no earlier than late February the company will host Ax-1 a mission purchased by space tourism and infrastructure company Axiom. A former NASA astronaut and three others who purchased tickets will stay on the ISS for just under two weeks. Axiom eventually plans on building its own space station.

SpaceX will also continue delivering NASA astronauts to the ISS as part of the Commercial Crew Program. Crew-4 will fly from KSC's pad 39A no earlier than April 15. Crew-5 meanwhile is slated to launch no earlier than the fall of 2022.

Falcon Heavy

SpaceX's three-core Falcon Heavy rocket should make another Space Coast appearance this year.

Currently set for the first quarter the rocket will fly from KSC's pad 39A before performing an aerial ballet of booster separations followed by dual touchdowns on drone ships stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. It won't include the same ""wow factor"" as boosters touching down at Cape Canaveral but separation should be visible from the ground if skies are clear enough. The center core will be expended into the Atlantic.

Recently:At KSC Visitor Complex SpaceX Falcon booster exhibit is ready to wow guests

This will mark the fourth Falcon Heavy flight to date. Secured in its payload fairing will be USSF-44 which will deploy two Space Force payloads to geosynchronous orbit some 22300 miles above Earth.

Falcon Heavy made its high-profile debut nearly three years ago in February 2018.

Starship orbital flight

Though not launching from Florida the first orbital flight of SpaceX's next-generation Starship will be one not to miss – especially since the massive rocket will fly from Kennedy Space Center in the coming years.

Elon Musk late last year was pushing for this orbital test which would begin at SpaceX's pad on the southern tip of Texas near Brownsville to kick off by the middle of 2022. Previous tests have seen the rocket's upper stage also known as Starship itself lift off turn around then return to the pad for a vertical landing.

The orbital flight test will include the Super Heavy booster and take Starship to a much higher – and more challenging – orbital altitude after which it will return to the pad.

Musk sees Starship as the vehicle that will take his company to the moon Mars and beyond as well as help build the company's Starlink satellite internet constellation. The vehicle has also been tasked with taking NASA astronauts to the lunar surface after they arrive in orbit via the agency's Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System.

Starliner

Teams at Boeing are also set for a redo of December 2019's Starliner capsule Orbital Flight Test which failed to reach the International Space Station due to technical issues but did cut its mission short and touched down in New Mexico.

A second attempt at launching last year didn't make it off the pad due to a series of stuck valves on Starliner's service module which teams have since resolved by swapping out hardware. If schedules hold the second attempt should fly in the first half of this year.

The uncrewed test mission is designed to demonstrate Starliner's systems before flying astronauts to the ISS as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. SpaceX was the only other company selected to transport astronauts which it started doing in 2020.

If all goes according to plan Orbital Flight Test-2 should happen before the middle of the year. United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket is tasked with Starliner launches.

Newcomers: Blue Origin Relativity ULA

Aside from SLS at least three newcomers are slated to join the Eastern Range's lineup of launch vehicles.

Blue Origin's massive 313-foot New Glenn rocket built just outside the gates of Kennedy Space Center is set to fly in the fourth quarter of this year if everything goes according to plan. Teams late last year delivered a mockup of the rocket to Launch Complex 36 for checkouts.

Relativity Space the California-based company using 3D printing technologies to produce rockets and engines is also planning to launch its Terran vehicle from Cape Canaveral before the end of the year. It will stand about 115 feet tall and is designed to boost smaller payloads to orbit. More on a specific timeline should be available after teams ""print"" the rocket in California then ship it via truck to the Cape.

Finally ULA has already performed a series of tests at Launch Complex 41 and is more or less ready for its next vehicle: Vulcan Centaur. The main thing standing in the way is the delivery of its BE-4 engines which are purchased from Blue Origin and built in Huntsville Alabama. Vulcan will ultimately replace ULA's Atlas and Delta family of rockets and should see its first flight before the end of the year.

In a post on Instagram the team has shown its design concept. As with the original lunar rover the new “Lunar Terrain Vehicle” doesn’t exactly look luxurious but would appear to be well suited to the low-gravity high-intensity conditions.

“We chose to go to the moon… again!” the automaker wrote in the post. “This is our Industrial Design team’s vision for the next chapter of @GM’s lunar legacy together with our partners #GMDefense and @LockheedMartin.”

With folding seats and four wheels the LTV looks a bit like a cabover truck with no bodywork. In several shots it doesn’t have a driver either. In fact there doesn’t really seem to be a steering wheel though there may be some controls on a central console. That’s because as previously announced the vehicle will be autonomous. That will allow it to prepare the surface of the Moon for human landings provide payload transportation and expand the range and utility of science experiments conducted in space.

“Surface mobility is critical to enable and sustain long-term exploration of the lunar surface” said Rick Ambrose executive VP of Lockheed Space GM’s partner. “These next-generation rovers will dramatically extend the range of astronauts as they perform high-priority science investigation on the Moon that will ultimately impact humanity’s understanding of our place in the solar system.”

Used as part of NASA’s Artemis program the LTVs will help astronauts get back to the Moon.

TIGER King is a Netflix show that first hit screens in 2020 chronicling the lives of exotic animal owners.

In December of 2021 cast member Jeff Lowe was permanently banned from exhibiting animals.

Who is Jeff Lowe on Tiger King?

Jeff first met the man behind Tiger King - Joe Exotic - in 2015 when he was introduced as an investor for Joe who was financially struggling due to his ongoing legal battle with Carole Baskin.

Not much has been publicly said about Jeff's background. In in the series he reveals how he grew up around big cats because his grandfather was a circus owner. Jeff had his first cat by the age of 15 and went on to own mountain lions and tigers. He went on to have a baby with his wife Lauren and they have employed nanny Masha Diduk to look after their daughter. On December 23 2021 the US District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma terminated the Lowe's interest in the endangered animals seized from their facility. The court also granted the motion for a default judgement against Tiger King LLC and Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park LLC prohibiting them from exhibiting animals in the future. 2 Jeff Lowe has been prohibited from exhibiting animals Credit: Netflix

Did Jeff Lowe take over Joe Exotic's zoo? The Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park started off as a shelter for endangered and exotic animals and faced legal issues from Baskin's company Big Cat Rescue. In 2016 Joe Exotic transferred ownership of his big cat zoo over to Jeff. Lowe rapidly increased the size of the animal park adding different animals in addition to the exotic cats. In 2019 he announced his plans to open up a new park in Oklahoma. Following a brief closure due to Covid-19 in 2020 Wynnewood was renamed Tiger King Park and reopened in May of same year.

Ownership of the park was granted to Baskin following a ruling from federal judge Scott Palk ordering Lowe to vacate the park and remove all animals.

According to a police report obtained by TMZ ... back in July security at the Wynn hotel in Vegas watched surveillance footage showing a woman pilfering a candelabra from a private dining room in a club on the property. Moments later she was seen leaving the casino wearing it on her forearm like an accessory.

But what happened in Vegas that night didn't stay under wraps. Security was able to get the name on the ticket the suspect used to valet her car as well as the license plate. And after some social media digging they were able to match Masha's posts to the suspect in the security footage.

Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.

She even posted at the club around the time of the incident on IG ... posing with one of their signature drinks.

She was later detained by Wynn security and arrested for grand larceny.

As you may recall Masha raised eyebrows over her work ethic when she became a part-time nanny for 'Tiger Kings' former cohorts Jeff Lowe and his wife Lauren. She apparently met Jeff and his wife in Vegas a while back where she had been living and working as a model."

Universal’s The Fall Guy the Ryan Gosling starrer inspired by the 1980s TV show kicked off the summer movie season at No. 1 with $28.5 million while Disney’s re-release of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace surprised by coming in at No. 2 with $8.1 million.

Despite The Fall Guy’s No. 1 finish its haul came in behind initial expectations of $30 million to $35 million and overall the box office is down dramatically from the same frame a year ago when Marvel Studios’ Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 bowed to $118.4 million domestically. The weekend is down 53 percent from last year and off more than 66 percent from 2022 when Marvel’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness opened to $187.4 million domestically.

The Fall Guy is said to have a net budget of $130 million after tax incentives for shooting in Australia. Universal will now hope that Fall Guy’s A- CinemaScore from audiences will help it make up ground in the coming weeks with word of mouth. It also boasts strong reviews out of South by Southwest.

The feature hails from stuntman-turned director David Leitch and has been marketed as a love letter to the stunt community. Gosling at the height of his star power thanks to his Oscar-nominated turn as Ken in Barbie fronts the picture as a beaten down stuntman who comes out of retirement to try to find a missing A-list star and save a film (which happens to be directed by his ex played by Emily Blunt). The feature has a global cume of $65.4 globally.

Phantom Menace‘s weekend is a nice turn of events for the film. It kicked off George Lucas’ Star Wars prequel trilogy in 1999 and for years after was a punchline for audiences and Star Wars fans but has grown in appreciation in the decades since with younger fans who grew up on the film coming into adulthood and star Ewan McGregor reprising his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi for his own Disney+ series in 2022 helping further build nostalgia for the film. It returned to theaters as part of the film’s 25th anniversary as well as for May the 4th the unofficial Star Wars holiday.

The Phantom Menace edged out Amazon MGM Studios’ sexy tennis drama Challengers for No. 2. The Luca Guadagnino feature had a solid hold in weekend two dropping just 49 percent for a weekend gross of $7.6 million and a cume of $29.4 million. Zendaya Josh O’Connor and Mike Faist star.

Sony and Screen Gem’s Tarot bowed in its first weekend to $6.5 million a solid start considering the feature cost $8 million and did not have a traditional marketing campaign. Sony embarked on its first digital-only campaign for Tarot meaning no TV spots or billboards for the feature which seven friends who accidentally unleash an evil entity trapped in a deck of cursed Tarot cards. Neither critics nor audiences embraced this one. It has an 8 percent on Rotten Tomatoes while audiences gave it a low C- CinemaScore. It ends the weekend with a global haul of $10.2 million to date.

For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

In the majority of cases this involves utilizing a third-party payment processor such as PayPal Mastercard or Visa. According to the Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance pirates exploit these trusted brands to appear legitimate themselves. But what can be done to break the association?

In the summer of 2018 a report from anti-piracy company Irdeto examined the payment processing abilities of 400 pirate IPTV supplier sites. It found that the majority (76%) openly advertised their payment options with Visa Mastercard and PayPal leading the way.

The strong message from Irdeto was that such payment processors should be supporting legitimate media organizations by conducting better due diligence and stopping support for pirate streaming services.

“If media organizations threaten to vote with their feet against payment platforms that enable piracy it’ll be fascinating to see who blinks first” the report said.

At the time we wondered whether this type of threat was the best way to achieve change. Now more than two years later the tone appears to have softened somewhat while still carrying a serious message.

Pirates Expolit Payment Processor Branding

While sporting a lower public profile than the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment there can be no doubt that the Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance is a force to be reckoned with. The anti-piracy group currently has 30 members including tech companies Irdeto and Nagra plus content owners and broadcasters such as BT BeiN Sports DAZN LaLiga Premier League and Sky.

This week the group again raised the issue of payment processor support for pirate IPTV providers but framed things a little differently. According to AAPA among other things the inclusion of payment processor logos on payment portals gives them an air of legitimacy while damaging the processors’ brands.

“From a pirate’s perspective they want consumers to pay for the services they offer. Their professional-looking websites already fool many unsuspecting consumers into thinking that they are a legitimate vendor. This veneer of authenticity is further enhanced with pirates often using multiple well-known payment provider services to make it easier for subscriptions to be purchased” the AAPA reports.

The underlying suggestion is that the appearance of brands such as Visa and Mastercard enables not only the processing of payments but also leads to a boost in consumer trust for illegal services. The big question then is how the situation has changed since the 2018 Irdeto report.

Improvement Over 2018 But Not Enough Says AAPA

In 2018 of the sites that openly published payment methods 21% offered Visa 21% offered Mastercard and 14% offered payment via PayPal. Since then AAPA says it has engaged with all three companies and according to a study by its Disruption Working Group PayPal now ranks first with 17.3% Mastercard at 14.7% and Visa closely behind with 14.1%.

“The question for the payment services industry and policymakers is how do so many sites slip through the net of the preventive measures – some of which are legal requirements like anti-money laundering regulations? Of course any ex-ante system is not watertight and can be circumvented but the evidence does suggest a lot more needs to be done. But by whom?” AAPA asks.

AAPA Engagement With The ‘Big Three’

Despite PayPal now being the largest player in the IPTV market according to AAPA’s own study the anti-piracy group expresses no criticism for the payment processor.

“PayPal and AAPA have a long-standing relationship. PayPal is committed to finding a workable solution to combat piracy’s impact on the industry and on their brand. Issues are discussed openly and constructively” AAPA says.

Visa too comes in for modest praise albeit with slight reservations.

“From our interactions with Visa we know that they have very stringent internal procedures in place” AAPA writes. “These procedures can include multiple cease and desist notices and may require proof via a test [IPTV] purchase. All of this takes time while piracy continues unchallenged. Visa is of course protecting its rights and interests and AAPA members are doing the same” the group says calling for compromises to find a middle ground.

As for an assessment of Mastercard’s efforts AAPA says it is “a bit too early to say” with the suggestion that meaningful cooperation has yet to begin in earnest.

Opportunities For Improvement

In general AAPA feels that the way forward for all processors is to be more attentive when it comes to due diligence matters preferably reinforced and monitored by either a third party or a memorandum of understanding. Proactive monitoring to ensure proper compliance with processor terms and conditions is also high on the list of requirements.

Referencing a discussion paper published by the European Union Intellectual Property Office the AAPA also identifies the need for a more streamlined system whereby rightsholders are able to complain about pirate sites and have their services terminated.

In addition the rightsholders seek a transparent system that opens up knowledge of how specific “repeat infringers” are being treated by payment processors.

IPTV and Cryptocurrencies

Looking back on Irdeto’s 2018 report cryptocurrencies accounted for just 4.3% of all payment methods openly advertised by pirate IPTV providers. According to the latest figures that share has now reached almost 12%. AAPA describes the increase as “not huge” and puts forward various theories of why the uptake is not greater.

“These could be the instability of the cryptocurrencies sinister association with hacking and ransom demands or that most consumers don’t know how to use crypto” the group says.

It seems probable at least among the less tech-savvy IPTV user that the latter is more likely to be a factor. After all the most convenient payment methods – PayPal and credit/debit cards – are still the most popular despite an ongoing level of cooperation with rightsholders.

That raises the question of whether clamping down on the simpler forms of payment will have a strong effect on the penetration of pirate IPTV services in the marketplace.

In the short term it seems that the answer is a strong ‘yes’ but over time it is likely that consumers will become more accustomed to using crypto too making the transition from traditional payment methods a gradual affair rather than a sudden overnight culture shock.

There is also evidence in the market to suggest that IPTV providers are encouraging their customers to move over to crypto sooner rather than later. In part this could be due to payment processor pressure but there is also a desire for providers to secure their businesses by making law enforcement “follow-the-money” investigations considerably harder.

That leaves the prospect of significant action by the mainstream processors eventually forcing a big shift towards crypto and creating even greater problems that will be considerably more difficult to tackle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vcG1uZXdzbmlnZXJpYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8wOS92aWRlb3MtYWJvdXQtbWUtc2F5aW5nLXBlb3BsZS13aWxsLWdvLXRvLWhlbGwtYXJlLWxpZXMtbXVtbXktZy1vL9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vcG1uZXdzbmlnZXJpYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8wOS92aWRlb3MtYWJvdXQtbWUtc2F5aW5nLXBlb3BsZS13aWxsLWdvLXRvLWhlbGwtYXJlLWxpZXMtbXVtbXktZy1vLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Videos about me saying people will go to hell are lies – Mummy G.O.,"Evangelist Oluwafunmilayo Adebayo alias Mummy G.O said that many videos about her sermons saying people will go to hell have been edited and are false.

She said this while giving her reaction to funny short clips and memes shared on social media about her in a BBC interview published on Sunday.

According to her people behind those videos started it over eight years ago.

She denied saying people who use MasterCard are going to hell because she herself uses MasterCard.

The evangelist also said getting a Master’s Degree doesn’t mean one would go to hell and she never said such.

Asked if her teaching and convictions about female footballers going to hell fire and others are backed by the scripture she cited a verse in the Bible.

“Deuteronomy 22:5 says no woman shall wear anything that belongs to a man and no man wears things belonging to a woman. It is inside the same Bible we all read”.

The cleric also revealed during the interview that her messages have made her receive death threats from other pastors and people she doesn’t know.

She said guns have been pointed at her and she has been pursued and spied on by people she doesn’t know owing to her messages.

The spiritualist said after receiving these threats and she did not back down these set of people came to social media to begin all the blackmail.

Evangelist Adebayo also apologized to artists and superstars her preaching may have touched noting that she is not trying to bring anybody down.

Speaking on her past when she was ‘on the other side’ before being called the evangelist said: “I was not a child of God from the beginning but in the other side of the world ‘darkness.’ I was working for the darkness doing all sorts of things in the church attacking the church molesting pastors and when God called me out after many preachings and prophecies I would laugh.

“I responded then saying Jesus said in the Bible ‘I know my people my people know me but me I don’t know Jesus’ even though all my family members are pastors. I told them I don’t believe in Jesus and I’ve arrested a pastor before for telling me God called me.

“When Jesus started talking to me to repent and he wants to use me I destroyed all my power and had to follow him.

She reiterated her preaching during the interview saying that the only way anybody can make heaven is to obey God which she describes as very difficult.

Speaking on her mandate as a spiritualist the evangelist said her work is to prepare people for heaven and the coming of Christ (rapture).

Asked how she feels about being called Mummy GO she said “that’s a new title and I don’t feel bad. Why will I feel bad?

“People don’t know I exist and now they hear many bad things about me. The wise among them will want to know the truth about me from there they will know me she said.

On viral clips about her going round on social media the evangelist said “I have seen plenty of these videos yet I don’t feel bad.

“I don’t feel bad because many of those sharing the clips are not my enemies. Many of them don’t know me and are just flexing on the social media that this is the new trend.

“Many don’t know why those who started sharing the clips are doing it. Many youth just join things that would make them laugh so they are not my enemies at all they don’t even know me.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmF0aW9ub25saW5lbmcubmV0L3Byb2ZpbGUtd2hhdC15b3UtcHJvYmFibHktZGlkbnQta25vdy1hYm91dC1tdW1teS1nby1pbi12aXJhbC1tZW1lcy_SAWVodHRwczovL3RoZW5hdGlvbm9ubGluZW5nLm5ldC9wcm9maWxlLXdoYXQteW91LXByb2JhYmx5LWRpZG50LWtub3ctYWJvdXQtbXVtbXktZ28taW4tdmlyYWwtbWVtZXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PROFILE: What you probably didn't know about ‘Mummy GO’ in viral memes,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='thenationonlineng.net', port=443): Read timed out.

She made the disclosure in a recent interview with BBC News Yoruba

Adebayo denied that she ever said those who use MasterCard will go to hell. “There was no time I said that. I use MasterCard and I am not going to hell. What I said is that many of the technological innovations are preparatory to the reign of the anti-Christ. I did not say users of MasterCard will go to hell.”

She also refuted the news item about her sex life stressing that there was no time she said it took 30 minutes for her husband to penetrate her vagina during sex.

A video on the wall of a Facebook user however shows that she made the claim of renewed virginity. Could the video have been doctored?

Adebayo who claimed to have been in ministry for 24 years said some people deliberately manipulate her messages so they could get people to hate her.

In the last few weeks many things have been credited to her on social media.

She however explained that some of those things were not put the way she said them.

While agreeing that she said those who have skin cut who use make-up and tattoo their bodies will go to hell she said “All I said are being backed by the scriptures. If you go through the book of Romans 1v32 33 and Leviticus 19 you will see where the Bible condemned these things. I normally back whatever I say with the Bible.”

Mummy G.O. Nobody was against me when I was with Satan

Adebayo is the founder of Rapture Proclaimer Evangelical Church based in Iyana Ipaja Lagos.

She said nobody was against her when she was in the kingdom of darkness doing all sorts of things to promote Satan.

She however noted that since she renounced her sins and committed her life to God she has been facing serious attacks from fellow pastors.

On her position about comedians she said “It is true that I said comedians will go to hell. There is no way you can do comedy in Africa without telling a lie. And the Bible tells us that we should let our yes be yes and our no be no. These things are in the Bible. I did not manufacture them.”

She said in another BBC interview that she was not the first person to condemn football. “Just goggle the god of football. Many other people have been saying that football is a god. People worship football.

“The antichrist knows that football is the only thing that can unite the whole world. That is why they are spending billions of dollars on it. Football represents the earth. It is a round shape object. That is the world for you. Inside it there is nothing but air. It tells you the world is vanity. I am not the first person that will say lovers of football will not make heaven” she quipped.

But was this video doctored…who is lying"

How the audience reacts to a wrestler or team at first can make or break careers. And few debuts at least in WWE are as momentous as this one.

Today we look back at the first official match involving three of the most famous WWE superstars of the past decade. Though they made their main roster debut earlier this match marked the first time that anyone would see them in the ring together. They managed to turn some heads with their regular match interference and beat-downs but were they just as good in the ring as they were outside it? There was only one way to find out.

Today we look back at the Shield’s debut match at TLC 2012 against Daniel Bryan Kane and Ryback.

As a reminder I am reviewing Five Star and almost-Five Star wrestling matches as rated by Wrestling Observer’s Dave Meltzer. It goes back to the 1980s and I’m going to pick different matches from different eras to see how they look today. Check out previous entries in my 5 Star Match Reviews series right here.

The story

One month earlier Ambrose Rollins and Reigns interfered in a triple threat match involving CM Punk John Cena and Ryback. Though they denied it they were revealed to be hired mercenaries for Punk in his quest to retain his WWE Championship whenever possible and by any means necessary. The Shield tried to mask their motives for attacking supposedly random targets as going after ‘injustices’ but it soon became apparent that they were actually going after anyone perceived to be a threat to Punk.

Ryback was one of the Shield’s first victims and naturally he wanted revenge for them costing him the WWE title. But as strong as he was he was still outnumbered and thus needed allies to even the odds. So he enlisted the then-WWE Tag Team Champions Daniel Bryan and Kane who despite acting as an oddball pairing that didn’t always get along had enough cohesion as a team to be able to challenge the Shield.

But could they really? Could this team of a Goldberg-inspired monster and strange bedfellow tag champions work together as well as The Shield? Or would they get picked apart and fall just like all of the Shield’s victims thus far?

The match

This match originally took place on December 16th 2012 at WWE TLC. It was rated ****1/2 out of five by the Wrestling Observer’s Dave Meltzer. The match was also rated ****1/2 by TJRWrestling’s John Canton in his review of the show.

This is the Shield’s first-ever match. The only way to win is via pinfall or submission in the ring. Rollins and Ambrose enter from one side of the arena and Reigns enters alone from another. Team Hello No and Ryback are already in the ring and they take the opportunity to go to the floor. A brawl begins right away. The ‘established guys’ score an early advantage as Reigns and Ambrose get knocked back into the crowd. Rollins brawls with Bryan until Bryan takes over with Kawada kicks. Ambrose makes it into the ring and chops Ryback but Ryback no-sells and drops Ambrose with chops of his own. Ambrose escapes a press slam and kicks Ryback down to a knee as the crowd chants ‘Goldberg’ at him.

Ryback lands a Thesz Press but is soon triple-teamed by the rest of the Shield. “Goldberg” roars and pushes all of them back and knocks Rollins to the floor but Ambrose follows up with a dropkick that sends Ryback down as well. Rollins sees Kane grabbing a ladder and lands a sliding dropkick. Bryan enters the ring but gets triple-teamed as well. Why he’d enter alone against three opponents I have no idea. Reigns launches Bryan face-first into a ladder held up by Ambrose & Rollins. Suddenly Ryback gets up boots Reigns and then sends the ladder into both Rollins and Ambrose. He smashes said ladder into them several times until Reigns hits him with a chair. But before he can bring it down again Kane grabs that chair and punches Reigns into a corner. Bryan comes in and lands multiple kicks to Reigns’ chest. The crowd chant ‘yes’ as Bryan yells ‘no’. He and Kane whip Reigns into the ladder set up in the opposite corner. Kane follows by sending Bryan into Reigns and Bryan lands a running dropkick. Kane pins but Reigns kicks out.

Bryan sees Ambrose and Rollins double-teaming Ryback ringside and goes to help but gets tripped and hits the apron hard. The fans chant ‘we want tables’ as Ambrose smashes Bryan into the ringpost and Rollins does a diving…something…only to eat an uppercut from Kane. Kane grabs another chair following a Rollins kickout opens a ladder places Rollins in between the ladder’s legs and hits the ladder with the chair. Okay makes perfect sense. Suddenly Ambrose comes in and DDTs Kane into a chair. Ryback comes in and smashes both Rollins and Ambrose into different corners but they cut him off. Rollins smashes the ladder into Ryback’s chest and then he and Ambrose try to throw Ryback into a ladder. Except Ryback’s too strong and he smashes both of them to the mat instead. Body blocks for each of them. Both of them end up in a corner perched against a ladder. Ryback runs into them and they go down hard. But he’s not done unleashing mayhem. Ryback suplexes both Rollins and Ambrose onto a ladder at the same time. He goes for Double Shellshocked. Reigns breaks it up and saves his teammates. They triple team Ryback with whatever weapons they can find. Ryback escapes to ringside but the Shield stay on him. Triple Powerbomb through the Spanish announce table! Suddenly Bryan appears out of nowhere and lands a suicide dive through the ropes. But then he gets triple-teamed. It’s hard to follow with the annoying shaky cam going on.

Bedlam ensues as Kane brawls with Reigns ringside and Bryan tries taking control from the other two with a chair. Ambrose pick up both Bryan and a chair and scoop slams Bryan so that he hits the chair on his way down. The Shield keep mangling Bryan with chairs as they set up a table upright in the corner. Bryan gets Irish whipped…and hits the edge of the table with his chin. The Shield continue their onslaught by placing Bryan on top of the table and land a two-man superplex. One two Kane makes the save.

Reigns charges Kane but gets dumped to the floor. But soon he too gets double-teamed by Ambrose and Rollins who wreck him with chairs and throw him chin-first into the table as was done to Bryan. They attempt the same superplex spot again but Kane fights out. Rollins gets thrown to the floor. Kane unloads with clotheslines on Reigns and lands a sidewalk slam. Ambrose breaks up the pin and then opens up a chair for a DDT. But Kane counters with a chokeslam. Ambrose gets chokeslammed not onto a chair but through it. Kane pins but Reigns breaks it up.

Kane clotheslines Ambrose to the floor and brawls with him but Reigns knocks him down from behind. Why no one has gone to pin Ryback after all this time I have no idea. Just thought I’d point that out. Anyway Reigns pulls a Goldberg and spears Kane through the barricade wall. The fans chant ‘this is awesome’ as they literally bury him in debris and random objects (instead of you know pinning the guy). Rollins and reigns are so caught up in their little celebration that they don’t notice what’s happening in the ring. Bryan catches Ambrose and locks him in the crossface. He sees Rollins coming releases Ambrose and locks it onto Rollins. But that doesn’t make sense since Reigns is right behind him and he starts hammering away on Bryan seconds later. Reigns goes for a back suplex. Bryan counters and locks in the crossface on Reigns. Ambrose breaks it up and sets up another chair for a double suplex. Bryan fights out by kicking both of them as hard as he can. He charges but Ambrose cuts him off. That allows Rollins to land a curb stomp into the chair. Ambrose goes for a pin. But here comes Ryback back from the dead to pull Ambrose off.

Ryback gets a second wind out of nowhere and starts landing big power moves on Reigns and Rollins. Rollins gets press-slammed over the rope onto Ambrose down on the floor. Both of them go down. Spinebuster by Ryback onto Reigns. Ryback attempts a powerbomb onto a chair. Ambrose breaks it up but gets speared on a charge. Ryback drops him with a Meat Hook clothesline and teases the end. He drops Ambrose with his Shellshocked finisher. The referee counts one two no both Reigns and Rollins break it up.

Ryback brawls up the entrance ramp with Rollins and Reigns. He gets the upper hand and teases a powerbomb when Ambrose hits him from behind with a chair. They smash any object they can find on him and then drag him onto a conveniently-placed table. Rollins sends his teammates back to the ring to deal with Bryan as he climbs a freakishly-tall ladder. He’s halfway up when Ryback gets up and walks towards him. Rollins has nowhere to go. He tries to climb onto another ladder but Ryback catches him and throws him down. Rollins goes through two other tables magically setup nearby. But instead of pinning the guy Ryback starts crawling back to the ring where Reigns and Ambrose have successfully double-teamed Bryan. Bryan’s completely helpless as his opponents set up another table. Ambrose lifts Bryan up onto Reigns’ shoulders as he puts Bryan in the powerbomb position. Reigns powerbombs Bryan from the corner through a table. Ryback’s coming up the entranceway as Reigns pins. One two three! The Shield trio has won. Ryback sinks down in defeat.

Review

If you like nonsensical demolition derbies or car crash-style matches you’ll love this match. It was twenty-two minutes of bedlam and weapons-based high-spots which made for relatively easy viewing. But if you’re looking for a cohesive match that makes sense you’ve come to the wrong place. This was fine as a guilty pleasure beatdown but it really isn’t that much of a classic.

Even though the commentators kept calling a three-on-three match it wasn’t. 90% of the match was three-on-one with the Shield trio picking their opponents apart one after another. They dominated the match and were able to hit some convoluted high-spots knowing they were in control and thus didn’t have to worry about being interrupted. It wasn’t long before the Shield – the supposed villains of the match – became the heroes. Although Bryan Kane and Ryback came in as the heroes defending their turf against outside invaders the Shield worked so well together that got cheered long before the match ended.

Moments that were supposed to garner heat for the Shield – Kane getting buried under weapons the double-team table superplex the constant pin interruptions – got cheered instead. It was obvious that Ambrose Rollins and Reigns were quickly become Steve Austin-style ‘tweeners’ that attacked whomever they wanted much to the crowd’s delight. So if the goal was to get the Shield over as this dangerous cohesive unit they more than succeeded.

And yet for all its flashy high-spots and creative moves some stuff didn’t make sense and it hurt the match as a result. Though the story made sense the match had some moments that raised more questions than they solved. Why didn’t the Shield drag Ryback’s carcass to the ring and pin him after their Triple Powerbomb through the announce table? That move was sold as some kind of tactical nuke yet they just left him to lay there for a long time. The same thing with Kane not long afterwards; he got speared through the barricade and they literally buried him beneath random debris instead of pinning him when they had the chance. If the goal was to win the match why didn’t they even try to pin those two opponents who were clearly unable to get up after taking such huge bumps?

There was also a sense of stupidity from Ryback Kane and Bryan. Whereas the Shield wrestled as a unit and looked after each other throughout the match their opponents went after them one by one. Ryback briefly managed to out-power all three opponents and Kane tried to even the odds with weapons. Still even with those slight advantages why would either one of them go in alone against a unified front? It was like both Ryback and Kane were asking to be triple-teamed which is exactly what happened.

Worse still was what Bryan did because he jumped into the lion’s den completely unprepared. He went into the ring against three opponents and got overpowered in seconds. It didn’t come across as bravery but as stupidity; he just saw them dismantle Ryback with ease seconds earlier and attacked them anyway. Why would he fly head-first into battle knowing he’d suffer the exact same fate? And why would he render himself defenseless by locking in a submission hold on Ambrose when he could clearly see Reigns and Rollins sprinting into the ring to save their friend? These were supposed to be three of the best wrestlers on the roster (including two champions) yet they wrestled in a way that defied logic. All three of them tried to make themselves look brave and valiant in defending WWE against the Shield but when the match was over they actually came across as fodder for this new group instead.

Final Rating: ****

I can’t call this a competitive match because Kane Ryback and Bryan went into this without a plan and ended up being sacrificial lambs. They just played their own biggest hits hoping something would work. And while all three of them got fleeting moments to shine the Shield outshone them. The Shield came across as smarter tougher stronger and more cohesive. The whole pick-them-apart-one-by-one strategy made perfect sense but it also made the match drag at times. There were a few moments when little to nothing happened only for those to be balanced out by some creative hardcore moments that were impressive though not awe-inspiring.

While this might’ve been a great match live it doesn’t really hold up that well over time. It’s got a few great moments thanks to some creativity and a somewhat sound story but one has to suspend disbelief a bit too much to find it really enjoyable now.

Graeme McCormick a well-known party activist who stood to become SNP president in 2023 claimed he would gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

His supporters argue it would be undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. If one does take place Swinney will not be appointed as first minister until late May.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson posted on X on Sunday that he had already obtained the 100 signatures required and was planning to hand them in to the SNP “in person”.

Lawson also attacked Swinney for criticising the move and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was challenging him.

“So Graeme McCormick has succeeded in getting the nominations he needed. Disappointed that JS [Swinney] has already had a dig at him before nominations even close for daring to challenge him. He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea?”

McCormick some of whose allies want the Scottish government to mount a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea? — Iain.lawson27 (@ILawson27) May 5 2024

Nominations to succeed Humza Yousaf as SNP leader close at noon on Monday. If another candidate crosses the nominations threshold and forces a contest Yousaf is expected to remain in post and as Scotland’s first minister until a winner is declared.

McCormick was very confident he would gather the signatures before the deadline after canvassing for support at an independence rally in Glasgow organised by All Under One Banner the Sunday Herald newspaper reported.

Swinney who has been expecting to be confirmed as the new SNP leader on Monday afternoon and be voted in as first minister this week warned on Sunday that a contest would delay his efforts to rebuild the party and put its deep divisions on public display.

“I think it would be better if we just got on with things that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength” he told BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show. “We had a lot of strains around a couple of issues in parliament and I think we’ve just had a rough couple of years.

“[The] SNP has not looked cohesive; the SNP has not looked together. The central point of my message is we’ve got to get ourselves together.”

An unopposed coronation would not be the SNP’s first: Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in November 2014 without a contest.

Swinney’s call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L3NucC1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWNoYWxsZW5nZXItZ3JhZW1lLW1jY29ybWljay1wdWxscy1vdXQtb2YtcmFjZS0xMzEzMDMwMtIBZGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2FtcC9zbnAtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1jaGFsbGVuZ2VyLWdyYWVtZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stcHVsbHMtb3V0LW9mLXJhY2UtMTMxMzAzMDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Swinney set to become next SNP leader and Scottish first minister as rival quits race,"John Swinney appears set to become Scotland's next first minister after Graeme McCormick pulled out of the race to become SNP leader.

Mr McCormick's decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Mr Swinney as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down.

Mr Yousaf said he was resigning last week after he decided to end the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Green Party.

Reports of a contest began early on Sunday when Mr McCormick said he had secured the 100 nominations from 20 branches needed to run against Mr Swinney.

But in a statement shared with Sky News the party activist said he had had a ""lengthy and fruitful conversation"" with Mr Swinney adding he had ""met the threshold set by the party rules"".

""John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months"" he said.

""This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver Independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

""I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney's nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.""

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

However he said he had been persuaded to run on this occasion after discussions with his family.

He chose not to run in 2023 as he felt ""tired and drained"" after a number of years in important roles but that he was feeling refreshed after a year out of the cabinet.

Mr Swinney said: ""I thought it was time for other people to take leading roles… I thought I’d done my bit.""

However he said he now had ""peace of mind"" that running would be the ""right thing to do for me and my family and my party and my country.""

The Perthshire North MSP added that he was confident he would deliver independence and that he would aim to do this through ""reasoned conversation"".

Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said it was ""laughable"" that Mr Swinney wanted to take conflict out of a push for independence.

He said: ""Scotland needs a first minister focused on the public’s real priorities – fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy – not one fixated on dividing the nation just to pacify the warring SNP.""

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the SNP were a ""divided and chaotic"" political party who had ""broken the trust"" of Scottish people.

He told The Sunday Show that Mr Swinney was managing his party and its ""decline"" rather than focusing on the priorities of people in Scotland.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI0LzA1LzA1L3NucC1hY3RpdmlzdC1qb2huLXN3aW5uZXktZmlyc3QtbWluaXN0ZXItc2NvdGxhbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SNP activist aims to thwart John Swinney's bid to be first minister with own leadership run,"An SNP activist is planning to ruin John Swinney’s coronation as first minister by running against him to become party leader.

Graeme McCormick a party member who has been actively critical of the Scottish Government was seen at an independence march on Saturday attempting to secure enough support to make the ballot.

Senior SNP sources admitted it was feasible that Mr McCormick could be successful in forcing a contest given the low bar set by the party.

To stand for SNP leader a party member needs just 100 signatures indicating support from fellow members coming from a minimum of 20 separate branches.

Asked whether he would welcome another leadership contest given reports about Mr McCormick Mr Swinney said: “I think it would be better if we just got on with things that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength.”

Mr McCormick a retired lawyer has declined requests to speak to the media.

However he has indicated to journalists that he is confident of winning the required support by the deadline of noon on Monday.

Should he succeed Mr Swinney would be all but certain to still win the contest but it would mean he would not become SNP leader until May 27.

What Is Staphylococcus Aureus?

The FDA explains that Staph is a bacteria that can cause severe food poisoning. Food contaminated with Staph may not smell or taste bad or look spoiled. Though the bacteria can be killed by cooking the toxins may still be able to cause illness.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) symptoms develop within 30 minutes to eight hours after consuming the contaminated food. Though severe illness is rare Staph food poisoning may cause nausea vomiting and stomach cramps.

What To Do If You Have the Recalled Products at Home

Check your pantry for the recalled products many of which have a long shelf-life. Do not eat any of the recalled products. You should discard them.

Sheffield Village police identified James Kimbrough as a “person of interest” in the shooting death of 24-year-old Milenna Lopez. Lopez’s identity was confirmed to The Morning Journal by Sheffield Village Mayor James Hunter.

“We hate to have things happen like this in the village but sometimes they are unavoidable” said Hunter who also expressed condolences to Lopez’s family.

Police believe that Kimbrough fled to Columbus Hunter said.

Lopez was in her vehicle in the McDonald’s parking lot on a break just before 10 a.m. when she was shot police indicated.

Kimbrough 34 has a lengthy criminal record with the Lorain Municipal Courts dating back to 2007 according to the court website. The charges include domestic violence unlawful restraint criminal damaging and endangering children along with traffic-related charges.

Lisette Gracia Lopez’s godmother who is acting as the family spokesperson said Lopez was the mother of four and was also the general manager at the McDonald’s where she was killed. Lopez attended Elyria Catholic High School and eventually graduated from Lorain High School Gracia said. She was attending Lorain County JVS where she was “on track to finish a dental assisting program” in February according to Gracia.

“She always wanted to be a dental hygienist to work in the dentistry field. She loved people’s smiles and she had a beautiful smile herself” Gracia said.

Kimbrough was the father of the two youngest of Lopez’s four children according to Gracia She confirmed Lopez and Kimbrough were involved in a tumultuous relationship and that Lopez had at least two restraining orders in place against Kimbrough.

“There’s a history” said Gracia.

Gracia said she met Kimbrough “once or twice” but had no clear memories of those interactions.

The memories of Lopez are far more vivid for Gracia who is a cousin of Lopez’s mother.

“I was in the hospital when she was born” said Gracia.

On Jan. 6 Gracia was at work when she received a phone call informing her of Lopez’s death. She was so upset that co-workers had to drive her to the McDonald’s 5250 Detroit Road where she went to comfort Lopez’s mother she said.

Garcia used the words “outgoing sweet friendly” when asked to describe Lopez. “She was loved by many.”

Lopez’s four children were aged 6 4 2 and 1.

“Devastating. Devastating. Heartbreaking” is how Gracia described the impact of Lopez’s death on her family.

Lopez’s death was one of three shooting deaths in Lorain County in the first six days of 2022.

It was a place where you could have your best birthday party ever where the Happy Meal toys flowed like Coke from the fountain and where the world of McDonaldland somehow seemed like pure joy. It's hard not to get nostalgic thinking back on these '80s McDonald's facts…how many do you remember?

The fries tasted better.

Author and journalist Malcolm Gladwell was distraught by the realization that McDonald's french fries didn't taste as good as the fries of his youth and so—in true Malcolm Gladwell form—he made a full podcast episode about it. The culprit? In 1992 McDonald's changed the method of frying from using beef tallow to a generic vegetable oil—all under the misguided notion that the oil would be seen as more healthy. The switch disappointed French fry fans everywhere and it left many pining for the rich and flavorful fries of yesteryear. So if you remember delicious McDonald's fries from your youth you're not misremembering them.

You got a lot of free McDonald's during the Olympics.

""If the U.S. wins you win."" This was the slogan McDonald's cooked up for its ad campaign during the 1984 Olympic games in Los Angeles as reported by The New York Times. The idea was that with every purchase you'd get a scratch-off ticket that revealed a sporting category and every time an American won a medal in that category you'd win a prize. A gold medal meant a free Big Mac a silver earned you french fries and a bronze got you a Coke. The only catch? The Soviet Union boycotted the games that year after the U.S. did the same to them during a previous Olympics in Moscow and America swept the floor with what was left of the competition. The U.S. won McDonald's customers won and McDonald's lost more than twice the number of Big Macs they had budgeted for.

Chicken McNuggets were all the rage.

Sure Chicken McNuggets still exist today but they're somewhat tainted by the idea that they're made of pink slime—a debunked rumor that's circulated on the internet for years. But '80s kids remember how it felt when McNuggets first made their way into our collective consciousness: It was pure excitement. They were so popular when they hit restaurants in 1983 that chains almost immediately had supply issues.

The prices were insanely low.

If you remember the price of a McDonald's hamburger being outrageously low as a kid your memory isn't deceiving you. According to Insider your average burger cost about 40 cents (with some wiggle room for regional fluctuation) and rose to only 62 cents by 1987. This left plenty of extra pocket change to cover your french fries and a drink—a steal by today's standards.

McDonald's tried to steal Pizza Hut's thunder.

Maybe they were still riding high after the success of their newly-introduced McNuggets or the advent of the Happy Meal. Maybe they were just getting too big for their britches. But in 1989 McDonald's got it in its head that it could—and should—pull an eleventh-hour power play and get in the pizza game. Though they didn't manage to convert as many Pizza Hut and Domino's fans as they'd hoped they did develop a small cult following that kept the item running at select chains until 2017.

McDonald's Changeables were the best Happy Meal toys.

When '80s kids take a stroll down memory lane to the golden years of Happy Meal toys one series stands out as supremely iconic: McDonald's Changeables. Released in 1987 these were plastic renditions of all of our favorite meals that transformed into robots (and in the third series that debuted in the '90s dinosaurs). Though they were of course free at the time these days they're still so beloved that they regularly fetch up to $50 each on eBay from devoted fans and collectors.

Hot Wheels also reigned supreme.

Something is comforting about knowing that Happy Meals included Hot Wheels since before many of us were born and that they continue to be released every year to this day. In 1983—for reference that's roughly 10 years before your parents finally started asking themselves whether it was worth it to get a dial-up internet hook up—the chain began releasing collectible car designs that sent kids everywhere into a frenzy.

The Hamburglar got a much-needed makeover.

The Hamburglar was an interesting character: His sole mission was to steal and hoard McDonald's hamburgers yet he remained a close friend of Ronald McDonald himself. When he was first created in the '70s he was a more troll-like character that spoke only gibberish and had goblin-like features. The company rather menacingly named him ""The Lone Jogger."" But in the mid-'80s they gave the character an image makeover refining and humanizing his features and renaming him with the more playful name he has today.

The value pack was the best deal around.

Before the advent of the Dollar Menu in the '90s there was the McDonald's Value Pack. Starting in 1985 you could get a Big Mac supersize fries and a Coke all packaged neatly in a box for just $2.59. The comments section for this Value Pack commercial is just brimming with old McDonald's enthusiasts waxing nostalgic about the pricing of the good ole days not to mention the option to ""supersize!""

The uniforms were iconic.

Here's a game that should help any McDonald's history buff pinpoint your age: Close your eyes and picture yourself walking up to the counter of the McDonald's of your childhood. What is the worker behind the register wearing? If it's a striped red and white button-up with a large collar chances are you're an early '80s kid. If instead you imagine a red polo with a white collar and a few horizontal stripes across the chest congratulations! You came of age in the late '80s.

Mac Tonight was the most soulful mascot.

Remember Mac Tonight? He had a moon for a head slick shades and a gift for jazz piano which he soulfully played by starlight to advertise the late-night menu at McDonald's beginning in 1986. Because the character and many of the advertisements were a play on ""Mack the Knife"" McDonald's was ultimately sued by the estate of Bobby Darin for illegally copying the style of the song—ending Mac Tonight's run as a McDonald's mascot in 1989.

There was finally a female McDonaldland character.

Just as Mac Tonight was rolled out to advertise the late-night McDonald's menu Birdie the Early Bird was an ambassador of the Egg McMuffin and other early morning fares. But perhaps more importantly and more memorably Birdie was one of the first female characters in the world of McDonaldland when she entered the scene in 1980.

The best birthdays were at McDonald's Play Places.

Doesn't matter who you are or what your childhood was like: if you grew up in the late '80s chances are you went to a birthday party—or dozens of them—at a McDonald's PlayPlace. In 1987 the chain debuted the indoor jungle gyms which had ball pits and Discovery Zone-type tubing to crawl through—so massive that once you went into the tube labyrinth your parents could only hope you'd resurface eventually at the bottom of some slide. You and your friends all got Happy Meals and the toys made it feel like it was everyone's birthday.

You couldn't live without a Flintstones wonderland cup.

Because every kid's idea of fun in the '80s was drinking a soda and then taking the sticky plastic cup home in their backpacks McDonald's had a very successful run with their Wonderland Cups in 1989. These featured all of our cartoon favorites including The Flintstones Scooby-Doo The Jetsons and Smurfs. These days the Marie Kondos of the world might balk at hoarding cheesy plastic cups but you know what? They gave us joy back then and they still do.

McNugget commercials were a low budget blast.

In the sleek world of today's ad industry our wildest ideas come alive convincingly with CGI animation—a far cry from the hot glued puppets and painfully cheesy jokes that used to fuel prime time advertisements in the '80s. The execution of the McNuggets commercials may have looked like a middle schooler's art project but those characters still stick with us decades down the line: the cowboy nugget the fireman nugget and everyone's favorite the fanny-pack-wearing tennis star nugget. They put on circus acts performed in rock bands and challenged Ronald McDonald to basketball games so they could ""dunk"" (in barbecue sauce of course). And you know what? They were fun.

The McDLT was ingenious.

The secret to the McDLT was not the recipe (a simple concoction of hamburger lettuce tomato and mayo) but the way the presentation preserved the temperature. As Seinfeld's Jason Alexander said in the 1985 burger's ad campaign it was key to ""keep the hot side hot and the cool side cool."" The burger was served in a polystyrene packaging that separated the cool veggies from the hot meat until you were ready to chow down but the whole idea fell by the wayside in the early '90s when people retaliated against such an environmentally-damaging container.

You needed the full collection of Snoopy glasses.

McDonald's began selling promotional glassware beginning in the 1970s but in 1983 it released a particularly popular line of Camp Snoopy glasses which you could buy with a meal for a discounted price. They sold a different glass each week so many customers made the pilgrimage to complete the set of five with the whole Peanuts gang. Today you can still buy the Camp Snoopy collection on Amazon though it'll cost you nearly $25 with shipping for a single glass. Good grief!

Grimace got his second of two makeovers.

Like the Hamburglar Grimace was a sinister character when he first came onto the scene. According to Business Insider his name was ""Evil Grimace"" and he was known to steal milkshakes and chase kids out of the restaurant. When they realized in the early '70s that children were terrified of the scaly four-armed miscreant they toned down his image and made him far less menacing—but he still had a slobbery pink mouth and a generally undesirable shape. In 1985 McDonald's refined his look again finally making him into the friendly giant gumdrop we all remember today.

Mickey's Birthdayland racecars felt like going to Disneyland.

For Mickey Mouse's 60th birthday in 1988 McDonald's celebrated with a series of pullback racers featuring all of our favorite characters from Mickey's Playhouse. Mickey could pop a wheelie Minnie's car spun in circles and for some inexplicable reason Donald Duck drove a locomotive despite the other four characters driving cars. If your family never went to Disneyland this was the next best thing.

We had the professor to thank for McNugget Buddies.

The Professor was the resident scientist of McDonaldland and though he technically existed in the '70s he rarely had speaking roles in ads and was always considered a tangential character. That all changed in 1983 when he became the mascot of the McNuggets launch and was reintroduced to the world as a Dr. Frankenstein-like character that made the McNuggets come alive. We have him to thank for all of those great McNugget Buddies ads not to mention the invention of the Dip-o-Matic.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

You could win $1000000 by learning the McDonald's menu song.

The McDonald's Menu Song was a promotional campaign where the chain gave out vinyl records of a jingle that listed a mouthful of McDonald's menu items to a catchy tune. On about 80 million records the singers botched the lyrics and gave up but on one lucky record—the winning record—they sang straight through without a single mistake. In 1989 a thirteen-year-old boy in Galax Virginia named Scotty Landreth claimed the million-dollar prize and millions of people learned to recite the McDonald's menu by heart along the way.

You had about 10 of each of the Berenstain bears toys.

In 1986 McDonald's gave out little Berenstain Bears figurines with their Happy Meals. Mama and Papa Bear were both pushing wheelbarrows as if they were gardening and Brother and Sister Bear were both riding on little carts. Because there were only four in the series often people collected entire armies of them with multiples of each character. Maybe that's what makes them so hard to forget!

Muppet Babies toys were great for racing.

The Muppet Babies Happy Meal toys were double the fun because each character was on a set of wheels. Kermit Miss Piggy Gonzo and Fozzie each came with vehicles: a car trike skateboard and rolling rocking horse which you could swap between the characters for seemingly endless combinations of racing. They were so popular that McDonald's re-released them in the 1990s.

Garfield mugs were 'the most wanted.'

In this late '80s commercial Garfield refers to his face on this glassware set as ""the most wanted mug in America."" (See what he did there?) And at just 69 cents with the purchase of a Happy Meal they sold like hotcakes. Though the internet seems to have confused the trademark date (1978) with the product release date (1987) '80s kids have no question about when these came out: we can still feel the scalding hot Nesquik through the glass in our hands while we flip the channel from Growing Pains to Golden Girls.

Packaging was an environmental disaster.

Back in the '80s before climate change was a household topic of conversation nearly every item you could purchase from McDonald's was served in styrofoam. While you could probably still visit those unfortunately well-preserved burger boxes in landfills and oceans to this day the company announced in 1990 that it would swap out its styrofoam for paper packaging and has slowly made the switch over a matter of decades.

In Officer Big Mac's playground jail the burger ate you.

You may remember Officer Big Mac for his massive burger-shaped head his old-timey constable hat or his clown shoes. Or if you were a true kid of the '80s you remember him for the climb-in jails for children that he apparently authorized endorsed and created in his image. The idea of kid-prison as playground equipment would have been disturbing regardless but '80s kids are probably doubly haunted by the memory of climbing directly into the cop-burger's mouth. McDonald's ultimately retired the character in 1985 when they streamlined the cast of McDonaldland characters but restored climbers have been spotted on eBay as well as an episode of the TV show American Restoration.

McDonald's came under attack from competitors.

The rivalry between McDonald's Burger King and Wendy's predates the '80s but it was during this decade that the gloves came off and both Burger King and Wendy's targeted Mickey D's directly in a series of cheeky ads. You could hardly turn on your TV without being caught in the crossfire. While McDonald's was hardly dethroned (it's undisputed that McDonald's sells the most burgers and covers the most territory) many would argue that Wendy's unofficially won the ad war with its extremely memorable ""Where's the beef?"" campaign that debuted in 1984.

Everyone loved the Fry Kids.

The Fry Kids were essentially anthropomorphized pom-poms with googly eyes and sneakers. But boy did they somehow make sense back in the '80s. Initially segregated into two groups of Fry Guys and Fry Girls the squad became coed in 1985 under their new name appearing in fantastical McDonaldland-themed commercials that reminded us all to ""keep your eyes on your fries."" Whether these have haunted your dreams since the '80s or been a source of sincere nostalgia it's hard to forget those french fry-loving mop tops of our youth.

Halloween was all about McDonald's pails.

In 1986 McDonald's started giving away what many regarded as the best Happy Meal prize of all time: Halloween pails for trick-or-treating. There were three in the original release and though the jack-o-lantern faces looked nearly identical they were given names (McPunk'n McBoo and McGoblin) to encourage people to collect all three. The fact that no kid needed three pails to lug around on Halloween didn't stop them coming back every time there was a re-release.

Happy Meals were everything we never knew we needed.

Happy Meals first hit the market in 1979 and we hit peak Happy Meal-mania in the 1980s. According to Reader's Digest they were inspired by kids' cereals with promotional toys in the boxes another popular food staple of the era. In 1987 the creator of the happy meal Robert A. Bernstein of Bernstein-Rein Advertising was gifted a bronze replica of a Happy Meal for his game-changing contribution to the fast-food chain. Now as a result of this invention there are countless throwback Happy Meal toys that remind you of your childhood.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbW9udGNsYWlybG9jYWwubmV3cy8yMDIyLzAxL25vLW1vcmUtbWNkb25hbGRzLW9uLWJyb29rZGFsZS1zb3V0aC1nc3AtY2xvc2VzLWNoaWNrLWZpbC1hLWFuZC1zdGFyYnVja3MtY29taW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No More McDonald's on Brookdale South GSP; Chick-fil-A and Starbucks Coming,"Say goodbye to Grimace Mayor McCheese and Ronald.

QUEBEC TO REQUIRE VACCINATION TO BUY ALCOHOL CANNABIS FROM SOME STORES: UNVACCINATED SHOULD ‘STAY HOME’

Local news outlet Israel 365 reports that McDonald’s is the first food provider in Israel to deny customers who do not have valid proof of vaccination. But the restaurant claims it is merely following government requirements and that the restriction only applied to locations on food courts.

""The Israeli government has enacted emergency regulations banning the sale of food on a food court without a ‘Green Pass’ and McDonald's Israel is complying with the law and has acted accordingly"" a McDonald’s Israel spokesperson told Fox News. ""Following the upcoming cancellation of the Green Pass this coming Monday by the government the announcement in Mac Touch will also be canceled accordingly.""

MICROSCHOOLS GAIN POPULARITY AS OMICRON KEEP SCHOOLS CLOSED

The Green Pass program has served as a temporary restriction the government has issued but officials continue to expand its application with each iteration. The current program applies to individuals who have received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine or who have had an infection but recovered indicating the presence of antibodies to protect against reinfection.

But some reports suggest Israel has decided to push ahead with a fourth vaccine shot which Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said has shown to increase antibodies ""five-fold"" just one week out from administration Reuters reported.

The Israeli government has juggled policies over the past few weeks in an effort to keep infections low and not provoke the image of lockdowns a line in the sand Bennett has tried to avoid.

Screenshot by ZDNet

Robots are the answer.

That'll surely be the mantra for so many businesses in 2022.

It's hard to hire employees especially when they want to be paid more than a tiny fraction of what the bosses make.

It's inevitable then that fast-food emporiums such as McDonald's and Chick-fil-A are burrowing deeply into automating their services -- and their customer service.

At the end of last year however McDonald's quietly revealed a more progressive direction for its future. It's not one that uses technology to eliminate humans. Instead it seeks to save them via IT equipment washing machines and dishwashers.

Old ones.

In the relatively quiet town of Market Drayton England McDonald's opened what it calls ""the UK's first net zero carbon restaurant!""

Perhaps you don't think this carbon obsession is merited. Perhaps you think climate change talk is all political hooey. Perhaps you think the Earth always rights itself one way or another.

McDonald's doesn't seem to agree with you. It actually wants all of its restaurants to achieve net zero emissions. (Next stop all its cows.)

The Market Drayton McDonald's will have wind turbines and solar panels of course. (What do you mean England is cloudy?)

The designers however have considered what to do with all the old washing machines dishwashers and IT equipment that have seen better working days.

They're using them to create the building's cladding which seems remarkably inventive and gives a reason for the people of Market Drayton to visit their local McDonald's and whisper: ""At last. The office printer that never worked finally has a use.""

The whole thing sounds like a museum of ingenuity. Drive-thru lanes made from recycled tires for example. Here's something you may not know about recycled tires: ""This material produces less carbon-dioxide and allows more water to be absorbed reducing the amount of rainwater going down the drain.""

McDonald's has even considered the curbs. They're made from recycled plastic bottles; 182 of them apparently. In the company's scientific analysis the result is ""reducing carbon emissions by 25kg per [curb] compared to concrete [curbs]. By using over 1000 of these at Market Drayton McDonald's has diverted over 200000 plastic bottles from landfills.""

Oh and the insulation is made from sheep's wool that would have gone to a landfill as well.

I'm not going to suggest that going to McDonald's will suddenly be good for you. Even its plant burgers have a ton of calories that may not be conducive to bracing health.

I can imagine though that anyone feeling even slightly guilty about eating fatty high-calorie sugar-laden food might feel a touch better that the fatty high-calorie sugar-laden food provider is doing something positive.

And here's another heartening thought. Robots could have never designed this McDonald's.

Could they?"

Biocartis and Merck to Collaborate on Improving Patient Access to Personalized Medicine in Middle East and North Africa (MEA) Region

Biocartis (Mechelen Belgium) announced an expansion of its collaboration with Merck Serono Middle East and Merck Saudi Ltd. both affiliates of Merck KGaA (“Merck”). The collaboration aims to improve patient access to RAS biomarker testing in the Middle East and North Africa (MEA) region.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide with an estimated incidence of more than 1.9 million new cases annually. An estimated 904 thousand deaths from CRC occur worldwide every year making it the second most common cause of death from cancer.1 Understanding an individual patient’s biomarker status is key to support timely treatment decision-making in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).2 Treatment with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody therapies have shown to improve outcomes in patients with RAS wild-type mCRC34 and have become standard of care for RAS wild-type mCRC.5

RAS biomarker testing is cumbersome and not readily available in all parts of the world. The Idylla™ KRAS Mutation Test and Idylla™ NRAS-BRAF Mutation Test are highly performant6 Tests that rapidly determine the RAS biomarker status in mCRC tumor tissue samples. Due to the ease-of-use of the Biocartis Idylla™ Platform the Tests can be deployed in any user setting and in turn aid patient access to biomarker testing globally.

Roger Moody Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis commented: “We are thrilled to announce the expansion of our collaboration with Merck in the Middle East and North Africa (MEA) region aimed at advancing healthcare solutions and ensuring timely and accurate diagnostics for mCRC patients. In our mission to enable universal access to personalized medicine for patients around the world Biocartis is proud to provide Idylla™'s cutting-edge technology for mCRC testing across countries in the MEA region. This collaboration underscores our shared dedication to overcoming the challenges in the healthcare environment of the MEA region and ensuring that patients receive the right medicine at the right time.”

Ramsey Morad SVP & Head MEAR - Middle East Africa Turkey & Russia/CIS at Merck added: ""In line with our commitment at Merck to enhance patient care in the MEA region we are happy to collaborate with Biocartis in addressing the critical need for improved access to RAS biomarker testing particularly in areas where such testing is not readily available. By leveraging Biocartis' RAS-testing platform we are confident this will allow treating oncologists to swiftly determine biomarker status and facilitate timely treatment decisions for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.""

BCG originally developed as a tuberculosis vaccine is also a standard treatment for NMIBC which accounts for about 80% of around 80000 new bladder cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S.

The FDA has cleared Anktiva and BCG to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ. And ImmunityBio is evaluating the combo in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with papillary tumors and perhaps more importantly in BCG-naïve NMIBC.

In the current indication ImmunityBio will go toe to toe with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 megablockbuster Keytruda and Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ gene therapy Adstiladrin both of which are administered by themselves without BCG. Ironically Merck is currently the sole supplier of BCG in the U.S.

Merck’s TICE BCG has been the lone BCG product in the U.S. since 2012 coming after Sanofi and another drugmaker ran into manufacturing problems. Sanofi officially pulled out of the market in 2016. Merck which had before then not been the major supplier globally for BCG was forced to pick up the slack.

In October 2020 Merck announced a plan to construct a new TICE BCG manufacturing facility in North Carolina. But that project was anticipated to be completed by late 2025 to late 2026 according to a Merck update in January this year. Once operational Merck expects to triple its current BCG capacity and believes believes it will be able to meet demand “for the foreseeable future.”

Merck has been rationing BCG supply since 2019. The New Jersey Big Pharma allocates its limited supply to distributors and wholesalers based on historical purchasing and it doesn’t directly determine the supply to individual healthcare providers.

SII is the largest manufacturer of BCG vaccine globally according to ImmunityBio. The Indian company has two BCG products for oncology use one traditional BCG called Onco-BCG is already commercialized outside the U.S. The new deal will see SII immediately supply that standard BCG for ImmunityBio’s clinical trials once the FDA signs off on the trial protocols which ImmunityBio plans to submit to global regulatory authorities within 30 days.

The second product a recombinant BCG is undergoing midstage testing in Europe. This version includes two gene modifications to improve its profile and according to ImmunityBio it has shown “potent immunogenicity with CD8+ and CD4+ stimulation and improved safety compared to standard BCG.” The two partners are now working to speed up the phase 2 program.

However in both cases the timeline for commercial supplies remains unclear. ImmunityBio will have more clarity on the timeline once it submits the trial protocols to the FDA a media aide to the company told Fierce Pharma.

The good news for ImmunityBio? Anktiva’s current U.S. label doesn’t specify or limit the type of BCG the drug can be used with. This allows the company to explore other alternatives to Merck’s TICE BCG ImmunityBio’s executive chairman Patrick Soon-Shiong M.D. said during an investor call last week.

“We are pleased to partner with the Serum Institute of India so that the power of its large-scale world-class GMP manufacturing capacity can be used to address the issue of BCG shortage which affects thousands of bladder cancer patients annually” Soon-Shiong said in a statement Thursday.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results."

""We are thankful for John's positive contributions during an intense and significant time in the company's history"" a Meta spokesperson said in an email Saturday. ""We wish him well going forward."" The spokesperson didn't give a reason for Pinette's departure.

Pinette gave employees the news in a Friday afternoon post saying it would be his last day according to The Wall Street Journal which earlier reported on his exit. ""I know the team will continue to thrive as you do some of the most important -- and most difficult -- work in Communications"" the post said according to the Journal.

Pinette had handled communications since 2019 and had previously led communications for Google in Asia. He'd also worked for Bill Gates as well as for Microsoft and for late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's company Vulcan.

Meta along with its Facebook and Instagram social networks has been the subject of intense scrutiny after former Facebook employee Frances Haugen leaked a cache of internal documents that among other things showed company researchers were aware of the harms caused by the platforms. The leaks fueled a series of high-profile media reports late last year and Haugen testified before Congress.

A Meta spokesperson told Reuters that for now Chris Norton vice president of international communications will step into Pinette's former role.

OnfyFans model Ava Louise claims Brown snuck her into his hotel room at the Jersey City New Jersey Westin hotel to have sex hours before the game which would be a violation of the Buccaneers' COVID protocol Daily Mail reported.

Louise claims Brown said ""f*** the NFL"" repeatedly during their meet up as well as ""I can’t wait for you to see what I do tomorrow. I can’t wait for you to see me tomorrow"" which many have interpreted as Brown foreshadowing his antics from last Sunday's game.

Additionally TMZ shared a video of Brown signing a COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card prior to Sunday's game as well as an image of the card with redactions a reference to his recent suspension.

Brown was recently among three players suspended for violating the NFL-NFLPA's COVID-19 protocols.

The NFL confirmed Brown and teammate Mike Edwards as well as free agent John Franklin III -- if signed to a club -- will all be ineligible for the next three games in a news release shared on its official communications website on December 2.

The Buccaneers issued an official statement on Thursday confirming Brown's release and denying accusations made by Brown that he was forced to play on an injured ankle last Sunday.

On Wednesday Brown shared an MRI from two days prior that revealed broken bone fragments a ligament torn from the bone and cartilage loss as part of his first statement in response to a strange incident in which he walked off the field at MetLife Stadium during the third quarter of the Buccaneers' 28-24 win against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium.

""The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have terminated the contract of Antonio Brown effective immediately"" the statement read. ""While Antonio did receive treatment on his ankle and was listed on the injury report the week leading up to last Sunday's game he was cleared to play by our medical team prior to the start of the game and at no point during the game did he indicate to our medical personnel that he could not play.

Those who wanted to watch the Giants’ season finale in person at MetLife Stadium on Sunday — and believe it or not there were several thousand — could have bought a ticket for around six bucks near kickoff.

The traffic usually backed up toward the Turnpike exit was light. The parking lots normally filled with hours until kickoff were barren. With plenty of up-close parking for the 22-7 loss to Washington the walk from the lot was shorter than general manager Dave Gettleman’s walk off the plank.

OPEN THE WASHINGTON-GIANTS GAME GALLERY HERE

After a year of awful football embarrassing postgame rants and an embarrassing fan promotion that have made the once-proud franchise a league-wide laughing stock a few thousand fans who braved the elements were willing to stomach one more Sunday of dreadful football in person — one more pitiful loss in a 4-13 season.

Seems there are fans who just can’t quit the Giants.

“They’re a [bleeping] mess. They’re hopeless” said Pat Daddino a 75-year-old Westchester county native. “But coming to the Giants it’s not just the game it’s coming to be with everybody. Misery loves company. It’s like having a family and you have one kid who is (messed) up but you still love him and take care of him.”

With Judge rambling for the past several weeks about culture and how hard his players are trying the Giants amassed one TD and 177 total yards of offense on Sunday 83 yards passing — against another team with nothing to play for. The Giants ran a quarterback sneak on a third-and-nine from their 4-yard line.

Meanwhile some fans refused to boycott. They wanted to deliver the message in person.

Gettleman who spent the pregame hugging and saying his goodbyes on the field “has got to go!” said Vinnie D’Antonio 59. His 65-year-old buddy Antonio Esposito chimed in: “His picks in the last few years killed us.”

The longtime North Jersey buddies — D’Antonio is from Totowa Esposito from West Orange — don’t agree on everything. They’re split on Judge following the trend of those polled for this story.

D’Antonio thinks Judge should get another year; injuries and bad team-building from Gettleman tied Judge’s hands he said. He’s not a fan of his recent postgame rants (”It feels like he’s a little concerned for his job”) but he’s willing to look past that.

Esposito thinks Judge should pack his things and join the group of coaches getting fired on Black Monday: “He’s a lame-duck coach” he said. “They got to clean house from top down.”

In a dream scenario for many Giants that would include Mara who is increasingly taking heat for the disastrous decade his team has undergone since winning its last Super Bowl in 2011. Fans are resigned to the fact he’s not going anywhere but some would like him to hand over the football decision-making to someone else.

“He’s the owner. What are you going to do? You can’t ask the guy to sell the team. It’s his team!” D’Antonio said. “He’s just got to clean it up. It’s in bad shape right now as bad as I’ve seen.”

Heading into the game the Giants were fourth in the NFL in average home attendance at 74448 per game trailing only Dallas Green Bay and Denver. But that figure represents tickets sold not fannies in seats — and as this latest lost season progressed fewer fans have bothered to show up.

Antonio Esposito of West Orange and Vinnie D’Antonio of Totowa pose for a photo in front of their Giants-themed tailgate wagon outside MetLife Stadium ahead of Sunday's season-finale against the Washington Football Team. They are two of the few thousand fans who just can't quit the Giants.

Anecdotally veteran Giants reporters could not remember a game as sparsely attended since MetLife Stadium opened in 2010. It may have even rivaled what is believed to be the smallest crowd for any Giants game not played with replacement players at the old Giants Stadium — a Dec. 4 1983 game against the St. Louis Cardinals that attracted just 25156 fans.

The Giants are on an eerily same path as their opponent on Sunday. The Washington Football Team once an NFL power that would fill every one of the 90000 seats at FedExField are a league-wide laughing stock with a half-empty stadium every other week. In 2021 the WFT ranked second-last in average home attendance.

There will always be people in the stands as long as hardcore fans like Esposito and Daddino and D’Antonio keep showing up. They were among the few thousand in the stands on Sunday and they’ll probably be back next year too. But they hope that the empty stands and barren parking lots will serve as a wake-up call.

“I just hope when he’s sitting in his box and he sees how empty his stadium is he has an awakening” Esposito said.

Kelly Smith knows a thing or two about digital transformation.

Before the phrase fully entered the business world lexicon Smith was at Starbucks where he helped lead its digital and mobile app expansion from 2014 to 2017. He then took a similar role at MGM Resorts using software and data to improve guest experiences at MGM locations.

Smith — who founded several Seattle startups earlier in his career — is now chief digital officer and chief information officer at Hagerty a classic car insurer that just went public in a SPAC deal valuing the company at more than $3 billion.

“I am really having fun. The cars make it really fun” Smith said in a recent interview with GeekWire (check out his wicked Porsche collection).

Founded in 1984 Hagerty is known for providing insurance for classic vehicles. It is riding growth in the classic car market particularly amid the pandemic.

But the Traverse City Mich. company has plans to grow into something much more — with digital at the core of that vision and Smith leading the way.

The longtime tech exec and entrepreneur brings a unique perspective as someone who has lived through hyper growth at both nascent startups and decades-old corporations. He previously founded Seattle startups such as RocketVox (sold to ThePlatform) ImageKind (sold to CafePress) and Zapd (sold to RealSelf).

We caught up with Smith to chat about his role at Hagerty the company’s SPAC what digital transformation means tech trends remote work Seattle and his memorable moment with Elon Musk while interviewing for a role at Tesla. The conversation was edited for brevity and clarity.

GeekWire: Good to catch up with you again Kelly. We miss you in Seattle. Where are you at these days?

Kelly Smith: We’re living in Idaho but I’m traveling to Traverse City once every three to four weeks. Hagerty’s transition to remote has gone great. We were extremely lucky because our leadership team was really supportive and enthusiastic about embracing best-of-breed tools for our employees. We made the cutover to Zoom and Slack before the pandemic. And now I think we have proven that remote work is a business advantage for us — so much so that we actually redesigned most of our office space to accommodate a remote work model.

GeekWire: The Hagerty gig must be fun. I think you love cars more than coffee (Starbucks) and casinos (MGM).

Smith: I am really having fun. The cars make it really fun. These old classic cars they can be money pits. I’m in the middle of two restorations right now. It doesn’t make any sense. But to people who love these cars it doesn’t need to make sense. Having people around you who enjoy the hobby and are willing to be somewhat irrational just to create some enjoyment in life is a blast.

GeekWire: Talk a bit about Hagerty and your role there.

Smith: Hagerty is probably the largest and most well-known insurer of classic and collectible car cars. But we sell a lot of insurance without talking about insurance. We’re one of the largest holders of valuation data for classic cars. We are one of the largest pay membership programs for automotive enthusiasts. We are one of the largest producers of automotive enthusiast media. We are developing physical spaces that are a combination of storage and entertainment spaces. We own many of the popular automotive events out there. And we’re working on a number of new innovations that keep fueling the automotive hobby such as a new way to buy and sell cars. We have a range of platforms that are not yet launched.

GeekWire: How is Hagerty using technology and digital to expand and what is your role in leading that?

Smith: To unpack that it’s fun to go backwards. I went from the entrepreneurial Seattle world into a more traditional corporate role at Starbucks. I was curious and interested in how these traditional companies would scale in an age of technology and whether or not I could add value at that scale. Then I came to MGM where I was the chief digital officer doing a very similar kind of role. And then finally here to Hagerty.

The “why” for me personally has turned into my own infatuation and interest in digital transformation stories amongst traditional non-tech companies. It started becoming more clear how someone like me could add value in these types of environments. It’s unbelievably challenging and it’s really interesting work.

One of things I’ve noticed as being a significant difference between my time in Seattle and the chapter of my life now is that the cultural divide is so much more significant than almost everybody including my former peers could have imagined in every little way.

How many times do you hear people in Seattle talking about or using the acronym “IT”? Not much. And yet outside of that reality that is the phrase people use in traditional companies to talk about technology.

To the rest of the world coming up in tech especially in and around Seattle and California they don’t actually know the real challenges and issues within traditional companies.

And a lot of people don’t realize only 30% of digital transformations are successful. So the “why” for me is very curious. Because if everybody presumably is getting the same newspaper in the morning if everybody’s reading the same internet then why do we have stories like Kmart or Sears or Macy’s or even Blockbuster? It’s an interesting question. If we’re all getting the same newspaper why are only 30% of digital transformations successful?

And so it’s that question and the reasons for the results that I have found to be incredibly interesting on the one hand and incredibly fulfilling from a professional perspective because you can really drive meaningful fulfilling impact.

GeekWire: Talk more about “digital transformation” and how you think about that phrase.

Smith: Digital transformation is not a buzzword that the consulting firms made up to sell more services. It is a real thing with with very real challenges.

To maintain business performance and relevance and cost control you need to have an ability to produce innovative products that meet the needs of customers who now have evolving expectations. They have an experience with Airbnb or an experience with Netflix or an experience with Amazon. Their expectations are rising and it permeates across into other areas in so much as how a customer makes purchase decisions. It will have an impact on your profitability and on your customer acquisition.

Now the issue is fundamentally that businesses typically don’t know how to go about creating a new kind of innovation culture within their traditional culture. And that’s usually because they don’t have awareness as to the importance of a framework to do it.

What do we mean by framework? From the board down does the enterprise have a stated digital North Star? Or are they just throwing money at different initiatives hoping something good happens?

Is there support at the CEO level and down to help drive the culture change so that it sticks from senior management all the way down through middle management so that the effort is not sabotaged?

For the last 30 years a business may have operated in such a way that the VP of sales drove the product roadmap. And now all of a sudden it’s a totally different conversation where there’s this new discipline called product management that feels that it has a different method for how you realize products and bring them to market. Product management isn’t even a thing in a lot of companies including my former employer MGM.

So it’s about bringing in new kinds of people teaching new disciplines new perspectives and rethinking whatever you thought traditional it was. What it amounts to is creating a more collaborative empowered culture that lets innovation flourish. It’s hard to do.

GeekWire: What’s an example of tech you are helping implement at Hagerty?

Smith: In our case lots of people do business with us — adding a car removing a car starting a new policy canceling a policy — over the phone. So we have hundreds of call center agents. As it stands right now we don’t even have a mobile app where you can get your insurance ID card. So we are trying to pour concrete to get to a table stakes position and we are then trying to get to the next level where we’re using innovation to drive business value.

And what that means is obviously a lot of different things. A lot of what that means is going backward and modernizing legacy technology that’s holding the company back from delivering on those table stakes.

(Hagerty Photo)

We’ve definitely shifted from a feature team where you’re basically producing orders that come to the back kitchen into a team where much of the innovation is happening more cross-functionally and you have more people helping to drive the strategy and the product offerings.

We’re building systems. This includes everything that the Airbnbs of the world take for granted. We’re creating baseline systems that might have been assumed elsewhere.

The reason most of these digital transformation efforts fail is because there’s no blueprint. Without a framework or a blueprint you might not get the results that you were hoping for. So what we’re trying to do now is set up a blueprint where we quantify the outcomes. We are investing in digital transformation for five reasons:

No. 1. Drive new sales. And there has to be a dollar amount and a date. That’s how we measure whether or not we’re successful. It’s new sales enabled by digital channels.

No. 2. Reduce our member support and service costs by X percentage by the end of 2024.

No. 3. Drive better customer retention metrics through these investments by X percent.

No. 4. Use these digital investments to create new levers that allow us to push deeper into our total addressable market so that we can take more of it.

No. 5. Hopefully with all these digital investments you are driving increased operational efficiency and effectiveness in all areas from finance to legal. You’re able to review contracts faster collaborate more work better and more efficiently.

“The reason most of these digital transformation efforts fail is because there’s no blueprint.”

So we are now starting to address the part where most other digital transformations fail which is aligning on a framework so that we know how we’re doing. It’s really surprisingly straightforward but most companies don’t do that. And so they flounder and then the board loses interest. When the board starts losing interest because they can’t keep track of what’s going on except for the money up going out the door that’s when you start to see a breakdown.

GeekWire: Why did Hagerty go public and why via a SPAC?

Smith: We roughly estimate that there are 500 million global automotive enthusiasts. We currently have 660000 paying members who are part of our Hagerty Drivers Club. And so now that we’ve got a formula that’s firing on all cylinders we can say okay let’s apply capital to this equation to produce more leverage so that we can push into other markets international markets ship some of these other products we’re talking about develop more media content produce more events build out more physical spaces and so forth. We’re using the capital for very healthy reasons.

In terms of the SPAC we were able to find additional leverage through the SPAC partners that we ultimately merged with. It just so happens that our SPAC partners are car enthusiasts. Aldel (the SPAC) is primarily led by Rob Kauffman who is a notable private car collector and is in the top 100 of worldwide personal car collectors. We both had strong ties to other car community and professional auto racing luminaries. And so the collective of those automotive luminaries adds additional leverage to our IPO and that’s why we did this SPAC IPO.

GeekWire: You are still investing out of Curious Office. More broadly what tech trends are you excited about right now?

Smith: There’s a couple of different spaces that really have my attention. I think the low-code world is going to start to really heat up. If you remember years back hardcore developers sort of looked down on these things thinking it’s not real software. But I think we’re past that time.

I’m also interested in the intersection of loyalty NFTs and how people start to creatively use these things beyond pictures and images. Can you add customer value by using these things in really interesting ways beyond what we’re seeing?

And I’m really interested in product management tools marketplaces etc. because that’s going to be one of the big unlocks for mainstream businesses.

GeekWire: Any thoughts on Seattle and its tech scene especially since you’ve left?

Smith: One of the things I notice about Seattle is how the streets and the landscape have changed just because of all the building going on. But my overall takeaway would be between the combination of watching Seattle grow as much as it has to watching Tesla blow up the way it has and being in the middle of these digital transformation stories — it has made it pretty clear that we are going through such a massive transformational shift that now I understand better. I understand why Amazon is growing as fast as it is for consumers on one hand and why it is growing as fast as it is along with Microsoft with the cloud on the other.

This is a transformational moment we’re living through. And I’m much more aware of it now than I was when I was in the middle of it.

And by the way I don’t think you knew this but I almost went to Tesla before going to MGM.

GeekWire: Wow — that would have been an interesting move.

Smith: I wasn’t necessarily even thinking about leaving Starbucks. But I got a call from Tesla and they were looking for someone to run their product teams. So I went down there spent an hour with Elon in the conference room. That was pretty interesting. It was right around the time they were struggling to hit their Model 3 delivery marks and it kind of wasn’t clear what was going to happen with this company.

Elon is super super intense. I needed a minute or two to calibrate to the way he thinks. But then once I kind of did we hit it off and it started being really fun.

He was sitting in the conference room with a furrowed brow when I walked in. I could see he was preoccupied with something. And I said “looks like you’re you’re preoccupied with something I hope my timing is not terrible.” He said “yeah I can’t figure out why we’re not hitting our sales numbers in the Northeast.”

I kind of lean back in my chair like regular people do and say “hmm can’t figure out why you’re not hitting your sales numbers in the Northeast.” He looked at me he said “Yeah … that’s what I just said.” I’m like OK I think I understand this guy better. He’s an extremely literal individual.

I told him that I bet it had do with people’s concerns over battery performance and cold weather. I said he should take a Tesla car and enter it in these events like Pike’s Peak (a race in Colorado). Electric cars eventually are always going to hold the record because they don’t have the deficiencies of altitude that combustion engines do. That got his attention. He’s like “Yeah that’s it.” Sure enough by the way electric cars went on to set the record so it turned out to be true.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxhc3ZlZ2FzYWR2aXNvci5jb20vcXVlc3Rpb24vbWlyYWdlLWhhcmQtcm9jay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will the Mirage Towers Be Torn Down for the Hard Rock Guitar?,"I've read that the Seminoles bought The Mirage and plan to open a Hard Rock Hotel-Casino there. The hotel will have the same guitar shape as the one in Hollywood Florida. But will they tear down the existing Mirage towers and replace them with the guitar hotel?

A:

No. The existing towers will remain — but not in their current guise.

Hard Rock International Chairman Jim Allen has explained “MGM has kept it in great condition but I think we all know that it’s extremely dated. You will see concrete on the floor and concrete on the roof and everything else will be brand new. Frankly some of the structure will change. For the existing 3000 rooms it’s our plan to gut them completely bathrooms and everything and start over.”

Allen would not go into details and has been extremely vague about the fate of the Strip-facing volcano. But given that the new guitar-shaped hotel would go in front of the Mirage as can be seen in the artist rendering there's a strong possibility that the volcano is toast. The fate of the dolphin habitat and Siegfried & Roy’s Secret Garden with its big cats also remains up in the air. Said Allen “Certainly we want to protect [the inhabitants] and make sure that their lives as animals are as comfortable as they are today.”

Hard Rock appears to have taken on The Mirage as a loss-leader for its wider casino empire giving it a Strip flagship. How else to explain paying $1 billion for a resort that generates $64 million in cash flow (after rent payments) per year? There’s not much return on investment in that.

As CBRE analyst John DeCree put it “Hard Rock will be able to do this right without concern for short-term return-on-investment hurdles.” In other words Hard Rock is sitting on so much money it can afford some lean years while it reinvents the Mirage. Also we've seen the Mirage referred to by the Seminole Tribe of Florida which owns the Hard Rock brand as a ""generational asset."" Meaning that the iconic center Strip casino will help to support tribal members for generations to come.

In the meantime it will still be The Mirage for three more years as Hard Rock gets to borrow the name rent-free. Then rights to the Mirage moniker revert to MGM Resorts International and the name Hard Rock Las Vegas will take its place.

Otherwise Hard Rock is being pretty tight-lipped about its plans. But we expect details to leak out as the deal closes and more plans are firmed. Watch our “Vegas News” space for further developments as they occur.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndidXIub3JnL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMS8wOS9tYXNocGVlLXdhbXBhbm9hZy1jYXNpbm8tcGxhbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Newly affirmed Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe looks at casino plans with fresh eyes,"As he begins his first full year in office the new head of a Massachusetts tribe says he intends to take a cautious approach to gambling while turning attention to social challenges and other economic opportunities for its members.

Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe Chairman Brian Weeden who is 29 and is the youngest ever to hold the post said last month's decision by President Joe Biden's administration to affirm the tribe's reservation and reverse a controversial Trump-era order gives the tribe legal footing to continue pursuing its long standing casino dreams.

But he said tribal leaders also want members to look at the idea with fresh eyes given how much the landscape for gambling has changed.

Massachusetts currently has three major casinos — MGM Springfield Encore Boston Harbor and the slot parlor Plainridge Park. The separate Aquinnah Wampanoag tribe has also broken ground on a more modest gambling hall on Martha's Vineyard though that's been mired in legal uncertainty. And state lawmakers are weighing legislation to legalize sports betting in Massachusetts.

""We're back to the drawing board basically"" said Weeden who took office in May in a wide-ranging interview Thursday. ""There's still an appetite for gaming. It just needs to be a smart approach. It has to be different from the past. We need to learn from our mistakes and proceed with caution.""

Meanwhile anti-casino residents in Taunton the city where the Mashpee Wampanoag project is proposed have asked a Boston federal judge to reopen their legal challenge.

They argue as they have before that the tribe wasn't eligible for a reservation because it wasn't an officially recognized tribe in 1934 the year the federal Indian Reorganization Act which laid the foundation for modern federal Indian policy became law.

The opponents have also argued the tribe's lands in Taunton shouldn't have been included in its reservation because they're some 50 miles from the tribe's home base on Cape Cod and weren't part of the tribe's historical domain. The tribe's reservation encompasses about 170 acres in the town of Mashpee and another 150 acres acres in Taunton.

Weeden said the latest legal challenge won't deter the tribe which traces its ancestry to the Native Americans whom the Pilgrims encountered centuries ago but which was federally recognized only in 2007.

Just prior to last month's decision the tribe extended its deal with its Malaysian casino developer partners Genting Berhad for another year according to Weeden.

But he said the tribe which has roughly 3000 members is looking to reach new financial terms to rein in its debt to the gambling giant which is about $600 million and growing but which comes due only if a gambling hall actually opens. Company spokespersons didn't respond to emails seeking comment.

Weeden said tribal members should also consider whether to scale back their casino ambitions.

Before litigation and the Trump administration order derailed it the tribe broke ground in 2016 on a $1 billion resort casino in a former industrial park. Dubbed First Light the resort was to include a hotel and shopping dining and entertainment options including a water park.

Opting to build a more modest slot parlor or bingo hall Weeden said would exempt it from a 17% state tax on gaming revenues even if it meant not being able to offer popular table games like blackjack and poker.

Weeden said the tribe also shouldn't rule out abandoning the casino plan altogether and finding other ways to bring financial stability to the tribe. He'd like to see it look into opening tax-free smoke shops tax-free gas stations recreational marijuana shops and other economic development initiatives on its lands.

""We need to exercise our sovereignty"" Weeden said. ""Casinos are just low-hanging fruit.""

The new chair says he also intends to focus more on homelessness substance use and other social ills facing the tribe.

Next month tribal leaders hope to present to members a plan to spend down the tribe's roughly $15 million allocation from Biden's coronavirus stimulus bill. Weeden says they will also pursue federal funds through the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill Biden recently signed into law which includes some $11 billion for tribes.

Among the projects being considered is the construction of tiny homes or cabins where homeless members can live temporarily Weeden said. The tribe also hopes to bolster staffing and programming for substance use mental health and other critical health services.

And with the national reckoning on racism reviving calls for reparations for Black slavery Weeden said the tribe also intends to step up its own calls for restitution.

He says the state should return seized lands or provide financial compensation as the tribe's current landholdings represent less than 1% of its ancestral territory.

""Everything going on in this country around social injustice and racial injustice that's all fine and good"" Weeden said. ""But the original inhabitants of this country are still fighting for what little land we have. Native Americans still don't have their fair share.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vb3V0aW5qZXJzZXkubmV0L2JvcmdhdGFzLW5ldy1kaW5pbmctZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1hbWVyaWNhbi1iYXItZ3JpbGxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Borgata's New Dining Experience: American Bar & Grille,"American Bar & Grille’s new menu focuses on seasonal ingredients and flavors

Pumpkin Soup: American Bar & Grille

In June 2021 Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa launched a new restaurant American Bar & Grille. Created owned and operated by MGM Resorts International and Borgata this new restaurant takes over the location of Wolfgang Puck American Grille which never reopened following its shutdown during the Covid-19 Pandemic.

American Bar & Grille’s new menu focuses on seasonal ingredients and flavors. The main dining room opens onto the casino floor. The casino-facing front of the restaurant is designed to appear more casual and features a seventeen-seat bar while the inner portion of the restaurant is designed with a more sophisticated edge. The bar features a wide variety of specialty cocktails wines by the glass plus domestic import and draft beers including Cape May Coastal Evaluation and Yards Philly Ale. The chef’s table seats up to twelve guests directly in front of the main kitchen line.

As part of the restaurant’s “Autumn on the East Coast” theme the ceilings and the back seating area are spotlighted by red gold and amber colors to resemble fall leaves. The restaurant features an open-flame wood-burning pizza oven. New Jersey’s locally sourced ingredients include tomatoes corn and fresh seafood.

Looking for the perfect cocktail? The Pumpkin Martini is flawless. If you are seeking something refreshing albeit not as strong the Apple Cider Sangria is a close second choice.

The appetizers and wood-fired pizza are the real standouts at this restaurant. The Tomato Bruschetta which is served with wood-fired bread marinated tomatoes and basil aioli is one of the best bruschetta dishes you will ever try. The Pumpkin Soup which is uniquely crafted with marshmallow cream is rich in flavor and offers an unparalleled distinctive taste. The Wild Mushroom Pizza is one of the best items on the menu.

Only MGM remains with a firm bid and even they seem to lack the enthusiasm they once had. How and why did it all go so wrong in Japan? And does Japan have any way to save the day?

In May 2018 I chaired the Japan Gaming Congress a major international conference in Tokyo produced by the organizers of the world’s largest gaming exhibition ICE London. The approximately 600 delegates represented a veritable who’s who of the international IR business community as well as a plethora of Japanese conglomerates and potential local suppliers – all looking to get a cut of the Japan IR action. Industry chatter about Japan ramped up through the 2010s. In 2014 and again in 2015 Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party said they were trying to get IRs open in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. In December 2016 Japan passed the Integrated Resort Promotion Act which the Financial Times described as “fulfilling a cherished ambition of [then Japanese Prime Minister] Shinzo Abe and firing the starting gun on a race to control a potential $40 billion Japanese gaming industry.”

The Integrated Resorts (IR) Implementation Act passed in July 2018. Just about every major IR operator in the world and plenty of second and third-tier operators too were salivating at the prospect of operating in what some described as the last great untapped IR market – the planet’s third-largest economy with a GDP around US$5 trillion and a population of 125 million. Many Japanese cities and prefectures created “IR promotion offices” tasked with exploring the opportunity.

IR concepts started surfacing taking advantage of Japan’s exquisite dining beautiful design esthetic and fascinating cultural mix of the ancient and historic with the modern and technological. Despite the most expensive IR anywhere in the world thus far costing around US$4 billion or US$5 billion suddenly investment amounts of US$10 billion or even more were bandied about.

Even IAG took the plunge and launched its IAG Japan brand in January 2019 adding Japanese to our language portfolio staffing a dedicated Japanese office and signing a strategic partnership with a long-established Japanese B2B hospitality industry media company. Yours truly travelled to Japan monthly throughout 2018 and 2019.

In 2019 IAG Japan covered no less than a dozen potential IR locations across the length and breadth of the country – from as far west as Nagasaki right up to Hokkaido in the very north. We also covered around 20 potential operators bidding for up to three licenses including all the industry tier-one names: Caesars Galaxy Genting Melco MGM Sands and Wynn – as well as a gaggle of other contenders such as Japanese company Sega Sammy Philippines IR operator Solaire Macau-based SJM and Suncity tribal gaming operators Hard Rock and Mohegan Sun and many more from across the globe.

A PROPHETIC WARNING

Amongst all this optimism in 2019 I asked a respected executive with over 40 years of industry experience his thoughts about Japan. I anticipated an enthusiastic response given all the excitement. What could possibly go wrong?

He looked at me much as an experienced and level-headed grandfather might look upon an exuberant youngster and sagely said “I have never been able to successfully do business in Japan or with the Japanese. Usually whatever deal you are working on falls through and when it doesn’t you wish it had. It always starts out looking rosy but by the time the dust settles they have ended up with everything and you’re left standing there wondering ‘what happened?’”

How prophetic those words were to be!

ABANDON SHIP

Fast forward to today. Just about every major IR company in the world has abandoned what used to be called “The Japan Opportunity” and might now be called “The Japan Folly.”

The waning interest started when Caesars pulled out of the Japan IR race in August 2019 ostensibly to focus on completion of its US$18 billion merger with Eldorado Resorts. Later in February 2021 when Caesars withdrew from its interest in developing a Korean IR CEO Tom Reeg stated “You should expect that over time [our Windsor management contract in Ontario Canada] will be the extent of our non-US business” signalling a lack of interest in operating anywhere outside North America.

Despite this in September 2021 Caesars was named as casino operator for Clairvest Neem Ventures’ IR development in Wakayama although Caesars was quick to point out this was with “no capital commitment” – so it seems Caesars merely lent their name to boost the Clairvest bid.

Las Vegas Sands was next to withdraw in May 2020. Then-Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson simply stated “The framework around the development of an IR has made our goals there unreachable.” In August 2020 Wynn closed its Yokohama office with CEO Matt Maddox saying the company had been “pulling back its efforts in Japan since March 2020.”

In November 2020 Genting Singapore noted it was still interested in Japan “if conditions meet the group’s investment criteria.” It was the first time the company had felt the need to add such a qualifier. Genting Singapore was forced to withdraw from Yokohama after the August 2021 election of new mayor Takeharu Yamanaka who promptly cancelled Yokohama’s bid to host an IR honoring his campaign’s popular anti-IR stance. After that Genting did not actively pursue any other bid in Japan and then quietly dissolved all its Japanese subsidiary companies in late December seemingly signalling a complete withdrawal from Japan once and for all – or at least the foreseeable future.

In May 2021 Suncity withdrew from its Wakayama IR bid citing the COVID-19 pandemic expected further delays and uncertainty surrounding the Japanese IR process.

Melco Resorts also a victim of the Yokohama cancellation says it remains fully committed to pursuing an IR license in Japan when the “right opportunity” emerges. Apparently so far it hasn’t.

Like Melco Galaxy has not publicly or officially withdrawn but has effectively done so by not pursuing any Japan IR opportunity right now. Galaxy is known to be reducing its staff on the ground in Japan from a peak of over 25 people to just a single employee.

Mohegan Sun too withdrew from the process after partnering with the Oshidori bid in Nagasaki – a bid which lost in highly controversial circumstances with Oshidori crying foul and accusing the Nagasaki prefectural government of lying and corruption. In a December 2021 interview with IAG Mohegan International President Bobby Soper said of Japan “It definitely evolved much differently than many thought it would. The regulatory requirements the short term of the license – there are a lot of reasons it didn’t make sense for a lot of companies.”

MGM Resorts was the most Japan gung-ho of the world’s major operators. Under former Chairman and CEO Jim Murren MGM spent considerably on its “Osaka-first” campaign. IR investment numbers well north of US$10 billion were quietly whispered amongst industry insiders. But rivals Galaxy and Genting Singapore withdrew their Osaka bids in February 2020 leaving MGM as last-man-standing in Osaka and now last-man-standing of the tier-one operators in all of Japan. Murren departed in March 2020 replaced by long-time MGM executive Bill Hornbuckle as CEO and President.

Under Hornbuckle MGM’s interest has been more measured. In July 2020 the new CEO described MGM Resorts as “not all-in on this investment” commenting “We will only make this investment if we think it’s going to be prudent if we think it’s going to pay the kind of returns that we need to meet our expectations. There is a long way to go.” In January 2021 analysts at brokerage Sanford C Bernstein speculated that potential acquisitions by MGM Resorts in the iGaming space could result in the company either reducing its stake in a Japanese integrated resort or exiting Japan entirely.

Even if Hornbuckle has since reaffirmed MGM’s commitment to Osaka the days of tossing about US dollar investments in the eleven figures are long gone with MGM now estimating the total cost at JPY 1 trillion (US$9.1 billion). In August 2021 Hornbuckle told investors MGM was prepared for a much more manageable US$2 billion to US$2.5 billion investment split over three years from 2024. That investment is expected to be matched by MGM’s major consortium partner ORIX with a further US$4.1 billion to US$5.1 billion to be funded predominantly by debt but also potentially by minor consortium partners contributing up to US$1.8 billion.

In March 2021 Japan’s Minister of Land Infrastructure Transport and Tourism Kazuyoshi Akaba said operators would not submit applications if they did not think IRs would be profitable. Perhaps he wishes he could eat his words because that is precisely what has transpired.

So what happened?

Why did most of the world’s major IR companies give up on Japan? There are many answers. Firstly the Japanese government has not done a good job selling the benefits of IRs to the Japanese people. Unlike Singapore in the noughties where the government was able to change the public’s vernacular from “casinos” to “IRs” Japanese people still often refer to the proposed IRs as “casinos” and the two words they most closely associate with “casinos” seem to be “addiction” and “gangsters”. The average Japanese impression of a casino is more like a smoky pachinko parlor a Yakuza-run underground casino or something out of a 1990s Hong Kong gambling movie than the modern-day luxurious resort offerings to be found in Macau or Las Vegas. Supporting IRs has therefore been politically unpopular as we have seen in Yokohama.

There have been several scandals associated with the development of IRs in Japan. The most well-known was the infamous 500.com scandal which saw an online sports lottery service provider in mainland China bribe Japanese House of Representatives member Tsukasa Akimoto who was serving as State Minister of the Cabinet Office at the time. Akimoto was jailed for four years in September 2021 for receiving bribes and offering to bribe witnesses in his own case. Two changes of Prime Minister since Shinzo Abe started championing the policy of legalizing Japanese IRs haven’t helped. While Prime Minister Abe’s replacement Yoshihide Suga and his replacement Fumio Kishida are both from the same ruling Liberal Democratic Party as Abe each change of leadership takes us a further step away from the original IR champion making it easier to bail on the policy for political expediency reasons.

Almost every economic factor in the Japan IR model has gone against the operators. Just a few examples are the relatively high 30% gaming tax the imposition of a Singapore-style entrance fee for locals a gaming floor maximum limit of 3% by area effectively short license periods and the imposition of surrounding public infrastructure costs on IR operators. All of these have impacted returns in the operators’ financial modelling.

Further exacerbating potential returns from Japanese IRs is the recent approach of mainland China towards countries targeting its citizens for play in casinos. In February 2021 Japanese House of Representatives member Kenji Eda referred to the mainland China blacklist system restricting travel to foreign cities with casinos targeting Chinese visitation noting “… if we build casinos (IRs) in Japan we cannot have expectations that foreigners and especially Chinese tourists will be able to visit.”

Cultural clashes between the Japanese business style and that of the international IR operators have been revealing. Behind closed doors international operators refer to the “unreasonable expectations” of the Japanese while the Japanese grow frustrated at what they deem foreigner’s lack of understanding of the Japanese way of doing business. This may go some way to explaining why no major new international industry has emerged in Japan since the 1970s.

Japanese jingoism has also played a role. Some believe that Japanese animosity toward China means no Chinese-based company (including those from Hong Kong or Macau) can hope to win an IR license in Japan. There is evidence to suggest this may have affected potential operators Galaxy Melco and Oshidori all of which are based in Hong Kong.

In January 2021 Vitaly Umansky Kelsey Zhu and Tianjiao Yu of brokerage Sanford C Bernstein summed it up simply stating “The Japan opportunity has been plagued with delays … and we maintain concerns around the high cost of development required and the potential returns.”

Despite all the negativity three locations in Japan do remain in the running for the up to three licenses to be issued by the national government – Wakayama Nagasaki and Osaka.

WARY WAKAYAMA?

In June 2021 Clairvest was “selected” as the operator partner of Wakayama for its bid – selected from a list of one that is as all other previously interested parties had withdrawn from the process. A basic agreement between Wakayama and Clairvest was signed in August 2021.

Also involved in the Clairvest consortium is AMSE Resorts connected to casino executive William Weidner and Mario Ho of the famous Ho casino family in Macau. Clairvest has announced Caesars as their operator partner but Caesars has not committed to any of the JPY 470 billion (US$4.3 billion) claimed capital investment. Neither Wakayama prefecture nor Clairvest have disclosed any further details on consortium members project partners or funding. Clairvest’s entire market capitalization is under US$1 billion less than a quarter of the project’s investment capital.

There have been political concerns expressed at the Wakayama Prefectural Assembly particularly relating to the lack of detail around financing such a large project and not-so-cryptically questioning if at least one Prefectural Assembly member is “too involved” in IR development.

In November Wakayama Prefecture announced the postponement of scheduled resident briefing and public feedback sessions due to information supplied by Clairvest being deemed “insufficient.”

Worse still a Wakayama resident group has collected 20833 signatures calling for a referendum on the IR bid saying “there was no opportunity for citizens to vote despite the fact this is a serious issue for citizens.” The petition consists of more than triple the minimum number of signatures required to hold a referendum and is expected to be submitted to the City Council in January 2022.

In May 2021 Wakayama Governor Yoshinobu Nisaka suggested that the prefecture may opt against taking part in Japan’s IR selection process should it deem Clairvest unlikely to win national approval.

NAUGHTY NAGASAKI?

On 6 August 2021 Nagasaki selected Casinos Austria International Japan (CAIJ) as its preferred partner and just 24 days later the parties hurriedly signed a basic agreement. The development cost is said to be JPY 350 billion (US$3.2 billion) with plans to attract 8.4 million visitors annually an extraordinary number which seems impossible to achieve given the extent of historical inbound tourism to Japan and Nagasaki’s reputation of being “too far away” to visit.

The operator selection process in Nagasaki was particularly bitter with rival bidders Oshidori International Development and NIKI Chyau Fwu (Parkview) Group both controversially claiming Nagasaki Prefecture pressured them to withdraw from the process. In August 2021 an Oshidori spokesman speaking directly to IAG said “The Nagasaki Prefecture has no other option at this point than to lie to cover up its corruption” while NIKI representatives are on record as saying they “object to this process in its entirety” and that Nagasaki Prefecture “refused to provide any information in what is [a] very troubling process.”

The project renderings offered by Oshidori and CAIJ didn’t help to quell suspicions amongst industry experts. Oshidori’s proposal titled “The Sails at Omura Bay” seemed like a spectacular and inspired IR project an iconic set of buildings resembling shimmering sails encrusted with one hundred thousand lights twinkling in the night sky. By contrast CAIJ’s modest and square buildings failed to impress.

The Nagasaki IR site at Huis ten Bosch in Sasebo City has weak access infrastructure. There is no bullet train so visitors must endure a near three-hour slow train journey from the nearest major airport at Fukuoka. The drive from Fukuoka is nearly two hours. Sources tell IAG that CAIJ is expected to pay around JPY 15 billion (US$136 million) in infrastructure costs in the area surrounding the IR an amount more than the entire net assets of CAIJ’s parent company Casinos Austria International according to the last set of financial accounts seen by IAG.

CAIJ is yet to publicly disclose its source of financing and intended partners and as a result IAG understands many prefectural assembly members are questioning the entire project. CAIJ does not have any internationally acknowledged or experienced IR expert or executive representing them publicly in Japan.

A public comment period for residents started on 21 December and will continue until 17 January and this may generate additional political pressure. In December the current pro-IR governor Hodo Nakamura announced he will be seeking re-election in Nagasaki’s upcoming gubernatorial election to be held on 20 February 2022 but the national-government-ruling Liberal Democratic Party has in fact thrown its weight behind one of his opponents Kengo Oishi who is yet to declare his stance on integrated resorts in Nagasaki.

ONLY OSAKA?

Given that neither Clairvest at Wakayama nor CAIJ at Nagasaki have given any detail on how they intend to fund these enormous projects multiple times larger than the value of their entire companies and the grave ROI concerns expressed by industry analysts about the regional IR projects it seems quite possible that neither of them will be approved by a prudent Japanese national government. But even if they are execution will be a herculean task to be taken on by companies with no experience in Asia let alone Japan.

Many commentators believe only one IR will be approved for the foreseeable future the MGM Resorts property in Osaka. At least that proposal has an internationally recognized top-tier IR company behind it and is located within a major metropolis. The surrounding Kansai regional population totals nearly 25 million people – the kind of population base needed to support a multi-billion US dollar integrated resort.

In September 2021 Osaka confirmed the MGM/ORIX consortium as its IR partner – again from a list of just one applicant. The US$9.1 billion project is planned to contain 2500 hotel rooms across three hotel brands with 730000 square feet of MICE space and tourism facilities. It is now planned to open in 2029 but given Japan’s track record of numerous delays don’t be surprised if we must wait until well into the 2030s to see the doors open. The many construction issues include the complete lack of subway access and a soil pollution problem at the Yumeshima site.

So much for Japan IRs opening before the 2020 Olympics!

WHERE TO FROM HERE?

The national government’s deadline for submission of development plans from the three prefectures is 28 April 2022. The national government then has the right to select up to three locations. It can even reject them all should it choose to do so. There is currently no official guidance regarding how long the national government will take to make these decisions.

Most commentators agree that MGM’s proposal for Osaka should be selected. However if either of the other two locations are selected the Japanese government will be making a grave mistake. Given the inexperience in major IR development of the selected operators the scale of the developments for such small regional locations and the problematic processes so far either of these regional sites will end up as enormous white elephants.

Can Japan pull itself out of the hole it has dug for itself in its IR development process? Yes but it will require a major rethink. The Japan government should use COVID as an excuse and go back to the drawing board learning from the mistakes made thus far and re-writing the rules to make Japanese IRs a more attractive economic proposition to the international IR community. The fact that just one major IR company is currently in the running and even then in a much less enthusiastic manner than previously should be a massive red flag to Japan.

The question is has Japan’s leadership got the ability to be introspective acknowledge the errors made and completely rework its IR development offering? I very much doubt it."

And that raises the prospect of co-operation on chips.

Taiwan's investment plans in Lithuania are not yet finalized pending studies to be conducted by a team of Taiwanese experts within the next few months. But in an interview with POLITICO the top Taiwanese diplomat in Vilnius said nothing was off the table and that Lithuania could act as an inroad to the rest of the European semiconductor market.

""This is the first time for the Taiwanese government to set up such an investment fund"" said Eric Huang head of the Taiwanese Representative Office in Vilnius. ""When we study the possibility for semiconductor investment in Lithuania we will consider the question in the light of the whole European Union market because then it will be more sustainable it will be profitable.""

Powerful friends

Even mention of partnership with a powerhouse like Taiwan is remarkable. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) — with an outsize 54 percent share of global foundry revenue in 2020 — has faced pressure from many foreign governments to diversify its production. So far though Taiwan has approached the offers with extreme caution ensuring that only such strategic partners as the United States and Japan — countries that might come to the island’s defense in the event of war — get the chips.

Europe has felt a severe pinch from microchip shortages especially during the coronavirus pandemic with manufacturing strongholds such as Germany feeling pain in sectors such as auto electronics.

Some sense of proportion over the money required is critical. Taiwan's proposed investment is a drop in the ocean compared to what a full-scale plant would require. TSMC’s factory in Arizona which will go into production by 2024 demands an investment of $12 billion for example.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy9zY2llbmNlLzE1NDU5NzgvY292aWQtbWljcm9jaGlwLXVrLXRyYWNraW5nLWxvY2F0aW9uLW5mYy1kc3J1cHRpdmUtc3ViZGVybWFsc9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy9zY2llbmNlLzE1NDU5NzgvY292aWQtbWljcm9jaGlwLXVrLXRyYWNraW5nLWxvY2F0aW9uLW5mYy1kc3J1cHRpdmUtc3ViZGVybWFscy9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Covid microchip: UK startup says technology WILL be able to track your every move,"Dr Amir discusses the changes in Covid-19 testing rules

A Swedish start-up tech company announced earlier this month that it invented a scannable microchip that is implanted in people’s arms and can display your COVID-19 vaccination status. This digital implant is designed to be embedded into people's arms so your vaccine passport pops up when scanned.

While new in humans this kind of technology is very common for household pets where most of them are embedded with a microchip that reveals the animal’s medical history when scanned. For the many people that would be sceptical of the device the company assured that the implants are not tracking devices and are only in use when they are scanned. However Paul McClure the co-founder of a different scannable medical card called MedTag says other companies will be able to use the technology to track people. Speaking to Express.co.uk Mr McClure explained: “Basically the technology works on Near Field Communication (NFC).

“The chip is inert and is activated when an NFC reader is passed over it. “Most smartphones are now NFC readers and can read the chip. “So while the chip in itself does not allow you to be tracked in reality any venue which scans it can then use geolocation to record where you have been scanned/checked in.” Mr McClure explained that MedTag users can use this card to ""get medical info with the ability to send the geolocation to their emergency contacts.

Recently speaking at the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit Elon Musk shared what's in store for the mind-bending tech. “We have Neuralink working well in monkeys. We are also doing a lot of testing and confirming that it’s very safe and reliable and that the Neuralink device can be removed safely"" Musk said.

For Elon Musk Neuralink implant is a ""profound"" device for it could help many people who have suffered spinal cord injuries and struggle to perform bodily tasks. This tech could help them regain independence.

""We hope to have this in our first humans — which will be people that have severe spinal-cord injuries like tetraplegics quadriplegics — next year pending FDA approval"" Musk was quoted by AfroTech as saying.

Earlier Musk had hoped to begin testing Neuralink in humans in 2021. In classic Elon Musk style this didn't happen and the timeline has now been delayed.

The lesson here is that while Musk seems optimistic about the tech its utility and a pending FDA approval he has a history of providing unrealistic timelines. While we'd love to see Neuralink in action this year we'll just have to wait and find out.

The ultra-thin wearable monitors vital signs and is equipped with tiny generators so it never runs out of juice.

Wearable technology and smart sensors have become increasingly popular over the past decade but one of the challenges has been coming up with a way of powering all these gadgets without the inconvenience of using wires or batteries. Now researchers at Osaka University in Japan have come up with a wireless and battery-less solution.

The patches no bigger than a small sticky plaster could help doctors monitor the health of their patients on a daily basis. Researchers say the problem with wearable technology is the ability to keep them powered for long periods of time. This groundbreaking tech could change everything.

“Our e-health patches may be employed as part of screening for lifestyle-related diseases such as heart disorders signs of stress and sleep apnea” explains first author Dr. Andreas Petritz in a statement.

The researchers used what’s known as a ferroelectric substance which can power itself from normal movement — the piezoelectric effect. This is because the substance contains crystals that can be made to spontaneously have both a positive and negative charge. The researchers applied a strong electric current to a small amount of the material just one micron thick. The material was very efficient at converting natural motion into small electric voltages the researchers found.

These currents could either be transformed into signals for medical sensors or used to harvest energy. Multilayer patches could harvest up to 200 millijoules per day from a person’s natural movement if placed on a joint like knees and elbows the researchers say. This is enough power to monitor a patient’s cardiovascular parameters several times a day.

Also because the patches are so thin they are barely visible making daily health monitors less invasive and unpleasant. “We expect that our findings will assist in the development of other sheet-type sensor systems that can perform precise bio-monitoring when affixed to the skin surface” says study senior author Professor Tsuyoshi Sekitani.

The technology could even be monitored via smartphone or computer the authors say.

The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.

Samsung Profit Climbs as Hopes Grow for 2022 Memory Recovery

(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co.'s quarterly profit climbed more than 50% after chip prices stabilized and sales of smartphones surged reinforcing hopes the memory industry will emerge from its downturn this year.

South Korea's biggest company posted operating income of 13.8 trillion won ($11.5 billion) for the three months ended December missing estimates after it distributed special bonuses to employees. But revenue jumped a better-than-expected 23% to 76 trillion won. The company's stock climbed as much as 2% in morning trade in Seoul.

Samsung and rivals SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. are weathering a cyclical downturn helped by demand from servers as well as a widening array of products from cars to home devices. Micron last month predicted record revenue for fiscal 2022 thanks to resilient demand from data centers networking and auto customers.

Investors are also monitoring Samsung's operation in the central Chinese city of Xi'an which has been locked down while the government fights a local outbreak. While it's unclear how long that situation will persist in the city -- also a big Micron production center -- analysts say short-term disruptions might dampen supply and lift chip prices. Samsung will provide net income and divisional performance when it reports its full earnings on Jan. 27.

“Memory prices will rebound in the second quarter if the lockdown in Xi'an gets prolonged” said CW Chung head of Asia technology at Nomura Financial Investment. “And demand from servers is solid while PC demand is better than the market feared.”

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

Samsung's 1.4 trillion won 4Q operating profit miss vs. consensus may be partly due to a one-time incentive payment and also a lockdown in Xi'an where it has a chip plant. Weakening memory chip prices may also affect its profit in 1Q22. Yet its 23% sales growth in 4Q vs. a year ago may suggest positive sales growth may continue in 1Q coupled with the upcoming new Galaxy smartphone launch.

- Masahiro Wakasugi BI analyst

Samsung's foundry business fabricating semiconductors for the likes of Nvidia Corp. is also making a growing contribution to its bottom line after the global chip shortage boosted prices for system chips.

Micron reported strong demand for chips used in data centers and industrial machinery last month and also noted improving supply of other components is helping PC makers build more machines supporting memory demand. Price drops in the fourth quarter were less dramatic than anticipated with DRAM down about 5% and NAND dropping 3% according to Hanwha Investment & Securities.

Analysts had projected the industry downturn to persist through the first half of this year with double-digit drops for both memory classes. Sentiment changed after China imposed its Xi'an lockdown affecting production for Samsung and Micron's local facilities. Samsung's Xi'an plant capacity accounts for about 15% of global NAND flash output according to Hana Financial Investment. The company hasn't completely shut down the fab but has adjusted operations.

“If NAND flash shipments fall 6% in 1Q and 2% in 2Q due to adjustment in operation rates at the Samsung Xi'an fab the NAND flash market may not enter an oversupply situation and is likely to keep the supply-demand balance for six months” Claire Kim analyst at Hana Financial Investment said in a note.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnl1Z2F0ZWNoLmNvbS9uZXdzL29tbml2aXNpb24tdW52ZWlscy1vdmIwYi0yMDBtcC1zZW5zb3ItZm9yLXNtYXJ0cGhvbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OmniVision unveils OVB0B 200MP sensor for smartphones » YugaTech | Philippines Tech News & Reviews,"OmniVision has announced at CES 2022 the OVB0B– dubbed as the world’s smallest 200MP image sensor with pixel size at just 0.61-micron for high-end smartphones. According to OmniVision it is the first 200MP to offer 100% quad phase detection (QPD) technology for fast autofocus performance.

The OVB0B features a 16-cell binning capability for 4K2K video with 16 times the sensitivity. In low light environments it achieves 12.5MP performance with 2.44µm-equivalent pixel size using near pixel 4×4 binning. An on-chip remosaic enables 50MP at 24 frames per second (fps) and 8k video at 30 fps with 1.22µm-equivalent performance. The OVB0B can also output 12.5MP at 30 fps with 3-exposure staggered HDR timing.

The OVB0B supports CPHY DPHY and dual DOVDD (1.8V and 1.2V).

“The introduction of 200MP image sensor products for smartphone cameras promises to capture stunning details within images meeting the needs of smartphone vendors who are aggressively looking to differentiate their devices with enhanced cameras that feature high-resolution image sensors. We estimate more than 40 million image sensors with 100MP+ resolution are expected to be shipped to smartphone vendors in 2022” said Jeffrey Mathews Senior Analyst at Strategy Analytics.

Former world number one Day the 2015 PGA Champion who won at Torrey Pines in 2015 and 2018 will be chasing his first tour title since a victory at Quail Hollow in May of 2018 when he tees it up in the final group today.

Zalatoris who is seeking his first tour victory fired an eagle and five birdies in an impressive seven-under par 65 to join Day on 14-under 202.

World number one Jon Rahm of Spain who started the day in a three-way tie for the lead was a stroke back after an even-par 72 tied on 203 with England’s Aaron Rai who shot a 68.

Justin Thomas who shared the overnight lead carded a 73 and headed a group on 204 that also included Cameron Tringale (72) and South Korean Im Sung-jae (68).

Australia’s Day who has dropped to 129th in the world after a tough 2021 season marred by continuing back trouble said he believes he’s headed in the right direction.

“It’s been a long two-and-a-bit years not really being in contention or having a good shot at winning a tournament but I think overall I’m pretty pleased with how things are progressing swing-wise body-wise” Day said.

Day was two-under on the front nine with birdies at the fourth and ninth. He bounced back from his lone bogey of the day at the 12th with a birdie at 13 then stormed home with birdies at 16 17 and 18.

He launched that run with a 28-foot birdie putt at the 16th then stuck his approach at 17 within three feet of the pin.

At the par-five 18th he blasted out of the back greenside bunker to 11 feet and made the putt.

“Actually to be honest that back pot is a pretty difficult bunker shot but it was nice to be able to get that up and down” he said.

Zalatoris who finished runner-up to Hideki Matsuyama at last year’s Masters kickstarted his round with a “pretty awesome” chip in for eagle at the second hole.

He rolled in a nine-foot birdie at the fourth and a 14-footer at the eighth to launch a run of three straight birdies.

An outstanding chip at 11 left him a tap-in to save par and at the 13th he missed a three-foot birdie putt but he got to 14-under with a nine-foot birdie at the 14th.

“Out here you can get a little wobble here or there” he said adding that his birdie at 14 “kind of righted the ship a little bit because I was pretty frustrated hitting two perfect shots into 13 and walking off with par”.

Rahm got off to a promising start with a birdie at the second hole and after seeing a string of birdie chances go begging he rolled in a 38-footer at the ninth.

He stumbled with a double-bogey at the 10th and a bogey at 12 before clawing back a shot with his last birdie of the day at 15.

“I played great” said Rahm who won the US Open on the same Torrey Pines course last June. “I feel like I played a lot better than the score shows.”",,,

At Microsoft we believe that the cloud will power the work of the future. Overwhelmingly our customers are choosing the cloud to empower their people—from frontline workers on the shop floor to on-the-go sales teams to remote employees connecting from home. We’ve seen incredible cloud adoption across every industry and we will continue to invest and innovate in the cloud as we partner with organizations everywhere to build the best solutions for the new world of work. But we also know that some customers just feel that they can’t move to the cloud despite the widely embraced benefits.

With this we are glad to announce that we have built Office LTSC (Long Term Servicing Channel) for a limited set of specific situations: regulated devices that cannot accept feature updates for years at a time process control devices on the manufacturing floor that are not connected to the internet and specialty systems that must stay locked in time and require a long-term servicing channel.

We expect that most customers who use Office LTSC won’t do it across their entire organization but only in specific scenarios. The good news is that you can deploy both Office LTSC and the Microsoft 365 version of Office with the same deployment tools.

Without access to the cloud Office LTSC will include only a subset of the value found in Microsoft 365 Apps building on the features included in past releases. New Office LTSC features will include accessibility improvements capabilities like Dynamic Arrays and XLOOKUP in Excel dark mode support across multiple apps and performance improvements across Word Excel Outlook and PowerPoint. The next version of Office will not ship with the Skype for Business client app which will be available as a download in the Microsoft Download Center. It will ship with the Microsoft Teams app allowing customers to enable and trial this experience if they so choose.

Also with this the perpetual version and specifically Office Professional Plus and Office Standard will have five years of support (though October 2026) with no extended support and will both see a price increase of up to 10% effective as of 1st October 2021.

Note: this new version will be available in all Microsoft’s volume licensing programs except in Open License (L only option). However the price increase will apply to Open License as well.

(Mainichi/Hiroya Miyagi)

KITAKYUSHU -- A high-schooler in southwest Japan won the global title in the Microsoft Excel section of the 2021 Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) World Championship in November 2021.

It is the first time a student from Japan has been crowned champion at the competition where students from around the world demonstrate their expertise using Microsoft computer software.

Ami Nakazono 17 a second-year student at Fukuoka prefectural Yahata High School rejoiced at her victory saying ""I was able to display my skills in the competition because I kept working hard toward my goal.""

Over 200000 students including high schoolers technical school students and university students from 108 countries applied to enter into the MOS World Championship and between Nov. 9 and Nov. 11 2021 160 students from 33 countries competed in the final round of the competition which includes different sections for multiple Microsoft Office products. The championship took place online for the first time due to the coronavirus pandemic.

For the Excel division finalists were judged based on their accuracy as well as their ability to create reports using graphs and charts while gathering and analyzing data over a period of three and a half hours.

Nakazono commented ""I try to create material that anyone can easily understand straight away. Since I prepared so well I felt I'd do fine and oddly I wasn't nervous. The material which incorporated my point of view and experiences as a high school student might have been good.""

Since she was in elementary school the 17-year-old stopped by the computer classroom where her mother works as an instructor and naturally took a liking to computers. In the sixth grade she won the ""MaiPaso"" national typing contest hosted by The Mainichi Newspapers Co. and other bodies where participants compete while displaying their typing speed and accuracy. Nakazono said that this was an experience where she ""learned how fun it is to work hard.""

Shortly after enrolling in high school she missed the opportunity to join a club following her hospitalization for around one week as well as a temporary school closure amid the pandemic. As she was jealous of her classmates who partook in club activities she decided to try taking a certification exam offered by Microsoft which is a prerequisite for participating in the world championship and passed it in the spring of 2021.

""You hardly ever get the opportunity to put your skills to the test on the global stage. I didn't want to regret letting go of this chance"" said Nakazono who made the big decision to try out for the world championship.

Alongside her schoolwork she set aside one hour each day to study for the competition and acquire knowledge about patterns for many types of mathematical functions and graphs.

The high schooler who snatched victory also spoke of a new dream: ""I'm undecided on my future but I want to utilize my skills to help others.""

Here’s how it works

Microsoft could be adding a new smooth scrolling feature to its Edge web browser really soon. In the latest Edge Canary build a new flag called ""Boost screen refresh rate when scrolling"" has appeared and it is especially interesting as it will utilize the Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) technology to provide this experience. The description of this new feature reads:

Allows Windows to temporarily boost the refresh rate up when scrolling (provided the machine has a VRR panel and a supporting driver). This provides an overall smoother scrolling experience - Windows

Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) panels like AMD Freesync / G-sync Compatible and G-sync panels are those which can vary their refresh rates across a given range. Such displays do not have a fixed refresh rate output and hence can boost or lower the refresh rates through their VRR ranges to synchronize with the games or the contents' refresh rates as long as it is within that range.

Essentially this new Edge feature will leverage this technology to bump up the refresh rate when scrolling down or up leading to more smoothness.

The feature could work similarly to how AMD's Radeon Chill does. Chill boosts the refresh rate when the action is heavy and user inputs are higher but scales down the Hz when there is little or no user input.

The association representing Ontario pharmacists says roughly half of people looking to get a Pfizer vaccine are rejecting the Moderna shot if they are offered that instead.

""They may cancel their appointment. They may walk out"" said Justin Bates CEO of the Ontario Pharmacists Association.

""That's creating a significant challenge"" said Bates as pharmacists also have to deal with combative patients who want to shop around for vaccines.

Many people did the same thing last spring when they questioned the safety of Moderna or mixing vaccines during the rollout of second doses.

Now they have less choice in the matter because many public health units are reserving Pfizer for younger people because there's now a greater supply of Moderna. In Toronto Durham and Waterloo regions people aged 30 and up will only be offered Moderna.

Last fall the Ontario government recommended people between 18 and 24 receive the Pfizer vaccine due to a ""mild risk"" of the rare heart condition myocarditis ""out of an abundance of caution."" Pfizer is also only being offered to those aged 12 to 17.

Jason Chomik opted to get Moderna for his third shot on New Year's Day even though he put off two appointments before getting Pfizer for his second dose. He says the surging Omicron variant finally prompted him to make the move.

""If the numbers hadn't been climbing as rapidly as they are now I probably would have waited"" he said.

""I'm glad I got the booster but I'm still concerned around the long-term effects of mixing the vaccines.""

'They only want Pfizer'

Despite public messaging that mixing vaccines is safe as is Moderna many are still reluctant to get it. Aside from pharmacies health workers at other vaccine clinics are seeing this too.

""When they sit down in the chair they immediately confirm [they're getting Pfizer] with me"" said Allan Grill who has been administering vaccines in York Region north of Toronto and is chief of family medicine at Markham Stouffville Hospital.

""They only want Pfizer.""

Grill along with many infectious disease experts have long maintained the risk of getting infected with COVID-19 is far greater than any risk associated with getting any of the vaccines.

""Omicron is spreading like crazy and people are getting sick"" he said.

Even Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Kieran Moore made a plea during his briefing on Thursday.

""I too got Moderna as my booster"" he said.

""The latest evidence demonstrates the protection provided by the Moderna vaccine particularly for older individuals is very robust.""

More brand awareness

Bates said there's more brand awareness around Pfizer's vaccine especially since many got it for their first or second dose. He also said the pandemic continues to change policy with time and new research.

""People aren't used to seeing science evolve in real time"" he said. ""And changing public perception is the hardest thing to do.""

Toronto's Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa said the city is ""doing everything we can"" to make sure people are aware vaccines are safe and effective.

""In fact there are some studies showing a particular benefit to those who receive the Moderna vaccine and its effectiveness against the Omicron variant.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Reddit first announced that it had quietly filed for an IPO back in December and is now aiming for a valuation of over $15 billion USD. Its last private funding round led by Fidelity investments in August of 2021 had the company valued at $10 billion USD.

In an earlier announcement Reddit shared that it had made more than $100 million USD in ad revenue in Q2 of 2021 marking a 192 percent increase from its figures last year. “We’ve grown up in the shadow of Facebook and Google and pretty much every dollar we make we’ve had to fight for” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told The New York Times in an interview.

The price range and the number of shares offered have yet to be determined. Stay tuned for more information to be announced soon.

One would think that after Adam Neumann’s spectacular flameout at WeWork (WE) that he would be content to lay low for a while and count his millions. (Yes Neumann you got a golden parachute!) Well if you thought that then clearly you don’t know Neumann.

This week it was revealed (first by The Wall Street Journal) that the co-founder of WeWork is putting about $1 billion into multifamily buys around the country in places like Miami Atlanta and Nashville.

We have to give Neumann credit for one thing — he did exceptionally well when the market was good. And maybe that’s what he senses is going on now.

Because one could easily forget all about work-from-home omicron and everything else pandemic-related if one just focused on New York’s leasing.

The big daddy of the week was the announcement that Morgan Stanley is taking 400000 square feet at Fisher Brothers’ Park Avenue Plaza at 55 East 52nd Street. Now that’s the way to begin a new year!

But there were several other monster deals too. Touro College announced that it was taking a massive 243000 square feet for a new campus in … Times Square? (An unusual locale perhaps for a university.) The school has leased the third through ninth floors (with pieces of the first and second) at Rudin Management’s 3 Times Square. (At least the students will definitely get real-time lessons in commercialism live performance popular culture chain retail aggressive sales tactics and naked cowboys.)

Signature Bank (SBNY) added a whopping 168310 square feet to its existing footprint at Empire State Realty Trust’s 1400 Broadway bringing its total presence up to 280182 square feet in the building.

But even without the 100000-plus-square-foot whales there was a ton of other leasing activity: Global Holdings inked two new tenants (fintech firm Ridgeline Apps and communications firm APCO Worldwide) and renewed and expanded two more (law firm Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian and data security firm Varonis Systems) at 1250 Broadway for a total of 75000 square feet of leases.

Over at 817 Broadway the venture capita firm Union Square Ventures landed a 13500-square-foot lease. The law firm Glenn Agre Bergman & Fuentes signed a 27230-square-foot lease at SL Green (SLG) Realty Corp.’s 1185 Avenue of the Americas. And it wasn’t just offices that were moving either; Sprüth Magers the contemporary art gallery with outposts in London Berlin and Los Angeles inked a lease for 2234 square feet at 22 East 80th Street.

Speaking of Adam Neumann WeWork held on to a pretty sweet member this week: Current a mobile banking app provider took an additional 29000 square feet at a WeWork location at 620 Avenue of the Americas.

One can raise one’s glass to all this activity. And take the drink home with you. Because that was one of the new (or actually revived) initiatives that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul mentioned in her State of the State address this week along with proposals for an Interborough Rapid Express lifting state-imposed caps on residential density and revamping the 421a tax incentive for development.

As for leasing outside New York?

Well we were definitely bowled over (in a bad way) when we learned that a quarter of all office space was available to lease in Los Angeles as of the start of 2022.

That was per a new report from Savills which said that L.A. added about 2.4 million square feet of empty offices to its inventory last year. And the market saw 34 percent less leasing in 2021 than it saw in 2019. While certain parts of the city like Burbank are only 10 percent empty other areas like Miracle Mile and Playa Vista are more than 30 percent vacant.

But if we take office out of the equation huge deals are still happening in L.A.

For instance Deka Group just plunked down $54 million for a Santa Monica Whole Foods at 2121 Cloverfield Boulevard.

SoCal industrial is to repeat a cliché on fire. Like a five-alarm fire … or at least three. Walton Street Capital paid $70 million for a 182620-square-foot warehouse in the Inland Empire (alarm one). A fully leased industrial park in San Gabriel Valley just traded for $108 million (alarm two). And Rexford just spent $270 million on eight properties (alarm three).

Plus multifamily deals are still pulling in high eight figures like West Covina’s 200-unit Twelve31 Apartments which sold to investor Ron Nasch for $80.4 million about $37 million more than the seller Benedict Canyon Equities purchased it for back in 2016.

Say hello to my little deal!

The two-story Miami Beach spot at 728 Ocean Drive — the site of the infamous scene where Al Pacino’s friend Angel gets dismembered via chainsaw in “Scarface” and is now the home of a far less offensive CVS pharmacy — was sold for $30.9 million.

But that’s peanuts in comparison to Starwood (STWD)’s sale of Westland Mall for $149.4 million to Centennial Real Estate Acquisition which is more than any retail deal inked in Miami last year.

But this isn’t to say that Starwood is done with Miami; on Thursday the real estate investment trust picked up the Standard Hotel in Miami Beach for $62 million.

And Starwood isn’t the only national real estate outfit buying and selling in South Florida; L.A. private investor Chaim Freeman scooped up Beach Place a seven-acre 308-unit apartment complex at 17101 North Bay Road from Jamestown for $110.6 million. (Jamestown is happy. According to property records this is three times what it paid for the complex back in 2009.)

Turning to our nation’s capital

One could have almost forgotten that this week served as a grim milestone (the one-year anniversary of the storming of the U.S. Capitol) in the flurry of activity going on in Washington D.C.

Lincoln Property and Cadillac Fairview spent $82 million picking up the office that housed the Department of Homeland Security which they’re planning on converting into apartments.

In Glenarden Md. Urban Edge Properties laid out $193.4 million to purchase Woodmere Towne Centre a 712000-square-foot shopping center from Heritage Partners which originally developed the property in 2010.

Finally Thor is spending $42 million on West Gude Labs three office and flex space properties in Rockville Md. which the company is planning on converting into life sciences space.

Time for reflection

While you’re ensconced in your domicile this Sunday there’s plenty to think about in the still young 2022.

For your Sunday reads may we suggest three things:

First lenders are expecting continued growth in 2022 … along with some attrition of the weaker office properties.

See you next week!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2dlb2dyYXBoeS5jb20vY29udGVudC8wMDczMDUtd2VsY29tZS1lbmQtZGVtb2NyYWN50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Welcome to the End of Democracy,"We bemoan autocracies in Latin America the Middle East Africa Russia and China but largely ignore the more subtle authoritarian trend in the West. Don’t expect a crudely effective dictatorship out of Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four: we may remain as we are now nominally democratic but be ruled by a technocratic class empowered by greater powers of surveillance than those enjoyed by even the nosiest of dictatorships.

The new autocracy rises from a relentless economic concentration which has engendered a new and fabulously wealthy elite. Five years ago around four hundred billionaires owned as much as half of the world’s assets. Today only one hundred billionaires own that share and Oxfam reduces that number to a mere twenty-six. In avowedly socialist China the top one percent of the population holds about one-third of the country’s wealth up from 20 percent two decades ago. Since 1978 China’s Gini coefficient which measures inequality of wealth distribution has tripled.

An OECD report issued before the Covid pandemic finds that almost everywhere the non-rich share of national wealth has declined. These trends can be seen even in social democracies like Sweden and Germany. In the United States as the conservative economist John Michaelson put it succinctly in 2018 the economic legacy of the last decade is “excessive corporate consolidation a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1 percent from the middle class.”

This process has developed both in the tangible and digital economies. In Great Britain where land prices have risen dramatically over the past decade less than one percent of the population owns half of all the land. On the European continent overall farmland has fallen increasingly into the hands of a small cadre of corporate owners and the mega-wealthy. In America the largest farmland holder is Bill Gates with over 200000 acres while Ted Turner and John Malone preside over lordly estates of over two million acres each — larger than several American states.

As property has concentrated small-holders have come under increased pressure. Australia historically has enjoyed high rates of homeownership but the rate among twenty-five to thirty-four year-olds dropped from more than 60 percent in 1981 to only 45 percent in 2016. The proportion of owner-occupied housing in once-egalitarian Australia has dropped by 10 percent in the last twenty-five years. Morgan Stanley predicts that the US will soon become primarily a “rentership society” where Wall Street firms seek to turn homes furniture and other necessities into rental products.

The digital economy is similarly dominated by a small group of giant firms. These overlords together exercise control of up to 90 percent of critical markets such as basic computer operating systems social media online search advertising and book sales. No longer satisfied with controlling the pipelines the tech oligarchy increasing buys up old news outlets and “curates” the news to its tastes. It increasingly dominates mainstream entertainment too: the pending sale of MGM to Amazon is just the most recent example of its conquest and consolidation of the means of communication.

Like the barbarian princes who shaped the Middle Ages the new oligarchs have been able to seize their fiefdoms with little resistance from weak central governments. The pandemic accelerated this process; its lockdowns and restraints on mobility proved a bonanza for tech companies like Google whose profits doubled during the period. In this highly regulated environment the tech-rich have simply gotten richer: seven of the ten richest Americans come from the tech sector. Apple by some calculations is now worth more than the entire oil and gas industry. The already obscenely rich have become richer still. Jeff Bezos alone saw his net worth jump by an estimated $34.6 billion in the first two months of the pandemic while his company has enjoyed continued revenue and profit growth.

As executive compensation reached the stratosphere in Big Tech and finance small businesses face what the Harvard Business Review calls “an existential threat.” Experts now warn that one third of small businesses which comprise the majority of US companies and employ nearly half of all workers could ultimately shut down for good. Hundreds of thousands have already disappeared including nearly half of all black-owned businesses. Particularly damaged have been the small merchants along Main Street and those working for them such as restaurant and hospitality workers.

As Moore has faced challenges dished out by law school high-stakes litigation cases and competitive entrepreneurial competitions along with the destructive impact of breast cancer on her support circle the magic has still been with her.

Even during this present time of uncertainty for many due to a global pandemic that does not seem to be lessening Moore’s response is guided by her own magic which in this instance involves opening a new business in the city she loves.

“Energy is going to flood the space and we’ll watch what grows from having a collective group of individuals that are going in the same direction” said Moore four days before the grand opening of Parker Avenue in Rivertown the only Black woman-owned yarn shop in the city of Detroit.

A practicing attorney for 25 years and a self-described student of people for even longer Moore has added “business owner” to her resume to “positively impact socioeconomic and racial disparity” in Detroit. With a name that pays tribute to Dorothy Parker — the celebrated writer poet editor playwright and critic who was part of a famous clique that assembled daily for lunch in New York during the Roaring ‘20s — Moore’s shop offers all things related to knitting and crochet and more. And it is the “more” part of the equation which has the shop owner fired up.

“I am passionate about this business and what can happen when fiber-crafting women from all walks of life have a place to call home” said Moore who grew up in Palmer Woods and graduated from Cass Tech in 1985. “The pandemic has taught us that interaction is what makes us human and the shop is all about connection just like the yarn we knit with — we touch it feel it. When you get people together around this common activity they will see each other and have meaningful conversations about real things that matter most in their lives.”

Moore further explains how mere yarn can transform lives and enrich her city by telling a story about driving west on I-94 this summer. It was a route that Moore had become accustomed to traveling while checking out other yarn shops across metropolitan Detroit. But on this day it was the conversation that was going on in her vehicle among women she adores (Dondi Roberts Parker Joye Watts Mosley and Moore’s sister Sharon) which held her attention.

“Their love for knitting and their support of the business brought them together but in the car they were bonding about their breast cancer treatment spectrum and were laughing about things like chemo and diarrhea and throwing up and their boobs” Moore recalls. “That openness and ability to get all of that out was showing me how knitting and yarn have helped to sustain a lifelong incredible community for three of the most important people in my world. It’s so much bigger than string and stitching and weaving — it’s human. And that’s why I have to do this because other people need a community.”

Evidence of the community building that Moore spoke of could be found at Parker Avenue during the shop’s first days of operation. Throughout the day on Dec. 28 a colorful array of masks were worn by about 40 customers representing multiple generations and an even broader range of sizes. But more than their exterior presentations and physical stature it was the actions of the customers that spoke louder than words. Through the masks there was no shortage of animated conversation and laughter along with gentle spontaneous touching and hugs too.

“This is a gift from God” said Detroiter Karin Massey Brock who was describing her feelings about becoming the shop’s first ""Parker Purl"" a shop membership she was gifted that provides a special T-shirt birthday discount first dibs at limited-edition products and a “seat at the table” when decisions about the shop are being made. “I truly believe in supporting Detroit but definitely a Black entrepreneur. And the shop is easy for me to get to from the west side and easy for my 94-year-old mother to get to; she’s my traveling buddy and has taught me everything about knitting and she’s teaching me crochet.”

Massey Brock’s membership was purchased by Mosley who attempted to keep her kind gesture a secret before Moore made it known because Moore did not want to take credit. While the soft-spoken Mosley wanted to keep her generosity private she had no problem opening up about her hopes for Parker Avenue.

“We have some very talented and crafty people in the city so I’m hoping that people can come and share their talents with each other and know that any kind of fiber art is welcomed” said Mosley a 1984 graduate of Cass Tech. “And it’s not just knitting and crocheting; I know one lady is weaving and I’m pretty sure she’s interested in macrame and stuff like that. We’re even trying to get some men to come down. We just want it to be a wide range of people with different backgrounds that can come and express themselves with art.”

Mosley’s words brought a smile to the face of Jeane Moore (mother of Sally and Sharon) who was seated nearby. In close proximity to Jeane Moore were people dear to her including two daughters and fellow St. John’s Presbyterian Church members like her longtime friend Janice Howell. But Moore 87 explained that in her own way she was casting her eyes on the entire city of Detroit as well.

Inside of Parker Avenue Knits in Detroit on Tuesday Dec. 28 2021. Junfu Han Detroit Free Press

“I’m excited because Detroit is our home — born and bred here. And to have this facility Parker Avenue in my city for the people is awesome” Jeane Moore declared. “And we now have a way of bringing together much that will lift us all. I say feet to move and hands to lift and we will make it across.”

After speaking her peace which included explaining the historical and cultural links to yarn for Black people Moore exerted her motherly authority by summoning her daughter Sharon to speak. And the self-described “emotional member of the family” did not disappoint her mom when it came to candor.

“We say this often but it’s true — representation matters” Sharon Moore who like her sister Sally is also an attorney said. “It’s really a hard thing when you go into a shop and people look at you like you don’t belong. It’s like 'Did you get lost? Or are you here for a friend?' And the thought never crossed their mind that you could be the person who actually engages in this. So having representation really matters and having a place that embraces that at its core is very important. When we buy our products we seek out women-owned businesses and of course we seek out Black-owned businesses. So it’s wonderful to be able to bring that all the way through and say ‘Yeah these are things that my folks do and these are things that my folks know about.'

“And it’s also been wonderful to have a space where we can gather and where we can hang out and be ourselves and have those real conversations. One of the things about some of the folks here is that some of us are breast cancer survivors. I am still going through treatment but I am coming to the end of it and it has been wonderful to find other Black women that I can talk to about my experience. To find a place that says 'You’re welcome — bring your scars bring your wounds and we can talk about it. Maybe I can’t fix the problem but I can give you space to talk.' And it’s important for us to have welcoming spaces where we can do those kinds of things.”

Dondi Roberts Parker was so moved by all of the conversations that were going on in the shop during the afternoon of Dec. 28 that she called Sally Moore later that evening to find out what was said after she had to leave. But before her departure Roberts Parker also contributed heavily to the conversation including speaking about a knitting community bond that transcends race and ethnic identities.

“Through my second stint of breast cancer fortunately for me I was part of that community because the people that came out for me the most were a bunch of white Jewish women that I had met through knitting” Roberts Parker a 1982 graduate of Cass Tech said. “They came out they helped they provided food and meals and I never had to ask. And then when I lost my mom in March the knitting community rallied again for me. That’s why I tell people all the time that knitting is cheaper than therapy. The bond crosses boundaries and you’ll hear that as you listen to conversations today. It’s not just about the yarn anymore or the fiber community it’s about us being together as a group.”

The testimonials provided on Dec. 28 more than validated Moore’s decision to open a yarn shop in Detroit — and not a nail salon which had been her intention immediately after being selected as one of the Motor City Match (Round 16) cash awardees in 2019 where she competed against other local entrepreneurs with big dreams.

“After the competition because of COVID I needed to pivot and keep it moving” said Moore who also was a first-place winner in a business pitch competition put on by Michigan Women Forward in 2021. “The reason I found the courage to move forward with the yarn shop is because of my team who was smart enough and loved me enough to believe this was going to work even though they were dealing with a maniac.”

Descriptive words flow naturally from Moore. She talks about a transformational period during 2008 when she began “knitting ferociously.” Moments after that statement Moore describes a close friend in her circle as a “fiber-arts fanatic.” She even uses the word “crack” to explain how addictive purchasing yarn can be for people that share her passion for fiber arts.

And like a quilt pattern rich in color and texture Moore’s ability to vividly communicate her journey and passion through words has been essential to making her Parker Avenue dream a reality.

“When I go into a courtroom I tell six to eight people a story and ask them to believe me and that is what this entrepreneurial journey has been about for me” Moore said. “I had never run a business I just run my mouth. But the people that have given their support believe in me.

“You can look at a business plan but the entrepreneur is the special ingredient so I am the secret sauce. The plan for this business is something I know like I know my name. We’re not trying to disrupt but the beauty of diversity is to have other voices at the table and we’re just trying to show that life comes in all of these shades. We want to create a community that sees and accepts everyone where they are and that is what Parker Avenue is going to do.”

At first glance Singapore has beaten the odds having surpassed gross domestic product (GDP) estimates for 2021. But not everyone was impressed by the figures.

The city-state revealed that 2021 GDP had surged 7.2% reversing a contraction of 5.4% in 2020.

The growth also went beyond initial estimates of a 6-7% GDP increase by Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and marks the largest recorded growth since 2010.

However asset managers noted that Singapore equities lagged developed market benchmarks and that the strong GDP growth could drive up already high valuations.

Clara Cheong

“Despite the strong growth numbers we’ve seen Singapore as well as the broader Asia Pacific ex Japan equities lag versus the developed markets in 2021” said Clara Cheong JP Morgan Asset Management’s Singapore-based global market strategist.

“Most of the underperformance is attributable to the more stringent restrictions on mobility as the virus evolved and the ensuing impact on the service sector” she added.

One-year returns for the MSCI Singapore index were 10.8% as of November 30 compared with MSCI World’s 25.18% returns which covers large and mid-cap equity performance across 23 developed markets. The MSCI AC Asia Pacific ex-Japan Index recorded a paltry 1.89% return over the same time period.

Mercer Singapore’s wealth business leader Chong Chee Loong concurred with this view saying that “Asia particularly Singapore have been slower to normalise compared to other regions such as Europe and the US. This is due to the government’s cautious approach in order to not overwhelm our healthcare services with an increase in Covid cases followed by further tightened restrictions.”

Nevertheless business sentiment among institutional investors for 2022 seems relatively positive primarily due to the rising vaccination rates in Singapore.

Chang Hwan Sung Invesco

“Even though the Omicron variant has brought additional uncertainties Singapore is in a stronger position with higher level of vaccination rates now and we expect Singapore to enjoy above-trend growth in 2022 albeit slowing down from 2021” said Chang Hwan Sung Invesco’s portfolio manager for Investment Solutions.

Cheong echoed this view saying that as vaccination rates increased Singapore and the Asean region should be in a stronger position to continue to reopen.

Mercer’s Chong was more specific as he expects certain sectors to pick up.

“Overall we expect the impact of Covid to become less important in 2022. Once the Omicron surge subsides we expect continued normalisation and the economy to open up in the rest of 2022” Chong said.

“This will benefit Singapore’s aviation and tourism industries which have been heavily impacted by the pandemic in the last two years.”

Interest rate hike

With the Singapore economy now back in the black on 2022 GDP growth expected at 3-5% according to official estimates Asian institutional investors also expect interest rates to rise in tandem.

“Alongside moderately stronger core inflation (the growth) should support higher rates as the economy continues to heal. As financials make up more than 40% of the Singapore equity market higher rates should be supportive of net interest margins” said JP Morgan’s Cheong.

Invesco’s Chang expects the US Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates in 2022 and said they will continue to maintain their positive view on the Singaporean stock market compared to other developed markets.

“However we believe other emerging markets in the Asean region such as Indonesia and the Philippines can benefit more from the recovery from Covid-19 in the long term and recommend a diversified portfolio in the region” he added.

Chong Chee Loong Mercer

Meanwhile Mercer’s Chong expects banks to perform well this year “as they benefit from interest rate normalisation (with at least two 25bps rate rises expected in the US in 2022) and the potential write back of provisions made during 2021.”

He noted that the Singapore stock market is quite concentrated and weighted towards financial stocks.

Higher valuations expected

Singapore’s expected steady growth in its GDP could drive up company valuations which would make it more expensive to invest in even if it meant more stable returns according to Asian institutional investors.

“We note that the Singaporean stock market is no longer cheap and is now fairly valued given the macro conditions such as local inflation levels and interest rates” said Invesco’s Chang.

“With above-trend growth and elevated inflation levels we expect it to deliver a high single-digit total return over the next market cycle. And in the long term we expect a strong dividend yield of around 3%” Chang added.

JP Morgan’s Cheong agrees that valuations are high but the returns could outweigh the costs.

“With consensus next twelve months price to earnings (PE) trading around 16x which is about +1 standard deviation valuations are not screamingly cheap” she said.

“However we expect the earnings outlook to continue to improve which would have the effect of lowering the PE ratio as the denominator expands” she added.

She expects Singapore equities’ earnings per share growth to be around 35% over the next 12 months - a higher rate than the Asia Pacific region ex-Japan at 22% and developed equities at 18%.

“As supply chain issues continue to ease globally and demand remains strong Asean companies should be able to grow earnings and hopefully avoid too significant of a margin squeeze.”

As for Mercer’s Chong he feels that the overall valuations of Singapore stocks are reasonable compared to the wider markets in Asia ex-Japan and the rest of the world.

“Singapore as a small open economy should benefit from the continued normalisation of economies in 2022 compared to those in Asia which have been less quick to loosen restrictions” said Chong.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZG9sbGFyc2FuZHNlbnNlLnNnLzQtdGhpbmdzLWtub3ctbmlra29hbS1zdHJhaXRzdHJhZGluZy1tc2NpLWNoaW5hLWV2Zm0tZXRmLWludmVzdGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Things To Know About NikkoAM-StraitsTrading MSCI China EVFM ETF Before Investing In It,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://dollarsandsense.sg/4-things-know-nikkoam-straitstrading-msci-china-evfm-etf-investing/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZG9sbGFyc2FuZHNlbnNlLnNnLzQtdGhpbmdzLWtub3ctbmlra29hbS1zdHJhaXRzdHJhZGluZy1tc2NpLWNoaW5hLWV2Zm0tZXRmLWludmVzdGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25vd25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLWVjb25vbXkvY29tcGFuaWVzL2FydGljbGUvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItd29vZHMtamVmZmVyaWVzLWdyZWVkLWZlYXItZm9jdXMtb24tZmVkZXJhbC1yZXNlcnZlLXRpZ2h0ZW5pbmctY3ljbGUtYW5kLWluZGlhLXN0b3J5Lzg0NzgzOdIBqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25vd25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9idXNpbmVzcy1lY29ub215L2NvbXBhbmllcy9hcnRpY2xlL2NocmlzdG9waGVyLXdvb2RzLWplZmZlcmllcy1ncmVlZC1mZWFyLWZvY3VzLW9uLWZlZGVyYWwtcmVzZXJ2ZS10aWdodGVuaW5nLWN5Y2xlLWFuZC1pbmRpYS1zdG9yeS84NDc4Mzk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christopher Woods Jefferies - Greed & Fear: Focus on Federal Reserve tightening cycle and India story,"Christopher Woods | Photo Credit: BCCL

Key Highlights Current focus on the presumed coming Federal Reserve tightening cycle ECB continues to be much more doveish than the Fed Greed's Asia ex-Japan portfolio is now 39% invested in India.

In his latest addition of Greed & Fear Christopher Woods of Jefferies started with positive start to the year for equities especially in cyclical stocks across markets. Which turned to post the release of the Federal Reserve minutes causing fears of rate hike in the month of March against the earlier expectations of May. While considering the performance of growth vs value stocks the MSCI World Value index with 1.2% return outperformed the growth index by 4%.

Till Thursday this week he also suggested that financial repression is more advance in Eurozone where negative interest rates has remained for more than seven years and inflation in November 21 at 4.7% against forecasted 1.5% for Q4. However European Central Bank continues to be more doveish than the Federal Reserve as ECB projecting no rate hikes until 2024 and no formal announcement on ending of tapering. Suggesting ECB is still committed to its targets of nominal bond yields

In report he also shared returns GREED & fear’s longest running portfolio the Asia ex-Japan long-only thematic portfolio which gave annualized return of 19.9% since inception compared to 11.1% in the MSCI AC Asia ex-Japan Index. The portfolio which now focuses on the demand story in India has now 39% exposure to India with another 33% allocated to China Taiwan and Korean technology.

Considering the last quarter performance of the long-only portfolio for India launched last year has underperformed with a decline of around 6% against benchmark MSCI India’s decline of 0.1%. However it has outperformed benchmarks since inception with gains of 14.1% comparing to 13.0% by MSCI India and 11.5% by Nifty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcGVuaW5zdWxhcWF0YXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMDkvMDEvMjAyMi9tYXNyYWYtYWwtcmF5YW5zLWFzc2V0LXF1YWxpdHktdG8tcmVtYWluLWhlYWx0aHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Masraf Al Rayan's asset quality to remain healthy,"File photo

Doha: The asset quality of Masraf Al Rayan is expected to remain healthy and is expected to remain cost efficient according to a report by QNB Financial Services (QNBFS). Masraf Al Rayan’s merger with Al Khalij Commercial Bank and its Foreign Ownership Limit (FOL) increase to 100% should help boost Masraf Al Rayan’s weight in major indices such as MSCI EM and FTSE EM and contribute to increased foreign institutional ownership in the company.

Masraf Al Rayan had announced on November 30 the successful completion of the merger with Al Khalij Commercial Bank. Post the merger Masraf Al Rayan is the remaining legal entity which continues to operate in accordance with Islamic Shari’ah principles.

“Asset quality to remain superior as Masraf Al Rayan’s primary exposure is to the public sector; management has been booking large precautionary provisions (because of the COVID-19 pandemic) since 2Q (second quarter of) 2020” noted QNBFS in a report. “Asset quality to remain healthy as NPLs are strongly collateralized” it added.

Masraf Al Rayan’s merger with Al Khalij Commercial Bank is a turning point in Qatar’s banking sector which will enable growth for corporates facilitating landmark deals fostering SME development and lending and supporting prosperity for our private clients to manage and grow their wealth and for our retail customers to reach their potential. With over QR182bn in total assets Masraf Al Rayan is one of the largest Shari’ah compliant banks in the region. With a robust capital position and strong liquidity the bank is in a prime position to accelerate Qatar’s journey towards Vision 2030.

QNBFS expects bank’s earnings to grow by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.2 percent. “We estimate the bottom-line to grow from 2020’s pro forma QR2.73bn to QR4.44bn by 2025e driven by healthy growth in net operating income (resulting from cost synergies) and normalizing CoR” said the report.

Loans are estimated to increase by a CAGR of 5.3 percent in 2020-25. “We estimate loans to increase from 2020’s QR119.9bn (pro forma) to QR155.5bn by the end of 2025. We expect loan growth to be driven by the public sector” noted the report.",,,

Netflix is losing the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series as well as a few films beginning this month with three of the specials having already been removed from the streaming platform as of January 1st.

According to What's on Netflix three My Little Pony specials were removed from Netflix as of January 1st. The specials in question are My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Forgotten Friendship (2018) My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rollercoaster of Friendship (2018) and My Little Pony Friendship is Magic: Best Gift Ever (2018). The big removal however will be coming on February 1st. At that time all eight seasons of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic will leave the streaming platform. The last day to watch will be January 31st so if you were hoping to catch the series now's the time to binge.

In total that's a lot of My Little Pony content leaving Netflix but fans of the franchise might want to keep a few things in mind. First My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic has been removed from Netflix before. Back in August 2018 the series was set to be removed entirely though only several seasons were removed before they were all added back so this removal may itself also not be permanent. Additionally 2021's My Little Pony: A New Generation will remain on the streamer for the foreseeable future.

My Little Pony: A New Generation stars Vanessa Hudgens (Sunny) Kimiko Glenn (Izzy) James Marsden (Hitch) Sofia Carson (Pipp) and Liza Koshy (Zipp). Additional voice cast members include Ken Jeong (Sprout) Elizabeth Perkins (Phyllis) Jane Krakowski (Queen Haven) Phil LaMarr (Alphabittle) and Michael McKean (Argyle). The film is directed by Robert Cullen José L. Ucha and co-directed by Mark Fattibene. The film's story creators are Robert Cullen & José L. Ucha and Tim Sullivan and the screenplay was written by Sullivan and Gillian Berrow. Cecil Kramer and Peter Lewis produced the film. You can check out it's official synopsis for yourself below.

""The unimaginable has happened...Equestria has lost its magic! Earth Ponies Unicorns and Pegasi are no longer friends and now live separated by species. But idealistic Earth Pony Sunny (Vanessa Hudgens) is determined to find a way to bring enchantment and unity back to their world. Teaming up with open-hearted Unicorn Izzy (Kimiko Glenn) the pair travel to faraway lands where they encounter the likes of charismatic and brave Pegasi Pipp (Sofia Carson) and Zipp (Liza Koshy) and the ever-responsible fellow Earth Pony Hitch (James Marsden). Their mission is full of misadventures but these new best friends each possess their own unique and special gifts that may be just what this ponyverse needs to restore magic and prove that even little ponies can make a big difference.""

According to Netflix Personalization & Search page the platform currently personalizes users’ experiences in three ways: (1) the suggested videos and their ranking (2) the way videos are organized into rows and pages and (3) the artwork displayed. Netflix claims that its personified content “can fit the member’s current mood and context and surfaces some surprises that bring unexpected joy.” However sometimes personalized content makes users of the platform experience emotions other than joy. Maria Brinker (2021) describes an incident with a misleading personalized artwork that happened in 2018. The personalized cover art of the film “Like Father” came in two versions: featuring only white cast members and only black cast members. The cover image with black actors was intended for the users interested in stories with Black protagonists but the targeted audience found the film disappointing. According to social media pushback following the release of “Like Father” the black actors there ""had may be a 10 cumulative minutes of screen time"" (Brinker 2021 p. 88) which posed a question of “false advertising or of being duped into watching” (Brinker 2021 pp. 93).

Experience machine

Netflix is not just a conduit of digital media (Gillespie 2018 p. 7) but a platform. Netflix connects the users with the digital content but at the same time moderates it (Gillespie 2018 pp. 5-9). However Netflix does not have affordances to connect users to each other upload user-generated content or post reviews so in its case moderation takes the form of filtering or algorithmic personalization of the videos. Highlighting certain content algorithmically Netflix serves as the “arbiter of taste” for the platform members.

Brinker describes the algorithmic content personalization on Netflix as a “filter bubble” (Pariser 2011) – a “bubble” of past preferences where users are trapped in an “experience machine” (Nozik 1974) – an imagined machine that could provide whatever pleasurable experiences we wanted. Brinker argues that the current forms of algorithmic personalization on Netflix ""(1) create deceptive shared world illusions (2) remove or further retract what was previously shared world aspects (3) make it harder to tell if what we are seeing is personalized or not.” (Brinker 2021 p. 94)

Another concern in terms of Netflix algorithmic personalization might be the low priority of the user’s agency to make their own cultural choices. According to Ted Striphas (2015) “human beings have been delegating the work of culture – the sorting classifying and hierarchizing of people places objects and ideas – increasingly to computational processes”. Striphas argues that such a shift “significantly alters how the category culture has long been practiced experienced and understood giving rise to ‘algorithmic culture’” (p. 395). However Striphas emphasizes that algorithmic culture is “not strictly computational” because algorithms join together the human and the nonhuman the cultural and the computational (p. 408).

Highlighting certain content algorithmically Netflix serves as the “arbiter of taste” for the platform members.

The aim of my essay is to investigate the human side of the algorithmic culture based on the case of Netflix. What do Netflix viewers feel towards personalization algorithms? Do Netflix users feel in control of their film choices? How do Netflix algorithms help to generate “the moods affects and sensations” (Bucher 2017 p. 32) of its viewers? In order to address these questions I am going to use the concept of algorithmic imaginary under which Taina Bucher understands “ways of thinking about what algorithms are what they should be and how they function” (Bucher 2017 p. 30).

Bucher explains that algorithms are not purely technical. Algorithms are designed by humans and ordinary users interact with them on daily basis thus modifying the algorithms of the platforms (“machine learning”). According to Bucher “algorithms are not just abstract computational processes; they also have the power to enact material realities by shaping social life to various degrees” (Bucher 2017 p. 40) – that means that algorithms shape our cultural reality as well for example when Netflix personalizes our “Top picks” or cover art of the films. That is why Bucher argues that studying how algorithms make people feel is crucial if we want to understand “their social power” (Bucher 2017 p. 30).

Twitter impressions

In order to gain an insight into the human side of the algorithms I have gone to Twitter. The social media platform has millions of public profiles; its textual messages are not longer than 140 characters and it is possible to search for tweets using a platform-specific search engine. Bucher considers Twitter to be “a great tool for accessing ideas sentiments and statements about almost anything including algorithms” (Bucher 2017 p. 32) Following Bucher’s methodology I have collected tweets using a search “Netflix + algorithm” which people posted in December 2021 and January 2022. This is the period of winter holidays – the time when people locate most of their activities indoors and are quite likely to use streaming services for entertainment.

I found 71 tweets on the topic of Netflix algorithms and divided them into five categories: (1) tweets that express anxiety about “ruining” one’s algorithm (2) tweets that express surprise at the sight of strange recommendations (3) tweets of gratitude to the algorithm after a particularly good recommendation (4) tweets of dissatisfaction - usually a complaint about bad recommendations and suggestions on how Netflix should “fix” the algorithm and (5) tweets -reflection on the work of algorithms. Unfortunately my attempts to reach out to users who wrote the tweets in order to ask them interview questions (like it was done in Bucher’s research) kept failing so eventually I took a decision to continue my study focusing on the analysis of the tweets.

“Don’t mess with my algorithm”

In this category of tweets (n=12) people refer to Netflix algorithmic personalization as an object of value. The authors of the tweets mentioned deliberately “training” their Netflix algorithm to teach it how to recommend content that leaves up to their expectations. Purposeful training of algorithm involves self-discipline as well: sometimes users half-jokingly confess that they are refraining from watching a holiday comedy because it might be bad for their Netflix algorithm. Most of the tweets in the category however express anxiety about something or someone “messing with the algorithm” and a desire to protect their personalized environment from intruders. Those tweets are addressed to family members exes and even to complete strangers who have supposedly hacked into the author’s Netflix account and are using it for free.

Netflix personalization is not only valuable to individuals as a form of immaterial possession but it is also perceived as an extension of users’ identities and an indication of their taste. Despite the fact that Netflix does not make information about members’ film taste socially sharable some users still find it important to keep their personally “trained” Netflix algorithm in order as if their profile might suddenly be seen publicly.

“Netflix algorithm just trolling now”

The second group of tweets (n=7) in our study are the posts about odd or funny Netflix recommendations. Such tweets usually consist of a screenshot of the recommendation and an ironic textual commentary. Users express surprise bordering on indignation when they find a totally out-of-place recommendation in their “More Like This” section. Tweets of this kind often personify the Netflix algorithm representing it as some kind of a mischievous being.

“The Netflix algorithm finally gets me”

This category of tweets (n=17) is dedicated to the positive experience with Netflix personalization. Users express satisfaction with the recommended content and gratitude to the algorithm that brought these recommendations to them. Some users are happy with the entire type of content that they have discovered thanks to Netflix (e.g. K-dramas) some others appreciate that the algorithm has “finally” suggested at least one title that lives up to their standards. In any case users post their tweets of gratitude when Netflix manages to connect with them emotionally on a very personal level. For example one user found it very touching when in her recommendations she saw a film which was “formative” for her. Tweets of gratitude indicate that their authors tend to personify the algorithm attributing it human traits. Users assume that the algorithm “knows” them like an old friend and deserves to receive a thank you for a good recommendation.

“Fix your algorithm!”

This group of tweets (n=16) is almost the same size as the one about positive experiences with Netflix personalization (n=17). However tweets of gratitude to the algorithm are homogeneous in structure and have the same reason behind them – a particularly good personalized recommendation of content. Tweets of dissatisfaction on the other hand are very diverse: some users complain about poor recommendations some others say that algorithm spoils the series they are watching by showing cover art from new seasons someone else is annoyed because algorithms do not give priority to the shows they are watching these days.

In addition to a complaint some of the tweets contain a suggestion on how to “fix” the algorithm: for example apply better genre classification to avoid mismatches let the “Currently watching” shows pop up on the homepage normalize “returning “0” search results” when the content is not available instead of a list of unrelated titles. Quite often tweets of dissatisfaction with algorithms are addressed to @netflix account on Twitter.

“What does the algorithm think about you?”

The last category of tweets (n=19) consists of the posts of reflection about the work of Netflix algorithms. In these tweets people are either asking questions on how Netflix algorithms provide them with recommendations or post their own thoughts about algorithmic personalization (e.g. “Netflix algorithm is about frequency and rating not about quality of content”). Some users (probably more tech-savvy ones) analyse elements of personalization such as cover art and assess the work of the algorithm (“The Netflix thumbnail algorithm knows how to get me watch something. It’s not going to work in this case but A+ for efforts.”). Most of the reflection tweets however criticize the personalization technology and provide tips on how to cheat Netflix algorithms which include “search manually” “add weird ass sh*t to watchlists” “watch as great a variety as you can” and finally pay attention to “the world outside of Netflix”.

Algorithms do things to people people do things to algorithms

The analysis of 71 tweets on the topic of Netflix algorithms has shown that their authors express a whole range of different emotions feelings and sensations associated with Netflix algorithms. The study has demonstrated that members of the Netflix platform are emotionally attached to their accounts’ personalization. Users who purposefully “train” their Netflix algorithms are aware of their role as co-creator of the algorithm and their agency to tailor their Netflix experience. A “trained” algorithm is perceived as a valuable possession – something that should be cherished and protected from intrusion.

Many users also view their Netflix personalization as an indicator of their cultural taste and an extension of their identity– in this way algorithms influence people’s sense of self. Poor recommendations odd suggestions and wrong content genre attribution surprise the users entertain them or arouse their indignation. The tweets about Netflix algorithmic oddities with a screenshot of a recommendation are usually accompanied by an ironic remarque.

Users assume that the algorithm “knows” them like an old friend and deserves to receive a thank you for a good recommendation

Many tweets that took part in this study are an expression of joy that a good algorithmic recommendation provided to the users. However within our selection the number of tweets expressing disappointment with algorithmic personalization is almost equal to the number of satisfaction tweets. Users vent their anger and frustrations with Netflix algorithms and express their opinions on how the platform should fix its algorithms.

Lastly there is a relatively big number of tweets by tech-savvy authors who are trying to make sense of the algorithms: they inquire how Netflix algorithms work assess how successful their algorithmic personalization is and speculate about future changes in the algorithm.

Netflix personalization algorithms evoke a wide range of feelings in the platform's users. These feelings make people adjust their practices of using the platform hence changing the algorithms and algorithms in their turn make an impact on users’ behaviour. It is a recursive loop in which “algorithms certainly do things to people people also do things to algorithms” (Bucher 2017 p. 42) and that is why it is important to study not only the technical side of this force-relation but the human side as well.

Looking to buy Nike sneakers Adidas sweats Crocs clogs Polo shirts or Canada Goose parkas?

You’re likely to have better luck these days snagging them from their own stores or on their websites than at mom-and-pops and smaller chains.

These major brands and other top shoe and clothing labels are all cutting back on the number of outside retailers that carry their goods and concentrating their efforts on getting customers to buy directly from their own channels as well as a narrow group of wholesale partners.

The shift means shoppers will find fewer places to buy leading brands and also puts pressure on retailers that will no longer be able to stock highly-sought after shoes and clothes on their shelves according to retail experts.

Selling to customers directly allows brands to make more money control their prices and showcase products exactly the way they want in their store displays. They also can prevent their labels from being discounted too heavily which could weaken their brand image and pricing power.

“We are less interested in undifferentiated small players that don’t have particularly good service levels or in-store standards” Crocs (CROX) CEO Andrew Rees said on an analyst call in April.

By offering less stuff at wholesale brands can also hit the sweet spot for their business — high demand and tight supply.

Strategies to pull away from other retailers started well before the Covid-19 pandemic of course but have sped up over the last two years.

“Even if brands weren’t heavily focused on direct [sales] pre-Covid now they are” said Susan Anderson an analyst at B. Riley Securities.

In fact brands have used the pandemic to accelerate plans to grow directly through their own channels especially online. At the beginning of the pandemic for example stores were closed with no choice but to push customers to buy online.

Once stores reopened and customers pounced on new clothes shoes and wardrobes there was a huge mismatch between demand and supply. Brands had little if any extra merchandise to send to retailers and they prioritized feeding inventory to their own stores and websites.

Under Armour (UA) Ralph Lauren (RL) and others for example pulled back on sending merchandise to discount stores like T.J. Maxx — previously their options of last resort when they had excess inventory.

In addition to tightening up their wholesale partners and growing online many of these brands are opening new stores.

Some such as Under Armour Adidas and Crocs sell to Amazon but Canada Goose and Ralph Lauren have stayed away from the online giant. Some brands have been hesitant to sell on Amazon out of concerns they won’t have control over the customer experience.

Nike announced in 2019 it would stop selling on Amazon.

Nike leaves DSW and Zappos

Among big athletic brands Nike was one of the first to signal that it would cut back on the traditional retailers it sells to and concentrate on growing its direct-to-consumer business.

In 2017 Nike said it would focus its resources marketing and top products on just 40 retail partners including Foot Locker (FL)and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS). At the time Nike sold to some 30000 retailers.

Nike has since cut ties with many independent shoe stores and small chains as well as bigger names such as Urban Outfitters (URBN) Dillard’s and Zappos according to reports.

Rivals like Adidas (ADDDF) and Under Armour followed Nike’s lead by trimming down their own wholesale networks.

Nike is a top draw and if stores don’t carry it customers loyal to Nike will shop elsewhere. (The company also owns the Jordan and Converse brands.)

Nike is also DSW’s largest athletic goods’ supplier accounting for about 7% of the company’s sales in 2020. Last month Designer Brands (DBI) DSW’s parent said that Nike had shipped the last of its products to the company.

(Picture: Getty / TikTok @erikakullberg)

A lawyer on TikTok named Erika has given us all a gift: a way to get free shoes from top sporting brand Nike.

Of course this hack depends on you already owning a pair of Nike shoes but you get the picture.

In her TikTok video Erika plays out a conversation between herself and a Nike employee where she asks ‘Hi my shoe has a tear can I get a new pair?’

The employee (played by Erika) responds: ‘You bought that almost two years ago so there’s nothing we can do since it’s been over sixty days.’

Erika says: ‘I’m not talking about the 60-day return policy. I’ve read your terms and as long as it’s been less than two years since the manufacture date (printed inside the shoe) it’s covered under the warranty and Nike will either give me a brand-new pair or a gift card for the same value.’

Erika a finance lawyer reads the terms of conditions of various companies in order to save consumers money and get them extra benefits they may not have otherwise been aware of.

In the case of Nike the company’s official warranty states that items can be returned to them if they have ‘developed a flaw’ such as a tear in Erika’s case for a brand-new pair of the same type.

If Nike no longer carry the shoes in question then they must give you a gift card for the same value of the shoes which then can be used to purchase a new pair on their website or in store.

However in order to take advantage of this warranty clause you must return your ‘flawed’ pair of shoes in store if you originally purchased it in store or by contacting the company for a return if they were bought online.

Though this information is available on Nike’s website many of us do not read the full terms and conditions of purchase nor do we pay attention to warranty clauses making it little-known that this is possible.

Erika also has another hack for how to get a discount from Nike but you have to purchase your items in store to do so.

In the video she says: ‘I know that if I shop in store I can get 15% off. I just have to download the Nike app and show [the store employee] at checkout.’

Worth a try right? (Picture: Tik Tok @erikakullberg)

Though Erika has multiple Nike-related videos available on her page they are not the only hacks she has to offer.

Many of her videos relate to airlines and the benefits customers can get if for instance their flight is delayed or overbooked.

She also has several videos on how to get discounts for big brands get free books and movie tickets and advice on how to see through the ‘tricks’ by salespeople to get you to spend more than you should.

Additionally as a finance lawyer she regularly offers her insight into money and work-related matters including how to get a raise at work protect your money while in a relationship save money on your phone bill and how to get a higher credit score.

Her videos often end with: ‘Who taught you this? Erika she reads the fine print so I don’t have to.’

There are clearly many advantages to reading the fine print. Thankfully Erika is doing the hard work for us.

But it also illuminates an awkward reality.

Alabama has a booming container port in Mobile. Over the last decade it has been among the nation’s fastest growing and it has benefited from an ongoing series of expansions. Alabama also has major developments happening inland such as growth of a massive steel mill in Calvert the Hyundai plant in Montgomery and the new Toyota-Mazda plant being built in Huntsville.

The potential for in-state intermodal rail shipping with trains carrying containers between the port and Alabama businesses seems obvious. But as of right now almost none of the containers handled by the port are bound from or to Alabama companies.

The new A-USA corridor isn’t a new rail line. Instead it’s a collections of nuts-and-bolts improvements: Raising bridges adding sidings improving signals. Individually they would hardly generate any public notice aside from construction detours. Collectively though the work will open up existing rails to container trains that will flow between the Mobile waterfront and economic development sites as far north as the Birmingham and Gadsden areas.

In a time when stories about fleets of container ships waiting off West Coast shipping terminals have become commonplace and major East Coast ports have also begun to experience congestion it’s natural to wonder if Mobile could capitalize. That’s easily said but it will take some work to make it happen -- and the A-USA Corridor is a big part of that work.

“We are not cheering for anyone to have congestion issues” said Beth Branch Chief Commercial Officer for the Alabama State Port Authority. But as the situation has dragged on she said “We’ve had quite a number of customers look to switch their supply chain and use routing through Alabama and the Port of Mobile.”

STACKING THEM UP

You can hardly attend an industrial groundbreaking or ribbon-cutting in Mobile without hearing someone tout the fact that the port has access to five Class I railroads. The designation is based on scope of business: Class I carriers have revenues of more than half a billion dollars per year.

The Port of Mobile also has a container terminal operated by APM. Over the past 15 years its volume has been on a fast upward trajectory: A multi-stage expansion program by APM and the Port Authority has added more acreage to store containers more and bigger cranes and more dock space so that the facility can now service two 1000-foot-long ships at the same time. In 2016 APM opened an Intermodal Cargo Transfer Facility (ICTF) to transfer shipping containers on and off rail cars.

It sounds like all the pieces are there but it turns out you can’t take anything for granted. In 2020 John Driscoll became director and CEO of the Port Authority. Improving intermodal rail service was high on his list of priorities. While it was true the port connected to five Class I railroads only one was carrying significant volume in containers.

That’s still true in 2022. If you see a train carrying double-stacked containers westward out of Mobile you’re almost certainly looking at a Canadian National train headed across Mississippi and then north.

“The CN runs from Mobile straight up the spine of the middle of the country” said Branch. “The Canadian National has been a fantastic partner since the ICTF opened in 2016” she said. “They’ve really grown the business from Mobile up into Memphis and then Chicago.”

But.

“Right now there is no intramodal service via Mobile that serves Alabama on a Class I railroad” Branch said. The exception would be occasional and rare trains put together by CSX.

Shipping containers are made to be stacked. If a line can’t accommodate double-decker loads then a container training is running at 50% efficiency at best and that’s just not a competitive proposition. So while Birmingham does have container rail service it doesn’t come out of Mobile.

“Birmingham right now is served but it’s served in a way that when you look at the mileage and you look at the routing it’s served over Charleston it’s served over Savannah” said Branch. “It is inevitably going to be more costly from a couple of perspectives.”

Port Authority officials think they can make the case that a rail connection to the Port of Mobile will shave days off the transit time and dollars off the bottom line. But first that connection will have to be open for business.

Tuesday’s announcement from the office of Gov. Kay Ivey said that the A-USA Corridor plan calls for more than $230 million in investment. Phase I costing $71.6 million will enable container service from Mobile to key economic sites in Calvert site of a major steel mlll and other industry; McCalla south of Birmingham; and the Little Canoe Creek mega-site near Gadsden. A small fraction of the money $5 million is coming from the state. Norfolk Southern is putting up more than half and the remainder is to come from federal Department of Transportation grants.

Phase I work will affect “12 specific track signal and yard improvements on Norfolk Southern rail lines between Mobile Selma and Birmingham” according to the announcement.

“It’s crossover it’s upgrading and extending existing storage track there’s clearances” said Branch referring to the heigh clearances needed for the double-stack trains. “Those clearances are really critical because that’s what gets us the service between Mobile and Birmingham.”

Norfolk Southern tracks that will get upgrades via the Alabama-USA rail corridor initiative are shown in red.Norfolk Southern

Headroom isn’t the whole story said Rob Legge director of industrial development for Norfolk Southern.

“There are some clearance issues that need to be resolved and part of this project is to resolve those” he said. “But really you can’t pick or choose one piece of the project or another. It’s all part of a network.”

“We’ve got to be able to build longer longer trains” to add containers he said. “We’ve got to be able to move trains more efficiently and faster.”

That means extending sidings so that they can hold more rail cars off the main line. It means adding new signals and automated switches to “dark territory” where engineers have to check in with dispatchers to see if the track ahead is clear. It means other improvements to handle containers at their destination sites.

This particular Norfolk Southern line doesn’t hit Huntsville but the state’s fastest-growing city won’t be left out.

“That particular line runs from Birmingham over to Chattanooga then you have to make a left-hand turn to head to Huntsville” said Legge. “Our route does not head straight north through the Huntsville area. At Birmingham you either go east towards Chattanooga or west toward Sheffield. And then the line between Sheffield and Chattanooga Huntsville’s kind of almost in the middle of that.”

Norfolk Southern’s Memphis East line which runs from Memphis through Sheffield and Huntsville to Chattanooga connects to an intermodal terminal in Huntsville. It also serves the new Toyota-Mazda plant.

Legge said discussions with the state about the A-USA Corridor Plan go back at least a couple of years though recent developments have given them fresh impetus.

“We’re just trying to be a partner with the state being proactive and identifying ways to address the supply chain issues that have happened over the last 18 months or so” he said.

THE LONG GAME

The announcement of the A-USA corridor isn’t the only development under way. The port and a partner have been developing a new terminal that allows vehicles to be rolled on and off of ships. That could be an attractive option to Alabama-based automakers especially as rail connections to Mobile are improved. And the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has begun work on a project to enlarge the Mobile Ship Channel deepening it and in places widening it to allow bigger shiploads of containers to reach the port.

A year and a half ago Driscoll said that inland container depots would be needed to handle intermodal rail shipments and that establishing one near Montgomery was a key priority. A push is under way to establish one which would be served by a CSX line running from Mobile.

It’ll all take a few more years to come together. Legge estimated that the Norfolk Southern line will be open to container service in late 2024 or early 2025.

That doesn’t make the A-USA a quick solution to the supply-chain issues of the past year and nobody wants those to last another couple of years. But if nothing else the current situation is a lesson in why developments like those planned in Alabama are important.

“The throughput of a terminal depends on the velocity with which you can move cargo” said Branch. “And if you all of a sudden start backing up your supply chain you don’t have the workers to strip the containers in the warehouse in Chicago … all of a sudden that customer in Chicago tells you to hold those containers at the port.”

The ripple effect continues: Container terminal storage yards can become logjammed. The trucking operations that move containers around locally can become overwhelmed. Branch praised the operators of the APM container terminal in Mobile which she said hasn’t had to keep ships waiting.

A-USA is part of a long game. Why doesn’t Alabama have more container-ready rail lines? Because the port’s APM-operated terminal didn’t open until 2008 after years of effort by Driscoll’s predecessor Jimmy Lyons to find a partner to help build and run it. Up to that point Alabama was facing a chicken-and-egg situation where it didn’t have the chicken or the egg.

“Mr. Lyons really had a vision for this” said Branch.

Now there are a lot of eggs in the A-USA basket some of them more than 250 miles inland from the port.

Legge said that Norfolk Southern has invested several million dollars in the Little Canoe Creek mega-site taking advantage of the Growing Alabama tax credit program. Administered by the Alabama Department of Commerce it gives companies tax credits if they invest in approved economic development initiatives.

The program helps sites “that may have been passed over for projects in the past because of a deficiency” he said.

“In the past you would drive up to the property and see a lot of wooded area and you had to be really creative in your mind” to picture locating a manufacturing or warehousing operation there he said. “Today you can go to that area and see a very open cleared area that just shows what the potential is for that site.

“We’ve worked really closely together on economic development projects attracting new companies to the state or existing companies helping them to expand” Legge said. “Part of this is to create the capacity needed to support our existing customers and then have both Norfolk Southern and the state prepared to attract future industries that want to locate in the state.”

When it comes to making that case A-USA ties a lot of things together.

“We’re very excited about it” said Branch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWlucy5jb20vdHJuL25ld3MtcmV2aWV3cy9uZXdzLXdpcmUvYmFsdGltb3JlLXZpcmdpbmlhLWNoaWNhZ28tcHJvamVjdHMtaGlnaGxpZ2h0LWJ1c3ktY3N4LXNsYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baltimore Virginia Chicago projects highlight busy CSX slate - Trains,"PHOENIX — There is A LOT going on in terms of capital projects for CSX Transportation — enough that Ed Sparks the railroad’s chief engineer bridges design & construction — had no problem running well past his scheduled 25-minute slot Saturday at the National Railroad Construction & Maintenance Association Conference.

Rest assured the audience did not mind. For the contractors in attendance the 2022 projects represent potential business and the 2021 work reviewed by Sparks represents jobs well done. For everyone else they’re an insight into the work that is sometimes required on a railroad with roots dating to the founding of the Baltimore & Ohio in 1828.

One good example: the long-discussed Howard Street Tunnel in Baltimore along with related clearance projects which will allow double-stack container traffic to reach the Port of Baltimore.

With the lengthy funding and permitting processes complete a ceremony for the start of work on the 1.4-mile tunnel under central Baltimore which dates to 1895 was held in November [see “Groundbreaking set for Baltimore tunnel project” Trains News Wire Nov. 29 2021].

Contracts for the main tunnel project which will lower the track and/or modify the arch of the stone tunnel are expected to be awarded by mid-year with construction starting before the end of 2022.

“It’s the last main link on the core routes of our network that’s not cleared for double-stacks” Sparks said “and by 2025 it will be. … We run right under the street and there’s not a lot of cover there. And just to add to the difficulty there’s also light rail over top of us in that street as well. If it was easy it would have been done decades ago. It’s not.”

That’s a theme of several pieces of the project. Another is the related North Avenue Bridge where the CSX main line passes under the street of the same name. At first glance it looks like a fairly straightforward if aging underpass featuring stone arch masonry.

“What you don’t see is that inside what looks like a tunnel is a bridge that goes over Amtrak’s tunnel” Sparks said. “Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor goes underneath us; this is their B&P Tunnel “[itself a subject of replacement efforts. … So we’ve got road railroad and then railroad tunnel. And we need to get another four-plus feet of clearance in there.

“That should be easy” he joked. “A lot of smart people in this room and the companies you represent please figure this out because we need to get that done by ’24.”

Two other bridges have to deal with water mains and Sparks also shared a photo of eight other clearance jobs to be addressed as part of the southern portion of the project. “Those are all big deals but it kind of becomes routine compared to some of the other higher-profile projects nearby. And this is just all just for the Bayview South half of the project. We’ve also got the Bayview North half of the projects thought the remainder of Maryland Delaware and Pennsylvania.” Five of the eight clearance projects in that segment are expected to see construction bids awarded by the third quarter of 2022.

“The goal is to have achieved clearances in 2024 coming from the north from Philadelphia and the Port of Baltimore” Sparks said “and in ’25 getting through Howard Street Tunnel to get to the Port of Baltimore from the South.”

Other projects

Work is also proceeding in Virginia where CSX and the commonwealth forged a landmark agreement in 2019 to create separate freight and passenger rights-of-way south of Washington D.C. [see “Virginia CSX announce major rail infrastructure plan” News Wire Dec. 20 2019 and “Plans take shape for how Virginia-CSX agreement will reshape rail travel” News Wire Jan. 27 2020].

In all projects worth more than $3 billion are taking shape in Phase 1. CSX is taking the lead on five of those — a fourth main track through Alexandria a third track from Franconia to Lorton and three sidings — valued at more than $1 billion. The Virginia Passenger Rail Authority is out front on $2 billion worth including the Potomac Long Bridge a Franconia-Springfield bypass and six stations either proposed or set for upgrades.

The Alexandria main is in design and permitting and will be contracted out as soon as those processes are complete.

“As soon as we get notice to proceed from Virginia for the various parts and pieces we’re entering into agreements” Sparks said. “Keep your eye on Viriginia; there’s a lot going on in the railroad sphere.”

Efforts are also continuing to advance CSX-related work that is part of Chicago’s CREATE project most significantly the South Side’s Forest Hill Flyover (P3 in the CREATE naming system) which will address one of the region’s most notorious bottlenecks the cluster of diamonds where CSX and its Baltimore & Ohio Chicago Terminal cross the Belt Railway of Chicago and Norfolk Southern the latter of which hosts Metra commuter service.

“This is a big deal for operations in Chicago. … When it’s morning rush hour and evening rush hour you don’t run freight trains. You run the commuter trains.” This is particularly difficult for CSX because its 59th Street Intermodal Facility essentially abuts the diamonds. “Imagine running a hotshot intermodal train from New York to Chicago. You can see the terminal. You just can’t get there because it’s commuter rush hour.” That project will go out to bid in the first quarter of 2022 and be awarded in the second quarter.

Other ongoing CREATE projects include grade-crossing separation projects adjacent to the 59th Street facility; and Dolton Interlocking which involves C&O and its B&OCT Indiana Harbor Belt Union Pacific and NS which should go out to bid later this year.

Also to come: “an aggressive capital campaign” on New England’s Pan Am Railway if the CSX purchase of Pan Am passes muster with the Surface Transportation Board; a new intermodal container yard at 63rd Street in Chicago adjacent to the 59th Street terminal which should be done this year; and five siding extensions plus a project in Montgomery Ala. including both a siding extension and work on Chester Yard.

2021 in review

A number of intermodal projects highlighted work completed by the railroad in 2021. The long-discussed Carolina Connector in Rocky Mount N.C. is one example [see “CSX Transportation celebrates ..” News Wire Nov. 18 2021] but perhaps not the project most reflective of current conditions.

“It’s not a secret to anybody that the logistics challenges of the last year put a lot of strain on our intermodal networks” Sparks said. “The response to that has been a quick-to-market expansion where we could of container yards and parking.”

On example was Avon Yard in Indianapolis where a stub-end facility has been double-ended and extended with expanded parking. That project will conclude this month. Other intermodal work came at facilities in Savannah Ga; Bedford Park in Chicago; North Bergen and Kearny N.J. Northwest Ohio Memphis Buffalo and Nashville.

The railroad has also opened its new Tilford Transflo transloading facility at the former Tilford Yard in Atlanta and is nearing completion of a new storage-in-transit facility for Shell Oil in McKees Rock Pa.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3JvYW5va2UuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvaGlzdG9yeS93b3ltLXdoZW4tZGlkLXJvYW5va2VzLXNoYWZmZXJzLWNyb3NzaW5nLWdhaW4taXRzLW1vZGVybi1uYW1lL2FydGljbGVfZTc4MDVlZGMtNzE2MS0xMWVjLTk4YzMtOGYwZTEzZjY2OGYzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WOYM: When did Roanoke's Shaffers Crossing gain its modern name?,"“Learning” Leonardo da Vinci is reported to have said “never exhausts the mind.”

Maybe so yet the quest for easy answers is often tiresome. The response to that reality here at the answer desk?

We gave up the search.

Q: While researching my grandfather’s Norfolk and Western Railway mechanical engineering department career I have been stymied in tracing origin of the name Shaffers Crossing. To what or whom does the name refer? Is it a physical crossing or simply the name of a geographic area? Does it have anything to do with the old Jefferson Street pedestrian crossing to the railroad offices?

Jim Kadel

Bridgewater

A: Easy ones being absent we start with the question about the origins of the name.

These many years later explanations for the original name and a subsequent transition to a completely different yet similar-sounding identification are elusive and for some readers will predictably be unsatisfying.

In service of education and fuller understanding we shall strive undismayed.

Knowledge comes to us through the good graces and assistance of our friends at Norfolk and Western Historical Society and the Virginia Room of the public library.

Shaffers Crossing as now it is properly known has had a variety of spellings over the years depending on the communication medium. Perhaps one of the reasons for that was it was first known as Shaver’s Crossing. Before we try to clear up some of the labeling confusion geographic orientation is helpful.

Shaffers Crossing is generally considered to be that part of the Roanoke railyard centered on the two underpasses at 24th Street one built in 1919 the other 1920 said Ken Miller of the historical society. There is no relation to the long-closed pedestrian crossing at Jefferson Street downtown to the General Office Building.

In a 1977 piece entitled “A Railfan’s Guide to Roanoke” Abram D. Burnett and Harold O. Castleman Jr. referred to the name Shaffers Crossing as “generic” and described it encompassing the three functions of the facility: motive power repairs and transportation and switching.

By the writers’ definition motive power referred to the roundhouse coal wharf and water treatment and pumping station. The repair shop was there for “all but the heaviest repairs to freight cars.” Transportation and switching was administered by personnel working in a variety of buildings and support facilities along with the necessary equipment.

A map of the complex which appears to be neatly done by hand with no further attribution accompanies the article.

When the Shaffers Crossing real estate became railroad property in 1876 it was part of the John Newton Shaver farm and included a couple of springs that turned the area into what was described as a “quagmire” in a 1999 Historical Society of Western Virginia Journal reprint of a earlier report in a Norfolk Southern (the N&W successor) brochure.

The crossing of what had been the former Virginia and Tennessee tracks by the old unpaved Salem Road in the then undeveloped part of the city was what led to the name Shaver’s Crossing according to the Journal article.

So then how did Shaver’s morph into Shaffers? That question was suggested by a February 1938 article in the N&W Magazine.

“There is an argument going the rounds just now as to how the name of the railroad’s shop terminal now known as Shaffer’s Crossing got that way” the article read note the spelling. The writer went on to say they didn’t “profess to know” how the name changed and solicited assistance from readers. If such ever emerged the proceeds are at this point unknown.

The magazine seemed to take up the question again in 1951 in a T.C. Poole Jr.-penned piece provocatively headlined “What’s in a Name?”

The reporter went into vast detail about descriptions of the Shaffers Crossing facilities; capabilities therein; summarized an interview with Mrs. Mary G. Billmyer one of farmer John Shaver’s daughters about the history of the property; cleared up some apparent confusion that farmer Shaver was in fact that and not a blacksmith; and provided a portrait in words of the nearby Shaver homeplace.

After that there was not one word of explanation about the name change much less what happened to the possessive apostrophe. Mrs. Billmyer did express dismay at the perversion of the family name.

At which point is introduced a note of personal regret at my lack as a preteen of research and interview skills. My grandfather T. Glenn Cox spent a career as an electrician at Shaffers Crossing. He was a history buff and may have known something about the evolution of the name.

In any case it is accurate to report neither he nor the generations of his offspring were exhausted by the rigors of learning.

Tony Finau is currently playing the best golf of his life. He recently won the 2022 Rocket Mortgage Classic at the Detroit Golf Club. Moreover this was his second win in two weeks and we are finally witnessing his true potential. Furthermore he humbly dedicated these two victories to his family members who have been with him through thick and thin.

Tony has been on the PGA Tour since 2014 and registered his first victory in 2016. However there was a drought of around five years as he did not win any event until 2021 when he won the Northern Trust. But the Samoan golfer has registered two victories in two weeks and his fans and family welcomed him royally after the 2022 Rocket Mortgage Classic victory.

All of those deployments needed to go perfectly in order for the massive space telescope which was decades in the making to function.

The JWST has two primary mirror panels on either side that it will use to collect infrared light from the distant Universe. Each of them consists of three gold-plated hexagonal mirrors. Today the rightmost wing was successfully unfurled just one day after the leftmost wing was deployed. Now that both sides have been locked into place this completes the array of 18 mirrors that makes up the 21-foot-wide JWST.

The JWST launched into space on Christmas Day and since the full-size mirror was too large to fit on a rocket scientists designed it in a way that allows its components to fold something that has never been done before. Once the JWST reached space it began the precarious unfolding process. Earlier this week the spacecraft pulled off its most complex hurdle: the deployment of a sunshield JWST uses to block light from the Sun and keep its instruments cold. With JWST now in its final form scientists will have to toy with the mirrors a bit more to ensure that they’re aligned as well as continue to calibrate its instruments to get it ready to reveal the Universe’s secrets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvYW1lcmljYXMtZmxlZXQtYi0xLWJvbWJlcnMtYmFkLXNoYXBlLTE5OTE5MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,America's Fleet of B-1 Bombers Is in Bad Shape,"Here's What You Need to Remember: Round-the-clock operations took a toll on the 1980s-vintage warplanes. The Air Force twice in 2018 and 2019 grounded the B-1 fleet following mechanical failures.

Just seven of the U.S. Air Force’s 61 B-1 bombers are fully mission-capable South Dakota senator Mike Rounds revealed on July 30 2019.

The B-1 shortfall could weigh on the Air Force’s plans for a new bomber.

Fifteen of the swing-wing B-1s are in depots for maintenance. Thirty-nine aircraft are down for inspections Rounds said during a Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing for Air Force general John Hyten.

Hyten is Pres. Donald Trump’s nominee to become vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His candidacy is imperiled by a serious accusation of sexual assault.

Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota houses two B-1 squadrons. Others are based in Texas and California. B-1s for many years flew from bases in the Middle East for long-endurance close-air-support missions over Iraq and Afghanistan.

Round-the-clock operations took a toll on the 1980s-vintage warplanes. The Air Force twice in 2018 and 2019 grounded the B-1 fleet following mechanical failures.

“We were just beating the heck out of them deploying them deploying them” Hyten said of the B-1s in response to Rounds’ comment. “We had to pull back a little and get after fixing those issues. The depots can do that if they have stable funding.”

A dearth of flyable B-1s has compelled the Air Force to transfer aircrew to other types according to Air Force magazine reporter Rachel Cohen citing a Senate subcommittee report.

“The committee is concerned B-1 readiness does not have the priority and resources to improve B-1 mission-capable rates” the report states according to Cohen. “This is evidenced by fully mission-capable aircraft currently in single digits and aircrew being rerouted from flying the B-1 to other aircraft due to lack of B-1 aircraft for training.”

The Air Force plans to replace the B-1s as well as 20 radar-evading B-2s with a new stealth bomber the B-21. The service still is mulling how many B-21s to buy. “We’re exploring the force structure between the B-1 the B-2 and the B-52” Air Force vice chief of staff Gen. Stephen Wilson said at an event in Washington D.C. on July 24 2019.

The Air Force repeatedly has said that in the 2030s it will retire its 61 1980s-vintage B-1 bombers and a few years later also will retire all 20 '90s-vintage B-2 stealth bombers.

Meanwhile the service would upgrade 76 B-52s that first flew in the early 1960s and buy at least 100 new B-21 stealth bombers. The result in the 2040s would be a force of around 175 bombers composed of factory-fresh B-21s and 80-year-old B-52s.

""That plan has not changed"" Heather Wilson the former service secretary said in February 2019. ""We need a minimum of 175 bombers is what we announced last year” Wilson added ""and that they will be a mix of B-21s and B-52s.""

Heather Wilson's announcement raises a multi-billion-dollar question. How does the Air Force plan to equip the five new bomber squadrons the service said it needed as part of its September 2018 plan to grow from 312 squadrons to 386?

In early 2019 the Air Force maintained nine front-line bomber squadrons at bases in Missouri Texas and North and South Dakota. A bomber squadron typically has eight aircraft. The balance of the bomber fleet belongs to training units or is undergoing deep maintenance.

Adding five new squadrons could compel the Air Force to acquire around 75 extra bombers in addition to the 100 it committed to buying when in 2015 it awarded Northrop Grumman the B-21 development contract.

And the B-1’s readiness woes could force the Air Force to buy the B-21s more quickly as the older swing-wing bombers might not last into the 2030s. “The general consensus is we don’t have enough long-range strike capacity” Stephen Wilson said.

Wilson told the Washington D.C. audience he in recent weeks visited Northrop Grumman’s facilities in Melbourne Florida where he was “looking at the B-21.”

Northrop is “moving out on that pretty fast.” Wilson said adding he has an app on his phone “counting down the days … and don’t hold me to it but it’s something like 863 days to first flight.”

That would place the B-21’s first flight in December 2021.

Two weeks after its Christmas launch the James Webb Space Telescope finished unwrapping itself today delighting astronomers in the process.

The deployment of JWST’s 18-segment 21.3-foot-wide primary mirror marked the end of the riskiest portion of the $10 billion telescope’s mission.

It’s still more than 300000 miles from its destination a gravitational balance point known as L2 that’s a million miles from Earth. It still has to fine-tune the orientation of the mirror’s gold-and-beryllium segments and cool its instruments down to a temperature just a few degrees above absolute zero. But mission controllers at the Space Telescope Science Institute were able to tick off nearly 300 potential points of failure without a hitch.

“We have a fully deployed JWST observatory” Northrop Grumman’s Paul Reynolds who led the mission’s deployment operations team declared during a widely watched webcast.

JWST is designed to be 100 times more sensitive than the 32-year-old Hubble Space Telescope which is near the end of its longer-than-expected life. Once JWST begins science operations as early as May it should bring new revelations about mysteries ranging from the habitability of alien planets to the nature of black holes and quasars to the origins of the universe.

Today’s mirror deployment coming after years of developmental delays and billions of dollars’ worth of cost overruns was hailed as a signal success by astronomers in the field as well as NASA’s top officials.

“NASA is a place where the impossible becomes possible” said Bill Nelson the agency’s administrator.

Mark McCaughrean senior adviser for science and exploration at the European Space Agency harked back to Winston Churchill’s wartime aphorisms to describe the moment. “To quote Mr. Churchill now this is not the end” McCaughrean tweeted. “It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is perhaps the end of the beginning. Five months of cooling aligning and commissioning remain hard work for the teams involved before science begins. But today is a big step.”

It took two weeks to unfold the primary mirror — and JWST’s other components including a sunshield and the rigging for the secondary mirror — because the telescope was too big to fit in its fully deployed configuration inside the nose cone of the European Ariane 5 rocket on which it was launched.

The sunshield consisting of five layers of ultra-thin coated plastic had to be unfurled in space to protect the telescope from solar radiation in what was considered the riskiest part of the deployment. Then the left and right sides of the telescope had to be drawn up and latched like the sides of a drop-leaf table. The left side was set in place on Friday and the right side was taken care of today.

“This has been arguably the most challenging deployment program ever done by NASA” NASA mission systems engineer Mike Menzel said during a post-deployment briefing at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.

The mission team had made contingency plans for potential glitches including a procedure for shimmying the spacecraft in space if necessary. But none of those plans had to be used.

“It was not as easy as it looks but the easiness that you saw … is just a tribute to the folks” said Bill Ochs the mission’s project manager. “We went through what I feel now is the exact right amount of testing the exact right amount of engineering audits the exact right amount of tweaks to the design.”

Before launch mission managers said JWST would face 344 potential single points of failure. And because the telescope was destined to operate far beyond Earth orbit there’d be no opportunity to send out a repair team to fix any flaws — as was the case for Hubble.

Although the riskiest part of the mission is over some risks remain. The spacecraft will have to fire its thrusters on Jan. 23 to settle into its orbit around the L2 gravitational balance point and then settle into a routine for the years ahead.

“There are 49 single-point failures out of the original 344 that are not retired and will not be retired for the duration of the mission” Menzel said. “These 49 are typical of all missions — things like propulsion tanks.”

The good news is that things have gone surprisingly smoothly so far. So smoothly in fact that the telescope has enough surplus propellant to last much longer than its originally expected five to 10 years of operation.

“Roughly speaking it’s around 20 years of propellant” Menzel said.

Update for 1:10 a.m. PT Jan. 9: University of Washington astronomer Eric Agol who plans to use JWST to study the potentially habitable exoplanetary system known as TRAPPIST-1 had this to say about the telescope’s deployment in an email:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL3NjaWVuY2Uvd2ViYi1wcmltYXJ5LW1pcnJvctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The James Webb Space Telescope's primary mirror is “all deployed all together”,"The James Webb Space Telescope is now finally a fully deployed telescope. On January 8 2022 NASA made history by successfully unfolding the telescope’s primary mirror — the largest of its kind ever sent into space.

What’s new — NASA’s flagship observatory successfully unfolded the starboard wing of the honey-comb-like beryllium and gold mirror at 10:28 a.m. Eastern. The starboard wing is the final piece of the spacecraft to unfold from its compact launch configuration. The mission team confirmed the primary mirror is fully latched — in other words fully deployed — at around 1.18 p.m. Eastern on January 8. The latching process took several hours to complete featuring 20 motor movements and multiple checks along the way each of which represents its own milestone.

To do it the team first had to successfully fire 178 release pins — all 178 had to work perfectly to unfold the mirror. The final four pins were particularly critical as they released the restraints that had held Webb’s mirror in place during launch.

Thomas Zurbuchen the associate administrator at NASA described himself as “emotional” following the deployment in a live broadcasting Saturday. He added: “I fully expect to shave today.” Zurbuchen had held off on shaving his beard until the telescope was “all deployed all together” he says in the broadcast.

The space agency began live coverage of the mirror deployment at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Saturday. During the coverage while mission scientists swigged iced coffee and bopped to Anita Ward’s “Ring My Bell” NASA showed a simulation of the telescope as it deployed. This marks the last stage of a metamorphosis which saw the telescope emerge like a butterfly from a chrysalis once it is situated in its home at Lagrangian Point 2 (L2).

The unfolding via Twitter.

For astronomers such as Heidi Hammel an interdisciplinary scientist on the project who has been involved with the telescope since the early 2000s it felt pretty good to see that final mirror wing swing and lock into place capping an incredibly successful sequence of deployments that began right after launch on Christmas Day 2021.

“It’s just going so smoothly I think all of us are waiting for the first shoe to drop or something you know? So knock on wood” Hammel tells Inverse. “I think this just shows you that all the testing all of the troubleshooting all of the modeling that took so long on the ground is paying off.”

Why it matters — The James Webb Space Telescope now has its power navigation communication and light-focusing capabilities intact and in a position to do science — but we will still need to wait another five months or so for that.

One problem James Webb may soon be able to solve is a “chicken-and-egg problem” as Zurbuchen explained in the broadcast: Namely how black holes and galaxies evolve and whether their development is intertwined.

How Webb will enter orbit around L2 ESA

The James Webb Space Telescope: Journey to L2

The telescope’s long journey through space was preceded by an even longer trip through time beginning with its birth as an idea in the early 1980s. And while headlines during its decade’s-long development often focused on the many delays and cost of the roughly $10 billion space telescope the measured pace also ensured engineers had the time to test everything as much as possible.

After all no one has tried anything remotely like this telescope before. Without human hands in space to assemble it the telescope was built to unfold independently.

“This was a crazy thing to do to take this massive telescope and fold it up and put it in a rocket” Hammel says. “Normally you build a telescope and launch it as is. We’ve just never done one of these where you've got the mirrors folded up for heaven’s sake.”

This animation shows one of the mirrors swinging into position. NASA

The telescope is currently more than 600000 miles away — it has some way to go before it reaches its destination of Lagrangian Point 2 or L2 about one million miles from Earth. It will be far from human reach — too far for a repair mission/

There are still myriad small tests it needs to complete before it is safe to start scientific observations like:

Turning heaters on and off

Unlatching and then focusing all 18 hexagonal beryllium of the primary mirror

Tuning testing and commissioning all of the telescope’s instruments

JWST’s recent milestones— After myriad delays the observatory safely launched from French Guiana aboard a European Space Agency Ariane 5 rocket on December 25 2021. It immediately began the long series of deployments necessary to fully unfold into a working space telescope.

Within hours of launch the telescope had successfully deployed its solar panels high gain antenna and conducted the first of three planned course correction burns.

NASA later confirmed the launch and burns were made so precisely that Webb would retain more propellant than initially thought which could extend its operational life beyond the hoped-for 10 years.

Since then the James Webb Space Telescope has successfully deployed and pulled taut its five-layered sun shield which is essential for keeping the heat and light of our Sun away from the telescope’s exquisitely sensitive infrared instruments. On January 5 the telescope completed one of the most crucial deployments that of its secondary mirror without which the telescope would be effectively blind.

“I was so nervous about that all day” Hammel recalls. “But it all worked great!”

And now the primary mirror is fully deployed too. The telescope could have functioned without the starboard wing of the primary mirror had the full deployment failed but it would not have had the same light-gathering power or been able to see as deep into the cosmos. In this case it would have been similar to a person having a small scratch on their eye — you’d still be able to see just not as clear in some areas according to NASA engineer Julie Van Campen who participated in Saturday’s broadcast.

“These are all the big moves to get the telescope created into an actual functioning telescope” Hammel explains.

Whatever else happens astronomers know they’ll “have the full power of the telescope focusing light into the instruments” she adds.

What’s next for the James Webb Space Telescope

There’s still a lot left for NASA to do before JWST can start performing any science beginning with finishing its journey to and entering orbit around L2 a point where the Earth and Sun’s gravity cancel out allowing it to move around our star with Earth permanently at its back.

Hammel likens it to completely remodeling a kitchen. The telescope is now at the point where the new walls are up the counters and cabinets are in but the plumbing electricity and appliances still need to be hooked up and checked out.

“The telescope is now structurally complete” she says but “substitute photons for water and instruments for plumbing and we still need to get all those other things done as well.”

The James Webb Space Telescope is due to reach L2 on January 25 where it will begin a long “commissioning” period as Hammel puts it in a recent blog post.

The next few months for JWST. AURA / S. Lifson

Each primary mirror segment can and must be adjusted so that the mirror functions as a whole and then finely tuned to generate sharp images on the telescope’s instruments. The instruments themselves must be cooled to minus 388 degrees Fahrenheit and then aligned and calibrated. Proper operation and focus will depend on gravity temperature and the mirrors’ individual calibrations.

All told it will likely be sometime in the summer before the telescope can finally turn its eyes toward the universe.

“None of us are going to really breathe the big sigh of relief until we’re all fully focused and all of our instruments are demonstrating that they’re working” Hammel says.

Sway 1.7 is up to its second release candidate for this popular i3-inspired Wayland lightweight compositor.Sway 1.7 kicked off its release candidate phase in late December. Notable with Sway 1.7 is adding support for zero-copy direct scanout for better performance when rendering full-screen windows.Sway 1.7 also has better support for virtual reality (VR) headsets via DRM leasing support on Wayland xdg-activation-v1 support as some additional Wayland protocol work and various other compositor enhancements.Up to now Sway has hidden its NVIDIA driver support behind a ""--my-next-gpu-wont-be-nvidia"" command line flag. With Sway 1.7 that is being changed to just ""--unsupported-gpu"" for enabling the NVIDIA support. This comes with NVIDIA's 495+ proprietary driver stack finally uspporting the GBM API. NVIDIA's binary driver finally supporting the Generic Buffer Manager interface means greatly improved Wayland support with that API being preferred by more Wayland compositors -- such as Sway -- rather than the EGLStreams approach NVIDIA pushed along for years.

As for this Sunday release of Sway 1.7-rc2 there are various fixes -- including crash fixes. Source downloads and the list of fixes in Sway 1.7-rc2 can be found over on GitHub . Given the past release rhythm of Sway there may be another possible RC before v1.7 is christened but in any case look for the stable release within the coming weeks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtZ2VGb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA1MC11c2VzLWdhMTA2LXNpbGljb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia Uses Expensive GA106 for Cheap RTX 3050 But What's The Point?,"Being in control of a whopping 79% of the desktop discrete graphics cards (many of which are among the best graphics cards around) has its perks. Amid supply glut Nvidia can play with silicon parts it uses. It may have its advantages with the availability of relatively inexpensive components and we will try to explain why.

Nvidia introduced its GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card (the list of boards is here) at a formal MSRP of $249 earlier this week. Many observers thought that the company was using its relatively inexpensive and relatively low-power GA107 graphics processing unit (GPU) for the solution. Unfortunately this is not the case. According to Inno3D the Green company uses a far more expensive GA106 silicon for this entry-level product. Yet this could be a good sign. Let’s try to analyze.

Inno3D sent a high-resolution render of its GeForce RTX 3050 as part of a press release without a cooling system revealing that the PCB uses the GA106 silicon. Unfortunately we cannot say anything about other graphics cards with the GeForce RTX 3050 badge on them for obvious reasons. Still our humble experience with GPU companies tells us that everyone uses the same silicon at launch but it might change over time. Anyway Nvidia’s GA106 and GA107 are entirely different so let’s examine these differences.

The GA106 is a reasonably large (272 mm2) chip with up to 3584 CUDA cores enabled and an up to 170W TDP (the desktop version). The cut-down version has 2560 CUDA cores which overlaps with the fully-enabled GA107 graphics processor with 2560 CUDA cores used for laptops and has a TDP range between 35W and 80W.

It is a question for Nvidia which it is not inclined to answer publicly. However big OEMs want one software driver and once a company wins a contract it lasts for a cycle which happens to be a year in our modern world. So we can speculate that amid winning the high-performance early 2021 notebook cycle Nvidia has reasons to have two GPUs that overlap rather than having no GPUs to ship.

The good news for PC gamers is that Nvidia has two entry-level GPUs in production. The bad news there are miners scalpers and another bunch of people that will not let you get a GeForce RTX 3050 at its MSRP.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS10by11bnZlaWwtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA4MC0xMi1nYi1ncmFwaGljcy1jYXJkLW9uLTExdGgtamFudWFyeS_SAV9odHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9udmlkaWEtdG8tdW52ZWlsLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwODAtMTItZ2ItZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZC1vbi0xMXRoLWphbnVhcnkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA To Unveil GeForce RTX 3080 12 GB Graphics Card on 11th January,"The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 12 GB graphics card wasn't shown at CES 2022 but it is real and headed for an unveil next week.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 12 GB Graphics Card To Be Unveiled Next Week: More Memory & More Cores

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 12 GB was indeed planned for an unveil for CES but it was decided at the last minute to change that plan similar to how the RTX 3070 Ti 16 GB was pushed back from its original 17th December unveil. Now based on the information we have from our sources the card will be unveiled next week on 11th January at 6 AM PST. There's no word on pricing and availability yet but we have heard that pre-orders or even sales will commence the same day.

NVIDIA RTX 3080 12 GB Graphics Card - What To Expect From The Latest Ampere

For the GeForce RTX 3080 12 GB NVIDIA is expected to have enabled a total of 70 SM units which results in a total of 8960 CUDA cores a 3% increase over the standard RTX 3080. In addition to the CUDA cores NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 also comes packed with next-generation RT (Ray-Tracing) cores Tensor cores and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units. The card is suggested to have a TDP of 350W.

In terms of memory the updated GeForce RTX 3080 comes packed with 12 GB of memory and that too is the next-generation GDDR6X design. With Micron's latest and greatest graphics memory dies the RTX 3080 can deliver GDDR6X memory speeds of 19.0 Gbps. That along with a bus interface of 384-bit will deliver a cumulative bandwidth of 912 GB/s or a 20% increase over the 10 GB variant.

The reception of this card mostly depends on its pricing. While the MSRP of $699 US was never true for the GeForce RTX 3080 the same can be expected for the 12 GB variant. It will slide between the RTX 3080 10 GB and RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB graphics card so expect around $899-$999 US as an MSRP & realistic pricing should be expected over $1500 US. As for performance the card may end up being really close to the RTX 3080 Ti at a lower price point.

Pricing and availability

Neither of these graphics cards are available just yet but they’re coming down the pipe in short order. The Nvidia RTX 3050 is slated to release on January 27 with a recommended retail price of $249. The AMD RX 6500 XT is coming a little sooner with a release date of January 19.

Its recommended price of just $199 makes it the notably cheaper GPU although that may not be the case in all territories. The European retail price for the 6500 XT has already been inflated to the equivalent of $340 so we’ll need to see what these cards actually retail for when they release.

Performance

We don’t have any third-party testing for these cards just yet so there is no definitive way to know how performative either of these cards are. What we can do though is look at the specifications and at the first-party comparative results released by both AMD and Nvidia at CES 2022 and make a relative estimate of how a head-to-head battle between these two cards would shake out.

Both the RTX 3050 and RX 6500 XT are designed to be 1080p graphics cards replacing older 1080p standouts like the GTX 1650 and the RX 570/580. Nvidia’s testing showed the RTX 3050 as being more than capable of delivering 60-plus frames per second (fps) in a number of major games including F1 2021 Control and Doom Eternal. But in each case that was with deep learning super sampling (DLSS) enabled which doesn’t give us a clear idea of performance because older cards like the GTX 1650 can’t use that upscaling technology and not every game supports it.

In AMD’s benchmarks it showed the RX 6500 XT as being a somewhat arbitrary 23% to 59% faster than the GTX 1650 in games like Age of Empires 4 Apex Legends and Resident Evil: Village. That’s good but without actual frame rates it doesn’t tell us much.

Looking at the specifications the RTX 3050 should have a major advantage when it comes to enabling advanced visual settings thanks to having double the GDDR6 memory. We don’t know its bandwidth yet but it should be higher than that of the RX 6500 XT though the Infinity Cache there may help AMD close the gap as it has done with some of its higher-end RDNA 2 graphics cards.

The 6500 XT also has a massive clock speed advantage over the RTX 3050 which could also offer competitive performance with the Nvidia GPU.

Considering where the companies have priced these cards it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the RTX 3050 be the slightly more powerful card with AMD nipping at its heels and even surpassing it in some games. We’ll need to see some unbiased real-world testing to know for sure.

Upscaling and ray tracing

Both graphics cards support an optional upscaling technology to improve performance in supporting games. The RTX 3050 has Nvidia’s Tensor Cores to let you use DLSS for impressive performance gains in select games which can make quite a difference — especially when you’re gaming on an entry-level card like this.

The RX 6500 XT doesn’t have any dedicated hardware to upscale in-game visuals but it can use AMD’s Fidelity FX Super Resolution in select games — a technology we’ve been quite impressed with. The RTX 3050 can use it too however with some games even offering the option of both FSR and DLSS to choose from.

Both cards also support ray tracing although you’re unlikely to use it in any grand capacity as even with dedicated hardware acceleration it’s going to mean a big performance hit especially the with weaker accelerators in the 6500 XT. Still having the option is nice and as games get better at implementing it being able to turn it on for gameplay improvements even at the cost of frame rate is nice to have.

Interfaces and media encoding

One area of concern with the 6500 XT at this untested prerelease stage of its life cycle is the limited PCIE x4 interface. While this shouldn’t matter in newer motherboards with PCIE 4 support in older PCIE 3 boards it could represent a constraint on bandwidth that could limit overall performance. Considering gamers with older PCs are the likely target audience for a card like this it seems like a puzzling design choice from AMD.

In comparison the RTX 3050 can take full advantage of PCIE x16 interfaces. It won’t use anything close to the maximum bandwidth but there won’t be a bottleneck at the slot even on older motherboards.

AMD also made the surprising choice to disable H264/HEVC encoding and AV1 decoding on the 6500 XT. That could cause some problems with streaming at higher resolutions and will limit the ability for it to work with Oculus Quest headsets. Those aren’t huge deal breakers for a card targeting 1080p gaming but it’s a shame to see such standard features stripped from the card.

The 6500 XT isn’t great but it might be all you can get

Out of these two cards the RTX 3050 looks likely to be the more powerful when it launches. Everything from its more expansive memory configuration to its ability to use DLSS and its higher price tag suggests it should be the more powerful GPU. However its 8GB of RAM might be its downfall because that lets cryptocurrency miners use it to mine Etherum. The limited 4GB of GDDR6 on the 6500 XT makes it nonviable for that which may make it far easier to obtain.

We still don’t know if either of these cards will be produced in enough volume to thwart scalpers but AMD has made bold claims about providing strong volume for this entry-level GPU. If the $200 price is relatively accurate it’s likely to be a very popular card among gamers. If they can get their hands on it it could be a decent buy at a time where getting hold of any card at a reasonable price isn’t easy.

The RTX 3050 should be the better card but it might lose out due to its own higher specs.

NVIDIA RTX 3080 12GB with more cores and memory to be announced next week

Wccftech claims to know the announcement date of NVIDIA’s new RTX 30 GPU.

Next week on January 11th at 6 AM PST NVIDIA is to announce its first ‘refresh’ of the RTX 30 series. It is not a SUPER refresh or a new Ti variant but relatively a small update to the existing RTX 3080 SKU.

According to the leaked specs GeForce RTX 3080 12GB is to feature not only 2GB more than the original 10GB model but also a wider memory bus which as result increases maximum bandwidth to 912 GB/s. Furthermore a new GA102 GPU featuring 8960 CUDA cores is to be adopted by this variant increasing the core count by 3% over the existing model.

At this point in time it is unclear why NVIDIA is releasing a newer RTX 3080 model or what will happen to the existing 10GB version. What is clear is that NVIDIA is now to announce yet another high wattage GPU in a span of two weeks. The company already revealed its RTX 3090 Ti flagship GPU with 450W TDP this Tuesday and will now add 350W TDP RTX 3080 12GB.

The RTX 3090 Ti is to launch on the same date as the entry-level RTX 3050 which is January 27th. The on-shelf date for RTX 3080 12GB is not yet known but we will make sure to report on it as soon as we learn it. Wccftech claims that on January 11th retailers may begin taking preorders for this new model however that is also yet to be confirmed.

And don’t forget about the giant stuffed spuds.

McAlister’s Deli a fast casual chain of restaurants founded in 1989 will add Adrian to its list of Michigan establishments when it opens at 10 a.m. Monday. There are currently four McAlister’s locations in Michigan according to Madison Stevens public relations specialist for Focus Brands Restaurants which owns McAlister’s Deli along with other subsidiaries such as Cinnabon Moe’s Southwest Grill Auntie Anne’s and Jamba brands. Adrian’s McAlister’s 1001 S. Main St. will be the company’s fifth Michigan establishment. It is located across the street from Golden Wok and Taco Bell and next door to O’Reilly Auto Parts.

“Our restaurant locations in Flint and Owosso have become a really good market for us” Stevens said. “We are trying to grow into those markets where we have the most fans.”

The other two McAlister’s locations in Michigan are in Lansing and Wyoming. The restaurant’s largest market according to its website www.mcalistersdeli.com is Texas with 95 locations. Indiana is second with 44 establishments. There are a total of 516 McAlister’s Deli locations in the United States.

“We are ready to expand McAlister’s Deli to the city of Adrian and to welcome the community into our restaurant” Mike Moss director of operations at McAlister’s Deli Company said in a news release.

The Adrian restaurant will be open daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Sunday. The restaurant can be contacted at 517-366-2276 or by searching for the McAlister’s Deli-Adrian Facebook page.

The restaurant is widely known for its handcrafted sandwiches fresh salads giant stuffed spuds and its McAlister’s Deli Famous Sweet Tea which Stevens said is a “delicious beverage to drink anytime of the year but especially on a hot summer day.”

A staple sandwich of the restaurant is the McAlister’s Club featuring smoked turkey black forest ham bacon sharp cheddar and Swiss cheeses spring mix lettuce tomato mayo and McAlister’s honey mustard on wheat bread.

Made from Idaho Russet potatoes McAlister’s giant spuds come in five varieties including the Justaspud Black Angus Roast Beef Chipotle Chicken and Bacon Veggie and Spud Max which is a baked potato topped with ham turkey bacon cheddar-jack cheese green onions black olives and sour cream.

January is recognized as National Soup Month and Stevens said McAlister’s will be celebrating the month by promoting its soup options which include chicken and dumplings broccoli and cheddar country potato chicken tortilla chili and veggie chili.

McAlister’s rewards members from Jan. 3-18 will be able to receive a free bread bowl with the purchase of a bowl of soup in the McAlister’s app or in store. New rewards members who download the McAlister’s app will be eligible for a free iced tea.

Earlier this month the Leesburg City Commission approved the 1088 acre development. The approval was not without controversy as residents raised concerns about the development’s impact on area infrastructure.

You can see the plan at this link: whispering_hills_phase_plan_pg1

Construction Journal detailed the Whispering Hills plan which calls for 2942 residential units to be constructed. Plans call for 2302 units which will be single-family homes and townhomes with an additional 640 multifamily units. The plan also calls for 451000 square feet of commercial space which would include medical and business offices as well as a hotel. The first phase will consist of 700 single family homes and a golf course.

More of the same can be found on his Instagram with people leaving vulgar comments under his photos.

The words they used will not be repeated here nor should they be repeated anywhere. Caver didn't do anything wrong. In fact he was just playing basketball and fulfilling a lifelong dream.

The former Old Dominion star was unaware that when he scored his first NBA basket with 3.5 seconds left during the Pacers' 129-121 home loss to Brooklyn on Wednesday countless bettors lost money. The spread for the game was set at -8.5 for the Nets which Caver ruined by blowing past James Harden for a finger roll layup that turned what would've been a 10-point loss into an eight-point defeat. Anyone who bet on the Nets to win by nine points or more lost.

Pacers:T.J. Warren (foot) 'still weeks away' Torrey Craig Isaiah Jackson exit protocols

""I had no idea what was the spread"" Caver said. ""So when I first got in I didn't try to score. And then when they dribbled the clock out (for a shot clock violation) I looked at coach (Rick Carlisle) and he said 'Go score.' So that's what I did.

""Everybody don't get that opportunity to score in the NBA especially when you got (Kevin Durant) and James Harden on the floor. So of course that's gonna be something I remember for a lifetime.""

Caver was picked up by the Pacers on Dec. 31 because of a COVID-19 outbreak within the team and he wrapped up his 10-day hardship contract Sunday. The 6-foot-2 guard was the last player on the court in Indiana's practice facility doing an unofficial exit interview with the media as he reflected on his brief time in the NBA.

Caver played with the Grizzles' G League affiliate the Memphis Hustle earlier this season and said it was surreal to get a call up with the Pacers.

""I actually had a crazy two weeks because I was in (Las) Vegas for the G League Showcase"" he said. ""(Then) I went home so I went back to Atlanta probably until like (Dec. 27). And so another team called me so I was on standby with the other team for like 2-3 days. ... I guess some of the guys from the other team tested negative and out of protocols and then I got the call (from the Pacers) when I was on a connecting flight going back to Memphis. Before I got on that flight that's when my agent called and was like 'Yo we gotta change your flight. Indiana called.'""

Caver said he then boarded a different connecting flight to Minneapolis and when he landed there his connecting flight to Indianapolis was canceled. So he stayed the night in Minneapolis and finally caught a flight to Indianapolis the following day signing with the Pacers just hours before they hosted the Bulls on New Year's Eve.

Caver shared the news with his parents first before the rest of his family and friends found out and began flooding his phone with congratulatory calls and texts. He spent four games with Indiana making his lone appearance and 50.6-second NBA debut against the star-studded Nets.

When asked what he'll take away from that experience Caver offered a big-picture perspective.

""Just having the confidence knowing that I can play in this league"" Caver said. ""Somebody sees that I have some talent to actually be up here to get that 10-day (deal). Because everybody is getting 10-days but there's a lot of people that's not. I think that's for a reason so that's what I just took from it.""

Stackhouse's house

When Caver took the court against perennial All-Stars Durant and Harden with another perennial All-Star Kyrie Irving having just left the floor it wasn't the first time he'd graced the court with a player of that caliber.

About a decade ago Caver lived with an All-Star: Jerry Stackhouse. Stackhouse who congratulated Caver on signing with the Pacers was a two-time All-Star with the Pistons and is now the head coach at Vanderbilt. But long before he was coaching in the SEC Stackhouse was coaching and looking after Caver.

""I played with his son (Jaye) when I was like 10 or 11 in AAU. He got hurt so we kind of distanced each other. And then Jerry came back with my dad and was just like 'Yo I think I want to start a team an AAU team'"" Caver said. ""This was towards the end of his (NBA) career. The first year (he started the AAU team) he was still playing with Miami on that team that went to the Finals (in 2011). ... And then that next summer he asked me and like four other of my teammates if we wanted to transfer high schools and go up there with him so we could have like a full-time training type of thing.

""So we all transferred schools and he became my guardian.""

Caver transferred from Charles Drew High School in his hometown of Riverdale Georgia after his freshman year and attended North Gwinnett High School in Suwanee Georgia from his sophomore to senior years.

The 25-year-old said it was an invaluable experience to learn from an NBA player every day but with that unique opportunity came a lot of sacrifice.

""I had to move out of the crib when I was 14 going to 15"" Caver said. ""And it wasn't like my house was dysfunctional or something like that. It was just another opportunity to get away from home. I had to grow up a little faster than normal but my parents was there the whole way. I was probably like an hour and half from where I actually (grew up).""

Caver stayed with Stackhouse for most of his sophomore and junior year but when his senior year came he began commuting back and forth from his parents' home to North Gwinnett.

""I had to get up at 6 (a.m.) 5:30 just to make it to school"" Caver said laughing. ""The traffic was crazy in the morning.""

Betting on himself

Even after training with Stackhouse Caver had zero scholarship offers after graduating high school in 2014 so he opted to do a post-grad year at a prep school St. John's Northwestern Military Academy in Wisconsin.

""(It was) a last minute thing. I was gonna go to Hargrave (Military Academy Basketball in Virginia) or Massanutten (Military Academy in Virginia) but Massanutten shut down that year and Hargrave had a bunch of guards"" Caver said. ""So I was like 'If I'mma go prep I might as well go somewhere where I know I'mma play and start.'

""That summer I ended up playing AAU again before I went to prep and then that's when I got my offers.""

Caver reeled in a handful of mid-major offers before committing to Old Dominion. He hardly played his freshman season but by the end of his college career Caver had left his mark. The Georgia native was a two-time first-team All-Conference USA honoree and finished his career as ODU's all-time leader in minutes played.

Caver went undrafted in 2019 before signing with the Memphis Grizzles later that year. He was cut before the start of the 2019-20 season and joined the Grizzles' G League team where he's played the last three seasons.

This season Caver is having a breakout campaign averaging 15.6 points a career-high 7.1 assists and 4.1 rebounds through 15 games. His strong play caught the eye of Carlisle when the Pacers had several players enter the league's COVID-19 health and safety protocols.

""We were getting into this situation with the hardship contracts. You just keep looking through the G League for the best available players and he was that guy"" Carlisle said of Caver. ""He plays some (point guard) plays a little (shooting guard). I looked at one of the YouTube reels on him and he had 35 (points) … against the OKC G League team. ... To me he reminds me a little bit of how Jarrett Jack played when he played in the league. Just has the ability to get places and got the floaters and the touch and stuff like that.

""He scored his first NBA points the other night. That's a pretty big deal.""

Caver draws inspiration from fellow G League guard Keifer Sykes who was signed by the Pacers on Dec. 27 and had his contract guaranteed through the end of the season Friday. Caver who will return to the Memphis Hustle plans to earn his own guaranteed NBA contract someday. And if the chance comes again to score in the best league in the world he'll take it with no hesitation.

Because after years of betting on himself Caver won't change for those betting from afar.

""I'm just trying to be the best version of myself"" he said. "" ... Just winning day by day trying to be better than I was yesterday. But making it? Of course it would be just getting on a team. It don't matter what team or how many years.

""Just knowing that I have a contract in the league I think that's when I officially would say I made it.""

So is Jacksonville State another regular in the FCS playoffs.

It’s the continuation of a trend. Georgia Southern Appalachian State Coastal Carolina Liberty and Old Dominion are among other FCS contenders who have made the jump. JMU and Sam Houston are the only programs to win a national championship other than North Dakota State going back to 2011. Georgia Southern won six FCS national titles before leaving; App State won three.

These defections have only amplified the voices up north for North Dakota State to look harder at making the move up to FBS as well. And why not? The Bison's dominance has reached almost absurd levels. There’s clearly nothing left to prove and as attendance at the Fargodome dwindles it’s becoming obvious that their own fan base is almost as bored with the winning as the fans of their foes.

A question that once was ""Who is going to step up and take down the Bison?"" is slowly morphing into ""What are the Bison still doing at the FCS level?"" Maybe it really is time for them to go.

SDSU:John Stiegelmeier set to rebuild South Dakota State football coaching staff — again

What would that mean for the FCS? What would it mean for South Dakota and South Dakota State? Because it’s not just about NDSU. In the short term saying goodbye to NDSU might provide a brief respite. Presumably SDSU would finally win its first national title without the Bison (and JMU Sam Houston and others) in their way.

Quality gap in FCS growing by the season

Even without NDSU in the picture the FCS feels like it’s being pulled in two separate directions. The teams at the top are better than they’ve ever been. SDSU smashed an FBS school Colorado State in its season opener this year and it barely registered as an upset. Many of the aforementioned schools that have moved up to FBS have had success and regularly play in bowl games.

But outside of NDSU and SDSU Montana and Montana State who are the heavyweights of what’s left in FCS? Villanova? They play in a glorified high school stadium. Basketball is their priority. Eastern Washington? There’s been talk of cutting or demoting that program. Delaware? Kennesaw State? Those teams would have trouble with the best the NSIC has to offer.

And that’s the thing: while the top teams in FCS look more and more like FBS programs the level of play in the bottom third of FCS isn’t any better than Division II football and with more and more teams moving up to FCS from Division II that trend may continue. Still nobody is sounding the alarm about FCS’s future just yet.

“I feel good about (FCS football)” said Montana State athletic director Leon Costello. “If you look around the landscape there’s been a couple teams that have left but I think that’s been more due to internal factors for those specific institutions. The upper echelon of FCS is still really good and that’s why I like it. It’s very competitive. We’ve got a great playoff system that crowns a true national champion. We’ll all have more information in the coming weeks when we see what direction the NCAA is going to take but I can tell you that we’re never going to do something that other people are forcing us to do. We’re going to do what’s in the best interest of Montana State.”

That’s what everyone says of course. But when USD and UND followed their rivals from SDSU and NDSU to Division I it was at least somewhat a reactionary move. Eventually Omaha came to the same conclusion though they dropped football to do it.

NDSU and SDSU made the move to Division I two decades ago because they saw they were outgrowing Division II. Could they be in danger of outgrowing FCS football already? Maybe but that doesn’t mean a move up to FBS is a good idea because it's not like you're jumping into the Big Ten or playing your games on Saturdays on network TV.

“If you make that move is it really a move up or a move to a different place where you just spend more money” asks SDSU athletic director Justin Sell.

USD’s David Herbster seemed to share that sentiment.

NSIC:With COVID-19 nixing games already heated NSIC basketball races to get even tighter

“If we go up how does that benefit us?” Herbster said. “Do we anticipate greater crowds? Great exposure? Greater notoriety? Honestly we haven’t answered any of those questions. Right now you can look around the landscape and some of the schools that have moved up have been head-scratchers to me.”

""Nobody wants to go backwards""

To be clear while the Bison are obviously more than ready to play at the FBS level from a competitive standpoint there’s no indication a move is imminent as NDSU faces challenges in making the move due to geography.

Namely there isn’t a conference that’s a particularly good fit. The Mountain West is the one most often floated by Bison fans and media but that league extends to California (well Hawaii actually) and the closest school to Fargo is Colorado State some 800 miles away. Not ideal. The MAC (MidAmerica Conference) isn’t all that attractive. That league may offer 85 scholarships but there’s little to suggest those teams are actually better than NDSU (or SDSU for that matter).

But change could be coming to college football that may hasten decisions for its member schools particularly in Division I. The NCAA will vote on a new constitution later this month at the NCAA convention and one of the major tenets of the new draft would be to give each division the power to govern itself.

In Division I football the FBS level has had its own issues with competitive balance as the richest schools and top conferences (namely the SEC) dominate the sport. Could FBS split into two? Would the Power 5 conferences form their own governing body and break away from the non-power conferences (or Group of Five as they’re informally called)? If they did would each entity have its own playoff? And under that scenario what would happen to FCS schools? It’s all speculation at this point but at the very least expect that SDSU and USD would want to remain in the second tier of college football whether that meant the status quo or some kind of new class that might be a hybrid of FCS and Group of Five teams.

“Nobody wants to go backwards” Herbster said. “We’ve climbed too far to even think about sliding back. If that’s something we need to work for then that’s what we do. Those that have recently made that transition understand where we came from and where we are now and we’re not going back.”

Sell floated the idea of a 70-scholarship classification (right now FCS offers 63 and FBS 85) that would presumably include Group of Five teams not able to compete with the SECs and Big Tens of the world and the top teams in FCS. Would that level have a playoff system? Be part of a bowl alliance? Anything seems possible right now.

But Sell and his coach John Stiegelmeier agree on one thing – they may not be tied to NDSU and they may not be interested in a move to the FBS level but if radical change comes from the NCAA’s new constitution they’ll be prepared. The bottom line for both of South Dakota’s Division I schools: If FCS becomes the equivalent of Division II they want no more part of it than NDSU does.

“We want to compete at the highest level our capability allows us” Sell said. “The FCS is good right now. We have quality teams our playoffs are awesome and we’re producing NFL-caliber kids that are linked to our universities. But we can’t be blind to continuing those conversations of how do we strengthen what we’re doing in football. Nobody wants to go backwards. My job is to make sure we build a really good program and be part of a good league and if you do that at the end of the day you’re always going to be wanted.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2ZzdS1mb290YmFsbC10cmFuc2Zlci13aWRlLXJlY2VpdmVyLXVub2ZmaWNpYWwtdmlzaXQtMTgwMTI0MTE3Lz9QYWdlPTLSAWFodHRwczovLzI0N3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9mc3UtZm9vdGJhbGwtdHJhbnNmZXItd2lkZS1yZWNlaXZlci11bm9mZmljaWFsLXZpc2l0LTE4MDEyNDExNy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SCOOP: Talented transfer WR is checking out FSU today,"West Virginia wide receiver Winston Wright is checking out Florida State today Noles247 has learned.

//php echo do_shortcode('[responsivevoice_button voice=""US English Male"" buttontext=""Listen to Post""]') ?>

EE Times 50th Anniversary Special: This three-part series by Malcolm Penn looks at the 74-year history of Silicon Valley how it came to be how it found itself in California and the legacy of William Shockley Fairchild and the “Fairchildren” that created a significant part of the foundation of the semiconductor industry today.

Part 1: William Shockley Jr. and the Birth of the Transistor

The transistor was successfully demonstrated on Dec. 23 1947 at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill N.J the research arm of American Telephone and Telegraph. The three individuals credited with its invention were William “Bill” Shockley Jr. the department head and group leader’ John Bardeen; and Walter Brattain. Shockley continued to work on development at Bell Labs until 1955 when having foreseen the transistor’s potential rather than continue to work for a salary he quit to set up the world’s first semiconductor company becoming a de-facto industry father.

Shockley was born in London on Feb. 13 1910 the son of William Hillman Shockley a mining engineer born in Massachusetts and his wife Mary (née Bradford) who had also been engaged in mining as a deputy mineral surveyor in Nevada.

The family returned to the United States in 1913 setting up home in Palo Alto Calif. when Mary joined the Mining Engineering Department faculty at Stanford University. But for this twist of fate — given that both Shockley’s parents were mining engineers — the family could have instead settled in Colorado Nevada or West Virginia.

William Jr. was educated in California earning his BSc degree at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) in 1932 before moving to the East Coast to study at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under J.C. Slater. He obtained his Ph.D. there in 1936 submitting a thesis on the energy band structure of sodium chloride and joined Bell Telephone Laboratories where he remained until his resignation in 1955.

Part 2–Planar Technology The Fairchildren

Part: 3: Startup Fever and Venture Capital

Upon leaving Bell Labs Shockley moved back to Palo Alto where his ailing mother still resided initially as a visiting professor at Stanford but with the vision to establish his own semiconductor firm making transistors and four-layer (Shockley) diodes. Had he decided instead to remain on the East Coast close to Bell Labs MIT or IBM in Vermont Silicon Valley might well have developed on the East Coast rather than the West Coast of the United States with almost certainly a very different DNA and personality.

Back to Palo Alto Shockley found a sponsor in Raytheon a pioneer in what came to be known as electronic warfare. But Raytheon’s support was short-lived. Undeterred Shockley who had been one of Arnold Beckman’s students at CalTech turned to him for advice on how to raise $1 million in seed money. Beckman was an American chemist inventor entrepreneur founder and CEO of the hugely successful Beckman Instruments — and now also a budding financier who believed that Shockley’s new inventions would be beneficial to his own company. So rather than pass the opportunity to his competitors he agreed to create and fund a laboratory under the condition that its discoveries should be brought to mass production within two years.

Beckman and Shockley signed a letter of intent to create the Shockley Semi-Conductor Laboratory (the hyphenation was then common practice) as a subsidiary of Beckman Instruments under Shockley’s direction. The new group would specialize in semiconductors beginning with the automated production of diffused-base transistors. Shockley’s original plan was to establish the laboratory in Palo Alto close to his mother’s home but this changed when Fred Terman provost at Stanford University and central figure in the rise of Silicon Valley offered him space in Stanford’s new industrial park at 381 San Antonio Road in Mountain View. Beckmann bought licenses on all necessary patents for $25000 and the firm was launched in February 1956.

Stanford Sows the Seeds

The seeds for Stanford’s high-tech relationship with industry were sewn much earlier. In 1936 Sigurd and Russell Varian — together with William Hansen Russell’s ex-college roommate and by then a professor at Stanford — approached David Webster head of Stanford’s Physics Department for help in developing the Varian brothers’ idea of using radio-based microwaves for aircraft detection in poor weather conditions and at night. Webster agreed to hire them to work at the university in exchange for lab space supplies and half the royalties from any patents they obtained. The group’s work eventually led to the development of the klystron in August 1937 subsequently adopted by Sperry and a decade later in 1948 the formation of Varian Associates.

In 1938 shortly after the klystron’s development Bill Hewlett and David Packard who had graduated three years earlier with degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University formed Hewlett-Packard in a garage at 367 Addison Avenue in Palo Alto under the mentorship of Fred Terman. The garage is often referred to as the “Birthplace of Silicon Valley” understating both the role Terman and Stanford played in creating the catalytic environment for Californian high-tech ventures and the explosive role Shockley Semiconductors would subsequently play. From a semiconductor perspective 381 San Antonio Road in Mountain View Shockley’s address is more appropriately the real birthplace of Silicon Valley as recognized by IEEE.

Shockley Semiconductors

Given his own prodigious IQ Shockley embarked on an ambitious hiring campaign seeking to employ the brightest scientists available; not just Ph.D.s but Ph.D.s from the finest universities at the very top of their class bringing together a veritable brain trust of brilliant engineers. The hiring process was not that straightforward however given that the majority of electronics-related companies and professionals were at that time based on the East Coast thus requiring ads to be posted in The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune. Shockley initially tried to recruit from his Bell Lab peers but knowing his reputation as a difficult manager none would join him.

Early respondents included Sheldon Roberts of Dow Chemical Robert Noyce of Philco and Jay Last a former intern of Beckman Instruments. Each was required to pass a psychological test followed by an interview. Julius Blank Gordon Moore Last Noyce and Roberts started working in the April-May timeframe and Eugene Kleiner Victor Grinich and Jean Hoerni during the summer. By September 1956 the lab had 32 employees including Shockley.

Although never medically diagnosed by psychiatrists Shockley’s state of mind has been characterized as paranoid or autistic. All phone calls were recorded and staff were not allowed to share their results with each other not exactly feasible since they all worked in a small building. At some point Shockley sent the entire lab for a lie detector test although all refused. Shockley also lacked business experience and industrial management unilaterally deciding that the lab would pursue an invention of his own — the four-layer diode — rather than developing the diffused silicon transistor that he and Beckman had agreed upon.

Barely six months passed when discontent boiled over prompting seven employees to voice their concerns to Arnold Beckman — not to get rid of Shockley but to put a more rational boss between him and them. Their request might well have been granted had Shockley’s Nobel Prize not been announced in November 1956 extending Shockley’s fame and inflated ego. Rather than rock the boat Beckman chose not to interfere instead telling the seven to keep their heads down. Future Intel founders Noyce and Moore stood on different sides of the argument with Moore leading the dissidents and Noyce standing behind Shockley struggling to resolve conflicts. Shockley considered Noyce his sole supporter but the team started to disintegrate starting with Jones a technologist who left in January 1957 due to a conflict between Grinich and Hoerni.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL3NlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc2hvcnRhZ2UtYWZmZWN0cy1jYW5vbi10b25lci1jYXJ0cmlkZ2VzLWZvcmNpbmctdXNlcnMtdG8tYnlwYXNzLXdhcm5pbmdzLW9uLXRoZWlyLXByaW50ZXJzL9IBggFodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXNob3J0YWdlLWFmZmVjdHMtY2Fub24tdG9uZXItY2FydHJpZGdlcy1mb3JjaW5nLXVzZXJzLXRvLWJ5cGFzcy13YXJuaW5ncy1vbi10aGVpci1wcmludGVycy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Semiconductor shortage affects Canon toner cartridges forcing users to bypass warnings on their printers,"Twitter user Mario W. (@mariowitte) posted this tweet yesterday morning in which he states that Canon is facing a huge toner cartridge shortage forcing users to bypass warnings on their printers.

Canon instructs customers on how to bypass future crucial component-less toner cartridges opening up to non-Canon cartridges to be used in place of the company's models

The semiconductor shortage is now affecting printers. This actually comes as no surprise as several computer components such as graphics cards processors and more have seen shortages over the last year. However the fact of Canon telling users to bypass their error messages from the printer due to it being unable to recognize the cartridge making the system believes it has a counterfeit cartridge does open up compatible cartridges from other manufacturers to be used if available at a lower cost.

For those non-German readers the translated tweet states:

Wrong world: thanks to the lack of semiconductors Canon is now apparently producing toner cartridges without ""copy protection"" and sending out e-mails to customers with instructions on how to bypass error messages about counterfeit cartridges.

Verkehrte Welt: dank Halbleitermangel produziert Canon jetzt offenbar Tonerkartuschen ohne ""Kopierschutz"" und verschickt Rundmails an Kunden mit Hinweisen wie man die Fehlermeldungen zu gefälschten Kartuschen umgeht. — Mario W. (@mariowitte) January 7 2022

The German branch of Canon's website brings to light the semiconductor problem and offers a temporary fix until parts become available. This is part of the official press release from Canon:

We value you as a customer and consistent user of Canon products. Due to the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor components Canon is currently facing challenges in sourcing certain electronic components used in our consumables for our multifunction printers (MFPs). These components perform for example functions such as detecting the remaining toner level. To ensure a continuous and reliable supply of consumables we have chosen to supply consumables without a semiconductor component until normal supply resumes. While there is no negative impact on print quality when consumables are used without electronic components certain additional functions such as toner level detection may be affected. — Canon.de Press Release

Each model listed below has instructions on how to bypass the error messages. If you own one of these models please follow the instructions following this list.

If you receive an error message after inserting any of the compatible printer toner cartridges with the corresponding model here is the instructions on how to utilize your cartridge:

Source: Canon.de

If this screen appears while using a cartridge with the missing protection from the lack of the proper components Press the Close button at the bottom of the screen to continue with the printing process.

The toner level screen on your printer may show an incorrect amount. In fact the level is stated to possibly change from 100% to zero percent as shown below.

Source: Canon.de

The company notes that if you see 0% displayed on the screen insert a brand new toner cartridge.

For the imageRUNNER 1435i/1435iF models they have a separate set of instructions to follow if an error message appears after inserting the toner cartridge:

If the following screen appears when using toner lacking certain electrical components press the OK button to continue with the printing process.

Source: Canon.de

The company warns users not to press the Stop button as pictured below.

Source: Canon.de

However if you have already pressed the button the following steps will continue the printing process:

Remove the toner from the device. Reseat the toner in the device. Press OK to continue printing.

Canon states that you may see the following screen:

Source: Canon.de

This screen may appear showing that the toner level has gone from OK to None. If None does appear as shown in the bottom image the company states to insert a new cartridge.

So where Canon is offering a fix that may last months or possibly longer it does open the company to allowing users to effectively use a third-party cartridge usually for a lower cost. This isn't necessarily bad business on Canon's part. It is quite a large loophole that is created for the company to potentially lose money while waiting for components to become available.

There is also another downside slowly growing larger each month. Shortages in all markets even outside computer components and electronics have appeared time and time again causing products that are scarce for the time being to be sold on black markets by scalpers for astronomical prices. Many of the largest companies affected by shortages such as Intel NVIDIA and AMD—which we have reported on a daily basis—have stated that they do not see the market shortage change until closer to 2023 where before the three tech giants had stated that we would see the end during 2022.

The real questions now are ""What's next?"" and ""When is this going to end?"" Unfortunately even manufacturers can be wrong so a lot of the time frames should be taken as ""estimates"" until changes to the market are finally confirmed and reported.

But as Warren Buffett has mused 'If you've been playing poker for half an hour and you still don't know who the patsy is you're the patsy.' When they buy such story stocks investors are all too often the patsy.

So if you're like me you might be more interested in profitable growing companies like Alpha and Omega Semiconductor (NASDAQ:AOSL). Even if the shares are fully valued today most capitalists would recognize its profits as the demonstration of steady value generation. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer it will need to generate a profit eventually or else breathe its last breath.

Check out our latest analysis for Alpha and Omega Semiconductor

How Fast Is Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Growing Its Earnings Per Share?

In a capitalist society capital chases profits and that means share prices tend rise with earnings per share (EPS). So like the hint of a smile on a face that I love growing EPS generally makes me look twice. You can imagine then that it almost knocked my socks off when I realized that Alpha and Omega Semiconductor grew its EPS from US$0.079 to US$2.73 in one short year. Even though that growth rate is unlikely to be repeated that looks like a breakout improvement. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed or if this is a just a one-off boost.

I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). Alpha and Omega Semiconductor shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from -0.5% to 11% and revenue is growing. That's great to see on both counts.

The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail click on the image.

The trick as an investor is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future not just in the past. To that end right now and today you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for future Alpha and Omega Semiconductor EPS 100% free.

Are Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?

It makes me feel more secure owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares thusly more closely aligning our interests. So it is good to see that Alpha and Omega Semiconductor insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Indeed they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it currently valued at US$276m. That equates to 19% of the company making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. Very encouraging.

Does Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?

Alpha and Omega Semiconductor's earnings per share have taken off like a rocket aimed right at the moon. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching and the large investment held by insiders certainly brightens my view of the company. The hope is of course that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So yes on this short analysis I do think it's worth considering Alpha and Omega Semiconductor for a spot on your watchlist. It is worth noting though that we have found 2 warning signs for Alpha and Omega Semiconductor that you need to take into consideration.

Of course you can do well (sometimes) buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But as a growth investor I always like to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.

And that raises the prospect of co-operation on chips.

Taiwan's investment plans in Lithuania are not yet finalized pending studies to be conducted by a team of Taiwanese experts within the next few months. But in an interview with POLITICO the top Taiwanese diplomat in Vilnius said nothing was off the table and that Lithuania could act as an inroad to the rest of the European semiconductor market.

""This is the first time for the Taiwanese government to set up such an investment fund"" said Eric Huang head of the Taiwanese Representative Office in Vilnius. ""When we study the possibility for semiconductor investment in Lithuania we will consider the question in the light of the whole European Union market because then it will be more sustainable it will be profitable.""

Powerful friends

Even mention of partnership with a powerhouse like Taiwan is remarkable. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) — with an outsize 54 percent share of global foundry revenue in 2020 — has faced pressure from many foreign governments to diversify its production. So far though Taiwan has approached the offers with extreme caution ensuring that only such strategic partners as the United States and Japan — countries that might come to the island’s defense in the event of war — get the chips.

Europe has felt a severe pinch from microchip shortages especially during the coronavirus pandemic with manufacturing strongholds such as Germany feeling pain in sectors such as auto electronics.

Some sense of proportion over the money required is critical. Taiwan's proposed investment is a drop in the ocean compared to what a full-scale plant would require. TSMC’s factory in Arizona which will go into production by 2024 demands an investment of $12 billion for example.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAxLTA5L2NoaW5hLXZlbnR1cmUtZnVuZGluZy1oaXRzLXJlY29yZC0xMzEtYmlsbGlvbi1kZXNwaXRlLWNyYWNrZG93btIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China Venture Funding Hits Record $131 Billion Despite Crackdown,"When China’s government launched a sweeping crackdown on the technology industry over the summer panicky venture capital investors stopped writing checks and startup valuations began to plummet.

The company has leased half of what will be Austin’s tallest skyscraper making the social media giant the latest major business to expand in the state. The company’s 589000 square feet across 33 floors will account for the entire commercial half of a 66-story tower under construction in the heart of Austin’s downtown area the Austin Business Journal reported this weekend.

“We’re committed to Austin and look forward to growing here together” Katherine Shappley head of Meta’s Austin office and vice president for commerce customer success said in a statement to the Business Journal.

A spokesperson for Meta couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.

Meta which already has 2000 employees in the Austin area is seeking to hire 400 more people there and will have the capacity along with other space in the region for many more the Business Journal reported. The tower known as Sixth and Guadalupe is scheduled to open in 2023.

Texas has been on an economic tear as companies seek to expand into lower-cost locales amid a broader shift to remote work that accelerated with the global pandemic.

Samsung Electronics Co. announced a massive new chip plant for Taylor Texas in Austin’s northeastern suburban fringe in November. A month earlier Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. said it would move its headquarters to Austin from Palo Alto California. Oracle Corp. transferred its main office from Silicon Valley to Austin in 2020.

The development of an in-house stablecoin was first discovered in the source code of Paypal’s iPhone app by developer Steve Moser.

Confirming the evidence found on the PayPal app Jose Fernandez da Ponte PayPal’s senior vice president of crypto and digital currencies told Bloomberg News:

“We are exploring a stablecoin; if and when we seek to move forward we will of course work closely with relevant regulators.”

PayPal Coin logo found inside of PayPal app. Source: PayPal iPhone app

Moser’s finding uncovered that PayPal is in the works of building PayPal Coin which will be backed by the United States dollar. However a PayPal spokesperson clarified that the source codes of the iPhone application were developed in a recent hackathon.

While PayPal’s digital asset is in the making the name logo and features of the in-house token are subject to change prior to launch. Supporting the ongoing development PayPal has previously launched new features that allow users to buy hold and pay with digital coins.

da Ponte had also pointed out in an interview from November 2021 that PayPal has “not yet seen a stablecoin out there that is purpose-built for payments.” According to him a stablecoin should support payments at scale while ensuring the security of the network adding:

“There would have to be clarity on the regulation the regulatory frameworks and the type of licenses that are needed in this space.”

In addition to launching its own stablecoin PayPal has also taken proactive measures to spread crypto-related services in jurisdictions out of the United States.

In September 2021 the company announced a rollout of new Bitcoin trading services for the United Kingdom market. As Cointelegraph reported customers can trade major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC) Ether (ETH) Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjEzMjcxNS9kYW4tc2NodWxtYW4tY2VvLXBheXBhbC1pbnRlcnZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It's Expensive to Be Poor. This CEO Wants to Reduce 'Antiquated' Bank Fees and Wait Times,"(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top CEOs and business decisionmakers click here.)

PayPal’s CEO and president did not learn his most important business lesson in the C-suite of the $215-billion fintech platform which he has led since 2014; nor in his previous top jobs at T-Mobile Sprint Virgin Mobile or Priceline. In his mind it came from Krav Maga the Israeli martial art which he learned as a teenager and at 63 still practices every day: “If you stand still you’re asking to be hit” Dan Schulman says. Introducing the new season of his podcast (called “Never Stand Still”) he says “You have to stay in motion to thrive and be competitive. I’ve applied that lesson throughout my career not just to business but in life.”

Schulman’s industry is in rapid motion these days: The new technologies of distributed finance and cryptocurrency are radically reshaping people’s behavior and prompting central banks to scramble to adapt. PayPal itself lagged in embracing crypto but in April 2021 it began offering digital currencies for all payments. Now Schulman is convinced that crypto will dramatically change people’s financial lives for the better.

Dating from a time when financial executives were far less likely to reveal their opinions Schulman has not been shy in stating his about everything from discriminatory bank practices and wealth inequities. That he says has meant putting his views into reality in the way he leads PayPal. In 2019 he raised wages and cut health-care costs for lower-pay employees.

Schulman agreed to sit still long enough for a Zoom interview in December. He spoke with TIME’s Vivienne Walt about how his very public commitments to social justice mesh with the way he leads PayPal’s 26500 employees.

(These answers have been condensed and edited for clarity.)

You talk a lot about equity. A lot of companies talk about equity ESG goals. How do we trust that companies are actually doing what they claim to be doing when there’s no real way to measure it?

I think that companies have an obligation and the CEOs who run those companies have an obligation to stand up and address the societal issues that are around us. You can’t have values on a wall without acting on them. Otherwise it’s just propaganda and employees and customers and share holders see through that.

For me it was like the second or third week coming in [as PayPal CEO] and saying ‘Do we pay equally across gender and ethnicity?’ Of course the answer was no. We finally got the study back they were like ‘Do you want to take three years to address that inequality?’ And I was like ‘How about we do it next week?’

Then North Carolina passed the bathroom bill. [In 2016 the state banned schoolkids from using bathrooms for genders different from their birth certificates.] I felt it was a bill that allowed for discrimination. We had just announced a huge deal with the Governor of North Carolina to establish a 600-person operation center. Once I heard that I walked down the hallway and said to our corporate communications ‘We’re going to pull out of North Carolina and within a week.’

How do your views impact the way you lead PayPal?

I look at it not just externally but internally. Are we driving financial health for our employees? My view of this is we’ve gone from talking about employees’ physical health to their mental health to now their financial health.

So I’ve created internal metrics to measure the financial health of our employees not just kind of talk about it not try and increase our minimum wage but how much net disposable income do they have after they pay all of their taxes and essential living expenses? We feel it needs to be a minimum of 20% for people to feel financially healthy. And when we did our initial study that ranged between 4% and 6%. And so we invested tremendously in our own employees because that was consistent with the values that we have.

What’s the biggest problem with the way the financial industry is set up?

It’s expensive to be poor. The less money you have the more it costs you to do basic transactions. If you want to cash a check and you’re part of the banking system it’s simple and easy. It’s usually free of charge. But if you’re outside the system you need to stand in line waiting at a cash checking location and pay. You’re waiting in line you’re losing money on every transaction and then if you want to pay a bill you need to stand in line again and pay a transaction fee to pay your bills. This is the kind of system we have today.

In the U.S. people who are outside the banking system spend about $140 billion on unnecessary fees and high interest rates to complete basic transactions. Think about that amount of money going to those populations that most need it.

The underlying infrastructure of the financial system today is quite antiquated. If I cash a check it can take three days for me to get that money. If I do an international remittance the receiving party may not get that for a week to 10 days. Why is that so important? Because those who have less income usually their expenses are not greater than their revenues coming in. Getting money efficiently and quickly is essential for so much of our world’s population.

Ok so what’s your answer?

There’s a solution to this issue. It’s rooted in technology and it’s why PayPal wants to do what we call ‘democratize financial access’ which is a fancy way of saying that managing and moving money should be a right for everybody not a privilege for just the affluent.

If you send an international remittance to somebody it doesn’t matter if it’s to Mexico or India it can cost $8 for every $100. If you do that from one digital wallet to another digital wallet it can cost under $2 and you have access to your money instantaneously. That’s a 6% savings. Multiply that on an industry level of international remittances that’s $635 billion dollars. Just think about how much more money can go to those who absolutely need this.

But wouldn’t people still need a PayPal account to do this?

No you can use PayPal by putting cash in a retail store. If you want to do a transaction we can create a virtual card. People are doing that quite a number of them. You just go in and give cash to a cashier. Instead of giving it to a bank you give it to a cashier. Your mobile phone has all the power of bank branches in your hand. There’s an ability to bring more people into the system and create a more inclusive system with lower costs and the ability to access your money quickly. I think it’s essential and possible.

How does crypto fit into this? Since August people can now charge things on PayPal with crypto. Does it help bridge this gap you’re talking about?

We need to modernize so we can get a payment instantaneously. If I send a digital wallet to digital wallet transaction you get that money instantaneously I could send you a PayPal transaction and you will get it in less than two seconds. You have it in your wallet to spend. It’s remarkable.

The other thing is if we can do away with some of the intermediaries in the system we can probably lower the cost as well. And so the promise of this new technology is that it can be more inclusive it can lower the costs of basic transactions it could speed the time to get your money make the system more efficient and bring in more people. That is why we established a full business unit around blockchain technology and digital currencies. It’s why we are working with central banks and governments around the world to help shape what a future might look like that that’s more inclusive.

When will central banks actually start using digital currency in great numbers?

About 80% of the world’s central banks have some kind of studies or limited experiments underway. There’s clearly an understanding that the world is moving more and more to digital forms of payments. Central banks are looking towards all forms of digital currencies for efficiency sake and lower costs but also the digital economy is upon us now. And clearly the pandemic accelerated that.

Is paper money really dying out or is it just us sitting in Europe and California who think that? If you travel around Africa no one takes a credit card.

Many people have forecasted the death of cash and been wrong and I don’t want to be another in that long list! But everyone has a smartphone. It is becoming ubiquitous and wireless connectivity is becoming more and more ubiquitous. The ability to leapfrog into the next generation of payments that’s more efficient faster with less cost is something governments are eagerly looking at. It just makes sense for them to do that for their citizens.

I saw the video of you buying great-looking cowboy boots with crypto last April. How does that actually work for regular PayPal users?

What we wanted to do with crypto was that you could easily use it at any of our 33 million merchants around the world. We know that merchants around the world do not accept cryptocurrencies. So what we did is we allowed consumers to instantaneously translate that cryptocurrency and sell it in into fiat currency to pay for that transaction. And so really what we were doing is enabling your crypto on your PayPal wallet to be used as easily as a credit card or debit card or your cash balance. That’s enabled quite a number of people to make transactions on it. And some use it some keep their cryptocurrency as an investment. Whatever they want to do is great with us.

So is there a conflict between profit and purpose?

My view of this is that profit and purpose are fully linked together. The only way to become a great company over time is to have the very best people and over 90% of employees say that they want to work at companies that have a purpose. If you don’t have a purpose as a company you will never attract the very best talent. And if you don’t have the very best talent you will never be a great company. We can’t be about just maximizing profit next quarter. I am beginning to see more and more of our shareholders embrace that concept.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vcGF5cGFsLWNyZWF0aW5nLWNyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5LXdoeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PayPal Working On Its Own Cryptocurrency But Why?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vcGF5cGFsLWNyZWF0aW5nLWNyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5LXdoeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdG9ycmVudGZyZWFrLmNvbS9waXJhdGUtaXB0di1wcm92aWRlcnMtZXhwbG9pdC1wYXlwYWwtbWFzdGVyY2FyZC12aXNhLWJyYW5kaW5nLTIxMDEwOC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Pirate IPTV Providers ""Exploit PayPal Mastercard & Visa Branding""","Pirate IPTV providers generally require payment in exchange for a subscription. In the majority of cases this involves utilizing a third-party payment processor such as PayPal Mastercard or Visa. According to the Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance pirates exploit these trusted brands to appear legitimate themselves. But what can be done to break the association?

In the summer of 2018 a report from anti-piracy company Irdeto examined the payment processing abilities of 400 pirate IPTV supplier sites. It found that the majority (76%) openly advertised their payment options with Visa Mastercard and PayPal leading the way.

The strong message from Irdeto was that such payment processors should be supporting legitimate media organizations by conducting better due diligence and stopping support for pirate streaming services.

“If media organizations threaten to vote with their feet against payment platforms that enable piracy it’ll be fascinating to see who blinks first” the report said.

At the time we wondered whether this type of threat was the best way to achieve change. Now more than two years later the tone appears to have softened somewhat while still carrying a serious message.

Pirates Expolit Payment Processor Branding

While sporting a lower public profile than the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment there can be no doubt that the Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance is a force to be reckoned with. The anti-piracy group currently has 30 members including tech companies Irdeto and Nagra plus content owners and broadcasters such as BT BeiN Sports DAZN LaLiga Premier League and Sky.

This week the group again raised the issue of payment processor support for pirate IPTV providers but framed things a little differently. According to AAPA among other things the inclusion of payment processor logos on payment portals gives them an air of legitimacy while damaging the processors’ brands.

“From a pirate’s perspective they want consumers to pay for the services they offer. Their professional-looking websites already fool many unsuspecting consumers into thinking that they are a legitimate vendor. This veneer of authenticity is further enhanced with pirates often using multiple well-known payment provider services to make it easier for subscriptions to be purchased” the AAPA reports.

The underlying suggestion is that the appearance of brands such as Visa and Mastercard enables not only the processing of payments but also leads to a boost in consumer trust for illegal services. The big question then is how the situation has changed since the 2018 Irdeto report.

Improvement Over 2018 But Not Enough Says AAPA

In 2018 of the sites that openly published payment methods 21% offered Visa 21% offered Mastercard and 14% offered payment via PayPal. Since then AAPA says it has engaged with all three companies and according to a study by its Disruption Working Group PayPal now ranks first with 17.3% Mastercard at 14.7% and Visa closely behind with 14.1%.

“The question for the payment services industry and policymakers is how do so many sites slip through the net of the preventive measures – some of which are legal requirements like anti-money laundering regulations? Of course any ex-ante system is not watertight and can be circumvented but the evidence does suggest a lot more needs to be done. But by whom?” AAPA asks.

AAPA Engagement With The ‘Big Three’

Despite PayPal now being the largest player in the IPTV market according to AAPA’s own study the anti-piracy group expresses no criticism for the payment processor.

“PayPal and AAPA have a long-standing relationship. PayPal is committed to finding a workable solution to combat piracy’s impact on the industry and on their brand. Issues are discussed openly and constructively” AAPA says.

Visa too comes in for modest praise albeit with slight reservations.

“From our interactions with Visa we know that they have very stringent internal procedures in place” AAPA writes. “These procedures can include multiple cease and desist notices and may require proof via a test [IPTV] purchase. All of this takes time while piracy continues unchallenged. Visa is of course protecting its rights and interests and AAPA members are doing the same” the group says calling for compromises to find a middle ground.

As for an assessment of Mastercard’s efforts AAPA says it is “a bit too early to say” with the suggestion that meaningful cooperation has yet to begin in earnest.

Opportunities For Improvement

In general AAPA feels that the way forward for all processors is to be more attentive when it comes to due diligence matters preferably reinforced and monitored by either a third party or a memorandum of understanding. Proactive monitoring to ensure proper compliance with processor terms and conditions is also high on the list of requirements.

Referencing a discussion paper published by the European Union Intellectual Property Office the AAPA also identifies the need for a more streamlined system whereby rightsholders are able to complain about pirate sites and have their services terminated.

In addition the rightsholders seek a transparent system that opens up knowledge of how specific “repeat infringers” are being treated by payment processors.

IPTV and Cryptocurrencies

Looking back on Irdeto’s 2018 report cryptocurrencies accounted for just 4.3% of all payment methods openly advertised by pirate IPTV providers. According to the latest figures that share has now reached almost 12%. AAPA describes the increase as “not huge” and puts forward various theories of why the uptake is not greater.

“These could be the instability of the cryptocurrencies sinister association with hacking and ransom demands or that most consumers don’t know how to use crypto” the group says.

It seems probable at least among the less tech-savvy IPTV user that the latter is more likely to be a factor. After all the most convenient payment methods – PayPal and credit/debit cards – are still the most popular despite an ongoing level of cooperation with rightsholders.

That raises the question of whether clamping down on the simpler forms of payment will have a strong effect on the penetration of pirate IPTV services in the marketplace.

In the short term it seems that the answer is a strong ‘yes’ but over time it is likely that consumers will become more accustomed to using crypto too making the transition from traditional payment methods a gradual affair rather than a sudden overnight culture shock.

There is also evidence in the market to suggest that IPTV providers are encouraging their customers to move over to crypto sooner rather than later. In part this could be due to payment processor pressure but there is also a desire for providers to secure their businesses by making law enforcement “follow-the-money” investigations considerably harder.

That leaves the prospect of significant action by the mainstream processors eventually forcing a big shift towards crypto and creating even greater problems that will be considerably more difficult to tackle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbmFpcmFtZXRyaWNzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzA4L3BheXBhbC1pcy1leHBsb3JpbmctZGVzaWduaW5nLWl0cy1vd24tY3J5cHRvL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vbmFpcmFtZXRyaWNzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzA4L3BheXBhbC1pcy1leHBsb3JpbmctZGVzaWduaW5nLWl0cy1vd24tY3J5cHRvLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PayPal is exploring designing its own crypto,"PayPal the American payments giant is looking into launching its own stablecoin as the company grows its crypto business. Bloomberg reported in September that PayPal subsidiary Curv was actively developing a stablecoin.

PayPal told Bloomberg in an emailed statement: “We are exploring the possibility of launching a stablecoin; if and when we move forward we will be working closely with relevant regulators.”

PayPal’s exploration into building its own stablecoin was first revealed by Bloomberg after developer Steve Moser found evidence of the company’s exploration in its iPhone app. Bloomberg reported that hidden code shows work on a “PayPal Coin.” The code shows the coin would be backed by the greenback.

PayPal has been very active in its crypto assets’ initiatives recently increasing its customers’ access to crypto and educating its users about it. Developing a way to withdraw cryptocurrency safely to third-party wallets.

PayPal told Bloomberg that the images and code inside the PayPal app came from an internal hackathon within the company’s blockchain crypto and digital currencies division – an event where engineers quickly explore and build new products that may never see the light of day.

In October 2020 PayPal allowed its US customers to store crypto assets then enabled them to purchase supported cryptocurrency from the platform’s 29 million merchants the following March.

In addition to not charging fees for holding crypto assets the payment company charges a small transaction fee at or below 2.3%.

A major advantage of using PayPal for crypto purchases is that it extends the same level of fraud protection as it does for fiat currency purchases."

Boca Raton Fla. for $550 million. Celsius is a manufacturer of energy and fitness beverages sold under the Celsius brand.

The investment also includes a distribution agreement that will transition Celsius’ current US distribution system to PepsiCo. PepsiCo also will become the preferred distribution partner globally for Celsius according to the company.

“We are extremely pleased to partner with Celsius and excited about the opportunity for our two organizations to drive growth and innovation in the energy beverage category” said Kirk Tanner chief executive officer of PepsiCo Beverages North America. “The Celsius brand’s growing momentum coupled with the strength of PepsiCo’s portfolio and go-to-market capabilities create a combination we believe will be very compelling and valuable to retailers and consumers. We are looking forward to seeing the impact these two outstanding organizations can make together to more fully capture energy occasions.”

John Fieldly chairman and CEO of Celsius added “We believe the opportunity to partner with a global best-in-class distributor provides Celsius with significant near-term additional shelf space in both existing retailers as well as new expansion within the independent retailers that represent a significant portion of the US convenience and gas channel where approximately 70% of energy drinks are sold.

“It also provides a strategic partnership that is expected to accelerate growth for both companies globally. In addition this partnership will drive efficiencies allowing our teams to consolidate sales marketing and distribution efforts with associated cost benefits which we expect to recognize once the initial transition is completed.”

The investment in Celsius continues PepsiCo’s efforts to gain share in the market for energy beverages. The company acquired Rockstar Energy Beverages in 2020 for $3.85 billion.

That same year PepsiCo entered into an agreement with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. Weston Fla. the maker of the Bang Energy drink portfolio to distribute the beverages in the United States.

The association representing Ontario pharmacists says roughly half of people looking to get a Pfizer vaccine are rejecting the Moderna shot if they are offered that instead.

""They may cancel their appointment. They may walk out"" said Justin Bates CEO of the Ontario Pharmacists Association.

""That's creating a significant challenge"" said Bates as pharmacists also have to deal with combative patients who want to shop around for vaccines.

Many people did the same thing last spring when they questioned the safety of Moderna or mixing vaccines during the rollout of second doses.

Now they have less choice in the matter because many public health units are reserving Pfizer for younger people because there's now a greater supply of Moderna. In Toronto Durham and Waterloo regions people aged 30 and up will only be offered Moderna.

Last fall the Ontario government recommended people between 18 and 24 receive the Pfizer vaccine due to a ""mild risk"" of the rare heart condition myocarditis ""out of an abundance of caution."" Pfizer is also only being offered to those aged 12 to 17.

Jason Chomik opted to get Moderna for his third shot on New Year's Day even though he put off two appointments before getting Pfizer for his second dose. He says the surging Omicron variant finally prompted him to make the move.

""If the numbers hadn't been climbing as rapidly as they are now I probably would have waited"" he said.

""I'm glad I got the booster but I'm still concerned around the long-term effects of mixing the vaccines.""

'They only want Pfizer'

Despite public messaging that mixing vaccines is safe as is Moderna many are still reluctant to get it. Aside from pharmacies health workers at other vaccine clinics are seeing this too.

""When they sit down in the chair they immediately confirm [they're getting Pfizer] with me"" said Allan Grill who has been administering vaccines in York Region north of Toronto and is chief of family medicine at Markham Stouffville Hospital.

""They only want Pfizer.""

Grill along with many infectious disease experts have long maintained the risk of getting infected with COVID-19 is far greater than any risk associated with getting any of the vaccines.

""Omicron is spreading like crazy and people are getting sick"" he said.

Even Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Kieran Moore made a plea during his briefing on Thursday.

""I too got Moderna as my booster"" he said.

""The latest evidence demonstrates the protection provided by the Moderna vaccine particularly for older individuals is very robust.""

More brand awareness

Bates said there's more brand awareness around Pfizer's vaccine especially since many got it for their first or second dose. He also said the pandemic continues to change policy with time and new research.

The majority of the project has been shot in Canada where Lopez 52 was shooting scenes prior to the new year.

The film set to premiere in 2022 is centered around an assassin who comes out of hiding to protect her daughter while evading dangerous assailants. The deadly thriller also stars Joseph Fiennes Gael García Bernal and Omari Hardwick per Variety.

The Mother is one of many projects forced to pause production amid the recent spike in COVID-19 cases. Several television shows — including Grey's Anatomy NCIS NCIS: Los Angeles and Chicago Fire — have reportedly put production on hold as the omicron variant continues to spread.

Filming for NCIS: Los Angeles has now been pushed back to February after originally being scheduled to resume this month according to TV Line. The delay should not impact on-air scheduling per the report.

College basketball insider Jon Rothstein reported on Sunday that Hoggard has narrowed the list of schools he’s considering. He’s currently in the transfer portal and is looking for a new home for next season.

Hoggard has started at point guard for the Spartans the past two seasons recording 10.7 points and 5.2 assists per game this past year. He however elected to enter the transfer portal following the season instead of coming back for a fifth year at Michigan State.

And unfortunately he was taken too soon.

When John Beilein took over the Michigan basketball team in 2007 there was a lot of work to do. The Wolverines floundered in his first season but in his third year he caught lightning in a bottle. One big reason was former point guard Darius Morris.

Morris really took off in the 2010-11 season but in his freshman season (2009-10) he helped lead the team to an NCAA Tournament after having not made it in 11 years. He left after his sophomore campaign being drafted in the second round by the Los Angeles Lakers.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

~

Keela recently added the Pinnacle Jacket to its extensive range and I have been able to try it out in varying conditions this winter.

Although stated as a three-layer material (outer fabric film coating then a scrim for strength and stability) it does not actually feel to be so especially if compared to say Keela’s ADS material jackets. This construction makes the Pinnacle a lighter and more packable less bulky jacket for those days when something good is required to beat the elements but perhaps not for wear all of the time. Once you do get the Pinnacle out it is waterproof and has fully taped seams is breathable and is very wind-resistant. This I can fully vouch for after some very blowy and wet coastal walks recently.

Yet another wet and wintry day on the South West Coast Path where the Keela Pinnacle proved its worth [©JG]

The Pinnacle uses the Extreme variant of the Aquaflex material so has that added robustness and durability. It didn’t rip even when I caught it on a barbed wire fence recently! This jacket offers good layering opportunities as it provides the weather protection and water resistance we all demand when out in inclement conditions but it can be used over a T-shirt base layer or with any warm base and mid layers you choose and need at the time thereby offering great flexibility.

Here you can see the peak on the capacious hood which is good to help keep the rain out of your eyes ~ also the showing the zipped chest pockets which work very well for those item you may need to get to frequently [©JG]

The jacket has a good specification with the required features you would expect to help you enjoy the great outdoors or an urban environment in any weather. Zips are all water-resistant to stop that wind-blown rain sneaking in. All are fitted with pull tags to make them easier to use with cold and/or gloved hands. The front zip can be opened from the base as well as the top. At the top it zips right up so the collar which has a soft fabric chin guard for added comfort forms a good level of protection at the neck.

Seen here the water-resistant zips used throughout this jacket the zip pull loops and the captive pull cord for the hood ~ logos are also reflective which is useful if walking in the dark as they show up under torches or headlights [©MG]

There are two very useful chest pockets and side pockets each side. This material is just stiff enough to enable single-handed use of the zip which is handy; of course it may not stay like this as the years of use go by. All pockets are perfectly capable of taking a folded OS map gloves phone and so on. There are ‘pit zips’ for underarm ventilation when the going gets warm and the arms have adjustable cuffs. There are keepers to prevent the hem adjusters flapping in the breeze and the hood pull cords are also captive. As you would expect from Keela the hood is a good one and is helmet compatible for climbers cyclists and so on. It has a useful peak and has plenty of adjustment so if it is really miserable you can keep it all outside.

The Pinnacle’s hood can be rolled up and secured to form a useful and protective collar [©MG]

I got this jacket ‘hot off the press’ for wear testing and Jean wants one now; it would have been an Christmas present but the Ladies version not quite available yet. Plan B in force. Currently available in red and in five sizes the main launch is scheduled for the spring with three more colours and two more sizes in the pipeline.

Colbert was one of seven experts the Dayton Daily News interviewed about the region’s 2022 economic outlook. The others interviewed were: Bill Adams senior economist for PNC Financial Services Group; retired Air Force Col. Cassie Barlow president of the Strategic Ohio Council for Higher Education; Sandy Gudorf president of the Downtown Dayton Partnership; Chris Kershner president and CEO of the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce; Richard Stock director of the University of Dayton Business Research Group; and Julie Sullivan executive vice president of regional development at the Dayton Development Coalition.

What do you foresee for the Dayton Region’s economic recovery in 2022?

“Dayton’s recovery has lagged the national recovery so far in part reflecting the impact of the auto supply chain problems on local manufacturers as well as demographic trends” Adams said.

The Dayton metropolitan area had the seventh lowest rate of job growth among the state’s 12 metropolitan areas with the number of jobs increasing by 1.4% year-over-year to 381900 in November according to the most recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The Cincinnati metro area which includes Butler County had the most robust growth at 3.6% and the Springfield area ranked third at 2.3%

Stock called the Dayton region’s job growth “anemic” and said there are still 13400 fewer jobs than in November 2019 before the pandemic.

Four industry sectors have struggled the most in the last two years in the Dayton region: leisure and hospitality down 4800 jobs compared to November 2019 health care and social assistance with 3300 fewer jobs as well as state government education services such as colleges and training centers and local governments Stock said.

“Recovery in Dayton in 2022 will continue to be more anemic than otherwise because the underlying conditions causing weakness in those sectors have not been resolved” Stock said.

On the positive side Stock said “strength in construction and continued strength in trade and transportation will offset some of the fallout from that continued weakness.”

“Manufacturing job growth will be mixed with strength in some sectors offset by factory closings in other areas” Stock said. “Long term Dayton will experience growth in professional and business services as it becomes more integrated in the greater Cincinnati area. Wright-Patterson (Air Force Base) will continue to be a source of strength in that area.”

While manufacturing has not fully recovered from the pandemic Kershner said that sector will improve as shipping costs continue declining and supply chain bottlenecks clear up.

Explore Dayton and Springfield regions had third lowest unemployment rates in Ohio

“The economy will continue its steady growth in 2022 yet likely at a slower pace than in 2021” Kershner said. “Last year we saw the economic recovery outpace expectations due in part to consumer spending fueled by stimulus dollars.”

“Wages have increased across the region which will hopefully translate to increased or sustained consumer spending” he said.

After a very difficult 2020 the Dayton region saw economic development projects move forward in downtown Dayton near the Dayton International Airport and elsewhere in 2021 creating jobs and hope. An infusion of federal money from the infrastructure bill passed last year is also expected to boost jobs and development.

The unemployment rate was 3.5% in the Dayton metro area tying with four other metro areas —including Springfield — for second lowest rate in November among the state’s metro areas. Cincinnati and Columbus had the lowest rate at 3% according the the BLS.

Sullivan said Wright-Patt is driving growth among Dayton region defense contractors and the logistics and distribution industries continue to boom. Near the airport Amazon is building two new facilities and a distribution center for Crocs shoes is nearly complete.

“Right now we are very optimistic for 2022. We had a record-setting 2021 for JobsOhio projects in terms of committed jobs and our pipeline for 2022 is very strong” Sullivan said. “We’ve seen a variety of projects in diverse industries increasing our region’s resiliency and creating new career opportunities for our communities.”

Gudorf said downtown construction projects are booming with wait lists to get into housing developments and the newly renovated Dayton Arcade opened with apartments and private offices already full.

“I am extremely optimistic about the economic progress and economic recovery for our region” Gudorf said. “Fourth quarter last year we had several round table discussions with several of our (office) businesses. For many 2021 was a banner year for them. They expect the same kind of level going in to 2022.”

Also important to the recovery are southwest Ohio’s 23 colleges and universities which educate 200000 students annually and have a total economic impact of $7.3 billon Barlow said.

“National research indicates that education is critical in any region for economic development and recovery” she said. “Education raises people’s productivity and creativity and promotes entrepreneurship and technological advances. In addition it plays a very crucial role in securing economic and social progress and improving income distribution.”

What are the primary hurdles the Dayton Region faces in 2022?

Educators at all levels along with governments businesses nonprofit organizations and local residents are key to resolving what many see as the region’s greatest economic issue: workforce.

“The primary hurdle the Dayton Region faces in 2022 is continuing to build attract and retain a trained and ready workforce” Barlow said “It has never been more important for every citizen of our region to earn a post-secondary credential in order to best contribute to our community’s needs while earning a livable wage.”

The skills gap existed before the pandemic but the pandemic put that problem into overdrive as 20.5 million people were thrown out of work in April 2020 in the U.S. and the unemployment rate hit 14.7%. The pandemic recession decimated swaths of the economy.

Rebuilding the workforce has proven problematic as fear of COVID-19 continues parents struggle to find affordable quality child care schools close and reopen and people reevaluate their lives and occupations in what has become known as the Great Resignation.

In November a record 4.5 million people voluntarily quit their jobs nationally according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

“Labor scarcity will likely intensify in 2022 as the recovery continues to push the unemployment rate lower” Adams said. “Workers in Dayton will have more employment opportunities than in the past as national employers open up more positions for remote work.”

Last year a report commissioned by the First Suburbs Consortium of Dayton called for increasing regional collaboration on workforce issues. Local colleges and universities already work closely with businesses to target training toward workforce needs.

Montgomery County trains people for in-demand jobs and helps companies recruit workers but employers face tough competition in the current job seekers’ market Colbert said.

“People are aware of the increase in prices due to inflation and the need for higher wages and better benefits to support their families even in an area as affordable as our region” Colbert said. “It is those companies that are hesitant to provide livable wages and benefits that will continue to have trouble finding employees.”

Sullivan said it is crucial that the region be ready to provide a skilled workforce for companies and that companies engage with educators to make sure people learn the right skills.

“We must continue to support businesses in their efforts and work with our educational partners at all levels to help job seekers understand local opportunities” Sullivan said. “The pandemic still poses a major challenge to businesses. Finding a path forward with minimal disruptions will be critical in 2022.”

What will be the local impact of pandemic-related economic disruptions such as supply chain issues labor shortages and inflation and what should be done to ease those pressures?

Stock does not believe inflation will have a negative impact on the economy in 2022. But Kershner is not so sure saying “prices and wages must level out for the economy to stabilize” and even when that occurs he doubts prices and wages will decline.

“The current rapid inflation rate and the fear of future inflation is driving businesses to be cautious” Kershner said. “Businesses want economic certainty and COVID-19 has taught us that nothing is ever certain and everything will change.”

While supply chain issues are easing Kershner said these pandemic-related problems continue to plague some industries. Gudorf said construction is one of them but businesses are making adjustments and it hasn’t stopped construction projects from progressing downtown.

“I just commend many of our businesses on how resilient they are how creative they are to try to find solutions to some of these challenges” Gudorf said.

Colbert said the county helps small businesses find resources that will help them but noted that supply chain issues are tied closely to the labor shortage.

“As a large distribution hub for our region lack of supplies hinders the manufacturing chain which means fewer products to distribute” Colbert said. “As distribution firms attract more workers these issues will subside but we’re uncertain as to how long that will take.”

Sullivan said the state is working to resolve supply chain issues by trying to “re-shore” manufacturing so more products are made in the state and U.S.

“The Air Force’s Agility Prime program is a great example. One of the program’s goals is to keep the development and manufacture of ‘flying cars’ within the U.S.” Sullivan said. “Springfield and the Dayton Region are well-positioned to capture that growth.”

How should the Dayton region leverage its strengths in 2022 to improve the economic outlook for businesses workers and families?

“The Dayton region should continue to invest in workforce retention and attraction leveraging our strengths in key industries such as defense and logistics and distribution” Kershner said.

“We’re in a good position to attract talent as people have become more mobile working virtually and choosing to live in places with a high quality of life. That’s where the Dayton region shines and we should capitalize on this opportunity.”

Adams said improvements to quality of life are what “can draw in people and reverse Dayton’s population loss which is the region’s biggest drag on economic growth.”

Those interviewed said the region’s attributes include a low cost of living short commute times abundance of amenities like recreation and the arts relatively low housing costs proximity to large cities and multiple educational institutions.

“Students in our region have an unlimited number of options when it comes to their education or training” Barlow said. “One of our strengths is the fact that we are the home to our state’s largest single site employer Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (which) attracts a highly educated and talented workforce to our region that contribute to our ecosystem of innovation.”

Barlow suggested one workforce solution is for the region to attract more veterans who she said offer a variety of skills and experiences to businesses and the community.

Sullivan said efforts should continue regionally and statewide to make Ohio “more military-friendly to preserve the missions we have and position the state to attract new ones.”

Several of those interviewed said one of the region’s strengths is the willingness of public and private sectors and members of the community to work together to innovate and solve problems.

“We’re very resilient and as we go into this new year we have a lot to work on. Of course the unknown is the pandemic” Gudorf said. “As a community we have worked together in very creative ways to combat some of these hurdles but it’s going to be a challenge.”

The 2.6-meter-long EV developed by FOMM Corp. was parked in a pool 5 meters in diameter on Dec. 20. When water was supplied and reached a depth of 1 meter the vehicle’s body gradually rose and it did not sink even when a driver got aboard.

The driver could steer the EV forward and make it turn on the water. The accelerator is operated by hand to prevent accidental pressing of the gas pedal instead of the brake.

One problem is that the EV can only travel at 1 to 2 kph on water making it difficult to move against strong currents.

According to FOMM the vehicle’s waterproof drive system can prevent it from breaking down on inundated roads.

“We designed the car so that it would not easily be thrown out of action in flooded underpasses and elsewhere in emergencies” said a representative of FOMM which produces compact EVs and offers related services in Kawasaki Kanagawa Prefecture.

FOMM’s EV is made of resin and its wheels have a propeller-like structure allowing the vehicle to move on the water surface.

The trial run was part of Osaka University’s graduate school program that conducts verification tests of self-driving and other features of electric cars.

The maximum driving range of the four-passenger car is 160 kilometers. The EV carries a price tag of 2.7 million yen ($23600) including tax.

The electric model has been produced in Thailand since 2019.

FOMM sold around 20 units in Japan in 2021 the first year it was available in the county. The company plans to eventually raise annual production to 10000 units.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The nine-building complex comprises 229 affordable apartments primarily along East 118th and East 119th Streets surrounding Park Lexington and Third Avenues.

Most of the buildings were constructed in the 1920s and consist of one- to three-bedroom units and a small collection of studios. As part of the acquisition LIHC and Camber will undertake $10 million in infrastructure and building system upgrades across the portfolio. This includes substantial plumbing and electric upgrades a new security and intercom system masonry and façade repairs as well as common area improvements.

The new owners have also committed to an extension of the portfolio’s Section 8 Housing Assistance Payment contract which combined with city-backed regulatory agreements will maintain the properties as restricted-income housing for at least the next 40 years. As a result of the regulatory agreements entered into by the new owners current and future residents will contribute no more than 30 percent of their monthly adjusted income toward rent.

“This transaction protects a substantial number of affordable units so they may continue to serve the East Harlem community while allowing for renovations that will greatly benefit longtime residents of these nine buildings” said Andrew Gendron principal at LIHC Investment Group. “There are very few asset classes with more proven resilience and staying power than affordable housing and competition for deals in the five boroughs remains extremely high.”

To finance the acquisition the partnership executed a $73.1 million FHA risk-share loan with the New York City Housing Development Corporation and supplied $11.5 million in developer equity.

“Through our partnership with LIHC Investment Group we look forward to preserving and renovating Lexington Court to deliver the highest quality housing to the residents of East Harlem” said Rick Gropper principal and co-founder of Camber Property Group. “By preserving affordability we ensure the city is accessible for everyone especially in this community.”

The company has now embarked on a path to becoming one of the leading auto finance players in Australia.

There can be no bigger indicator of its lofty intentions than its recent purchase of the Macquarie Bank dealer floorplan book – valued at between $600 to $700 million – and the boost to its car finance business that Allied Credit has already seen flowing from that acquisition.

For many Allied Credit is a new brand on the block that has had the apparent audacity to break out of the peripheral world of two to four wheels where the customers are mostly riders rather than drivers to take on one of the biggest car finance books in the nation.

Its deal to buy the floor plan book of Macquarie Bank was completed before Christmas. This sets the scene for Allied Credit to recruit those car dealers using Macquarie to come over to Allied to fund and operate their retail vehicle loans – a recruitment process that is well under way with more than 100 dealer groups already on board.

Allied Credit has a unique business model in the consumer and commercial finance world. It operates:

A joint venture partnership model suitable for OEMs and big dealer groups. Allied Credit establishes and manages a separate finance company that is 50 per cent owned by Allied Credit and 50 per cent owned by the partner.

White label partnerships for OEMs. Allied Credit is the 100 per cent owner of the contracts that originated through that white label program.

Retail finance operations for dealers under the brand Automotive Finance. Dealers sell Allied Credit’s retail finance paper if they are not exposed to Allied Credit through an OEM or dealer group joint venture or white label arrangement.

The name Allied Credit is new to many of the people in the industry yet it has been a player in Australia since 2010 and has roots in North America well before that.

Allied Credit’s actual beginnings reach back some 35 years when its New Zealand-born founder and current executive chairman Richard Harding entered the vendor-based lending business in Canada where he became a senior vice president in AT&T Capital (Canada) and he built NCR Credit (Canada).

Mr Harding a qualified engineer used his engineering background to develop in the early 90’s one of the first web-based HTML software platforms to manage lending finance for auto dealers. This platform after many iterations and owners grew to take in more elements of dealer management to become DealerTrack which is now a division of Cox Automotive in North America.

After selling his interests in North America Mr Harding a keen motorcyclist was approached by Yamaha to set up a finance company for its Australian dealers. Later Mr Harding set up a white label finance company for Kawasaki which continues today. It was this arrangement that spawned Allied Credit in 2010.

Along the way he also founded Newcourt Credit in Australia (which became CIT and is now part of BoQ Finance); Yamaha Motor Finance; and Fundcorp (which was sold to Macquarie Bank).

In the early days of Allied Credit Mr Harding received funding from associates from Canada who wanted to back his vision for finance company partnerships and white-label finance based on a flexible customisable IT platform.

Jon Moodie managing director of Allied Credit told GoAutoNews Premium: “Richard always understood the need for excellent technology to manage dealer finance because he’d done that sort of IT before when he was in North America.

“And to make that work Richard realised the importance of having his own proprietary software as a way to differentiate his offering by providing a really good customer experience.

“He also had a keen interest in developing a joint venture partnership model. Very early on he realised the importance of relationships and partnerships for the sustainability of a business and the benefits of going into business together as opposed to just being a finance company with a brand and lending to customers via dealers.

“He was much more about becoming true partners of our manufacturers and big dealer groups and having a software platform that we could bespoke and develop to suit the particular needs of the various partners” Mr Moodie said.

As Mr Harding along with founding CEO Matt Stevens used the platform to manage the white label arrangements and the joint ventures Allied Credit attracted clients from across the motorcycle ATV outboard motor and jet ski sector as well as the caravan and camper trailer industry.

These include Kawasaki Suzuki BRP Aprilia Triumph Vespa Moto Guzzi Mercury Marine motorcycle dealer group Peter Stevens and publicly-listed Motorcycle Holdings.

By 2018 it became clear that a major transformation was underway with the leading banks signalling a withdrawal from automotive finance to focus on home and business finance. It was at that time that it was decided to take the Allied Credit model to the wider auto retail industry and the plan to become a leading player in all auto finance sectors in Australia was hatched.

In 2019 as the business evolved into the wider finance world Allied Credit announced changes to the leadership team. Richard Harding would focus on managing major relationships including building new joint ventures as well as continuing as the board liaison for Allied Credit’s joint venture partners and shareholders.

Matt Stevens who as CEO had led Allied Credit for the previous seven years moved to the position of deputy CEO and his responsibilities encompassed those of chief information officer and chief risk officer.

At the same time the former managing director of Macquarie Leasing Jon Moodie joined Allied Credit as CEO and is now also Allied’s managing director. His right-hand man at Macquarie Leasing Russell Bryant joined Allied Credit as chief operating officer.

Allied were reportedly interested in buying the St. George floorplan book from Westpac before the team recast their attention across to the Macquarie book which they succeeded in securing.

Today as the transition from Macquarie to Allied Credit proceeds apace Allied Credit has six joint venture operations under way and over 10 white labels.

Directors and investors

Meanwhile Richard Harding’s vision for Allied Credit has been attracting attention in the corporate funding and investment world.

As recently reported Bain Capital Credit has taken a 20 per cent share of Allied Credit and its director in Bain Capital’s special situations group Joshua Hartz has been appointed a non-executive director of Allied Credit.

Other directors include an early backer of the company Peter Ivany the man who took Hoyts Cinemas from a small chain in Australia to a global business with over 2000 theatres operating in 12 countries. After selling Hoyts in 1999 Mr Ivany established a diversified investment business Ivany Investment Group and is its executive chairman.

Mr Ivany is highly-regarded at Allied Credit for his investment at a challenging time in the company’s history and for his help in shepherding the business through the early years.

Directors Justin Lewis and Tony Stocks are partners at Sturt Capital Allied Credit’s biggest investor whIch first invested in 2014 via an investment trust and has participated in each raise since. Sturt Capital is an independent principal investment and financial advisory firm founded in 2009.

Director Guy Fowler executive chairman of Barrenjoey Capital Partners is a financial markets veteran with over 30 years’ experience and instrumental in building and running UBS Australia. He has a track record of delivering some of the largest and most complex transactions for Australia’s corporate clients including large companies institutions banks and both federal and state governments.

Alceon’s Phil Green who joined the Allied Credit board in November has more than 30 years’ experience specialising in structured finance and advisory leasing asset-based financing principal investment and funds management. Alceon has invested over $3.8 billion of capital for its high net worth family and institutional clients across real estate private equity and listed equity.

Other key investors in Allied Credit include:

Matthew Grounds and Matthew Hanning from Barrenjoey Capital

Chris Hadley chairman of Quadrant Private Equity

PointsBet chairman Brett Paton

Richard Elmslie who is the co-founder of RARE Infrastructure and an ex-ABN Amro banker.

Eagers Automotive’s largest shareholder Nick Politis is also a shareholder and was the first auto dealer to partner with Allied in an auto joint venture.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

It is easy for a self-proclaimed progressive business owner to say all the nice things about how they believe in equality and fair wages and worker rights – but when their employees unionize and come to claim those rights those nice bosses must stop talking about how nice they are and prove it. For limousine liberals dealing with unions is where the rubber hits the road.

Needless to say many Good Liberals turn out to be charlatans. There is a saying in the union world: “A boss is a boss.” This is a more pithy way of saying: “A boss is kind of a greedy jerk no matter how many ‘Nevertheless she persisted’ bumper stickers they have plastered on their Volvos.”

The New York Times is one of America’s most vital totems of mainstream liberalism right up there with expensive coffee and defensive explanations for sending your kids to private school. The New York Times is also it turns out one of America’s very best examples of how a boss is a boss. Because even as the paper pontificates about the dangers of inequality and gives sympathetic coverage to major union drives the leaders of the company’s business side are busily trying to undermine their own unions.

Last April 650 tech employees at the New York Times announced that they were unionizing. Rather than applauding them and proceeding to negotiate a contract the company instead refused to voluntarily recognize the union. This is despite its own editorial board supporting a bill that would have made it legally binding for employers to voluntarily accept union requests when they are backed by a majority of the staff.

As the paper’s own editorial explained: “Under current law an employer can reject the majority’s signatures and insist on a secret ballot. But in a disturbingly high number of cases the employer uses the time before the vote to pressure employees to rethink their decision to unionize.” Now this is what the New York Times company is accused of doing to its own employees.

Since last year the Times has been accused of trying to scare workers into changing their minds – to sow division among the employees divide the unit and erode support for organized labor. Last week federal labor regulators claimed that the company had broken the law by telling large swaths of employees that they were actually “managers” and that they were therefore prohibited from publicly supporting the union. (A hearing is scheduled for this March. A spokesperson for the Times said they “strongly disagree” with the union’s allegations.)

If you find this sort of anti-union behavior from the New York Times surprising remember that another unit of unionized workers at the paper those who worked for the product review section Wirecutter had to go on strike during the busy Black Friday shopping weekend in order to secure a minimally fair contract. So while most of the editorial employees at the Times have been unionized for decades the company is still exhibiting a chesty commitment to doing everything possible to keep any more of its workers from securing the same sort of benefits.

I don’t want to get caught up here in the details of labor regulations and lose sight of the big picture. Which is this: the New York Times Company which makes its money by branding itself as the foremost defender of liberal American values is fighting against its own workers pursuing their right to organize a union and bargain collectively.



Respectable people don’t engage in union-busting. People who run anti-union campaigns are not Good Liberals

To me that makes the New York Times an anti-union company. I can say this with no qualms. Companies that are not anti-union will honor a formal request from their employees for voluntary union recognition; they will bargain fair contracts that include pay equity for all; and they will certainly not run internal messaging campaigns trying to convince their employees that unionizing is a bad idea.

The New York Times has done all of these things quite recently. This means that it can stand proudly with its dishonorable peers across corporate America in that regard. While its writers editorialize against the deep political and economic problems plaguing our country its management is very much a part of those problems.

The New York Times gets away with a lot. They are the journalism equivalent of the supreme court. They offer prestige big budgets and job stability at a time when those things are in short supply in this industry. The half of our country terrified by Trump sees them as an army of truth and everyone in media wants to work there. (Call me!) But let’s be honest: the people who control the New York Times company are acting like real weasels.

It’s not just that they are hypocritical yammering about the public good while acting from pure selfishness – it’s that they want to have it both ways. While more outwardly evil media bosses like Rupert Murdoch may be proud to embrace their Ayn Randian reputation those who lead the Times want to be accepted as good people on the Brooklyn-brownstone cocktail party circuit even as they quietly try to stop those who work for them from having an equal seat at their tastefully appointed table. Screw that.

I have covered hundreds of anti-union campaigns. No matter where they happen they are all based on lies and fear. Whether they happen at an Amazon warehouse or at the New York Times they are a demonstration of contempt for the idea that an employee may deserve to be treated as someone whose humanity is just as real as that of an employer.

Respectable people don’t engage in union-busting. People who run anti-union campaigns are not Good Liberals. Hundreds of workers raising their voices have not been enough to convince the New York Times executives to act right. Maybe it’s time to stop inviting them to the cocktail parties.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGNhbGlzdGVjaC5jb20vY3RlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMCw3MzQwLEwtMzkyNjc5OSwwMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Addon Optics raises $12 million for multifocal lenses platform | Ctech,"Israeli company Addon Optics has raised $12 million from AP Partners in its second equity round to date. AP Partners was the only investor to participate in this round. To date Addon Optics has raised $8 million from angels and funds Kli Capital Rimonci Capital Wilson Ave and Sapir Venture Partners.

Based in Kadima-Zoran Addon Optics was founded in 2016 by Amir Erlichman (CEO) and Haim Engler based on a technology platform co-developed with Prof. Yoel Arieli head of the department of electro-optics engineering at the Lev Academic Center in Jerusalem.

Erlichman is a seasoned entrepreneur and angel investor with extensive experience running high-tech companies. He chaired Kasamba sold to LivePerson worked as a senior partner at Israel VC fund Yozma and as an investment banker at Lehman Brothers. Engler is a serial entrepreneur with over 30 years of high-tech experience. Among others he founded and served as CTO of Code Red which specializes in broad area Wi-Fi network administration and security.

Addon Optics' technology platform integrates an off-the-shelf single-focal lens with a proprietary flexible lens to create a high-quality progressive lens using a machine the size of a 3D printer requiring a low capital outlay. Multifocal lenses correct several vision ranges – far near and intermediate eliminating consumers' needs to switch eyeglasses for different uses. As a result multifocal lenses have become the default preference for everyone with eyesight issues particularly those older than 40. The global market for multifocal lenses is estimated at more than $10 billion.

Addon employs 20 people and plans to recruit aggressively over the coming year to accommodate its global expansion.

“Given the current cost structure of production and distribution of multifocal eyeglasses Addon Optics' technology platform can potentially transform the lives of millions with a more affordable progressive lens solution” said Addon Optics' CEO Amir Erlichman. “With Addon technology multifocal prescription eyewear will become accessible to various populations greatly enhancing their quality of life.”",,,,,,

With host Rootstown locked in a tight battle with Streetsboro for the Portage County Tournament crown sophomore Tyler Paulus freshmen Brian Youngblood and Tristen McKibben and senior Cody Coontz stacked up back-to-back-to-back-to-back titles.

Tack on a runner-up finish from Will McEwuen and a trio of third-place finishes from Nick Malek Dylan Wise and Sylas Reiheld and Rootstown (206) captured the team title ahead of runner-up Garfield (179) which surged late and third-place Streetsboro (173.5).

""We all just kind of push each other in the room"" Youngblood said. ""We have this bond where it seems like we hate each other in the wrestling room and as soon as we're out we're like best friends again.""

Tyler Paulus Brian Youngblood Tristen McKibben Cody Coontz win four straight titles for Rootstown

Tyler Paulus a sophomore making his PCT debut got Rootstown rolling by capturing a back-and-forth title clash at 132 with Drake Rennecker. The Crestwood sophomore threatened to take control of the match with a reversal and near fall midway through the second but Paulus got Rennecker by the side toward the end of the period for a pin.

Next up Youngblood captured a similarly back-and-forth match. Trailing 2-0 in the first Youngblood escaped then got Garfield's Tim Sommer by the ankles to take a 3-2 lead.

""It kind of just came to me all the sudden"" Youngblood said. ""I don't know how to explain it. During a wrestling match you don't think. It just comes to you and then you just go.""

Knotted at three entering the second Youngblood starting on the bottom spun around quick to get Sommer on his front for a 5-3 lead then got Sommer by the back of the knee toward the end of the period for a 7-4 lead en route to a 9-7 victory.

""One of my team captains Cody Coontz always tells me that I got to finish a shot"" Youngblood said. ""It's an old middle-school habit that I keep trying to break and I was like 'Oh crud Cody is going to be mad if I don't finish this shot.'""

McKibben's 150-pound title match with Red Devils senior Ethan Strahan was no less epic. Tied at two after a period McKibben managed to ride Strahan out in the second.

Still knotted at two in the third McKibben starting in the down position escaped and got behind Strahan for two points 30 seconds into the third holding on for a 4-3 win.

That left the streak alive for Coontz a PCT runner-up last season who is one of the lone upperclassmen on the Rovers and Coontz maintained it with a pin in 2:55.

Garfield Streetsboro climb the team standings

Rootstown's streak finally came to an end in the 165-pound title match which instead featured a State Route 88 battle of state qualifiers in Garfield junior Hunter Andel (who placed in 2021) and Ravenna senior Shane Michael (who qualified in 2020).

Andel got out to a 2-0 lead in the first period then proved nearly impossible to score on staying compact on his knees in the second then riding on top for the bulk of the third.

G-Men sophomore Keegan Sell another returning state placer followed with a title at 175. Amazingly Sell won all three of his matches Saturday by first-period pin.

Garfield junior Grayson Hoover was no less impressive earlier.

Seeded third at 120 pounds Hoover advanced to the title match with a pair of pins late in the first round then toppled top-seeded Morgan Harris of Streetsboro 6-0.

The Rockets ended up just a few points behind the G-Men but they showed impressive depth throughout the tournament. Streetsboro advanced a wrestler to the finals in five out of 14 weight classes including the three lowest weights (106 113 120) and the Rockets were also represented in four third-place bouts.

Junior Donovan Paes (132) and sophomore Aiden Carone (106) both captured titles for Streetsboro.

Mogadore Southeast stage memorable upperweight battles

There was a brief feeling of deprivation late in the afternoon as a tantalizing 190-pound title match between Mogadore's Tyler Knight and Southeast's Jaidyn Sapp was scrapped.

Knight and Sapp met last year at a dual meet the PCT the district meet and the state meet but Knight just made his return from a serious injury earlier this week so Wildcats coach Duane Funk elected to have Knight sit out the 190-pound championship match.

""[Off] four practices you're not going to wrestle a guy that got fifth in the state last year"" Funk said. ""Nobody could do that but I wanted to get him some mat time [earlier in the tournament].""

A Mogadore-Southeast thriller couldn't be put off for long however with the Pirates and Wildcats meeting in the 190 215 and 285 finals.

At 215 Mogadore's Michael Lowe and Southeast's Spencer Mesaros both seniors had a battle for the ages — and the rages as it turned out.

Nearly every point was controversial with Lowe awarded two penalty points for stalling that infuriated the Pirates to no end and Mesaros getting behind Lowe for two points with the Wildcats furious as can be claiming the wrestlers were out of bounds. Knotted at two with two seconds to go Lowe pulled off a remarkable escape for a 3-2 win.

""You don't see too many 215-pound kids hit Granby [rolls]"" Funk said. ""If they do it right you're good and that was perfect.""

Mogadore junior heavyweight Tyler Shellenbarger followed with a pin in 40 seconds giving the Wildcats three individual titles after Brady Funk captured his second straight PCT title earlier in the day.

Crestwood's J.P. Wrobel also made it two straight PCT championships following an epic title bout against fellow state qualifier Mason Amodio of Southeast. Amodio stayed on top the entire second period and led 1-0 early in the third before Wrobel got Amodio's leg up 30 seconds into the third period and knocked him down for a 2-1 lead.

Following Amodio's escape to tie the score Wrobel lifted Amodio's leg once more. This time Amodio wriggled free but Wrobel raced behind him for what turned out to be the winning shot in a 4-3 victory.

Comelec Resolution No. 10728 contains the rules and regulations on the ban on the: bearing carrying or transporting of firearms or other deadly weapons; and employment availment or engagement or the services of security personnel or bodyguards during the election period of the May 9 2022 national and local elections.

Comelec Resolution No. 10741 is a consolidated resolution on the guidelines on the establishment and operation of Comelec checkpoints; and instructions for the preliminary examination of violations of the ban on the bearing carrying or transporting firearms or other deadly weapons and the employment availment and engagement of the services of security personnel and bodyguards in connection with the May 9 2022 national and local elections.

Cañete said effective January 9 until June 8 which is the election period all permits to carry (PTC) firearms issued to civilian licensed gun holders are automatically suspended.

“The PTC are automatically recalled unless they managed to secure a certificate of authority coming from Comelec central office” Cañete said.

He said the Comelec central office has issued an authorization to carry firearms in December 2021 to the Philippine National Police and Armed Forces of the Philippines.

Candidates who need bodyguards will have to apply for authorization from the Comelec central office he added.

He said applying for authorization is now easy and fast as the processing of applications is automated or online.

The development will rise on a large site situated just to the north of Roosevelt Boulevard and just to the east of the Northeast Tower Center shopping mall. The building will be fully sprinkled. Permits list Truman Gee as the design professional Swinerton Builders as the contractor and a construction cost of $6 million.

The permit is one of the first to be issued for new construction in Philadelphia in 2022 coming during a slowdown following an end-of-year permit issue frenzy when developers raced to secure permits before the expiration of the full ten-year tax abatement program.

The multi-acre lot is largely vacant partially occupied by a large warehouse-style structure. A MapQuest listing specifies Jimmys Tree & Landscape Contractors as situated at the location. A still-posted listing by Corporate Partners & Co. Inc. specifies the site as for sale for $5 million.

The development site is situated in the southwest section of Near Northeast Philadelphia reasonably proximate to the dense mass-transit-oriented Upper North Philadelphia communities of Olney and Fern Rock. However despite a relatively high residential density Lawncrest has a distinctive suburban sprawled-out auto-oriented flair similar to numerous other Northeast Philly communities notably those along major thoroughfares such as Roosevelt Boulevard.

The site at 4890 Summerdale Avenue sits between a residential enclave to the south a playground with baseball fields to the east the aforementioned shopping mall to the west (notable to drivers on Roosevelt Boulevard via the prominent “Home Depot” lettering painted onto a tall prewar chimney) and vacant commercial-industrial lots to the north.

Given these surroundings a self-storage facility seems oddly appropriate where it would act as a transitional element between the residential community and the adjacent mall and vacant land. And while we generally see high-rise construction as the proper design solution to many urban needs we are glad that the building is planned to rise only three stories tall as a larger hulking self-storage facility would have overwhelmed the surrounding community.

While the development is appropriate for the site’s current conditions we hope that one day the city constructs the subway line that was once proposed for Roosevelt Boulevard allowing the surrounding area to transform from a middling urban-suburban area into a walkable transit-accessible community.

While automakers and various innovative ventures have been working to develop fully autonomous vehicles time has proven the task to be much more complex than initially perceived for a host of reasons.

One of the realities of the future of automotive is that more and more connected things in a vehicle will be required to work together much of it in real time.

A digital platform for cars is needed to tie all the connected capabilities together according to Qualcomm CEO and president Cristiano Amon who detailed his company’s roadmap.

Qualcomm introduced its Snapdragon Ride Vision System which features front rear and surround video cameras.

The key is that Qualcomm is not going it alone announcing partnerships with companies including Honda Volvo and Renault noting that it is also working with most major automakers including Mercedes-Benz BMW Toyota and Chevrolet.

The Snapdragon digital chassis uses AI for in-car virtual assistance aiming to create natural interactions between the driver and the vehicle.

Messaging such as notification about approaching emergency vehicles as well as driver attention monitoring are expected in such platforms.

While Qualcomm has traditionally been focused on mobile with its chips in most mobile phones the company sees an expanded future in automotive platforms.

While experimentation and the development of driverless vehicles continues innovations for actual car drivers in the future are expected to start showing up in cars in 2024.

Almost every smartphone or tablet you see is powered by either a Qualcomm Snapdragon or MediaTek chipset. But the tremendous growth in the performance of mobile devices over the last few years implies that even the slightest of differences in performance can significantly impact a buyer’s decision. Companies such as Apple have played this to their advantage by hailing the performance of its custom chips over counterparts from Qualcomm and MediaTek.

With swarms of phone manufacturers exploring ways to design their own custom smartphone chipsets in a bid to offer a customized experience to the users. the phenomenon appears to be on the rise. Will Qualcomm and MediaTek succumb to this pressure from companies designing their chips in-house?

Samsung and Huawei have been making chips for a while

Smartphone brands already design their own custom ARM-based chipsets — although at a relatively smaller scale than Qualcomm or MediaTek. Samsung is unquestionably the first brand that comes to mind when we think about phone brands that design or even develop their own processors. Another phone brand that does so is Huawei which is relatively lesser-known for its in-house chips.

Even though one is most likely to recall Samsung’s Exynos lineup of smartphone chips the company has been making processors for electronic devices like handheld multimedia devices personal digital assistants and candy bar phones for more than two decades. In fact the first Apple iPhone used a Samsung processor — although the Exynos series had not been conceived until then. It must be noted that Samsung’s mobile and semiconductor divisions are separate entities operating under the same brands and Samsung Semiconductors which manufactures the Exynos line of chipsets also manufactures the Snapdragon 888/888 Plus and the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 system on a chip (SoC).

The Exynos branding was first introduced in 2011 with the Samsung Galaxy S II which ran on an Exynos 4210 a dual-core processor that featured ARM’s Cortex-A9 cores and was built on a 45nm process. Fast forward to early 2021; Samsung announced the Exynos 2100 just two days before the Galaxy S21 series was officially released. The Exynos 2100 was praised for being the first ARM chipset from Samsung in several years that matched up to Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 88 chip in terms of performance but its limited availability on just Samsung’s flagship series has precluded it from dominating Qualcomm or Snapdragon and the same goes for Huawei’s HiSilicon Kirin chips.

Apple fuels the buzz around custom silicon

In 2020 Apple sparked the buzz around “custom silicon” as it broke ties with Intel for its Mac lineup. The company revealed Apple M1 the first ARM-based chipset for Macs which consolidated the CPU GPU memory and storage on a single chip. It’s only fair to say Apple broke the internet by choosing a custom solution and ending its dependency on Intel. The Apple M1 chip has been seen to offer much better performance and thermal efficiency than the latest Intel x86-64 chips used in the previous Mac machines. The upgraded versions — Apple M1 Pro and the M1 Max — that launched with the latest 2021 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are much more efficient in terms of CPU and GPU performance and offer up to 64 gigabytes of bundled RAM.

While the performance and power efficiency of Apple’s custom silicon chips is something to be envied — and is being attempted to be replicated by Qualcomm through its ARM solutions — the biggest takeaway from this announcement appears to be the marketing of custom chips. Besides Chinese companies that include Oppo Vivo and Xiaomi Google also happens to be riding this wave and has announced its entry into the world of custom silicon solutions beginning with the Google Tensor chipset announced earlier this year.

Meanwhile Apple has also been designing its custom A-series chips for iPhones and iPads and is also exploring options to manufacture its own 5G modems after acquiring Intel’s chipmaking business.

Google Tensor inspires other manufacturers

In 2021 Google launched its custom silicon Tensor for the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro. The chipset shares its name with Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) used inside the giant’s data centers. The Tensor SoC is designed by Google for Pixel smartphones and is produced in partnership with Samsung. While based on the Exynos platform the chipset is the first non-Samsung chip to use an Exynos 5G modem and is designed to cater to on-device A.I. and machine learning capabilities. As per Google the objective behind the custom chipset is to bypass the limitations of chipsets from Qualcomm and enable workloads that were previously not achievable on “standard” mobile platforms by other silicon manufacturers.

Before the Pixel 6 launch event Qualcomm could be seen letting off steam by subtweeting.

""We've decided to make our own smartphone SoC instead of using Snapdragon"" 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 — Snapdragon (@Snapdragon) October 13 2021

Unlike any other flagship chipset from Qualcomm MediaTek or brands like Samsung and Huawei the Google Tensor uses two ARM Cortex X1 cores for high-performance threads to satiate the requirement for demanding A.I. as well as machine learning applications. This custom solution also allows Google to use low-powered and older-generation middle cores in an attempt to keep power demand and heat dissipation under control — although there have been numerous complaints about overheating. The chipset also uses a custom 20-core Mali-G78 GPU to prioritize graphics tasks such as instant photo and video processing as well as AR applications.

Chinese companies vie to make in-house chips

Chinese smartphone brands such as OPPO and Xiaomi have also been vying to replace Qualcomm and MediaTek chips with their own custom silicon. Xiaomi launched its first custom chipset called Surge S1 for the higher midrange of smartphones. The chipset was specifically designed for the Xiaomi Mi 5C. Although structurally similar to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 660 the Surge S1 chip featured a custom Mali GPU and was primarily designed to offer a more optimized software experience on Xiaomi’s custom Android skin MIUI and to help it cut its dependence on Qualcomm and MediaTek especially for devices to be sold in mainland China.

The Surge S1 was to be followed by the S2 but the proposed successor never materialized and Xiaomi eventually abandoned (via Weibo) its endeavors to make a custom chip. However a year after it reportedly pulled the plug on its custom chipset lineup Xiaomi seems to be working on rebuilding a team and seeking IP for its next chipset as per sources from China (via Android Headlines).

At the same time Oppo has also been reported by Nikkei to be working with Taiwan’s TSMC to release custom chipsets in 2023 or 2024. The company has already embarked on its custom silicon journey with its custom MariSilicon X neural processing unit (NPU) which was showcased at the Oppo Inno Day event in December. MariSilicon X essentially combines the NPU with the image signal processor and features a dedicated memory subsystem. All of these components combined will give Oppo phones the ability to process HDR in 4K video recording and A.I.-related camera optimizations in real time.

The first device to feature Oppo’s custom MariSilicon X chip is the Find X4 which launches in the first quarter of next year. Meanwhile because Oppo shares its ownership with other prominent phone brands including Vivo and Realme — and has recently been remerged with OnePlus we can expect to see more devices from these brands also benefiting from Oppo’s developments.

Along with Oppo Vivo has also been weighing in on different Snapdragon alternatives. Last year it announced the Chinese versions of the Vivo X60 and the X60 Pro with Samsung’s Exynos 1080 chipset. Meanwhile Vivo also announced its custom V1 image signal processor (ISP) for its flagship Vivo X70 Pro Plus. The custom ISP — in conjunction with Zeiss Optics — is claimed to offer professional-quality photographs with some A.I. processing on board.

Looking at the legion of Chinese smartphone companies it is fairly evident that they are trying to reduce their dependence on Qualcomm and MediaTek. It’s natural to question why that is so important. And to answer that we have two potential explanations for why it is a must for companies to have capable firepower against Qualcomm.

Evading Qualcomm’s monopoly

For many years Qualcomm and MediaTek have been the frontrunners in terms of the chipset market share. Of the two leading chipmakers Qualcomm has had a stronger hold and it’s easy to correlate this dominance with the historic notion about its chipsets outperforming the competition including MediaTek Samsung’s Exynos and Huawei’s HiSilicon Kirin. However the story has more caveats than one would naturally imagine.

Before we go over those caveats here’s a brief history of Qualcomm making its way into the chipset market. The chipmaker began its journey in 1985 as a satellite communications and telecom equipment provider. It invested hugely in revamping and marketing CDMA wireless technology and collected well over 100000 patents for wireless communications via phones. Qualcomm also developed CDMA-based handheld phones in the late 1990s but eventually sold its business to Japan’s Kyocera Corporation to cover losses.

Qualcomm actually became relevant in the chipset industry with its introduction of the Scorpion series mobile chipsets in 2007. This series is what we know as Snapdragon now. By adopting an SoC design Qualcomm bundled its baseband processor — or modems — into the mobile chips that it eventually began selling to phone manufacturers. Given Qualcomm’s control over the CDMA standard it was able to employ aggressive licensing strategies with smartphone companies including single-handedly controlling the terms for licensing deals and threatening to cut off supplies abruptly. These tactics were identified as part of an antitrust ruling against Qualcomm in 2019 — a case that had initially begun with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) suing Qualcomm for anticompetitive practices in 2017.

Days after FTC’s lawsuit against Qualcomm Apple sued Qualcomm for another $1 billion for not paying the promised rebates in licensing fees if it chose Qualcomm exclusively for its modems. Apple also highlighted the latter’s “no license — no chip” policy which implies phone companies had to agree to pay license fees for its entire portfolio of patents.

Instead of just selling their SoC’s Qualcomm arranged licensing agreements for the use of CDMA-based wireless technologies where licensees had to pay a fee based on the price of the handsets. Qualcomm made a good profit overall irrespective of whether it was only selling these components as part of an SoC or not.

Despite its legal binding Qualcomm refused to share its patents with competitors including Intel. This meant that Qualcomm was for several years the sole provider of CDMA modems and forced companies including Apple to rely on it for these chips. Incidentally it shared its patents with smaller — at that time — competitors including MediaTek. But since Qualcomm was the leading manufacturer of high-end chipsets during the early smartphone years smartphone companies had to rely on it for the entire SoC and not just the modem.

In some other cases Qualcomm also offered discounts in its licensing fees to smartphone companies if they agreed to use Snapdragon chipsets on at least 85 percent — and in certain cases 100 percent — of their smartphones. Besides the U.S. these monopolistic practices got Qualcomm on the radar of — and hefty fines from — anticompetition agencies in Korea Japan China Taiwan amd the European Union.

With the 2019 ruling against Qualcomm the chipmaker was forced to renegotiate its licensing terms with most phone makers without threatening to cut off supplies for modems.

However with Qualcomm still supplying over 50 percent of the chipset modems (as of 2018) its dominant monopoly is difficult to refute if companies keep relying on the Snapdragon lineup. Therefore using custom solutions is a solid mechanism to skirt and thwart Qualcomm’s stronghold.

Fear of U.S. government

While trying to fight its monopoly is surely one of the reasons why smartphone companies are preparing to stock up against Qualcomm the U.S.-China trade war might have also led phone companies — especially Chinese ones— to be prepared for any sudden action against them. One of the major blows in the trade war came when the U.S. government under former president Donald Trump issued executive orders barring Huawei from engaging in business with any American company on grounds of national security.

Huawei which was barred from using Android or engaging in commercial activities with companies like ARM was suitably prepared to mitigate the impact of this blow because of its custom Kirin lineup of mobile chipsets. In the face of such adversity business would come to a halt overnight for any other company that does not have its own range of chipsets ready to replace Qualcomm’s offerings.

MediaTek Samsung close in on Qualcomm

Despite Qualcomm’s early advantage in mobile computing competitors MediaTek and Samsung have been closing in on it in terms of chipset performance. Samsung announced its Exynos 2100 earlier this year with the Galaxy S21 series which boasted performance and power efficiency on par with Qualcomm’s then-latest flagship chipset the Snapdragon 888.

Later on in the year MediaTek also announced the Dimensity 9000 chipset — its greatest flagship chipset in many years — that is set to compete with the Snapdragon 888 and the more recent Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipsets. In 2020 MediaTek also surpassed Qualcomm as the largest supplier of smartphones chipsets and the gap has only been growing with each passing quarter.

Qualcomm diversifies

Meanwhile Qualcomm is diversifying into multiple different markets beyond smartphones. It is catering to chipsets for wearables such as smartwatches and TWS headsets extended reality (XR) headsets 5G and Wi-Fi 6/6e connectivity solutions connected cars A.I. automation in industries and Internet of Things (IoT) beyond the home in industrial and medical environments.

Despite rising competition Qualcomm has been posting better financial results than forecasts. Even as companies such as Apple grapple to fulfill demand due to the ongoing chip shortage Qualcomm sailed through with 55 percent year-to-year growth in revenue in the fiscal year ending in 2021.

MediaTek on the other hand has been focused on consumer electronics. Besides smartphones the company has been working on its portfolio of chipsets for Chromebooks smart and Android TVs Wi-Fi routers and 5G hot spot solutions. Alongside the Dimensity 9000 the company also announced Kompanio 820 and 828 chips for mobile PCs that offer higher power efficiency as compared to counterparts from Intel as well as a 7nm Pentonic 2000 chip to offer up to 8K video playback with A.I. upscaling and Dolby Vision on smart TVs.

Qualcomm and MediaTek May be hard to replace

We spoke to leading industry analysts who shared their insights on why smartphone companies leaning into chip design may have a tough time uprooting Qualcomm and MediaTek. All of them unequivocally agree it is difficult to replicate the same success as Qualcomm and MediaTek instantly as it may take companies several years to gain the same expertise as these giants.

Avi Greengart president and lead analyst at Techsponential tells us: “Designing your own silicon is difficult and expensive but it can be a great way to differentiate your device and if volumes are high enough can improve margins. However competition is fierce: Apple sets a very high bar and Qualcomm and MediaTek are pushing hard to keep up. If your in-house chip does not provide the same performance functionality connectivity and power efficiency than what you can buy from Qualcomm MediaTek or Samsung your phone will be less competitive not more. ”

Greengart elaborates that chips limited to a single brand may not only be less fierce than the competition but will also be more expensive to produce and scale. The only company succeeding at it well is Apple which sets a high bar for performance throughput with its A-series Bionic chips that use custom designs instead of simply rebranding IPs from ARM like other companies in the list.

Tarun Pathak research director at Counterpoint Research states: “Designing chips is complex. They have become multifunctional and integrating CPU GPU DSP ISP with optimized performance is a very challenging task for any [manufacturer]. Then there is also a challenge of integrating RF and modem with the SoC. [The] short answer is it might take several years and significant resources for [manufacturers] to reach … the level to compete with the likes of MediaTek and Qualcomm.”

Pathak also highlights that Qualcomm’s prowess in designing non-smartphone chipsets has given rise to opportunities worth $10 billion cumulatively. These include the company’s endeavors in RF front-end parts automobiles and other IoT components.

Navkendar Singh research director at IDC India says: “For established players like [MediaTek] or Qualcomm it is not a big worry as of now. Bringing in-house chips to the market and scaling up is a costly and time-consuming process. And even after launch it required integration testing and acceptability in the market. Furthermore brands like Oppo and OnePlus merge they can share more resources and eventually chips development as well. However this still requires a few years of effort and investment before their own devices are replaced with [their] own chips.”

Singh remarks that while Qualcomm and MediaTek benefit from their vast portfolio of clients the two chipmakers should be wary of advancements and research and development in areas such as A.I. machine learning and camera technologies especially when it comes to custom solutions like the Google Tensor that are capable of enticing a significant population of loyalists. This drift will be a cause of worry for Qualcomm and MediaTek.

Here’s everything found under the hood on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.

This article was originally published in August of 2021 and has been updated to reflect the final specs of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro since their October 2021 release.

Google Tensor chip

To kick things off let’s talk about the biggest thing these phones have in common and the most notable part of Google’s release – the Tensor chipset.

Both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro leave behind the typical Qualcomm Snapdragon chip found in most Android flagships and instead use “Tensor.” This chip is designed by Google specifically for the needs of Pixel though the chip does notably have its foundation in Samsung’s Exynos designs.

What sets Tensor apart? It’s not the performance. On paper and in real-life use Tensor is essentially on par with the Qualcomm chip of the same year the Snapdragon 888. On Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro that equates to smooth performance across general tasks and even games but Tensor tends to heat up a little quicker and be a little less efficient compared to Qualcomm’s chip.

In a deep-dive AnandTech found that Tensor’s GPU was on paper an absolute beast but was held back by thermals. Meanwhile AI tasks such as the natural-language processing we love so much on Pixel 6 was the star of the show outpacing all of its competition at the time. As of January 2021 MediaTek’s next-gen flagship chip seems to be taking the crown but Google’s inital showing is nonetheless very impressive.

Google Tensor utilizes a somewhat unorthodox setup for its physical design with two Cortex-X1 cores two Cortex-A76 cores and four Cortex-A55 cores. The use of two Cortex-X1 cores should have provided a performance boost over other same-year competitors but the use of older A76 cores really hinders the setup.

Despite the pros and cons though Tensor is a pretty impressive initial showing for Google’s mobile chip design and it leads the charge to make Pixel 6 specs 80% more powerful than Google’s previous Pixel 5 as the company has claimed.

Pixel 6 specs

Google’s $599 device the Pixel 6 is its mass-market model that’s meant to be affordable but doesn’t really skimp on the spec sheet. This “smaller” phone has a 6.4-inch 1080p display which has a 90Hz refresh rate to ensure smooth scrolling. The glass over top of the display is flat and has an optical fingerprint sensor underneath. The Tensor chip is paired with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage with no expansion option.

Meanwhile the hardware has metal rails coated in a black matte texture with glass along the back the splits the color into two tones. There’s no headphone jack on the device but it isn’t a portless phone. A USB-C port serves to charge the 4614 mAh battery. Charging can hit around 23W over a USB-C cable and up to 21W with Google’s new Pixel Stand.

Pixel 6 Pro specs

The Pixel 6 Pro meanwhile supercharges a couple of key areas.

Starting with the display the panel here is larger at 6.7 inches. It also carries a faster 120Hz refresh rate higher resolution and has curved glass along the top. The curve is consistent with some of Samsung’s older flagships falling into the aluminum rails. It makes screen protectors a bit more difficult making options for tempered glass few and far in between. As with the smaller model an under-display fingerprint sensor is being used.

The hardware will see the metal rails along the side polished instead of a matte texture and the colorways are also more subdued.

Inside the Tensor chip is paired with 12GB of RAM and either 128 256 or 512GB of storage. There’s also a 5000 mAh battery with fast charging up to around 23W both wired over USB-C and wireless with the second-generation Pixel Stand.

The biggest upgrade that the Pixel 6 Pro delivers on the specs sheet over the base model is in its camera setup. There’s the same 50MP main camera and 12MP ultrawide but with the addition of a 48MP sensor that has a 4x telephoto lens on top. We’ve been incredibly impressed with the results of that zoom sensor. The selfie camera is also upgraded to an 11.1MP sensor with a wider lens.

Here's how,"Residents can now order at-home COVID tests for free through the United States Postal Service thanks to a new federal government website that officially went live Wednesday.

Four kits per address can be ordered at COVIDtests.gov. Once ordered the site says you’ll receive email confirmation as well as estimated time of delivery a tracking number and other shipping updates. Tests are expected to be mailed within seven to 12 days.

""To promote broad access"" however ""the initial program will only allow 4 free individual tests per residential address"" according to the section for frequently asked questions on the website.

A credit or debit card isn't needed to order the tests because there is no cost but you will not be able to select a particular brand of tests as part of the program.

The tests are part of the Biden administration's purchase of 500 million tests last month to help tackle a record surge in infections during the holidays.

Where to find at-home COVID tests

If you are trying to find an at-home test now – before the free tests come through USPS – it can be a daunting task.

But at-home COVID-19 tests are being sold at drug stores and other locations. Some offer rapid results while others have to be shipped off to a lab to be processed.

They are in short supply so it may be difficult to find tests in stock. Here are a few places to start your search:

The Biden administration had announced in early January that it would require insurance companies to cover the cost of at-home COVID-19 tests beginning Jan. 15 up to eight tests per covered person each month. The tests will either be paid for up front by the person's health plan or get reimbursed after a claim is submitted.

The administration is also working to provide up to 50 million at-home tests for free to community health centers and other clinics which will then distribute them at no cost.

Where to get COVID testing in OKC

The Oklahoma City-County Health Department has paused COVID-19 testing at all of its locations ""until further notice"" as of Feb. 22 2022.

The Health Department has a list of many other testing locations on its website testokc.com.

IMMY Labs: IMMY Labs is offering drive-through testing at a number of locations including Oklahoma City Norman Midwest City and Edmond. Locations and appointment times can be found here.

Diagnostic Laboratory of Oklahoma: Because of a decline in cases drive-through COVID-19 testing is no longer offered at DLO but testing is stavailable at most DLO locations throughout the state. Visit DLO's website to find a location and make an appointment.

Walgreens: Tests are available at a number of locations.

CVS: Tests are available at a number of locations.

Walmart: Tests are available at a number of locations. People interested in getting tested can fill out a questionnaire through Quest Diagnostics to determine if they're eligible for a free test without a doctor's order. Combination COVID and flu tests are also available.

Crest Foods: Several Crest grocery store locations are offering drive-through COVID-19 testing including in Edmond Oklahoma City Yukon Moore and Midwest City according to Crest Foods' Facebook page. Weekday hours are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday hours are 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Curative: PCR or rapid tests available in Oklahoma City by appointment. Some walk-in slots may be available.

Oklahoma COVID Testing Center: PCR or rapid tests in Edmond and The Village by appointment. Walk-ins may also be accepted.

Tower Theatre: Rapid and PCR tests available on Tuesdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 425 NW 23.

As of Monday Feb. 21 Oklahoma City Public Schools is offering testing for students staff as well as family members of students and staff. A full list of testing locations can be found here.

More options: The Oklahoma Health Department has a list of COVID-19 testing sites many of which are at local health departments across the state. The state Health Department recommends calling ahead before visiting a location.

Don't go to the ER just for COVID testing

But health leaders are also asking people with mild symptoms to avoid going to the emergency room just to get a COVID-19 test.

Oklahoma City hospitals have seen their emergency rooms packed with people seeking testing. They're asking people to use other options for testing and reserve visits to the ER for emergencies.

""While emergency rooms remain ready and able to treat urgent medical conditions they are not the place to go to get tested for COVID"" Patti Davis president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association said in a statement.

Related:While omicron symptoms are mild for some COVID is overwhelming OKC hospital staff ERs

Davis in a joint statement with the Oklahoma City-County Health Department urged the public to use one of numerous testing sites across Oklahoma County instead.

""This will enable healthcare providers in emergency rooms to focus on treating urgent medical needs and potentially saving lives"" she said.

As COVID-19 cases have skyrocketed after the holidays so has demand for testing. At-home tests are still hard to come by but testing is still available at physical locations and is typically provided at no cost. PCR test results generally come back in 24-48 hours but turnaround times may be longer when demand is high.

When to get a COVID test

Health officials have said to get a test if you have symptoms of COVID-19. Those can include fever chills cough shortness of breath fatigue muscle or body aches headache loss of taste or smell sore throat congestion or runny nose nausea or vomiting and diarrhea.

People also should get a test if they have had close contact with someone infected with COVID-19 defined as spending 15 or more minutes within 6 feet of an infected person.

Looking to buy Nike sneakers Adidas sweats Crocs clogs Polo shirts or Canada Goose parkas?

You’re likely to have better luck these days snagging them from their own stores or on their websites than at mom-and-pops and smaller chains.

These major brands and other top shoe and clothing labels are all cutting back on the number of outside retailers that carry their goods and concentrating their efforts on getting customers to buy directly from their own channels as well as a narrow group of wholesale partners.

The shift means shoppers will find fewer places to buy leading brands and also puts pressure on retailers that will no longer be able to stock highly-sought after shoes and clothes on their shelves according to retail experts.

Selling to customers directly allows brands to make more money control their prices and showcase products exactly the way they want in their store displays. They also can prevent their labels from being discounted too heavily which could weaken their brand image and pricing power.

“We are less interested in undifferentiated small players that don’t have particularly good service levels or in-store standards” Crocs (CROX) CEO Andrew Rees said on an analyst call in April.

By offering less stuff at wholesale brands can also hit the sweet spot for their business — high demand and tight supply.

Strategies to pull away from other retailers started well before the Covid-19 pandemic of course but have sped up over the last two years.

“Even if brands weren’t heavily focused on direct [sales] pre-Covid now they are” said Susan Anderson an analyst at B. Riley Securities.

In fact brands have used the pandemic to accelerate plans to grow directly through their own channels especially online. At the beginning of the pandemic for example stores were closed with no choice but to push customers to buy online.

Once stores reopened and customers pounced on new clothes shoes and wardrobes there was a huge mismatch between demand and supply. Brands had little if any extra merchandise to send to retailers and they prioritized feeding inventory to their own stores and websites.

Under Armour (UA) Ralph Lauren (RL) and others for example pulled back on sending merchandise to discount stores like T.J. Maxx — previously their options of last resort when they had excess inventory.

In addition to tightening up their wholesale partners and growing online many of these brands are opening new stores.

Some such as Under Armour Adidas and Crocs sell to Amazon but Canada Goose and Ralph Lauren have stayed away from the online giant. Some brands have been hesitant to sell on Amazon out of concerns they won’t have control over the customer experience.

Nike announced in 2019 it would stop selling on Amazon.

Nike leaves DSW and Zappos

Among big athletic brands Nike was one of the first to signal that it would cut back on the traditional retailers it sells to and concentrate on growing its direct-to-consumer business.

In 2017 Nike said it would focus its resources marketing and top products on just 40 retail partners including Foot Locker (FL)and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS). At the time Nike sold to some 30000 retailers.

Nike has since cut ties with many independent shoe stores and small chains as well as bigger names such as Urban Outfitters (URBN) Dillard’s and Zappos according to reports.

Rivals like Adidas (ADDDF) and Under Armour followed Nike’s lead by trimming down their own wholesale networks.

Nike is a top draw and if stores don’t carry it customers loyal to Nike will shop elsewhere. (The company also owns the Jordan and Converse brands.)

Nike is also DSW’s largest athletic goods’ supplier accounting for about 7% of the company’s sales in 2020. Last month Designer Brands (DBI) DSW’s parent said that Nike had shipped the last of its products to the company. Once DSW sells them in stores and online Nike will be gone from its shelves for good.

DSW believes it can replace Nike by increasing its sales of other athletic brands CEO Roger Rawlins said on an analyst call last month. “We are getting strong results really across our entire athletic portfolio” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNjIwMzMvYnRzLXN0eWxlLWhhcy1nb25lLWhpcC1ob3AtZGlvci1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLXdlLWxvb2sta9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNjIwMzMvYnRzLXN0eWxlLWhhcy1nb25lLWhpcC1ob3AtZGlvci1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLXdlLWxvb2staw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BTS’ fashion evolution from hip-hop to Dior to Louis Vuitton,"Group members V Suga Jin Jungkook RM Jimin and J-Hope made their first appearance with a simple yet streamlined look.

While Brown told the ""Full Send Podcast"" he plans on playing in the NFL again ESPN reported Saturday that the former Buc's career in the league may be in jeopardy.

""You can believe his side. You can believe the Buccaneers' side. The fact of the matter is there's a lot of history that's been built up here"" NFL insider Adam Schefter said on ESPN’s ""SportsCenter."" ""When you talk to people around the league they expressed doubt that he will get another chance in the league""

When Brown spoke to the ""Full Send Podcast"" they were his first remarks about his split from Tampa Bay.

""Of course man"" he said. ""It’s my passion. It’s what I do. Every year is a fresh start. I still like getting in shape. I still like to compete. It’s just getting started. Obviously we had some stuff that went on. It’s all about integrity and handling people the right way. I’m a football player first that’s my business. That’s what I do. That’s not who I am.

ANTONIO BROWN SHARES HIS SIDE OF BUCS OUTBURST PLANS TO PLAY AGAIN

""Sometimes people like to say I had a past … you know I never done anything to no one. Let’s get this clear. All I ever did was play football. I acted irrational and did some things people may not have understand. But that’s a part of life. For some reason I get a bad tag and a bad name. I get handled the wrong way. We as humans and we as people just want to be treated civilized.""

Brown also made it clear that his ankle is not 100% diminishing his chances of signing with another team for a Super Bowl run this season.

There’s a discrepancy in the Brown saga. Brown says he was concerned about his ankle injury during the game in whch he dramatically exited while shedding his uniform. Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians said the wide receiver never spoke to a trainer or team doctor about his ankle. Instead Arians pinned the problem on Brown complaining about getting the ball.

Amid supply glut Nvidia can play with silicon parts it uses. It may have its advantages with the availability of relatively inexpensive components and we will try to explain why.

Nvidia introduced its GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card (the list of boards is here) at a formal MSRP of $249 earlier this week. Many observers thought that the company was using its relatively inexpensive and relatively low-power GA107 graphics processing unit (GPU) for the solution. Unfortunately this is not the case. According to Inno3D the Green company uses a far more expensive GA106 silicon for this entry-level product. Yet this could be a good sign. Let’s try to analyze.

Inno3D sent a high-resolution render of its GeForce RTX 3050 as part of a press release without a cooling system revealing that the PCB uses the GA106 silicon. Unfortunately we cannot say anything about other graphics cards with the GeForce RTX 3050 badge on them for obvious reasons. Still our humble experience with GPU companies tells us that everyone uses the same silicon at launch but it might change over time. Anyway Nvidia’s GA106 and GA107 are entirely different so let’s examine these differences.

Comparison of Nvidia's GPUs

GeForce RTX 3060 Ti notebook GA107 2560 192-bit Smaller than 276 mm2 ?

The GA106 is a reasonably large (272 mm2) chip with up to 3584 CUDA cores enabled and an up to 170W TDP (the desktop version). The cut-down version has 2560 CUDA cores which overlaps with the fully-enabled GA107 graphics processor with 2560 CUDA cores used for laptops and has a TDP range between 35W and 80W.

It is a question for Nvidia which it is not inclined to answer publicly. However big OEMs want one software driver and once a company wins a contract it lasts for a cycle which happens to be a year in our modern world. So we can speculate that amid winning the high-performance early 2021 notebook cycle Nvidia has reasons to have two GPUs that overlap rather than having no GPUs to ship.

The good news for PC gamers is that Nvidia has two entry-level GPUs in production. The bad news there are miners scalpers and another bunch of people that will not let you get a GeForce RTX 3050 at its MSRP.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ZpcnN0LWhpLXJlcy1waG90b3Mtc2hvd2luZy10aGUtbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwNTBzLWdhMTA2LTE1MC1ncHUtYXBwZWFyLW9ubGluZS_SAW5odHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9maXJzdC1oaS1yZXMtcGhvdG9zLXNob3dpbmctdGhlLW52aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDUwcy1nYTEwNi0xNTAtZ3B1LWFwcGVhci1vbmxpbmUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First hi-res photos showing the GeForce RTX 3050’s GA106-150 GPU Appear Online,"Inno3D revealed our first look at the finalized version of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Twin X2 PCB. With NVIDIA going through multiple variations optimizing the unreleased graphics card it appears the company has officially completed the new GA106 GPU releasing it to manufacturers to incorporate in their custom designs.

Inno3D shows close-up images of the new GA106 GPU for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Graphics Card

NVIDIA has been incorporating the GA107 graphics processor for the company's GeForce RTX 3050 mobile series. Unfortunately the mobile graphics processor was not going to be adequate enough for desktop computers especially up against their competitors—AMD recently released the Radeon RX 6500 XT and Intel soon to launch the new Arc Alchemist A350 in the near future.

2 of 9

We recently reported that:

[...] the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti will also be featuring the GA106 GPU but a cut-down configuration. The card will feature 20 SM units and 2560 CUDA cores with a TGP of 130 Watts. The entry-level graphics card will also rock 8 GB of GDDR6 memory clocked at 14 Gbps and will be running across a 128-bit wide bus interface for a total of 224 GB/s bandwidth. The graphics card will be priced at $249 US and will launch in several custom flavors on 27th January.

With this new confirmation it is safe to say NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3050 showcases a total of 2560 CUDA cores leaving space to add the RTX 3050 Ti later on. With the utilization of the GA106 graphics card NVIDIA will allow for AIB repurposed designs currently on the market to be refactored without a lot of engineering costs. Lower costs for manufacturing will allow for the costs of components like other upcoming variants to present at a lower cost for the consumer.

It is expected for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 to offer 8GB GDDR6 memory with a memory clock of 14 Gbps. The new GPU will be in direct competition with AMD's Radeon RX 6500XT. AMD's card will present with half of the capacity of NVIDIA and have a faster clock of 18 Gbps memory. Both offerings from the two GPU giants will be the current generation's slowest desktop graphics processor that will be available. AMD's RX 6500XT will be available starting January 19 2022 while NVIDIA's RTX 3050 GPU will release eight days later on January 27th.

NVIDIA RTX 3080 12GB with more cores and memory to be announced next week

Wccftech claims to know the announcement date of NVIDIA’s new RTX 30 GPU.

Next week on January 11th at 6 AM PST NVIDIA is to announce its first ‘refresh’ of the RTX 30 series. It is not a SUPER refresh or a new Ti variant but relatively a small update to the existing RTX 3080 SKU.

According to the leaked specs GeForce RTX 3080 12GB is to feature not only 2GB more than the original 10GB model but also a wider memory bus which as result increases maximum bandwidth to 912 GB/s. Furthermore a new GA102 GPU featuring 8960 CUDA cores is to be adopted by this variant increasing the core count by 3% over the existing model.

At this point in time it is unclear why NVIDIA is releasing a newer RTX 3080 model or what will happen to the existing 10GB version. What is clear is that NVIDIA is now to announce yet another high wattage GPU in a span of two weeks. The company already revealed its RTX 3090 Ti flagship GPU with 450W TDP this Tuesday and will now add 350W TDP RTX 3080 12GB.

The RTX 3090 Ti is to launch on the same date as the entry-level RTX 3050 which is January 27th. The on-shelf date for RTX 3080 12GB is not yet known but we will make sure to report on it as soon as we learn it. Wccftech claims that on January 11th retailers may begin taking preorders for this new model however that is also yet to be confirmed.

Pricing and availability

Neither of these graphics cards are available just yet but they’re coming down the pipe in short order. The Nvidia RTX 3050 is slated to release on January 27 with a recommended retail price of $249. The AMD RX 6500 XT is coming a little sooner with a release date of January 19.

Its recommended price of just $199 makes it the notably cheaper GPU although that may not be the case in all territories. The European retail price for the 6500 XT has already been inflated to the equivalent of $340 so we’ll need to see what these cards actually retail for when they release.

Performance

We don’t have any third-party testing for these cards just yet so there is no definitive way to know how performative either of these cards are. What we can do though is look at the specifications and at the first-party comparative results released by both AMD and Nvidia at CES 2022 and make a relative estimate of how a head-to-head battle between these two cards would shake out.

Both the RTX 3050 and RX 6500 XT are designed to be 1080p graphics cards replacing older 1080p standouts like the GTX 1650 and the RX 570/580. Nvidia’s testing showed the RTX 3050 as being more than capable of delivering 60-plus frames per second (fps) in a number of major games including F1 2021 Control and Doom Eternal. But in each case that was with deep learning super sampling (DLSS) enabled which doesn’t give us a clear idea of performance because older cards like the GTX 1650 can’t use that upscaling technology and not every game supports it.

In AMD’s benchmarks it showed the RX 6500 XT as being a somewhat arbitrary 23% to 59% faster than the GTX 1650 in games like Age of Empires 4 Apex Legends and Resident Evil: Village. That’s good but without actual frame rates it doesn’t tell us much.

Looking at the specifications the RTX 3050 should have a major advantage when it comes to enabling advanced visual settings thanks to having double the GDDR6 memory. We don’t know its bandwidth yet but it should be higher than that of the RX 6500 XT though the Infinity Cache there may help AMD close the gap as it has done with some of its higher-end RDNA 2 graphics cards.

The 6500 XT also has a massive clock speed advantage over the RTX 3050 which could also offer competitive performance with the Nvidia GPU.

Considering where the companies have priced these cards it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the RTX 3050 be the slightly more powerful card with AMD nipping at its heels and even surpassing it in some games. We’ll need to see some unbiased real-world testing to know for sure.

Upscaling and ray tracing

Both graphics cards support an optional upscaling technology to improve performance in supporting games. The RTX 3050 has Nvidia’s Tensor Cores to let you use DLSS for impressive performance gains in select games which can make quite a difference — especially when you’re gaming on an entry-level card like this.

The RX 6500 XT doesn’t have any dedicated hardware to upscale in-game visuals but it can use AMD’s Fidelity FX Super Resolution in select games — a technology we’ve been quite impressed with. The RTX 3050 can use it too however with some games even offering the option of both FSR and DLSS to choose from.

Both cards also support ray tracing although you’re unlikely to use it in any grand capacity as even with dedicated hardware acceleration it’s going to mean a big performance hit especially the with weaker accelerators in the 6500 XT. Still having the option is nice and as games get better at implementing it being able to turn it on for gameplay improvements even at the cost of frame rate is nice to have.

Interfaces and media encoding

One area of concern with the 6500 XT at this untested prerelease stage of its life cycle is the limited PCIE x4 interface. While this shouldn’t matter in newer motherboards with PCIE 4 support in older PCIE 3 boards it could represent a constraint on bandwidth that could limit overall performance. Considering gamers with older PCs are the likely target audience for a card like this it seems like a puzzling design choice from AMD.

In comparison the RTX 3050 can take full advantage of PCIE x16 interfaces. It won’t use anything close to the maximum bandwidth but there won’t be a bottleneck at the slot even on older motherboards.

AMD also made the surprising choice to disable H264/HEVC encoding and AV1 decoding on the 6500 XT. That could cause some problems with streaming at higher resolutions and will limit the ability for it to work with Oculus Quest headsets. Those aren’t huge deal breakers for a card targeting 1080p gaming but it’s a shame to see such standard features stripped from the card.

The 6500 XT isn’t great but it might be all you can get

Out of these two cards the RTX 3050 looks likely to be the more powerful when it launches. Everything from its more expansive memory configuration to its ability to use DLSS and its higher price tag suggests it should be the more powerful GPU. However its 8GB of RAM might be its downfall because that lets cryptocurrency miners use it to mine Etherum. The limited 4GB of GDDR6 on the 6500 XT makes it nonviable for that which may make it far easier to obtain.

We still don’t know if either of these cards will be produced in enough volume to thwart scalpers but AMD has made bold claims about providing strong volume for this entry-level GPU. If the $200 price is relatively accurate it’s likely to be a very popular card among gamers. If they can get their hands on it it could be a decent buy at a time where getting hold of any card at a reasonable price isn’t easy.

The RTX 3050 should be the better card but it might lose out due to its own higher specs.

A big determiner is how you want your dividends delivered.

Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) and Realty Income (O 0.64%) have a lot in common that commends them to investors as long-term buy and holds.

They're both real estate investment trusts (REITs) which requires that pay at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. They generate that income from their commercial real estate portfolios counting on their tenants to provide real estate investors with a steady flow of cash and share price appreciation over a period of years.

Notice I said years. What makes Federal Realty and Realty Income such compelling choices is their venerability matched by performance. Both are Dividend Aristocrats which means they're among the 65 members of the Standard & Poor's 500 that have raised dividends for 25 straight years or more. Federal Realty goes a step further. It's one of the 31 companies meriting the title of Dividend King bestowed for 50 straight years of payout increases.

Below we'll look a bit deeper at each of their portfolios and performance.

Realty Income is an 11000-pound giant among retail REITs

Realty Income with a market value of about $40 billion is by far the larger of the two with about 11000 properties under long-term net-lease contracts with 650 different clients in all 50 states the U.K. and Spain. Net-lease contracts require tenants to pay most of a property's operating costs.

Dollar General and Dollar Tree-Family Dollar account for 1462 of those leases and 7.5% of the REIT's rental revenue. 7-Eleven (592 leases) and Walgreen's (246 leases) meanwhile individually account for 5.7% and 5% of rent revenue respectively. Then there's FedEx with only 42 leases but 3.4% of total rent.

As for performance Realty Income has posted annualized dividend growth of 4.5% since joining the NYSE in 1994. Its record actually goes back to 1969 when it was created to provide monthly dividends to shareholders long before it went public.



Realty Income calls itself the ""Monthly Dividend Company"" and right now that payout is $0.246 a share every month good for a yield of about 4.1% based on its recent share price of about $71.

Federal Realty is smaller but also mighty

Federal Realty has a market cap of about $10.7 billion one fourth that of Realty Income and a much smaller footprint. Instead of casting such a wide net Federal Realty focuses on what it calls ""award-winning retail environments and mixed-use neighborhoods in the nation's most desirable markets.""

It has 106 properties with about 3100 commercial real estate (CRE) tenants and about 3200 residential units concentrated in coastal markets such as Washington D.C. Boston San Francisco Los Angeles Chicago and Phoenix.

Federal Realty which pays its dividend four times a year raised its quarterly payout by a penny to $1.07 a share last summer continuing a string of 54 annual increases the longest in the REIT industry. That's good for a yield of about 3.15% based on the recent share price of about $135.



Realty Income has the total return lead and gets the nod here

As an income-focused investor I like to look at total return taking into account dividends and share price growth. Realty Income is the clear winner here as $10000 invested in its stock 10 years ago would now be worth about $32000 compared with about $21000 for Federal Realty.https://ycharts.com/charts/fund_chart_creator/fool/#/?annotations=&annualizedReturns=false&calcs=i[…]=&title=&units=false&useEstimates=false&zoom=10

Realty Income and Federal Realty are both widely held widely respected members of the real estate sector and for good reason. They both have long records of reliable paybacks and decent returns making them ideal candidates for a retiree's portfolio.

As for looking ahead Federal Realty has increased its 2022 forecast for funds from operations (FFO) per diluted share from an estimated $5.45-$5.50 for 2021 to $5.65-$5.85 for 2022 Realty Income meanwhile says it has invested in $1.61 billion in 308 properties and properties under development or expansion including $532.5 million in Europe.

Those are just two of the metrics that point to continued solid returns from these two dividend stalwarts. Stocks like these are often viewed by individual investors as an alternative to low-yielding bonds cash and certificates of deposit. Either of these two will do that just fine.

A big choice is whether you prefer the payout monthly or quarterly of course but there's more. Realty Income's higher yield and stronger returns and its significant investment in revenue growth gives it an edge over its worthy competitor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tZWV0LWphcGFucy12ZXJ5LWJ1c3ktbm90aGluZy0xNTE3MjU3NDEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Meet Japan's very busy ""Do Nothing Rent-a-Man""","Tokyo — Throughout his 38 years Shoji Morimoto had become accustomed to being told by family classmates and co-workers that he was a ""do-nothing"" — the kind of guy who stood back and let others take the initiative.

So after college and listlessly shuttling through one dispiriting job after another he finally decided that if the shoe fit why not wear it. In 2018 unemployed on a whim the self-described slacker opened a Twitter account under the moniker ""Do Nothing Rent-a-Man"" and began offering his diffident companionship — but not a drop of sweat equity — to the world.

""I lend myself out to do nothing which means I don't make any special effort"" he told CBS News while seated in a local park between gigs. He schedules up to three appointments almost every day. ""I don't initiate conversation. I reply to chitchat but that's it.""

COVID linked to worrying spike in female suicides in Japan

He has turned down requests to help clean houses ""be a friend"" do laundry make scintillating banter visit a haunted house and pose nude. But he has stood in the freezing cold to be an audience for a struggling street musician accompanied the painfully self-conscious on outings to shops and restaurants and even shared cake with a lonely soul on a birthday.

""People use me in different ways"" he said. ""Some people are lonesome. Some feel it's a shame to go somewhere (interesting) alone — they want someone to share their impressions with.

""What's amazing is the huge variety of personalities circumstances and situations"" he noted. ""That's striking to me almost every day.""

On a recent weekday he met a woman in her 30s one of his regulars. After perfunctory greetings they sat down to sip coffee — in silence.

The woman who requested anonymity said Mr. Rental offered a safe space with no judgment no strings and no talking.

""Japanese women tend to worry about what others think and about not burdening others"" she said. ""It's exhausting. So being freed of this obsessing is valuable.""

The concept of offering to be a plus-one at restaurants or on shopping trips is not unheard-of in Japan. But Morimoto was perhaps the first to entertain a wide range of ""assignments"" for nothing more than the cost of carfare and if needed meals.

Followed online by almost a quarter of a million people he trudges around town and often out of it meeting with a steady stream of clients. ""Rent-a-man"" has struck a chord in this workaholic and conformist country.

Thousands of curious encounters later his experiences have earned him a living. He's written four books including a manga comic about joining clients for a few hours at a café or on an outing or even providing moral support while a client filed for divorce.

While his clientele skews overwhelmingly female some of the often-poignant stories are from men aching for even a total stranger's ear. There was the young man stuck in a soul-killing office job who asked Rent-a-Man to meet him on the swings after work to briefly relive the joy of being alive.

Another unforgettable client was a lonely young man who asked to share a home-cooked meal and an unbearable secret: His mother had raised him to a life of crime and he'd been sent to a reformatory for his role in a robbery that left a woman dead. And yet the man told Mr. Rental he still pined for the mother who had ruined his life.

Mr. Rental's signature props a blue cap and backpack and his inexplicable minor celebrity inspired a 12-part semi-fictionalized Amazon Prime series last year.

""Critics say 'Get a job!'"" the married father of one told CBS News. ""But I don't feel the need to answer to anyone. They're entitled to their opinions.""

By evening Morimoto was on the move again headed for drinks with a soft-spoken 44-year-old health care worker named Tamami Miyazaki.

""With a friend you have to worry about whether they would like the bar or not"" she said. ""But with Rental-san he just says straight up 'yes' or 'no.' It's less drama than going out with a friend.""

Morimoto has sparked scores of copycats but he's just getting started. He resents inferences that this is anything like a real job. Nothing's more fun he says than doing nothing.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.""



Angela Bassett has said it before and she’ll say it again: “You look good for your age” is not a compliment.

The then 63-year-old recently opened up about why she feels this way.

“When we take care of ourselves we do look good for our age whatever age that is you know?”

At 64 Angela Bassett knows she looks good. She doesn’t need anyone to tell her especially if they’re going to add “for your age” to the end of the compliment.

If you think about it the overused phrase “You look good for your age” is kind of a backhanded insult—why must age be a factor in someone’s beauty? That’s what Bassett wants to know.

“I think when we take care of ourselves we do look good for our age whatever age that is you know?” the actress recently told InStyle.

This isn’t the first time the 9-1-1 star has resisted the cliché either. In 2018 she told Allure of the time a woman bagging her groceries leaned over the counter to say “You look so young.” Instead of thanking her Bassett had a little fun with it. “I said ‘Hearing that is a wonderful thing—seeing as I’m 80!’” she laughed.

Although she admitted to Allure that it “feels good that they wonder” she knows her value is rooted in much more than appearance. That’s something she’s paid close attention to throughout her career especially as someone who has stepped into the shoes of legendary characters like Rosa Parks Betty Shabazz Tina Turner and the Black Panther’s Ramonda the Queen of Wakanda.

“Thirty and 40 years ago when I started out Black characters were weighted too heavily in the negative. I was always mindful of those images” she told InStyle. “There’s complexity to us. There’s beauty to us. There’s strength to us. There’s compassion to us. There are so many wonderful things.”

That may be why she doesn’t have a ton of advice when it comes to looking youthful—she has more important things to talk about. And when it comes to her radiant skin specifically she admitted that she can’t take much credit for it.

“My aesthetician is a big part of it. I found a great one Skin by Mamie [Mamie McDonald]. She is so gifted at what she does” Bassett raved. “As August Wilson once wrote after two hours with her ‘I am shining like new money.’ I don’t really wear makeup if I don’t have to. I’m trying to just keep healthy skin that I don’t need to cover up.”

And although it may be hard to believe she does have problem areas that pop up “like hormonal changes and melasma” she said. And when McDonald isn’t working her magic on Bassett’s skin the actress previously told the Los Angeles Times that she loves using Dr. Barbara Sturm’s line for darker skin tones.

“But I feel like so much of who we are is on the inside” she told InStyle. “So if you’re stressed it shows and it shows in your skin.”

In fact in Bassett’s opinion staying as stress-free as possible works better than any anti-aging cream on the market. “As we advance 60 is the new 40 or 70 is the new 50. It keeps getting pushed” she told Allure. “But you have to keep the stress down and the attitude hot.”

Now those are some words of wisdom we can live by.

A welterweight bout between the two fighters is on tap for UFC 273 which takes place April 9. A location and venue have not yet been set.

Two people with knowledge of the matchup recently informed MMA Junkie of the booking but asked to remain anonymous since the promotion has yet to make an official announcement.

Gall (7-4 MMA 6-4 UFC) looks to get back into the win column after a unanimous decision loss to Alex Morono in December. Since his 2016 win over Sage Northcutt Gall has alternated losses and wins.

Malott (7-1-1 MMA 0-0 UFC) won back-to-back fights en route to a Dana White’s Contender Series opportunity in October 2021. In 39 seconds Malott submitted opponent Shimon Smotritsky with a guillotine choke to earn a UFC contract from the promotional brass. Malott is the brother of Winnipeg Jets prospect Jeff Malott.

Portals recreates a dense urban environment where users can explore buildings and interactive rooms.

“Binance.US is getting a space in Portals Downtown with a focus on delivering the latest news charts and events virtually” Portals head of community and partnerships Chris Lund said in a Twitter message to CoinDesk.

Lund said FTX.US the U.S. arm of crypto exchange FTX will also build its own office in Portals.

Companies have been rushing headfirst into open metaverses such as The Sandbox and Decentraland both of which are Ethereum-based. Portals seems to be an early favorite for capturing metaverse mania on the high-speed Solana blockchain.

Binance.US spokesperson Zachary Tindall said the virtual buildout is meant to be a gathering place for exchange users.

“We are creating a space in the metaverse for the Binance.US community to come together” Tindall told CoinDesk in an email. “It’s the first of many steps we’re taking to be forward-looking as we build and reach our community in new environments.”

And Binance won’t be alone.

The Head of the Industrial Human Resources Development Agency (BPSDMI) of the Ministry of Industry Arus Gunawan said this strategic step was aimed at preparing competent and competitive industrial human resources (HR).

""This program is competency-based in the metal processing sector by adjusting the needs of a number of industries in Morowali Regency where the number of industrial HR needs per year has reached 682000 people while the average number of workforce needs is 40000 people per year"" he said in a press statement Sunday January 9th.

According to Gunawan the Ministry of Industry and the Morowali Regency Government want to increase the potential for the development of the metal processing industry. This effort is in line with the government's determination to carry out the downstream industry policy especially to increase the added value of existing mineral and coal in the country.

According to Gunawan's notes industrial downstreaming in the Morowali Industrial Estate Central Sulawesi has succeeded in downstreaming nickel ore into stainless steel. As an illustration the price of nickel ore when sold is only around 40-60 US dollars whereas when it is made into stainless steel the price can be above 2000 US dollars.

""The export value of products from the Morowali Industrial Estate has been able to penetrate 4 billion US dollars both hot rolled coil and cold rolled coil product shipments to the United States and China. The contribution of the Morowali Industrial Estate is also reflected in the achievement of significant investment more than 5 billion US dollars and the total employment of more than 30000 people"" he said.

On the same occasion the Regent of Morowali Taslim revealed that the synergy that was built included the development of Small and Medium Industry (IKM) centers for textiles and roa fish processing.

""In the future the cooperation will not only be for the supply of the metal industry but also the development of IKM centers in the garment sector and other industrial human resource development programs"" he said.

The collaboration initiated by the Ministry of Industry's BPSDMI with various stakeholders is claimed to be able to produce competent industrial human resources so that they can meet industry needs and continue to encourage regional potential to increase competitiveness.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Tampa Bay Rays have been in our community since 1995. They have excelled on the field outperforming our market size with the third most wins in Major League Baseball since 2008. Despite this remarkable success attendance at Tropicana Field consistently ranks at the bottom of the sport.

The Rays want to stay in Tampa Bay and we believe we should do what we can to save/keep the team in our region. We believe their Sister City Baseball plan with Montreal is a win-win-win for Tampa Bay Major League Baseball and Montreal.

We endorse the leadership and membership of the three prominent regional chambers who supported this Sister City Baseball plan and the construction of an open-air neighborhood ballpark in Historic Ybor City. The site would serve as home not only for the Rays during the first portion of the season as well as for half the postseason games but also as home of the Tampa Bay Rowdies. The new multi-use facility would be an economic development platform to host national sporting events concerts and community gatherings similar to the versatility of Amalie Arena. It would also help spark development in and around Ybor like replicating what other successful urban ballparks like Fenway Park and Wrigley Field have done across the country.

After many years of analysis and conversations the time has come to prioritize a new home for our Tampa Bay Rays on terms that the current market frames — a shared season in an intimate neighborhood venue with the benefits of a lasting connection to Montreal and its fans who will come visit here and make Tampa Bay a destination of choice for tourism and commerce.

Radhika Panjwani is a former journalist from Toronto and a blogger.

After shouldering heavy workloads economic uncertainty and frozen wages for some two years now glad tidings are on the way for many Canadian workers.

Employees across a wide cross-section of industries will receive an average annual pay increase of about 2.7 per cent in 2022 according to LifeWorks a human resources services and technology company based in Toronto.

The downside? The increases will be lower than the rate of inflation. The consumer price index rose 4.7 per cent in November from a year earlier the highest increase in three decades.

The expected 2022 raises come a year after 12 per cent of organizations did not give salary increases and in 2020 when 36 per cent of employers froze salaries according to insights from the LifeWorks report.

The LifeWorks survey of 829 organizations conducted in July 2021 also found that while most non-unionized employers plan to offer a wage hike in 2022 18.3 per cent said they are undecided.

“Only 3.3 per cent of organizations are projecting salary freezes next year which indicates that employers are recognizing the necessity of boosting pay and rebranding their total rewards value proposition in an effort to attract and retain key talent” Anand Parsan LifeWorks partner and national practice leader of compensation consulting said in a news release.

Sector-wise salary

The sectors with the highest projected average salary increases are wholesale trade (3.1 per cent) construction (3 per cent) information technology (3 per cent) and accommodation and food services (3 per cent). In contrast those in health care and social assistance (2 per cent) educational services (2 per cent) and information and cultural industries (1.9 per cent) are projected to have the smallest salary increases.

Employee retention: Beyond the dollar

Last month international staffing firm Robert Half released the findings of its research and survey of 502 senior managers at companies with 20 or more employees across Canada. Nearly 63 per cent said their company plans to award year-end bonuses. Ninety per cent said they will offer raises in the next six months to account for employee performance cost-of-living increases competitive pressure for staffing and wage stagnation since the start of the pandemic.

Insights from the 2022 Salary Guide from Robert Half shows robust compensation packages will be critical for recruiting new talent and retaining current employees in Canada noting that one in five workers surveyed for the research said they would leave without another job lined up. Professionals are particularly in the driver’s seat when it comes to negotiating a raise or new role and they are interested in more than just pay the report said.

Michael French a regional director at Robert Half Canada calls the upheaval in Canada’s labour market “The Great Reshuffle” contrasting it with the “Great Resignation” said to be happening south of the border. A smaller proportion of Canadians are planning to leave working life altogether he said and are more likely to be thinking about opportunities elsewhere taking into account priorities such company culture flexibility and the opportunity to negotiate wages.

Mr. French said employers would be far better off to ensure they are paying their employees a competitive salary instead of scouting new talent. But he also cautioned that employees should not focus on salary alone but consider other factors as well.

“The dollar should not be your destination; it’s just one of the stops to consider” Mr. French said. “Does your job give you the flexibility to have a fulfilling personal life? Does it allow you to go to your kid’s soccer game on Tuesdays at 3 p.m.?”

You may have heard of Google’s 20 per cent rule. Google workers in addition to their regular projects are encouraged to spend 20 per cent of their time working on what they think will most benefit the company. Many of Google’s significant programs (such as AdSense and Google News) happened because of employees following the 20 per cent rule. So how can you pursue those development opportunities? This article shows you how.

The build-up to WrestleMania 38 has now officially begun and so has the speculation. The two men's World Title matches have seemingly been in flux since Roman Reigns was forced to miss the Day One pay-per-view earlier this month after testing positive for COVID-19.

Advertisement

As previously reported the original plan at Day One was for Seth Rollins to leave as WWE Champion. On the latest edition of Wrestling Observer Radio Dave Meltzer noted that the original plans for WrestleMania 38 was to have Rollins defend the title on one of the nights.

Meltzer mentioned he was not aware of who Seth would have been facing. He was the original man expected to walk into the show as WWE Champion. On the other night it was expected that Brock Lesnar would be facing Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship.

Previously it has been reported that the plans for WrestleMania 38 are supposed to be staying the same but with a different journey after Reigns tested positive for COVID-19. That led to Brock becoming WWE Champion rather than Seth Rollins.

However the storyline between the Beast and the Tribal Chief has continued with the two men confronting each other on SmackDown on Friday. Of course there is plenty of time between now and WrestleMania which means WWE could switch things up again.

Both men will be defending their titles at the upcoming Royal Rumble. Brock Lesnar will face Bobby Lashley for the WWE Championship. Meanwhile Roman Reigns is set to defend his Universal Championship against Seth Rollins at the show. Of course whoever wins the Rumble itself will also be thrown into the mix when it comes to WrestleMania title plans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53cmVzdGxpbmdpbmMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMS93d2UtaGFzLW5vdC1jb25maXJtZWQtc2V0aC1yb2xsaW5zLXZzLXJvbWFuLXJlaWducy10aGUtdXNvcy1hdHRhY2stcm9sbGlucy1hZnRlci1zbWFja2Rvd24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE Has Not Confirmed Seth Rollins Vs.

Seth Rollins vs. WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns is not official for the WWE Royal Rumble as of this writing.

As noted it was indicated at the end of last night's SmackDown that Adam Pearce sent Rollins to the show to challenge Reigns at the Royal Rumble event later this month.

In an update WWE never officially announced Rollins vs. Reigns but they did tease the match on social media. The WWE website has not published a match preview but they did cover the show-closing segment on SmackDown.

Furthermore the WWE On FOX Twitter account published a graphic for Rollins vs. Reigns at The Rumble after last night's SmackDown went off the air. They quickly deleted that tweet and posted a follow-up saying they may have jumped the gun on the match announcement.

""So about THAT tweet we may have jumped the gun but we REALLY hope @ScrapDaddyAP makes it official 'cause we need it"" WWE On FOX tweeted.

On a related note last night's SmackDown post-show dark segment featured Rollins and SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos.

The SmackDown main event saw The Usos retain over The New Day in a Street Fight. The Usos continued their celebration after SmackDown ended until Rollins came out to the ring. Rollins was attacked by The Usos but he fought them off and delivered a Stomp. A fan in attendance noted that Rollins received a massive babyface pop from the crowd.

It's likely that WWE will confirm Rollins vs. Reigns in the next week or so.

The 2022 Royal Rumble will take place on January 29 from The Dome at America's Center in St. Louis. Below is what looks to be the updated card if Rollins vs. Reigns is happening along with the WWE On FOX tweet:

(KNOE) - Walmart in West Monroe is scheduled to close Saturday afternoon.

According to Walmart’s media relations team the store located at 1025 Glenwood Drive will close at 2:00 p.m. on Jan. 8 2022 as part of a company-initiated program to allow third party cleaning crews time to thoroughly clean and sanitize the building.

The location will remain closed through Sunday Jan. 9 2022 to provide associates time to restock shelves and prep the store to reopen on Monday Jan. 10 2022 at 6:00 a.m.

The media relations team provided a statement on behalf of the company:

As an essential business and a member of the Prairieville community we understand the role we play in providing our customers with food medicine and other essential items especially at this time.

As you know several areas across the country have begun seeing a renewed increase in positive COVID-19 cases and we want to assist health officials working against the pandemic. In support of this effort we have chosen to temporarily close our West Monroe store location at 1025 Glenwood Dr today at 2 p.m. as part of an ongoing company-initiated program. This will allow extra time for a third-party specialist to further sanitize the store and will also give our associates additional time to restock shelves and prepare the store to once again serve the community. We plan to reopen the store to customers at 6 a.m. on Monday Jan. 10.

Everything we’re doing is for the well-being of our associates and the thousands of customers we serve daily and in consideration of guidance by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and health experts. We will follow CDC guidance which includes fully vaccinated people wearing masks in public indoor settings in counties with substantial or high transmission.

In these counties and where there are state or local mask mandates associates will be required to wear masks inside our facilities including stores clubs distribution centers and fulfillment centers. You can find the county-by-county breakdown here. The CDC updates its data on transmission rates weekly so the guidance on mask usage is likely to change over time in different locations.

When the store reopens Monday we will continue conducting associate health assessments and all unvaccinated associates must still wear face coverings.

In addition to offering COVID-19 vaccines to customers through walk-in or online appointments we’re also offering easy access to vaccines for associates. Associates can receive their vaccinations at their home store pharmacy on or off the clock. They’ll receive two hours of paid leave to receive their vaccination and up to three days paid leave should they experience an adverse reaction.

These protocols and convenient access to vaccinations are in addition to the extensive measures we’ve put in place during the pandemic to help protect our associates and customers. We will continue working closely with elected and local health officials adjusting how we serve the community while also keeping the health and safety of our customers and associates in mind.

Michelle Wlazlo evp and chief merchandising officer at JCPenney said the activewear collection Sports Illustrated for JCPenney was “inspired by iconic moments in sports.” The styles are available online and in more than 650 U.S. JCPenney stores. “Sports Illustrated is committed to reaching consumers in new and unique ways” said Dana Carpenter evp of entertainment at Authentic Brands Group which bought Sports Illustrated in 2019. While this is its first fashion and lifestyle collection the brand launched a swimwear collection in 2018.

So what kinds of items is SI offering? We’re glad you asked! Let’s take a look at some choice options.

Who wouldn’t want to wear this pencil skirt for example?

Is there a real calling out there for a below-the-knee pencil skirt made from some kind of stretchy athletic fabric going for $37? It’s hard to figure there is. I’m not the target market here but neither LuLuLemon or UnderArmour makes a pencil skirt of any kind. Maybe the market will prove us wrong on this one but it’s hard to see this trending.

None of these items have a listed country of origin. They’re all just listed as “Imported” which sort of defeats the purpose of JCPenney offering a “Country of origin” fact line. Feel free to speculate exactly which nation these were produced in and under what conditions. The material is maybe even better; this one for example is 50% nylon 50% polyester. What a blend! And this is $60 for the option to wear something that would probably melt if left in a car in July.

To say a few positive things: it’s nice they have plus sizes for women. And big & tall for men.

That’s enough both sides-ism. Back to the fun stuff for one more entry:

Listen parents: I don’t have children. That usually automatically disqualifies me from giving parenting advice and I’m almost always more than happy to be excused from that discussion. But I’m going to make a plea here on the off chance that anyone is willing to listen: please please please do not send your kid to school wearing an SI branded $20 t-shirt. Do not even send them to virtual/remote school wearing an SI-branded t-shirt. If a well-meaning relative gifts your child an SI-branded graphic tee burn it then spend $20 to buy a normal t-shirt for your child (or to donate to Goodwill in its place.)

I know very little about teen/youth/kid culture today. (I knew very little about it when I was actually a teen/youth/kid.) But I know with absolute certainty this falls on the “what not to do” list. If you take nothing else away from this post let it be that.

Anyway stay tuned for the upcoming Awful Announcing Summer ’22 collection produced in conjunction with Ross Dress For Less!

The company one of the world’s biggest cruise operators said that it was taking the step “out of an abundance of caution.” This is the second time this week that Royal Caribbean has called off voyages.

“We regret having to cancel our guests’ long-awaited vacations and appreciate their loyalty and understanding” the company said in a statement on its website. “Our top priority is always the well-being of our guests our crew and the communities we visit.”

Royal Caribbean said it had called off planned trips on three ships — Serenade of the Seas Symphony of the Seas and Jewel of the Seas — and pushed back the return to cruising of another Vision of the Seas to March.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Zsb3JpZGEtcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMi8wMS8wOC9ub3J3ZWdpYW4tYW5kLXJveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1jYWxsLW9mZi12b3lhZ2VzLWR1ZS10by1vbWljcm9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norwegian and Royal Caribbean call off voyages due to omicron,"Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean two of the cruise industry’s largest global operators are temporarily halting certain cruises marking the first mass cruise cancellations due to the omicron variant of the coronavirus.

Royal Caribbean said Friday it’s canceling cruises on three of its ships starting Saturday and postponing voyages on a fourth ship until March 7. One of the ships will remain out of service until April 26.

Norwegian had already said it was canceling voyages on eight cruise ships nearly half its fleet after the Norwegian Pearl on Wednesday returned early to Miami due to a COVID-19 outbreak among crew members.

In March 2020 the cruise industry was brought to an abrupt halt at the onset of the pandemic and it didn’t operate for over a year.

Cruising only restarted about six months ago but the rapid spread of the omicron variant that emerged in the United States in late November is hammering the industry as well as many other business sectors.

Miami-based Royal Caribbean said on its website that cancellations were “a result of the ongoing COVID-related circumstances around the world.”

The company is canceling sailings that were scheduled to leave Saturday on the Serenade of the Seas and the Symphony of the Seas. Also the Jewel of the Seas voyage that was supposed to depart Miami on Sunday is canceled.

Passengers will be issued refunds but the company warned that due to the high volume of refund requests it may take up to 45 days for travelers to get their money back.

Meanwhile Norwegian said certain ships only will stop sailing the remainder of January while others will suspend trips through late April. Miami-based Norwegian the world’s third-largest cruise line operates 17 cruise ships.

All booked passengers will get a full refund plus a certificate for a future voyage.

“Our first priority is the health and safety of our guests crew and the communities we visit” the cruise line said in a statement. “Due to ongoing travel restrictions we’ve had to modify a few sailings and unfortunately have had to cancel” certain voyages.

In recent weeks several U.S. cruise ships hit with COVID-19 outbreaks have been denied entry to ports in Aruba Curacao Bonaire and Cartagena concerning cruise industry leaders.

“The one worry I’ll be honest is that a number of destinations in the Caribbean are concerned and denying entry to cruise ships” said Brian Salerno senior vice president of maritime policy at Cruise Lines International Association the cruise industry’s largest trade group.

“There’s an ongoing effort to work with Caribbean destinations” Salerno said. “Cruise ships need places to sail to. Arriving at ports and getting turned away at the last minute is a very difficult thing for cruise ships to deal with.”

On top of turning around the Norwegian Pearl on the second day of an 11-day Caribbean cruise and arriving Wednesday back at PortMiami the company also canceled a Jan. 5 voyage on Norwegian Getaway.

Many of those passengers got notice of the cancellation on the morning the cruise was supposed to depart after some of them had already traveled to Miami from around the country.

Since Dec. 18 Royal Caribbean has experienced coronavirus outbreaks on at least three ships that left Florida ports and Carnival Freedom also had infections occur during a voyage from Miami.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that between Dec. 15 and 29 there were 5013 cases of COVID-19 among passengers and crew members on cruise ships compared to just 162 in the previous two weeks.

Despite the resurgence of the pandemic disease and the Dec. 30 CDC advisory for people to avoid cruising this winter no matter their vaccination status other major cruise lines as of Friday had no plans to cancel voyages.

A spokesperson for Miami-based Carnival Cruise Line said all the ships are sailing as scheduled acknowledging that even with the requirement for passengers over age 12 to be fully vaccinated and other strict public safety measures in place it’s “possible” there will be coronavirus infections on board.

Officials at MSC cruise line said that they are not halting any cruises.

Cruises on the following Royal Caribbean ships are canceled until the listed date:

• Vision of the Seas cruises postponed until March 7;

• Serenade of the Seas cruises from Jan. 8 to March 5 are canceled. The ship will resume cruising on April 26;

• Jewel of the Seas sailings from Jan. 9 to Feb. 12 are canceled. The Jewel will resume cruising on Feb. 20;

• Symphony of the Seas sailings from Jan. 8 to Jan. 22 are canceled. The Symphony will resume cruising on Jan. 29.

But after contracting covid-19 and isolating in a designated cabin he had to order off the room service menu: turkey sandwich pizza burgers and three choices for dessert.

“They were like ‘We’re going to give you the minimum you need to survive’ "" said Rebelo 54 who owns a small trucking company and works as a DJ while splitting his time between Tijuana and Las Vegas.

His nine-night voyage on the Norwegian Getaway late last month went awry after a coronavirus surge sent cases soaring to record heights on land and at sea. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cruise lines sailing in U.S. waters reported 5013 coronavirus cases between Dec. 15 and Dec. 29 about 30 times more than the total from the previous two weeks.

On Dec. 31 the CDC escalated its travel warning for cruises to Level 4 advising against cruise travel even for the vaccinated. By that time it was too late for Rebelo and thousands of others to heed the message.

Although passengers must follow strict rules to cruise — with the vast majority of people onboard vaccinated and everyone required to test negative — infections have slipped through. As positive cases mount passengers and crew have coped with less-than-ideal accommodations. Many interviewed by The Washington Post reported long waits for service hours without water bare-bones food and confusion over when and who to test — even as most ships maintain their course.

A box of rice for dinner

For customers such as Rebelo waiting on room service when they paid for premium options can feel like an indignity. For crew quarantine can be even more difficult — even without getting sick.

One crew member on Royal Caribbean’s Odyssey of the Seas who did not want her name published because she is still employed by the company said she was sent to “soft quarantine” after having contact with someone who tested positive. That means she was allowed to work but required to spend the rest of her time in her room.

She said one day she found her lunch outside her door as workers were fogging the hallway with cleaning chemicals. She decided not to eat the food.

“One night my dinner was like just a box of rice. Nothing else. Not even a roll or a vegetable” she said. “Just rice. I was like cool glad I have a box of Pop Tarts in my room.”

A former member of the cruise director staff on Oasis Ovation and Harmony of the Seas said he tested positive for coronavirus recently and was served food in quarantine that seemed inedible to him. He declined to have his name used because of concerns about endangering future job prospects.

He provided pictures that showed a rotting orange; a small seafood salad in a box with a slice of watermelon; and a box with a scoop of white rice a hard-boiled egg and a paltry pile of corned beef hash.

“It would be different if I worked for like a construction company that doesn’t know anything about how to prepare food” he said. Royal Caribbean did not address questions about meals it provides to quarantining crew members.

Aboard the Norwegian Encore however passenger Kelly Araujo said she and her mother took solace in room service deliveries. The 18-year-old student at Duke University said she could order anything available from the dining rooms to her quarantine room. She ate lava cake with a molten chocolate center every night.

Araujo and her mother spent four days in a windowless room without seeing sunlight. They would nap watch TV or scroll online losing track of the hours.

“It just felt like one really really really long day” Araujo said. “Even when we’d wake up we would do the same thing the next day.”

During part of a three-week sailing on the Seabourn Ovation Barry Kluger was exiled to the quarantine floor. The 68-year-old retired public relations executive missed his wife he said getting to see her only when she would visit a balcony near his and talk to him through an opening in a wall. Kluger who was vaccinated boosted and previously infected had an asymptomatic case. He spent most of his lonely days online posting updates about his quarantine on social media. On New Year’s Eve he wore a tux ordered champagne and rang in 2022 with his wife over Zoom.

Kluger said the crew to their credit did their best to entertain him. The cruise director brought him trivia and board games. His meals although served on disposable plates looked elaborate: Two ginormous shrimp on a bed of greens and dollops of sauces grilled prawns with roasted autumnal vegetables an assortment of mussels and octopus over yellow rice.

“Cruise lines didn’t create covid” he said. “Everyone’s trying to feel their way through it.”

‘They did not want to know’

Araujo the college student who enjoyed nightly lava cake said within three days of her family’s Norwegian sailing her mother started feeling nauseated. The family thought it was motion sickness at first.

“When we tested positive it was like they didn’t know what to do” she said of the company. “It was like they had not thought that anyone was going to test positive.”

Araujo whose father tested negative said staff told her she and her mother were the only people to test positive but she wondered how many other guests carried the virus without getting a test. Initially her family was told they would disembark together on the U.S. Virgin Islands. Instead they stayed on and split up so she and her mother could quarantine.

On the Norwegian Getaway Rebelo said he had to argue to receive a test after he developed a cough and chills.

“They grilled me” Rebelo said. “They did not want to know. If you were firm with them and I was they came up and tested.”

He said he and other infected passengers on the Dec. 27 cruise tried to provide information about their close contacts on the ship but “they would not take it down.” The ship’s next sailing was canceled.

In response to questions about his claims Norwegian sent a link to its protocols which say the company has “various contact tracing methodologies to identify and notify those who may have been exposed.”

Rebelo said the cruise companies are promoting their safety precautions before people board but should be doing more before they return to land. The CDC doesn’t require disembarkation testing for fully vaccinated passengers.

“You’ve been cruising around in this petri dish for 10 days” he said. “Shouldn’t you have to test before you can go back on land?”

‘This is absolutely awful’

Graphic designer Mike Ratliff 33 found out his 4-year-old daughter had contracted covid because she had to get tested before the end of the cruise on the Harmony of the Seas as Royal Caribbean requires for unvaccinated kids on trips that are five nights or longer.

His daughter had been feeling a little tired and had a cough but he said those symptoms didn’t seem out of the ordinary especially several days into a busy cruise.

Then Ratliff found out she was positive. He thought the rest of his group — three older kids his wife and parents all vaccinated — would have to isolate because everyone had been exposed.

But Ratliff said only he had to isolate because he took his daughter to get tested; his wife had to persuade staff to let her join with their 6-year-old son because she did not want to be separated from her ill youngest child. No one else in the group was tested on the ship.

He said his father even followed up with officials on board to make sure they didn’t need to quarantine or get tested. According to Royal Caribbean International spokeswoman Lyan Sierra-Caro passengers identified as a close contact less than 24 hours before to the end of the cruise are supposed to quarantine but are not tested on board.

During the day and a half left of the Western Caribbean sailing Ratliff started documenting his experience with videos on TikTok calling the account “Cruising With Covid.”

“5-Star Service” he wrote on one video where he got what sounded like a busy signal as he tried to reach room service for food and water.

“This is absolutely awful” he says.

Sierra-Caro said passengers are provided with free bottled water and room service.

Ratliff said it took at least an hour to reach room service and then another hour to get food delivered. After the first meal he said he made the mistake of throwing out empty water bottles realizing too late that there was no way to collect water from the sink to drink. His efforts to get more water sent to the room were fruitless before dinner which he said arrived nearly three hours after they ordered it and was “super cold.”

After Ratliff and his wife drove their four kids home from Central Florida’s Port Canaveral everyone in the family got sick. His parents tested positive but his immediate family didn’t even bother getting tested.

While Ratliff said his family knew cruising came with risk of covid he was disappointed with the way they were treated after his daughter tested positive.

“It was just frustrating that they weren’t able to meet basic needs” he said. “We’re still a guest on the ship that we paid money to be on.”

Even though some shows and events got canceled because of staffing issues Ratliff said it was a good cruise early on with stops in Cozumel Costa Maya and Roatan.

“We had a good time up until we didn’t” he said.

‘They were just overwhelmed’

David Beyer a 68-year-old travel adviser from Colorado tested positive Dec. 30 eight days after boarding the Celebrity Equinox for the “ultimate Southern Caribbean cruise.”

Beyer developed a slight cough before he woke up “not feeling good at all.” After waiting hours for a test and results he relocated from his cabin to an isolation room a couple of floors down.

The new room was a “stripped-down” version of the original Beyer said with just a bar of soap in the shower no tissues and no bath mat.

“If I’d had hair I needed to shampoo I would’ve been [out of luck]” he said. “Thank goodness I’m bald.”

His husband Don McCleary kept their original room because he had tested negative; McCleary said he planned to get tested again this week because he had covid symptoms.

Until the ship returned to Fort Lauderdale Fla. on Jan. 3 Beyer passed the time talking on the phone playing games on his cellphone watching TV and gazing at the sea from the balcony. He was able to order from the dining room menu though the process to obtain the lukewarm food that arrived in paper boxes left a lot to be desired.

“Sometimes I was dialing upward of nine to 10 times to get through” he said. “I think it was just so many people they were just overwhelmed and it took a long time.”

After a Caribbean cruise on the Celebrity Reflection Elizabeth Seguin is stuck in quarantine in Miami for two weeks before she can make it home to Quebec. The 23-year-old disembarked on Jan. 2 for a trip that was supposed to be a respite from lockdown in the cold Canadian province.

Within her group of three families eight people tested positive on the ship Seguin said. She wishes she knew how many passengers in total were infected.

“We would hear the announcement every morning like 'It’s New Year’s Eve. I hope you have a good new year’ ” she said ""and that kind of sucked because we were stuck and couldn’t participate in all of that.”

Still Seguin said she thought it was just as safe on a cruise as it would be in plenty of environments on land.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzA4L3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1jYW5jZWxzLWZvdXItc2hpcHMtY292aWQtMTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean cancels multiple voyages due to Omicron,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2022/01/08/royal-caribbean-cancels-four-ships-covid-19 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzA4L3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1jYW5jZWxzLWZvdXItc2hpcHMtY292aWQtMTnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

PATRIOTS' JEROD MAYO DOUBTS TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY QUARTERBACK FOR HIS OLD TEAM

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvbmZsL2FydGljbGUtMTMzODU4ODEvQXdrd2FyZC1tb21lbnQtdW5pbXByZXNzZWQtVG9tLUJyYWR5LXRlbGxzLXJvYXN0LW1hc3Rlci1KZWZmLVJvc3Mtbm90LXNheS1zLVJvYmVydC1LcmFmdC1tYXNzYWdlLWpva2UuaHRtbNIBpQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvbmZsL2FydGljbGUtMTMzODU4ODEvYW1wL0F3a3dhcmQtbW9tZW50LXVuaW1wcmVzc2VkLVRvbS1CcmFkeS10ZWxscy1yb2FzdC1tYXN0ZXItSmVmZi1Sb3NzLW5vdC1zYXktcy1Sb2JlcnQtS3JhZnQtbWFzc2FnZS1qb2tlLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Awkward moment furious Tom Brady snaps at Jeff Ross over VERY rude Robert Kraft joke at Netflix roast - with f,"Tom Brady willingly signed up for a roast but America's 'Roastmaster General' Jeff Ross took a shot that the quarterback took an exception to.

In Netflix's live production of the 'Greatest Roast of All Time' Ross delivered a line that referenced when Brady introduced himself to Patriots owner Robert Kraft.

'Tom became a Patriot moved up to New England and on the first day of training camp that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft's office and said I'm the greatest decision your organization has ever made... would you like a massage' Ross joked.

It drew laughs from the room but Brady appeared unimpressed by the joke and went up to Ross in the middle of his set.

'Don't say that s**t again' Brady said with a smile while his hand poorly covered up the microphone.

Tom Brady interrupted Jeff Ross's roasting set after he took exception to a joke he said

The joke involved a fake scenario where Brady asked Kraft if he wanted a massage

That's a reference to when Kraft was charged with soliciting a prostitute back in 2019

“Don’t say that shit again”



Tom Brady was NOT happy about Jeff Ross’s massage joke

pic.twitter.com/GgU3FoXneN — Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) May 6 2024

That joke of course was a reference to when Kraft was one of 25 people facing a misdemeanor charge for soliciting prostitution at a Florida day spa back in February 2019.

Kraft pled not guilty. Later the charges were dropped in September of 2019 after a Florida appeals court ruled his constitutional rights were violated.

That's because Kraft's attorneys revealed hidden cameras were installed at the spa before Kraft visited under the guise of a response to a bomb threat.

'I am truly sorry' Kraft said in a March 2019 statement about the case. 'I know I have hurt and disappointed my family my close friends my co-workers our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard.

'Throughout my life I have always tried to do the right thing. The last thing I would ever want to do is disrespect another human being.

'…As I move forward I hope to continue to use the platform with which I have been blessed to help others and to try to make a difference. I expect to be judged not by my words but by my actions. And through those actions I hope to regain your confidence and respect.'

Social media reaction seemed to be in favor of Ross with some saying that the incident felt like it would boil over into a sequel of when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars.

Social media seemed to find the joke funny but thought it could turn into a Will Smith moment

Ross was not the only person who roasted Brady. Several comedians - including Kevin Hart Nikki Glaser and Bert Kreischer - were on the dais.

So were a number of Brady's former teammates - such as Drew Bledsoe Randy Moss Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman.

Edelman also made a joke at Kraft's expense. He said 'I think the next time I see you all will be at Kraft's funeral.' When Kraft got the mic later he retorted 'Julien I'm not inviting you to my funeral.'

Among the many topics for jokes were Brady's divorce from Gisele Bundchen the Patriots' multiple cheating scandals his sexuality and his looks.

Kim Kardashian who was once rumored to be dating Brady gave a toast at the roast.

'I know there were some rumors of Tom and I dating and I'd never say if we did or not I'd just release the tape' she opened poking fun at her leaked sex tape with Ray J.

'But I do know it would never work out' she went on. 'An ex-athlete high cheek bones silky hair... you remind me too much of my stepdad now. Part of me thinks you'd want to undress me just to try on my clothes.'

THIS LEAGUE!!!!

Later in the evening Bill Belichick made a surprise appearance after rumors suggested he wouldn't show up.

'I'm so honored to be here for the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix not to be confused with the roast of Bill Belichick on the 10 part Apple doc' Belichick joked in reference to the Apple documentary series 'The Dynasty'.

After he arrived Julian Edelman went into his set. 'Remember when you used to yell at us ""Look a**holes the f**king kids down at Foxborough High can make that f**king play. I've been waiting for this for so long: ""Look a**hole [Belichick] Foxborough High's the only job offer you f**kin' had.'

At the end of Rob Gronkowski's set the former Patriots tight end joked that he never took a drink with Brady and Belichick - before the three all took a shot of alcohol together.

Then Gronkowski took his shot glass and spiked it on the stage - sending glass shards all over the place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZG9uZXNpYS1wcm9wb3Nlcy1jdXR0aW5nLXBheW1lbnRzLWtvcmVhLTAyMTczODg2OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indonesia proposes cutting payments for S.Korea fighter jet project Yonhap reports,"FILE PHOTO: A full-scale mockup of South Korea’s KF-X fighter jet is displayed at the Seoul International Aerospace and Defense Exhibition in Seongnam

SEOUL (Reuters) - Indonesia has proposed to cut its share of payments for a joint fighter jet development project with South Korea to about one-third of the originally agreed amount South Korean news agency Yonhap reported on Monday.

Indonesia recently suggested to the South Korean government that it would pay about 600 billion won ($442.47 million) for the KF-21 joint fighter jet project Yonhap reported citing multiple unnamed government sources.

The original amount due for Indonesia's share of the joint fighter project was set to be at about 1.6 trillion won by June 2026 the report said.

""In order to successfully complete the development of the KF-21 system the governments of both South Korea and Indonesia are conducting final negotiations to resolve the current cost sharing issues"" South Korea's Defense Acquisition Program Administration said in a statement to Reuters.

Indonesia's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The KF-21 fighter jet developed by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) in a project partially backed by Indonesia is designed to be a cheaper less stealthy alternative to the U.S.-built F-35 on which South Korea relies.

Indonesia said it would receive fewer technology transfers from South Korea as part of its move to cut its financial contribution Yonhap reported.

South Korea and Indonesia resolved in 2022 a dispute over funding for the joint fighter jet project worth more than 8 trillion won after Indonesia had halted payment of its 20% share of the development costs.

The Indonesian government's latest proposal comes after South Korea police raided KAI's head office in March in connection with two Indonesian nationals accused of leaking technology related to the KF-21 fighter jet project.

Revanna sent to three-day SIT custody,"May 05 2024 09:05 pm | Updated May 06 2024 08:59 am IST - Bengaluru

Janata Dal (S) MLA and former Minister H.D. Revanna who has been arrested in an abduction case was on Sunday remanded in three-day police custody of the Special Investigation Team (SIT).

The SIT is probing the alleged multiple instances of sexual abuse by his son and Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna. His police custody will end on May 8.

Before he was produced before the magistrate Mr. Revanna was subjected to medical examination at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital where he spoke to electronic media waiting outside.

He alleged that his arrest was a political conspiracy. “There is no evidence against me. I have not done any harm to anyone. First they registered a case against me on April 28 but when they could not do anything to me in that case they registered another case just to arrest me. I have fought many battles in my 40-year career and will fight it out this time too” he said.

Mr. Revanna was arrested minutes after his anticipatory bail plea was turned down by the Special Court for Elected Representatives on Saturday.

He was produced before magistrate Ravindra Kattimani at his residence at Koramangala on Sunday evening. The SIT sought his custody even as Mr. Revanna’s advocate opposed it. However the magistrate remanded him in SIT custody for three days.

The former Minister is accused of being involved in the abduction of one of the victims of alleged sexual assault by his son who is a former maid at his Holenarsipur house.

She was allegedly raped by Mr. Prajwal Revanna who also allegedly recorded the crime. The victim was allegedly abducted at the behest of Mr. Revanna on April 29. She was allegedly held captive at a farmhouse of a former personal secretary to Mr. Revanna in Hunsur taluk Mysuru district. She was rescued by SIT on Saturday hours before Mr. Revanna’s arrest."

1.







Disney World people are crazy.

2.







There’s a low key Cult of Walt(on) at Walmart stores

3.







Salesforce. They have gamified their recruiting training and career advancement. They have badges tiers ranks mascots tribal/group-based identities the notion of ""Ohana"". Not saying their product isn't good (quite the contrary actually) but it feels like a cult/MLM model at times.

4.







LulaRoe lovers

5.







Nickocado Avodaco subscribers

6.







Texas A&M University. Their fave saying? “From the outside looking in you can’t understand it. From the inside looking out you can’t explain it.” 100% a cult.

7.







All of those do-it-at-home online marketing that I see a lot of women in my life get sucked into where you make a ton of posts and hype up whatever occupation you're in as a ""lifestyle"" with promises of good pay great social circles and fulfilling incentives

8.







Being a fan of certain movies or shows. Some people just take it way too far (looking at you Harry Potter fans).

9.







Peloton. ‘Nuff said.

10.







Employers who express themselves as a unit such as we are a family/pack etc.

11.







Hustle Culture. I used to work with a guy who bragged he ""only sleeps 10 minutes a night"" because as soon as he got off he'd go do gigs or play with crypto all night. The only things in his life supposedly were ""banging b*tches and getting bags."" He's far from the only person who thinks it's ""Chad"" to run yourself ragged and never take care of yourself.

12.







Kpop fandoms

13.







HOAs

14.







When I was in high school I had several friends who did crew (rowing). These guys had some unusual rituals to say the least. Before every race the varsity captain would buy probably $100 worth of products and would host a food fight ""in the name of the great gods of the water"". To top it off they all dressed the same and would speak in the jargon of crew terms nobody else could understand. Definitely not technically a cult but it sure as hell felt like one

15.







Every Army and every marine I've spoken to gave me cultish vibes too.

16.







Alcoholics Anonymous. You’ll encounter various dogmatic characters in the rooms who turn AA into their life where there's nothing left of their personality.

17.







Any kind of brand loyalty. “I’d rather push a Ford than drive a Chevy!”But… why though!?

18.







People who trade NFTs

19.







Greek life

20.







Being on eBaum’s World

21.







Politics So many people have made their political party of choice into their personality and it's unbearable.

22.







MLM's. They suck you in with an info session and have convinced so many people that they can be their own boss but first you have to pay them a bunch of money and try to recruit other members in order to be successful. Their followers then constantly broadcast their products all over social media in the hopes that they will earn money and a brand new BMW.All very cult-like.

23.







Dave Ramsey walks around with so much cultish boomer energy it's insane.Like some of these people are really stupid and get themselves way over their heads but he just gives little quips in response. Caller: So yeah that's when I used my credit card to pay to visit my mom's funeral Dave: Wow...long pause well that was really stupid wasn't it? You know what Tom (theme music starts slowly playing) it's time for you to start making better choices and to take responsibility for your actions. That's how we’re gonna get this country back on track. (Theme music gets really loud) This is the Dave Ramsey show.Caller: So what do I do? Dave? Hello?

Not only does it feel like yesterday when Bey and her beau welcomed their baby girl but Blue Ivy looks so grown up and exactly like her mumma too.

Blue Ivy's grandmother and Beyoncé's mum Tina Knowles 68 took to Instagram to wish her granddaughter a happy birthday in the sweetest post complete with a rare snap of Blue.

In the snap the proud nan could be seen standing beside a very tall Blue Ivy as the pair posed for a snap on a sandy beach with a gorgeous sunset behind them. The now 10 year old wore white trousers white trainers a white top and a contrasting black blazer. Blue teamed the look with some dark sunglasses and her long hair flowing and cascading down her back.

Both Blue and her nan looked exactly like Beyoncé with the family resemblance being incredibly noticeable.

Tina posted the snap and penned the most adorable caption to accompany it which read ""My beautiful Talented and super smart Grandaughter Blue Ivy turned 10 today!

""God it seemed like yesterday you came into the world running things. Blue is my little Capricorn Twin . I prayed for her to be born on my birthday but she did what she always does she came when she got good and ready 😂 three days later but we still share the bond.""

Tina then continued ""She reminds me that 'Grandma you are acting just like a Capricorn'. Blue gives the best advice like a grown person I sometimes forget that she is so young!!!😂 Blue is one of those rare gifted people that can do everything well!""

The proud nan then concluded: ""God Blessed me the day you were born! My Sweet  Beautiful Baby Blue❤️❤️❤️🎂🎂💥Happy Birthday 🎂❤️🙏🏽.""

People were completely shocked and taken aback by the rare snap of Blue with one person penning ""No way she’s that tall now!!!"" While another said ""OMG she is so tall and beautiful! They grow so fast! She’s a young woman already!!!""

Leigh-Anne Pinnock melted millions of hearts when she shared a new snap of her baby twins.

The Little Mix star 30 sent fans into a frenzy with the most adorable picture of the tots holding hands.

Leigh-Anne gave birth to twins back in August and while neither their sex nor names have been made public the singer is still giving us a glimpse into her baby bubble with the occasional pic.

The Boxing Day movie star posted a black and white snap of her twins’ hands to her 8.1million followers with the caption: ‘It’s the forever bond that gets me… 😩😩❤️❤️’

Fiancé Andrew Gray – with whom Leigh-Anne shares the bubbas – was quick to comment and gush over his little ones writing: ‘And the chunky hands😍😍😩😩’

Fans’ emotions were beyond control in the comments section as they flooded her feed with heart eye emojis for the ‘so so cute’ pic.

The cuteness is too much! (Picture: Instagram)

A fellow new mum to twins added: ‘My twins are a few weeks younger than yours and I’m loving watching how they interact and look for each other. It’s amazing.’

Leigh-Anne and husband-to-be Andre got to enjoy their first Christmas as a family-of-four last month as the star shared the sweetest photos of the brood in matching festive pyjamas.

The Sweet Melody hitmaker and Queens Park Rangers footballer were ultimate family goals as they cradled their babies in front of the Christmas tree with beaming smiles on their faces.

Though the twins are Leigh-Anne’s first children she’s been handling motherhood like a pro as she recently juggled the premiere for her acting debut with breastfeeding her twins in the hotel.

The X Factor winner opened up about her decision not to share the twins’ names and gender publicly telling The Telegraph in November: ‘I’m just gonna keep it to myself.’

Getting candid about adjusting to life as a parent she added: ‘You can’t plan anything. Even when you want to feed them at a certain time it never goes to plan.’

Leigh-Anne got to enjoy some downtime over the festive period before reuniting with bandmates Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirlwall to start rehearsals for the group’s upcoming arena tour.

Following the shows the group will embark on a hiatus but have assured fans they are not splitting up.

Roughly a year into their relationship Offset was accused of trying to set up a threesome with fellow rapper Cuban Doll and his alleged mistress Summer Bunni. Cuban Doll denied the allegations at the time while Cardi B and Offset eventually got married.

But on Saturday (January 8) Cardi B and Cuban Doll exchanged a barrage of contentious tweets reigniting their once-dormant beef. It all started when Cuban Doll shared a behind-the-scenes photo of her upcoming video.

Dressed in a head-to-toe leopard print Cuban Doll noted the look was inspired by Nicki Minaj Cardi B’s purported rival. A fan then posted a video of Cardi showing support for Cuban Doll several years ago and wrote “@iamcardib SHOWS THESE RAP GIRLS SO MUCH LOVE FOR THEM TO DISRESPECT HER FOR NO REASON! ITS SAD.”

AD AD LOADING... AD

Cardi replied “Ask me why they hate me … THEY DONT HAVE A REASON JUST BANDWAGONING …. It’s cool tho everyone that ever hated never succeeded.”

Cuban Doll was quick with a rebuttal and claimed they hadn’t been on good terms since Offset allegedly tried to sleep with her.

“Girl sdfu!!!!” she tweeted. “We never had a problem you dry tweeted that shit bout me … me & you ain’t been cool [since] offset was tryna to fuck me … Don’t play victim. THAT’S WHAT WE NOT FINNA DO.”

“I pray a man don’t marry me just to cheat on me” she wrote. “That’s next level OD DISRESPECT … I could never be inspired by someone I don’t listen to. Simple stop trying to force that on me.”

Cardi B who also deleted her tweets snapped “You started this whole shit wit those two NOW DELETED tweets being shady about the inspiration and then my husband. Now that I respond I’m wrong.” Cuban Doll then called Cardi a “bully” and didn’t seem to grasp why she was triggered.

Cardi replied “It was never about clothes I never shaded you …You put these two tweets up and then deleted them and now you talking about I bullied you?” Bouncing back to the original topic Cuban Doll explained why she didn’t list Cardi B among her inspirations.

The complaint from Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul seeks to force St. Louis-based Foresight Energy to eliminate threats to public health and the environment at its Sugar Camp mine in Franklin County about 270 miles southwest of Chicago.

Raoul also is asking a judge to prohibit Foresight from using firefighting foam made with chemicals known as PFAS. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are a growing concern worldwide because they remain in the environment forever linger in the blood of exposed people for years and trigger several health problems including cancer liver damage and decreased fertility.

Foam made with the chemicals is being phased out in Illinois and 11 other states. But stocks of it are still on hand at airports and industrial operations such as Sugar Camp.

The Sugar Camp coal mine near Benton in southern Illinois on Sept. 16 2021.

“Sugar Camp jeopardized public safety and irresponsibly violated both state environmental statutes and the constraints of its permit by misusing dangerous ‘forever chemicals’ ” Raoul said Friday in a statement. “Exposure to such chemicals can cause long-lasting damage to the environment and poses a serious risk to public health.”

Raoul’s lawsuit filed in Franklin County Circuit Court comes after environmental activists announced plans to file their own complaint under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act.

“The use of firefighting foam containing toxic PFAS chemicals at Sugar Camp mine is the latest reminder that Illinois must move beyond coal and transition to a safer renewable energy future” said Jack Darin director of the Illinois Sierra Club. “That future starts by holding coal companies like (Foresight) … accountable for their actions and protecting communities from further harm.”

The Chicago Tribune first reported in October that one of Foresight’s lawyers told state officials the foam used at Sugar Camp was biodegradable and would not harm fish or wildlife.

Inspectors later determined the company had pumped more than 46000 gallons of PFAS-laden foam into the mine raising the possibility that nearby private wells and other sources of drinking water could be contaminated.

Company officials hired contractors to drill boreholes into the mine without a permit records show. One of the boreholes is close to a creek where testing by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency detected high levels of PFAS.

Both the fire and Foresight’s responses to it remained secret until a local environmental activist took pictures of foam that had drifted to aboveground ditches and farm fields near the mine entrance. The activist forwarded the photos to state officials and to the Tribune which sought more details under the Freedom of Information Act.

Portions of the mine are still smoldering. Federal mining regulators have blocked Foresight from resuming production.

Foresight executives did not return requests for comment.

Because PFAS remain largely unregulated federal and state officials have struggled to protect Americans from the chemicals even though it became clear more than two decades ago that they pose widespread hazards to public health.

Nearly all Americans have PFAS in their blood studies have found. The compounds are known largely for their use in products featuring the Teflon and Scotchgard brands manufactured by DuPont and 3M respectively. Dozens of related compounds are widely used in food packaging stain- and water-resistant clothing carpets and household products among other things.

Foresight one of the last coal companies operating in Illinois declared bankruptcy in 2020. Yet the company produced more than half the 32 million tons of coal mined in the state during the same year.

Nearly all of Foresight’s coal is shipped to other states and countries. The company cuts costs by relying on longwall mining a process that uses robotic equipment rather than people to do most of the work.

Since opening in 2008 Sugar Camp has repeatedly shown up on the U.S. EPA’s list of chronic violators of the federal Clean Water Act. Five of the 16 Illinois miners killed on the job since 2008 worked at the mine where the injury rate exceeded the national average at times during the past decade.

The mine also is a major source of heat-trapping pollution scrambling the planet’s climate. During 2020 companies that burned Foresight coal released more carbon dioxide than emissions from all 4.6 million automobiles registered in Illinois according to a Chicago Tribune analysis.

Madison LeCroy is returning to Southern Charm Season 8 and will presumably be sharing details about her upcoming wedding with fiance Brett Randle. The new season on Bravo will not feature her fiance and her co-stars should not expect an invitation to her event. LeCroy is finally breaking her silence about why her TV friends won’t be making a cameo at her wedding.

Why is Madison LeCroy not inviting her ‘Southern Charm’ co-stars?

LeCroy joined Southern Charm in season 6 of the show as a love interest to Austen Kroll. The entrepreneur became a full-time cast member in season 7 showcasing being a working and single mother to a young boy. Most of her interactions on the show have surrounded her tumultuous relationship with Kroll which ended for good last season.

The reality TV personality confirmed late in 2021 she was engaged to get married to Randle shortly after starting a relationship earlier in the year. No definite date for the wedding has been set but LeCroy did reveal she was planning on holding it in December 2022. However none of her Southern Charm castmates were going to be in attendance.

“The Southern Charm cast will not be at my wedding only because we’re doing family and that’s kind of it” she said during an Instagram Live.

LeCroy also said “I am engaged! And I’m so excited because I honestly had no clue at the time. It was a very special moment for my family. We traveled a good bit around the world and I kinda thought it would possibly happen then but I think it happens when you least expect it.”

A representative for LeCroy confirmed to Page Six that the Southern Charm cast was not attending as it was going to be reserved for “personal friends and family only.”

Madison LeCroy excited for engagement

LeCroy confirmed that she was engaged to marry Randle in October 2021. The couple had been dating for about six months prior to that and the salon owner expressed her excitement during an interview.

“I am so excited and I feel like I’ve been trying to hold this in for quite some time and it has been one of the hardest things I’ve had to do” she told Us Weekly. “Even though I was married in the past I had never tried on a wedding dress. I had never done any of that. This is really the first time that I’m going to be a bride so I’m going to take my time.”

Since revealing her plans for the wedding LeCroy had always maintained she was a small wedding and keep the guest list to less than a hundred people. The salon owner said that her fiancé had a large family and keeping the guest list short was going to be difficult.

Alex Rodriguez scandal

LeCroy made international headlines when she revealed that she had been exchanging messages with Alex Rodriguez who was engaged to Jennifer Lopez. The Bravo star maintained that she was not physical with Rodriguez and had only texted him but there was no cheating involved.

Lopez and Rodriguez would later call off their engagement and go their separate ways.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dGhyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY29hbC1taW5lci1kaWVzLWluLXNvdXRoZXJuLWluZGlhbmEtYWNjaWRlbnQta25veC1zdWxsaXZhbi81MzEtOWIzZWM2M2QtYjMyYi00NjliLTgwYjQtZDRkM2ZjNmRlYzUx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coal miner killed in underground accident in Knox County,"The miner died late Friday in an underground mine between Sullivan and Vincennes.

For years the airline had enjoyed dominating California and other important west coast markets in the United States. With a strong hub in San Francisco and a revived hub in Los Angeles the carrier seemed to be in a strong position to compete against other legacy airlines on the west coast.

However what the airline had not been prepared for was an aggressive assault on its territory from low-cost rival Southwest Airlines. With incredibly low fares high productivity and frequency and reliable performance Southwest had become an instant success in California and began to take market share away from United especially after a strategic legal decision awarded them access to United’s Los Angeles hub.

Steven Wolf United’s CEO at the time recognized the threat Southwest and other low-cost carriers had to his airline’s profitability. He realized that in order to compete with this new generation of startups United’s costs needed to be cut. Knowing this Wolf went to his unions informing them that his plan to compete with low-cost airlines required reduced employee wages and benefits along with a 10 percent increase in productivity.

However unions were unhappy with the concessions they were asked to make. Much of their negotiating power however was eliminated when Wolf threatened to end many of United’s short-haul flights by contracting them to lower-cost airlines. The unions opted to come to an agreement with United’s management in a settlement that ended with a compromise. Wolf got his concessions while United employees would buyout the airline and hold 55% ownership in the company.

With the needed cost cuts the airline launched Shuttle By United an “airline within an airline” focused on offering low fares frequent flights and a simplified service that would support the higher productivity and lower costs the carrier aimed to achieve. Knowing that employees played a crucial role in the success of the airline many of the daily operational details were created by a group of 150 frontline United employees with diverse job responsibilities. By doing this United believed it would create a system that worked for each functional group thus improving productivity throughout the Shuttle’s system.

The planning committee also focused on selectively replicating the product and practices of low- cost airlines especially their competitor Southwest. In Los Angeles some would analyze Southwest’s operations by observing its boarding process and even recording Southwest’s infamous aircraft turn times.

Despite the lessons learned from Southwest United sought to transfer some important aspects of its own brand to its new shuttle service. The challenge however came when trying to determine how to implement some of United’s traditional offerings while still maintaining high levels of productivity by turning aircraft around in 20 minutes. Some of these challenges were overcome like for example deciding to assign seats at the gate to encourage passengers to show up for their flight on time. Additionally they found it was most efficient to board aircraft based on seat position meaning those sitting in a window seat boarded first followed by those traveling in a middle seat then passengers in an aisle seat.

With high morale from the recent employee buyout and an innovative product on Oct. 1 1994 Shuttle By United (eventually renamed United Shuttle) began operations from its San Francisco hub. At first United Shuttle boasted strong performance. In its peak time the carrier flew 469 daily flights to 22 cities throughout the western United States including Seattle/Tacoma (SEA) Portland (PDX) Las Vegas (LAS) and Phoenix (PHX). The threat United’s success posed to Southwest’s profitability even played a huge role in Southwest’s stock value dropping 54 percent between February and December of 1994. United Shuttle it seemed was beginning to achieve its goal.

However it wasn’t too long before United Shuttle began to face headwinds. For one the Shuttle’s main hub in San Francisco suffered from a dense fog many mornings causing many of the fleet’s first flights of the day to be delayed. Because United Shuttle focused on having productive aircraft this meant that those early delays “snowballed” throughout the rest of the Shuttle’s daily flights lowering reliability within its west coast network. Additionally while morale was high at United after the employee buyout the positive culture wore off as time progressed and without proper organizational practices designed to encourage good collaboration among functional groups eventually productivity dropped.

The final nail in the coffin for United Shuttle was the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001. The drop in air travel demand that followed these attacks when combined with the other challenges United Shuttle was facing forced United to integrate the Boeing 737s it used for Shuttle back into its mainline fleet thus ending the carrier’s low-cost experiment.

Though United Shuttle ultimately failed many legacy carriers attempted to compete with low-cost airlines using similar tactics. Continental Airlines launched Continental Lite and U.S. Airways launched Metrojet both of which ended within a few years of being launched. Delta launched Delta Shuttle and after that failed tried to create another low-cost brand named Song which ended up being a financial disaster. United even tried to enter the low-cost market again in the mid-2000s with Ted. Just like the other legacy airlines its second low-cost experiment failed.

In today’s world legacy carriers like United mostly compete with low-cost airlines by offering ticket classes with “unbundled” fares and fewer perks rather than creating an entirely new brand. Though Shuttle ended up failing the lessons it taught United about product and pricing proved to be valuable as they moved through a difficult post-9/11 era and can still be seen in its offerings today.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0c3AuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodC1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb25zLWFuZC1kZWxheXMtdXMtYWlycG9ydHMtdHBhLzY3LWZjMjhiYjY3LTA1YTUtNDExNi05N2FiLTQwMWFjNjcwMzlmM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canceled and delayed flights throughout 2nd weekend of 2022,"Sunday TPA 75 flight delays as of 4 p.m. ET according to flight tracker FlightAware.

AirlineRatings.com has named Air New Zealand as the safest airline in the world for 2022.

The organization publishes the top 20 list every year and ANZ beat out 2021's top carrier Australia-based Qantas.

Five US carriers made the list in 2022 though Southwest Airlines dropped off after ranking 13 last year.

AirlineRatings.com a source for airline safety and product reviews has revealed its top 20 safest carriers in the world for 2022 with five US airlines making the list.

Established in 2013 AirlineRatings.com is a trusted website that rates airline safety inflight products and COVID-19 compliance of 385 worldwide carriers on a unique seven-star scale. Every year AirlineRatings.com releases a list of the top safest airlines in the world and this year Air New Zealand snatched the title from Australia-based Qantas.

AirlineRatings.com editor-in-chief Geoffrey Thomas explained in a press release that ""there is very little between the top 20 they are all standouts.""

""Our top 20 safest airlines 2022 are always at the forefront of safety innovation operational excellence and the launching of new more advanced aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787.""

Air New Zealand is the safest airline in the world for 2022 according to AirlineRatings.com with carriers like Etihad Airways TAP Air Portugal Qatar Qantas Lufthansa and Finnair also making the list. Five US carriers also earned top spots including Alaska Airlines Delta Air Lines Hawaiian Airlines American Airlines and United Airlines.

According to Thomas ANZ earned the title because of its superb incident record number of technological innovations and cockpit advancements comprehensive pilot training and low fleet age which averages just 6.8 years.

AirlineRatings also said ANZ's pilots operate in harsh weather conditions and remote environments adding to the carrier's safety ranking. Moreover the airline excelled in COVID policies and practices.

""Air New Zealand has won countless awards and has a firm focus on safety and its customers and over the past 18 months COVID-19 has brought yet another new dimension to the challenges"" Thomas said.

According to the organization the 2022 awards were based on six factors including crashes in the past five years serious incidents over two years audits from aviation governing bodies government audits fleet age and COVID policies.

However Thomas clarified that all airlines experience incidents and that it is not always the fault of the carrier when things go wrong but sometimes rather the aircraft or engine manufacturer.

""It is the way the flight crew handles these incidents that determines a good airline from an unsafe one"" he said.

There were several ranking shifts in 2022 compared to 2021 most notably were Qantas losing its crown to Air New Zealand after a three-year winning streak Southwest Airlines falling out of the top 20 after ranking number 13 last year and TAP Air Portugal being named Europe's safest carrier after not making the list in 2021.

As we've been reporting airlines across the board have been suffering operational problems for weeks now including the busy holiday period. It was hoped once January was underway and demand slowed down that the airlines would be able to get to some semblance of normalcy. So far that hasn't happened.

Airlines had already canceled more than 1150 flights in the U.S. on Sunday by noon.

The omicron variant of COVID-19 has devastated airline operations and airline schedules for more than two weeks now. Airlines simply don't have enough staff to operate all their flights because of sick calls. A few major snowstorms haven't helped matters.

Henry Harteveldt a travel industry analyst and president of Atmosphere Research told TPG that COVID-19 was causing staff shortages at every airline and at every airport. ""Obviously many cancellations occur at the last minute when a crew member is unable to work ... airlines have done the best they can to cope with a situation that isn't just fluid but chaotic.""

Several airlines have preemptively cut their schedules back significantly. As we reported yesterday Alaska cut 10% of its flights for January in an attempt to restore regular operations. JetBlue had previously announced similar measures.

Related: 1 in 13 flights was canceled during the holidays

The airlines are doing better this weekend than they did last week. Friday airlines canceled more than 2600 flights as a snowstorm hit the Northeast.

Harteveldt also told me the airlines were doing the best they could considering we are in the middle of an ever-changing pandemic:

""This is so frustrating for airline managers airline employees and for travelers. Everyone is eagerly awaiting to see the broader number of case counts and start to see verifiable good news that allows us to confirm the omicron variant peak has been reached and has passed. But this isn't a situation the airlines can control.""

(NYSE:SWK) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Stanley Black & Decker Inc. (NYSE:SWK) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 2 2024

Stanley Black & Decker Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.56 expectations were $0.55. Stanley Black & Decker Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

With one reusable cup replacing up to 30 single-use cups* the program aims to encourage customers to shift away from single-use cups as part of Starbucks global goal to reduce waste sent to landfills by 50% by 2030.

With many customers enjoying their Starbucks® beverage on the go the program invites customers to enjoy the convenience in using reusables while making a positive impact on the planet. Following similar programs in South Korea Japan and the United States Starbucks will take learnings from the Singapore pilot program to develop insights to drive meaningful change in stores while informing future innovation on a global scale.

“We are thrilled to kickstart the Borrow A Cup program in Singapore” said Patrick Kwok General Manager of Starbucks Singapore. “At Starbucks we are constantly testing new innovations that can bring our communities and business partners together around this shared desire to make a positive impact for the planet. We invite customers to join us on our resource-positive journey by choosing reusables as a part of their everyday Starbucks Experience.”

Customers can order their beverage in a reusable cup through the Borrow A Cup program at no additional charge*. In addition customers who bring their personal cups or opt for the borrowed cup will enjoy 50 cents off from their drink purchase.

Starbucks has partnered with Muuse a smart system of reusable to-go containers which allows customers to borrow cups by scanning a QR code on the cup using the Muuse App and enjoy their handcrafted beverage from anywhere. Customers can then bring the used cup back to dedicated return stations at the participating stores to be professionally cleaned and sanitized.

Jonathan Tostevin CEO of Muuse said “We are really excited to launch this partnership with Starbucks to save single-use waste at NUS using the Muuse platform to enable the reuse of Starbucks cups. We believe that this signals the future for all takeaway as we head towards a more circular economy.”

The participating Starbucks stores include NUS Techno Edge NUS University Town and NUS Wet Science Building.

*All reusable cups will be professionally cleaned and sanitized by Muuse after each return by the customers and each reusable cup can be reused for up to 30 times.

*If returned within 14 days. Customers who do not return the cup within the stipulate period will be charged SGD$4 on their saved credit or debit card in the Muuse app.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3NvcmFuZXdzMjQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMDkvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWphcGFucy1zZWFzb25hbC1mb29kLW1lbnUtcmVjb21tZW5kYXRpb25zLWFyZS1mdWxsLW9mLWRlbGVjdGFibGUtc3dlZXRzLWFuZC1zYW5kd2ljaGVzL9IBhwFodHRwczovL3NvcmFuZXdzMjQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMDkvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWphcGFucy1zZWFzb25hbC1mb29kLW1lbnUtcmVjb21tZW5kYXRpb25zLWFyZS1mdWxsLW9mLWRlbGVjdGFibGUtc3dlZXRzLWFuZC1zYW5kd2ljaGVzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks Japan’s seasonal food menu recommendations are full of delectable sweets and sandwiches,"Starbucks is offering a delicious array of sweets for you to have with your coffee or take home to share!

You probably know that Starbucks Japan makes delicious coffee and tea but have you tried their food? They’ve got lots of delicious fare on the menu and like their drinks there are both staples and items that rotate based on the season.

As such Starbucks has a special “Seasonal Recommendations” menu so that you can best take advantage of their ever-rotating menu. For the winter 2022 season they’ve got a tasty-looking array of cakes sandwiches and cookies that look hard to resist starting with the Houjicha & Caramel Mousse Cake (495 yen/US$4.28 per slice). In this decadent dish a roasted green tea-flavored cake is basted with bittersweet caramel and topped with a layer each of roasted green tea mousse caramel milk mousse and whipped cream. If you love the flavor of houjicha then you’ll probably die over this cake!

If you prefer matcha over houjicha then you might like their Choux Cup Matcha Cream & White Choco-Nuts (355 yen). This cup comes with six total cookie cream puffs three each of two flavors: Matcha and White Choco-Nuts. The Matcha cookie cream puffs have a matcha-flavored choux pastry topped with a matcha cookie and filled with a matcha white chocolate cream filling.

The White Choco-Nuts cream puffs are made with an almond-praline choux filled with an almond praline white chocolate cream and topped with a cookie that has diced almonds in it. Sounds delicious! The cup is only sold at certain restaurants though so if you want to try these specifically make sure you check the website before you go out in search of them.

The Apple & Berry Pound Cake (385 yen) might be a great option if you’re looking for something a little lighter to go with your drink. Made from a batter mixed with cream cheese apple preserves and dried cranberries then baked and iced with a frosting made from cream cheese and cream this moist pound cake is sure to be the perfect complement to a nice hot cup of coffee.

For something with a little more of a crunch there’s the Crispy Strawberry Churro (300 yen). It’s made crunchy and delicious with a strawberry-flavored coating and chocolate sprinkles for an extra dazzle of color. They look scrumptious. These are also limited by cafe location so make sure to check if your local store has them.

Starbucks Japan is also offering a Japanese-style sweet this winter: the An Butter Sandwich (300 yen). This is a soft fluffy roll sliced and filled with a mixture of koshian (smooth red bean paste) and tsubuan (coarse red bean paste) and of course butter. The fragrance of the roll combined with the sweetness of red bean paste and the richness of butter make it an unexpectedly luxurious combination.

Two savory sandwich options are available if you want something for lunch: the Tuna & Green Sandwich (545 yen) and the Chicken & Green Sandwich (545 yen). The tuna salad is made with green beans onions and black olives dressed with mustard and mayo and topped with green leaf lettuce and red onions all on fluffy bread.

The chicken salad is made of sliced and steamed chicken dressed in a rich sauce of soy sauce eggs onion vinegar carrot puree garlic paste sesame seeds. Served on fluffy bread together with a carrot salad purple cabbage and green leaf lettuce this sandwich is sure to be a delicious lunch.

Cookie fans will probably like the Milk Cream Cookie Sandwich (225 yen). With a smooth creamy sweet milk cream filling sandwiched between two crunchy cookies you can’t go wrong with this as a tea-time treat.

If you’re looking for something to bring back to the office to share Starbucks is also offering the 4-type Cookie Assortment Box (1800 yen) the Starbucks Cheesecake (2950 yen) and the Starbucks Chocolate Cake (2950 yen). The assorted cookie box comes with butter cookies matcha cookies chocolate macarons and mixed berry ball cookies all in a sleek Satrbucks tin great for sharing with friends or giving as a gift.

The two cakes are available on the Starbucks Online Store only but look absolutely delectable with their smooth and rich filling over a crunchy biscuit base. If you’re hosting tea at home you’ll impress your guests with either of these two options!

Check out these items at a Starbucks near you (or online in the case of the cheesecake and chocolate cake) but they’ll only be around for a limited time so don’t wait if you want to try them! And while you’re there don’t forget to try one of their winter frappuccinos the Houjicha meets Caramel Cream Frappuccino. Houjicha fans have much to enjoy at Starbucks this year!

The McDonald’s restaurant — along with that nostalgic drive thru and retro McDonald’s characters at Brookdale South — has closed.

When we told our college-age daughter who grew up playing in the play place and then later going to the drive thru with friends for late night eats her reaction was “NOOOOO!”

The New Jersey Turnpike Authority tells us that Brookdale South’s Mickey D’s and the Vauxhall rest stop restaurant on the GSP have both closed with only vending and grab-and-go food options offered at both locations temporarily.

This spring the main buildings are scheduled to be demolished. There will be no food available at either location while new facilities are being built.

When construction is complete in 2023 the Brookdale South rest stop restaurants will include Chick-fil-A Burger King Starbucks and a convenience store. The Vauxhall rest stop is getting a Shake Shack Popeyes Dunkin’ and a convenience store.

Will you miss this McDonald’s?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsaXRlZGFpbHkuY29tL25ld3MvaXMtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWNvZmZlZS1wb3BwaW5nLXBlYXJscy1ib2JhLWRyaW5rLXRlc3QtbmF0aW9ud2lkZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Starbucks Coffee Popping Pearls Boba Test Nationwide? Here's The Deal,"ICYMI Starbucks is testing out Coffee Popping Pearls sips and they appear to be similar to boba. The exciting test item features popping pearls to complement two different drink flavors: In The Dark (a coffee sip) and an Iced Chai Tea Latte. The pearls are filled with real Starbucks coffee and burst in your mouth so you probably want to know where you can try the unique sip. Here’s the scoop on if the Starbucks Coffee Popping Pearls will test nationwide.

Off the bat Starbucks was mum about the Coffee Popping Pearls test. The Seattle-based coffee company quietly began testing the sips in December 2021 and TikTokers discovered the Coffee Popping Pearls drinks in late December 2021. In a Dec. 21 video from TikToker @kirbyssister you can see a promotional sign listing both of the Coffee Popping Pearls drinks as well as images of the boba-like balls in the sips.

As of Jan. 9 2022 the the Coffee Popping Pearls test beverages are only in two U.S. locations: Palm Desert California and Bellevue Washington according to a Starbucks spokesperson. Unfortunately an expansion to more stores doesn’t look promising at the moment. “[Starbucks does not] have additional information to share on future availability of these products in our stores or whether we will expand the test to additional stores or markets” the Starbucks spokesperson said. But all hope is not lost as the spokesperson added “Testing is a way of life at Starbucks and we continue to introduce new drinks and food to menus globally.”

That means you'll need to visit the Palm Desert or Bellevue locations to give the Coffee Popping Pearls sips a tase and see what Starbucks’ take on boba is like. The Coffee Popping Pearls contain real coffee and pop in your mouth for a burst of flavor. It's unclear what's in the “In The Dark” sip except that it appears to be an iced coffee. Going off Starbucks' 2014 tweet mentioning a “shot in the dark” it could be a coffee with a shot of espresso though you’ll need to try the sip to find out. Meanwhile the Iced Chai Tea Latte should be the same classic sip you know and love with a popping pearls twist.

It looks like you can also customize one of the test sips as you would any other drink at Starbucks. For example in the TikTok video @kirbysister specified that their order was “a half sweet brown sugar chai with cinnamon and oat milk” instead of a classic Iced Chai Tea Latte.

To see if the drinks become available nationwide you’ll need to wait it out for more details from Starbucks. As you’re (im)patiently waiting for more info if you head out on a Starbucks run remember to check the CDC guidelines for the most updated health rules.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nZWVrd2lyZS5jb20vMjAyMi9xYS13aXRoLWtlbGx5LXNtaXRoLXN0YXJ0dXAtZm91bmRlci1hbmQtZXgtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXZwLWxlYWRpbmctZGlnaXRhbC10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi1hdC1jYXItY29tcGFueS1oYWdlcnR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Q&A with Kelly Smith startup founder and ex-Starbucks VP leading digital transformation at car company Hagerty,"Kelly Smith chief digital officer at Hagerty. (Photo courtesy of Smith)

Kelly Smith knows a thing or two about digital transformation.

Before the phrase fully entered the business world lexicon Smith was at Starbucks where he helped lead its digital and mobile app expansion from 2014 to 2017. He then took a similar role at MGM Resorts using software and data to improve guest experiences at MGM locations.

Smith — who founded several Seattle startups earlier in his career — is now chief digital officer and chief information officer at Hagerty a classic car insurer that just went public in a SPAC deal valuing the company at more than $3 billion.

“I am really having fun. The cars make it really fun” Smith said in a recent interview with GeekWire (check out his wicked Porsche collection).

Founded in 1984 Hagerty is known for providing insurance for classic vehicles. It is riding growth in the classic car market particularly amid the pandemic.

But the Traverse City Mich. company has plans to grow into something much more — with digital at the core of that vision and Smith leading the way.

The longtime tech exec and entrepreneur brings a unique perspective as someone who has lived through hyper growth at both nascent startups and decades-old corporations. He previously founded Seattle startups such as RocketVox (sold to ThePlatform) ImageKind (sold to CafePress) and Zapd (sold to RealSelf).

We caught up with Smith to chat about his role at Hagerty the company’s SPAC what digital transformation means tech trends remote work Seattle and his memorable moment with Elon Musk while interviewing for a role at Tesla. The conversation was edited for brevity and clarity.

GeekWire: Good to catch up with you again Kelly. We miss you in Seattle. Where are you at these days?

Kelly Smith: We’re living in Idaho but I’m traveling to Traverse City once every three to four weeks. Hagerty’s transition to remote has gone great. We were extremely lucky because our leadership team was really supportive and enthusiastic about embracing best-of-breed tools for our employees. We made the cutover to Zoom and Slack before the pandemic. And now I think we have proven that remote work is a business advantage for us — so much so that we actually redesigned most of our office space to accommodate a remote work model.

GeekWire: The Hagerty gig must be fun. I think you love cars more than coffee (Starbucks) and casinos (MGM).

Smith: I am really having fun. The cars make it really fun. These old classic cars they can be money pits. I’m in the middle of two restorations right now. It doesn’t make any sense. But to people who love these cars it doesn’t need to make sense. Having people around you who enjoy the hobby and are willing to be somewhat irrational just to create some enjoyment in life is a blast.

GeekWire: Talk a bit about Hagerty and your role there.

Smith: Hagerty is probably the largest and most well-known insurer of classic and collectible car cars. But we sell a lot of insurance without talking about insurance. We’re one of the largest holders of valuation data for classic cars. We are one of the largest pay membership programs for automotive enthusiasts. We are one of the largest producers of automotive enthusiast media. We are developing physical spaces that are a combination of storage and entertainment spaces. We own many of the popular automotive events out there. And we’re working on a number of new innovations that keep fueling the automotive hobby such as a new way to buy and sell cars. We have a range of platforms that are not yet launched.

GeekWire: How is Hagerty using technology and digital to expand and what is your role in leading that?

Smith: To unpack that it’s fun to go backwards. I went from the entrepreneurial Seattle world into a more traditional corporate role at Starbucks. I was curious and interested in how these traditional companies would scale in an age of technology and whether or not I could add value at that scale. Then I came to MGM where I was the chief digital officer doing a very similar kind of role. And then finally here to Hagerty.

The “why” for me personally has turned into my own infatuation and interest in digital transformation stories amongst traditional non-tech companies. It started becoming more clear how someone like me could add value in these types of environments. It’s unbelievably challenging and it’s really interesting work.

One of things I’ve noticed as being a significant difference between my time in Seattle and the chapter of my life now is that the cultural divide is so much more significant than almost everybody including my former peers could have imagined in every little way.

How many times do you hear people in Seattle talking about or using the acronym “IT”? Not much. And yet outside of that reality that is the phrase people use in traditional companies to talk about technology.

To the rest of the world coming up in tech especially in and around Seattle and California they don’t actually know the real challenges and issues within traditional companies.

And a lot of people don’t realize only 30% of digital transformations are successful. So the “why” for me is very curious. Because if everybody presumably is getting the same newspaper in the morning if everybody’s reading the same internet then why do we have stories like Kmart or Sears or Macy’s or even Blockbuster? It’s an interesting question. If we’re all getting the same newspaper why are only 30% of digital transformations successful?

And so it’s that question and the reasons for the results that I have found to be incredibly interesting on the one hand and incredibly fulfilling from a professional perspective because you can really drive meaningful fulfilling impact.

GeekWire: Talk more about “digital transformation” and how you think about that phrase.

Smith: Digital transformation is not a buzzword that the consulting firms made up to sell more services. It is a real thing with with very real challenges.

To maintain business performance and relevance and cost control you need to have an ability to produce innovative products that meet the needs of customers who now have evolving expectations. They have an experience with Airbnb or an experience with Netflix or an experience with Amazon. Their expectations are rising and it permeates across into other areas in so much as how a customer makes purchase decisions. It will have an impact on your profitability and on your customer acquisition.

Now the issue is fundamentally that businesses typically don’t know how to go about creating a new kind of innovation culture within their traditional culture. And that’s usually because they don’t have awareness as to the importance of a framework to do it.

What do we mean by framework? From the board down does the enterprise have a stated digital North Star? Or are they just throwing money at different initiatives hoping something good happens?

Is there support at the CEO level and down to help drive the culture change so that it sticks from senior management all the way down through middle management so that the effort is not sabotaged?

For the last 30 years a business may have operated in such a way that the VP of sales drove the product roadmap. And now all of a sudden it’s a totally different conversation where there’s this new discipline called product management that feels that it has a different method for how you realize products and bring them to market. Product management isn’t even a thing in a lot of companies including my former employer MGM.

So it’s about bringing in new kinds of people teaching new disciplines new perspectives and rethinking whatever you thought traditional it was. What it amounts to is creating a more collaborative empowered culture that lets innovation flourish. It’s hard to do.

GeekWire: What’s an example of tech you are helping implement at Hagerty?

Smith: In our case lots of people do business with us — adding a car removing a car starting a new policy canceling a policy — over the phone. So we have hundreds of call center agents. As it stands right now we don’t even have a mobile app where you can get your insurance ID card. So we are trying to pour concrete to get to a table stakes position and we are then trying to get to the next level where we’re using innovation to drive business value.

And what that means is obviously a lot of different things. A lot of what that means is going backward and modernizing legacy technology that’s holding the company back from delivering on those table stakes.

We’ve definitely shifted from a feature team where you’re basically producing orders that come to the back kitchen into a team where much of the innovation is happening more cross-functionally and you have more people helping to drive the strategy and the product offerings.

We’re building systems. This includes everything that the Airbnbs of the world take for granted. We’re creating baseline systems that might have been assumed elsewhere.

The reason most of these digital transformation efforts fail is because there’s no blueprint. Without a framework or a blueprint you might not get the results that you were hoping for. So what we’re trying to do now is set up a blueprint where we quantify the outcomes. We are investing in digital transformation for five reasons:

No. 1. Drive new sales. And there has to be a dollar amount and a date. That’s how we measure whether or not we’re successful. It’s new sales enabled by digital channels.

No. 2. Reduce our member support and service costs by X percentage by the end of 2024.

No. 3. Drive better customer retention metrics through these investments by X percent.

No. 4. Use these digital investments to create new levers that allow us to push deeper into our total addressable market so that we can take more of it.

No. 5. Hopefully with all these digital investments you are driving increased operational efficiency and effectiveness in all areas from finance to legal. You’re able to review contracts faster collaborate more work better and more efficiently.

“The reason most of these digital transformation efforts fail is because there’s no blueprint.”

So we are now starting to address the part where most other digital transformations fail which is aligning on a framework so that we know how we’re doing. It’s really surprisingly straightforward but most companies don’t do that. And so they flounder and then the board loses interest. When the board starts losing interest because they can’t keep track of what’s going on except for the money up going out the door that’s when you start to see a breakdown.

GeekWire: Why did Hagerty go public and why via a SPAC?

Smith: We roughly estimate that there are 500 million global automotive enthusiasts. We currently have 660000 paying members who are part of our Hagerty Drivers Club. And so now that we’ve got a formula that’s firing on all cylinders we can say okay let’s apply capital to this equation to produce more leverage so that we can push into other markets international markets ship some of these other products we’re talking about develop more media content produce more events build out more physical spaces and so forth. We’re using the capital for very healthy reasons.

In terms of the SPAC we were able to find additional leverage through the SPAC partners that we ultimately merged with. It just so happens that our SPAC partners are car enthusiasts. Aldel (the SPAC) is primarily led by Rob Kauffman who is a notable private car collector and is in the top 100 of worldwide personal car collectors. We both had strong ties to other car community and professional auto racing luminaries. And so the collective of those automotive luminaries adds additional leverage to our IPO and that’s why we did this SPAC IPO.

GeekWire: You are still investing out of Curious Office. More broadly what tech trends are you excited about right now?

Smith: There’s a couple of different spaces that really have my attention. I think the low-code world is going to start to really heat up. If you remember years back hardcore developers sort of looked down on these things thinking it’s not real software. But I think we’re past that time.

I’m also interested in the intersection of loyalty NFTs and how people start to creatively use these things beyond pictures and images. Can you add customer value by using these things in really interesting ways beyond what we’re seeing?

And I’m really interested in product management tools marketplaces etc. because that’s going to be one of the big unlocks for mainstream businesses.

GeekWire: Any thoughts on Seattle and its tech scene especially since you’ve left?

Smith: One of the things I notice about Seattle is how the streets and the landscape have changed just because of all the building going on. But my overall takeaway would be between the combination of watching Seattle grow as much as it has to watching Tesla blow up the way it has and being in the middle of these digital transformation stories — it has made it pretty clear that we are going through such a massive transformational shift that now I understand better. I understand why Amazon is growing as fast as it is for consumers on one hand and why it is growing as fast as it is along with Microsoft with the cloud on the other.

This is a transformational moment we’re living through. And I’m much more aware of it now than I was when I was in the middle of it.

And by the way I don’t think you knew this but I almost went to Tesla before going to MGM.

GeekWire: Wow — that would have been an interesting move.

Smith: I wasn’t necessarily even thinking about leaving Starbucks. But I got a call from Tesla and they were looking for someone to run their product teams. So I went down there spent an hour with Elon in the conference room. That was pretty interesting. It was right around the time they were struggling to hit their Model 3 delivery marks and it kind of wasn’t clear what was going to happen with this company.

Elon is super super intense. I needed a minute or two to calibrate to the way he thinks. But then once I kind of did we hit it off and it started being really fun.

He was sitting in the conference room with a furrowed brow when I walked in. I could see he was preoccupied with something. And I said “looks like you’re you’re preoccupied with something I hope my timing is not terrible.” He said “yeah I can’t figure out why we’re not hitting our sales numbers in the Northeast.”

I kind of lean back in my chair like regular people do and say “hmm can’t figure out why you’re not hitting your sales numbers in the Northeast.” He looked at me he said “Yeah … that’s what I just said.” I’m like OK I think I understand this guy better. He’s an extremely literal individual.

I told him that I bet it had do with people’s concerns over battery performance and cold weather. I said he should take a Tesla car and enter it in these events like Pike’s Peak (a race in Colorado). Electric cars eventually are always going to hold the record because they don’t have the deficiencies of altitude that combustion engines do. That got his attention. He’s like “Yeah that’s it.” Sure enough by the way electric cars went on to set the record so it turned out to be true."

He's understood to be joining a hedge fund.

Sources say that Eggenschwyler resigned on Friday. Eggenschwyler didn't respond to a request to confirm the move and Credit Suisse declined to comment.

It's understood that Eggenschwyler is joining hedge fund Brevan Howard. This has not been confirmed by BH.

Eggenschwyler spent nearly 15 years at Credit Suisse after joining the bank from Barclays in 2007. His exit comes just months before bonuses are paid for 2021 and follows the announcement of a new strategy at Credit Suisse which will see capital allocated to the investment bank fall from $13bn in Q3 2021 to $11bn in 2022. It also comes as JPMorgan's European banking analysts are predicting a 16% drop in total global credit trading revenues across all banks between 2021 and 2022.

Eggenschwyler is one in a series of senior credit traders to quit Credit Suisse. 30-year-old star credit trader Hamza Lemssouguer left Credit Suisse in 2020 and now running his own hedge fund Arini Capital. Fellow credit trading star David Goldenberg left the bank to become head of macro credit trading at Barclays last October.

It's thought that Eggenschwyler was one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hamza's exit from the high yield trading team. His departure at this point in the bonus cycle suggests that Credit Suisse's bonuses - which are expected to be low following losses relating to Archegos and Greensill - may not be worth sticking around for.

School officials set up cameras around the stadium and captured the demolition from several angles. A string of explosions on the grandstand’s support beams sent the structure crashing down into the empty parking lot.

Steve Hatch who works for Dykon Demolition said the demolition worked exactly how it was designed

""It was designed to fall that direction into the parking lot and it came over exactly how we wanted it to"" Hatch said.

The stadium renovation is expected to be complete before the 2023 football season. By the time it opens to the public it will be equipped with a student center and wellness center.

We don’t just cover the best phone carriers for American readers here at Android Authority. Our Canadian neighbors have just as many carriers to choose from and the choices are even tougher in some provinces. Fido is one of our personal favorites throughout Canada and it’s one of the best bets if you’re hoping to skip the high prices of most Canadian plans. It’s the fourth-largest carrier in Canada and there are plenty of reasons to sign yourself up. See also: These are the best Canadian phone plans

We’ll break down everything there is to know about Fido throughout this page with a particular focus on all of the available plans. After that we’ll dip into some of the best devices on the network and even give you some comparisons to top competitors. There aren’t too many MVNOs in Canada but it’s best to make an informed decision so we’ll dive into a few of those too. Ready to check out the carrier that’s for the dogs? Let’s get into it!

Fido at a glance Fido or Fido Solutions as it’s formally known started its journey in December of 1996. The network was initially funded by Voicestream which is now T-Mobile US. The Fido name itself came out of a need to appeal to French and English customers. Rogers Communications acquired Fido back in 2004 changing the name to Fido Solutions shortly afterward. The MVNO now runs on Rogers’ nationwide network which the carrier boasts can reach 97% of all Canadians.

Fido positions itself as the cool midrange alternative to Rogers’ full-service coverage as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Fido had a subscriber base of a little over three million users as of the last report. You’ll find Fido’s coverage throughout much of southern Canada and the carrier relies on GSM and HSPA Plus service for most of its signal. Fido offers a handy interactive map so you can check for your local coverage. Take a peek in your backyard right here.

Data Talk and Text Fido keeps its plans reasonably simple and the Data Talk and Text option is the most complete experience around. It offers everything you need and you essentially pay based on your data cap. You can pick up a Starter plan from CA$38 per month for 2GB of data and boost your coverage up to 15GB for CA$70. It doesn’t appear like you can add extra data but Fido’s five extra hours perk allows for unlimited data for five hours each month.

If you’re looking to take your talk abroad you can add preferred international rates for just $5 per month. It gets even better if you plan to keep in touch with friends in America — unlimited US calling is $15 per month. Overall the Data Talk and Text plan is the best overall value you can get from Fido if you want to use your device to its full potential.

Highlights: Unlimited talk and text

Up to 15GB of data per month

International calling options Best for: Users who want to get the most for their money

Talk and Text The name is relatively self-explanatory in this case. This plan gives you all of the talk and text you could ask for. For CA$30 per month Fido will keep you connected to your family and friends though you’ll have to have a reliable Wi-Fi source if you want data. You can also take advantage of the same international add-ons — preferred international rates for $5 and unlimited US calling for $15.

Highlights: Unlimited talk and text

Low monthly rate of CA$30

International add-ons available Best for: Users who don’t need any data

Data and Talk Just like the last plan two out of three isn’t half bad. However this option drops unlimited calling in favor of a data cap that you can choose for yourself. Options start at just 250MB for CA$15 per month and range as high as 3GB for CA$30 per month. No matter your data cap neither basic plan makes mention of text messages.

Although there are no text options for the plan it looks like you can still add voicemail options at no extra cost. It’s not immediately clear whether you can pay to expand your mailbox but the 250MB plan charges as you go.

Highlights: Flexible data cap

Low monthly cost Best for: Users who spend little to no time texting

Tablet and connected device plans

Oliver Cragg / Android Authority

As long as you’re already a Fido customer adding a tablet or other connected device can take just minutes. It essentially works like a mobile hotspot plan where you’ll pay for your data cap and let Fido do the rest. The most popular plan offers 4GB of data for just CA$15 per month. You can grab several brand-new tablets straight from Fido itself. You’ll have to make monthly payments on whichever device you choose.

Talk Text and Data Fido’s prepaid plans follow almost the same blueprint as its post-paid offerings. You won’t find quite as much data however. Once again the Talk Text and Data option is the most complete plan you can get though it’s certainly not a cheap way to go. You won’t find unlimited minutes on the CA$55 per month base level including just 750MB of data per month. In fact you get more for less money with the post-paid version of the plan.

However you’re not out to dry if you want to go prepaid — otherwise Fido wouldn’t even offer the plan. You can bump up to 1GB or 2GB of monthly data and you get unlimited texting to the US and international phone numbers on top of it all. If you splurge for the top level of service you can expect to pay CA$70 per month.

Highlights: Choose your data cap along with talk and text

Prices start at CA$55 Best for: Users who want the most coverage in a prepaid plan.

Talk and Text If you want the most affordable plan Fido offers the prepaid talk and text plan is it. However your cheapest option won’t get you close to unlimited service. Prepaid Talk and Text starts at just 75 minutes of talk and 75 texts for CA$15 per month. You can jump to 250 minutes and texts for CA$25 per month or 1000 minutes and unlimited texts for CA$35 per month.

Of course as a talk and text plan there’s no baked-in data but you can always choose to add some later. Your options include 100MB 500MB or 1GB of extra data and those will cost you CA$10 CA$20 or CA$30 depending on how high you go.

Highlights: The most affordable plan Fido has to offer

Choose your talk and text levels Best for: Users who want to save money and don’t use their phones much

Which Fido plan is right for you?

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

If you’re all set to join Fido then you’re probably asking which plan is the best for you. The answer mainly comes down to your usage. It’s tough to top the Talk Text and Data plan for flexibility though some users may not need all three parts. If that’s the case you can always swap for one of the other plans and save a little cash.

Fido’s prepaid plans are a viable alternative especially if you want to save even more. They offer a similar structure to the post-paid plans though you have fewer options. You should have more than enough access thanks to the prepaid Talk Text and Data plans but at that point you may not be saving much money over the post-paid plans. All post-paid plans come with the same suite of Fido benefits but you can always add extra data and talk to your prepaid option.

How does Fido fare against the competition?

If you’re ready to switch carriers it’s best to make a fully informed decision. We’ll do some comparison shopping to see how Fido stacks up against two of its top competitors — Virgin Mobile and Koodo. All three are wholly owned subsidiaries of Canada’s largest carriers making sense as midrange rivals. We’ll take the top plans from each carrier and compare them to see which is most worth your money.

Virgin Mobile Canada Owned by Bell Mobility Virgin Mobile takes a similar approach as Fido when it comes to plans. Everything is built for the millennial subscriber right down to the MyBenefits and MyPeeps perks. MyBenefits allows you to rack up discounts and benefits on food clothing and more. MyPeeps on the other hand is all about you and your friends. You can set up multiple lines of service on the same bill and you’ll get unlimited calling between them all.

Even Virgin’s plans are similar to Fido’s right down to the data caps. You’ll pay a similar rate that tops out at around CA$75 and you can take full advantage of an extensive nationwide network.

Highlights: MyBenefits and MyPeeps perks

Similar prices slightly larger network

Koodo Mobile Over in the Telus umbrella Koodo Mobile operates as yet another Fido sibling. We call it a sibling since it follows the same midrange millennial-focused structure as Fido and Virgin Mobile. You’ll find reliable customer service and Telus and Bell utilize the same LTE network for coverage. Your best perk is shock-free data which means that Koodo will send you helpful reminders as you get closer and closer to your data cap.

As for Koodo’s plans there are two main ways to price out your service. You can save some money by bringing your own device or you can pay into your Tab which is essentially a piggy bank for buying new devices after a certain period. If you don’t upgrade often then you can pay into a small Tab or you can pour some funds in there to get ready for a flagship release.

Highlights: Same LTE network as Virgin Mobile

Tab helps you save up for a new phone

Rogers

We’ve already compared Fido to its top MVNO competition but what if you want a full-size network? If you like the sound of Fido or any of its competitors it might be even easier to go for one of Canada’s largest providers. In this case we’ve chosen Rogers Bell and Telus because each is the owner of one of our popular MVNO picks. Let’s tap into some top plans to see which carrier comes out on top.

Rogers Wireless Get a free tablet for 24 months

Telus Mobility Save up to CA$15 per line per month



Rogers Wireless Up first for the big guns is Fido’s parent network Rogers Wireless. You’ll get the same level of nationwide service as you would on Fido but Rogers adds a few extra goodies to the mix. You can take advantage of Canada’s largest 5G network and you can even get a free tablet over the course of a two-year agreement. Even better Rogers Infinite offers a large pool of sharable data at reasonable prices. You can save an extra CA$15 per line every time you add a device.

Bell Mobility If you’re looking at Bell the first thing you might notice is that it offers a ton of plans. You can go Unlimited or choose Connect Everything and then there are even promotional plans on top of that. Depending on what you choose you’ll either get unlimited access to Canada’s fastest 5G network or you’ll get a nice pool of data to share between your accounts. Bell also offers a long list of connected device plans so you can connect your whole house to the internet.

Telus Mobility The last competitor to consider is Telus Mobility. Like we mentioned with Koodo it shares the same nationwide LTE network as Bell so you at least know that you’re getting excellent service. All plans also include unlimited talk and text so it comes down to how much you want to share your data. If you go for either Peace of Mind or Peace of Mind Connect you’re pretty much able to keep your data to yourself and your own devices. However if you head for the Simple Share plan you can split a pool between your family and friends.

What phones can I use?

Even though Fido Solutions positions itself as a midrange player in the Canadian phone game it’s not short on the list of available devices. If it’s come out in the past year there’s a pretty good chance that you can grab it from Fido. For example the entire iPhone 13 family is up and ready along with the Google Pixel 6 and Samsung Galaxy S21 devices. True to the budget-friendly goal you can also grab the Moto G Power and scores of other devices for no money down. See also: The best phone deals

Read this you may lose service,"Larry Miller admits he’s not too techy.

He has a computer but uses it as a word processor. He goes to the library regularly to check email or go on the internet.

“I was dragged kicking and screaming into the computer age” said the 82-year-old retired writer who lives in Springfield Township.

His cellphone is a flip phone. He thinks he bought it 10 years ago and he uses Tracfone to buy buckets of minutes since he doesn’t want an expensive monthly bill.

He only has it for emergencies and to call his adult son in West Virginia with prepaid cell minutes instead of hefty landline long distance rates.

But now Miller and others nationwide who have old phones on the nation’s 3G cellular network are going to have to buy a new phone if they want service.

More:Remember 3G? It's going away as AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile shift to 5G. What to know about 3G shutdown

The nation’s major cellular phone carriers are sunsetting or

shutting down their 3G networks which were first introduced 20 years ago and rely on older technology to make room for more advanced network services including 5G said the Federal Communications Commission.

“As a result many older cellphones will be unable to make or receive calls and texts including calls to 911 or use data services. This will affect 3G mobile phones and certain older 4G mobile phones that do not support Voice over LTE (VoLTE or HD Voice)” the FCC said.

This could also impact other gadgets such as medical devices home security systems smart watches vehicle SOS services and other connected products may be using 3G network services the FCC said.

The various cell companies will be retiring or sunsetting their 3G networks throughout this year. Here’s information on dates from the FCC. It's possible dates could change but it's good to know what is coming up so you can prepare if needed:

AT&T will finish shutting down its 3G network by February 2022.

Verizon will finish shutting down its 3G network by December 31 2022.

T-Mobile will finish shutting down Sprint's 3G CDMA network by March 31 2022 and Sprint's 4G LTE network by June 30 2022. It also announced it will shut down T-Mobile's 3G UMTS network by July 1 2022 but has not yet announced a shutdown date for its 2G network.

If your mobile carrier is not listed here you may still be affected. Many carriers such as Cricket Boost Straight Talk and several Lifeline mobile service providers utilize AT&T's Verizon's and T-Mobile's networks.

A technology story by my USA Today colleague Brett Molina has more detail and can be found at https://tinyurl.com/2p9xj2dm.

When the 3G network goes away people will not be able to use their phones over that cellular network even for 911 calls. You may be able to use Wi-Fi.

But it’s not just old flip phones that are still on 3G and will be affected; some older smartphones will be affected too — including an iPhone 5 or older model as well as several models of the Samsung Galaxy.

So what should you do? I included links in this column by the sunset dates for the specific major carriers' information. Or all of the carriers have lists of impacted phones if you search the internet for the name of the carrier and 3G sunset or 3G shutdown. Or call or take your phone to your provider’s store. In some cases some phones may need a software upgrade but that will be the easy fix. Most older devices on 3G will need a new phone.

Miller wasn’t sure whether his old phone was affected when he originally emailed me before the holidays. He had read an article alerting senior citizens that their phones may not work in 2022.

He took it to his local Walmart electronics counter where he usually buys the Tracfone prepaid cards.

The Walmart employee “kind of pooh-poohed the whole thing” Miller told me. “He didn’t think it was a big deal. He said he was aware of the issue” and told Miller he’d probably need to buy a new phone for 30 to 40 bucks.

When Miller and I met up with a Beacon Journal photographer he showed me his phone. I showed Miller where he could find the model number for the phone by opening the back battery case and taking the battery out. The model number is under the battery.

But we didn’t even need to look up on the internet whether his Tracfone was going to be affected by the 3G shutdown.

When I powered up the phone again a message popped up warning that his active service was only through July 18. His phone also said 3G on the upper left of the screen once it fully powered up.

Miller says he has no choice but to upgrade his phone even though it works perfectly fine for him. He wants another simple phone but said he has trouble opening the flip phone so he’ll look for something a little easier — and cheap.

“I will get one. I guess if I have to” he said.

Samsung launched its first 5 G -enabled device in April that year. Apple followed suit in late 2020 with its long-awaited 5 G iPhone. Until now however actual 5 G coverage in America has been limited. The country’s three biggest carriers AT & T  Verizon and T -Mobile have offered 5 G connectivity but in practice this differed little from the earlier 4 G . AT & T and Verizon had to delay their large-scale roll-outs of something closer to the hype in December after the Federal Aviation Administration aired concerns that their 5 G radio spectrum interferes with avionics on some ageing aircraft. On January 3rd both firms which insist that the technology is safe (and can be turned off around airports just in case) said they would again postpone switching on their 5 G networks by two weeks.

Yet it is the imminent arrival of another player in the 5 G contest that is the talk of the industry. In the next few months Dish Networks a company best known for its satellite-television service is expected to launch America’s fourth big carrier. The firm’s promise to inject more competition into a concentrated and ossified sector was what helped persuade regulators to approve a merger between T -Mobile and Sprint a smaller incumbent in 2020."

Like many travelers over the holidays I got stuck last week in my effort to get back home. I live in San Francisco and was in Phoenix with my family. We picked that as our New Year's meeting spot so we could attend the college football Fiesta Bowl pitting Notre Dame against my brother's former squad Oklahoma State. My flight home was scheduled for Monday morning. But because of severe winter storms in parts of the country and airline staffing shortages from the fast-spreading Covid omicron variant it was delayed three times. Rather than bum around the airport I decided to do some work and have some fun in the process. Phoenix is the only market where Waymo is currently operating its self-driving ride-hailing service Waymo One to the general public though test rides are available in San Francisco. As the Alphabet beat reporter I thought — what better time to give it a shot? No employees no public relations staff and no camera crew. Just me my phone and a minivan with no driver. Last time I rode in a Waymo was 2019 a year after Waymo One started offering trips to select riders. I visited the company's Phoenix office and took a ride in a self-driving car which at the time could only operate with a safety driver behind the wheel. Since then Waymo has raised $5.5 billion in funding from investors including Silver Lake Andreessen Horowitz and T. Rowe Price . It also launched Waymo Via a local delivery service and announced that it's testing self-driving vehicles in San Francisco and New York. The company says its cars have driven more than 20 billion miles in simulation and over 20 million miles on public roads.

Getting a car

Before I could experience a Waymo One firsthand I had to first find out where I could pick one up. Waymo only reaches a portion of the sprawling Phoenix area. I knew this because earlier in my stay I'd tried to order a car but the app told me I was outside its service region. According to its website Waymo One operates in suburbs including Chandler Tempe Mesa and Gilbert.

I already had an account from my prior unsuccessful attempt. To register I had to connect to my Google user account by entering my Gmail address and password. Next I added my credit card information. Then I went to open the map to summon a vehicle. When I attempted this a few days earlier a message popped up saying ""Autonomous specialists are temporarily accompanying rides which means someone will be in the driver's seat."" I had to click ""OK"" before proceeding. That was a bit of a surprise because in October 2020 then-CEO John Krafcik who left the company in April said in a blog post that ""Waymo is opening its fully driverless service to the general public in Phoenix."" Julianne McGoldrick a Waymo spokesperson told CNBC in an email that humans sit behind the wheel ""during inclement weather."" However it hadn't rained around the time that I received the notification. The rest of the setup was straightforward similar to signing up for Lyft or Uber . On Monday the day of my actual Waymo trip I took a 15-minute Lyft ride from my hotel near the airport to the Raintree Ranch Center in Chandler so I could finally be in range to order a car. At the shopping center I grabbed a cup of coffee at Starbucks and opened the Waymo One app. For my desired location I picked a Trader Joe's store several miles away towards the northern edge of the service area. The app estimated a car would be available in 10 minutes and kept me posted on its progress by the minute. It showed a small photo of the car a Chrysler minivan that was on its way.

The ride

I couldn't find the car at first. The map showed me where it was but since I wasn't familiar with the area that wasn't much help. The app gave me the option of tapping the ""honk"" button. As soon as I did I heard the honk loud and clear and began walking toward the sound which was a few hundred feet away from where I was standing. I approached the van and was again surprised. It was illegally parked in a fire lane which was apparent by the brightly painted red curb. It was also partially blocking a lane used by cars entering and exiting the shopping center. One car had to go around the Waymo to get into the parking lot. The van had its hazard lights on the Waymo logo on the side and a dashboard displaying my initials. I clicked the door handle jumped in and strapped on the seatbelt. A woman's voice welcomed me. The passenger seat in front of me had a screen that displayed a map and the car on the road. A partition read ""Please stay in the back. Don't touch the steering wheel."" That led me to wonder if Waymo had experienced an attempted hijacking before a potential risk I hadn't considered until that moment. Waymo said in an email after the story was first published that ""We've always had those stickers in our vehicles to caution riders from touching the steering controls for safety not as the result of any incident."" The cupholders held hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes. In the seat pocket in front of me was an N95 mask that was the same aqua color of the Waymo logo. I wanted to put on some music but the screen required me to download the Google Assistant app so I gave up. A Bluetooth feature or USB plug-in would've been more convenient.

The five-mile ride lasted 14 minutes over highways and some neighborhood streets. The cost was $10.77 or a little less than $1 a minute. For the most part the ride was smooth allowing me to comfortably avoid spilling my coffee. However there was one rough moment toward the end. Just as the car neared Trader Joe's it came to an abrupt stop slamming the brake for an apparent pedestrian. It nearly gave me whiplash and made me particularly grateful for the working seatbelt. The jolt was surprising as the car was going no more than seven miles an hour in a parking lot. McGoldrick the Waymo spokesperson wrote that ""it's definitely not the experience we strive for"" and added ""Our team is looking into this event and we will use it to improve."" After gasping — and letting out an audible ""Jesus!"" (see video below) — I settled back in until the car let me off in front of the Trader Joe's. The drop-off spot was in yet another fire lane next to a red-painted curb. ""We've arrived"" the recorded voice told me. ""Please check your surroundings before exiting the vehicle and remember to close the doors after you exit."" McGoldrick didn't provide a comment on why the car kept parking in clearly marked fire zones and said the team is looking into it.

A slightly different feel

Despite spending a week in the Phoenix area I saw very few Waymos. It was a stark contrast to my visit in 2019 and to current day San Francisco where I'll often see several test cars on the roads in a day. The company says it has 300 to 400 vehicles in the Phoenix area including Chrysler Pacifica vans and some Jaguar I-Pace electric SUVs. On the whole the experience was much more relaxing than my prior ride in 2019 with a safety driver. At that time the car felt overly cautious. It went slower than the speed of traffic and waited for what felt like an eternity before making an unprotected turn. This time it felt natural. Instead of inching into a turn at a glacial pace it swiftly moved up and accelerated at the right moment. The car didn't seem to attract stares from other drivers the way it did in two years ago likely because residents are used to seeing them on the road. Still entrusting a completely driverless car with my life required a mind shift. Watching the foot pedals move themselves up and down and the wheel turn itself to the left and right was unnerving at times even though I follow the company closely and have seen the technology work on several occasions. Clearing that hurdle with the broader public may be one of Waymo's biggest challenges. On Instagram I posted a 10-second video of the ride which allowed viewers to see the steering wheel and foot pedals move themselves. I got dozens of direct messages that mostly consisted of ""WTF"" and ""How was it?!"" I also spoke to several Phoenix residents to get their perspectives. Some were unaware the service was even available to them through an app. Others said they knew about Waymo One but were reluctant to try it. Most acknowledged that autonomous cars would eventually be the norm. Waymo is now 13 years old. It's taken this long to get self-driving cars operating fluidly on city streets in part of one U.S. market. While even getting that far is a mighty impressive technological feat ubiquity — if it ever comes — feels like it's still a long way off.

Techland shared the news on Dying Light's Twitter saying that the sequel to its 2015 first-person zombie action survival horror game is ""almost as long as it would take to walk from Warsaw to Madrid."" For those wondering that walk would take around 534 hours.

This news took the internet by storm and there were those who felt that 500 hours was a bit of a daunting mission to undertake. Techland quickly put those fears to rest by saying that the enormous amount of time to reach 100% was reached by doing literally everything and most players will be able to finish the main story and side quests in under 100 hours.

""500 hours is related to maxing out the game - finishing all the quests endings and exploring every part of the world but a regular player should finish the story + side quests and do quite a lot of exploring in less than 100 hours so don't worry"" Techland wrote.

In a follow-up tweet the developer confirmed that ""if you're not in a rush"" Dying Light 2's story and side quests should take roughly 70-80 hours to complete.

For comparison howlongtobeat.com has Dying Light's main story taking 17.5 hours to complete main story and extras at 35 hours and a completionist run taking 55 hours. It's clear the developers are holding nothing back for this new entry.

Kristiana Chan is a first generation Malaysian-Chinese artist writer and educator from the American South. Her work examines the material memory of the landscape and the excluded histories of the displaced Chinese diaspora.

She researches the political historical and environmental heritage of the landscape and its material elements incorporating their elemental properties into her processes. Working across disciplines she uses video installation archival photography and experimental alternative photographic processes.

Most recently Chan has been working with wild harvested clay and ceramics. She is deeply fascinated by how the not-so-distant histories of racial exclusion erasure and extractive environmental capitalism lay the foundation for every day lived contemporary experiences and contribute to our concurrent crises of violent racism and climate disaster.

By uncovering roots of our origins her work seeks to revive and reckon with lost histories and lives and their implications on race and environment so that by knowing where we come from we can envision a new future for ourselves.

Chan’s solo exhibitions were at the START Gallery (Winston-Salem) and The Growlery (San Francisco). Group exhibitions include SOMArts ProArts Root Division Kearny Street Workshop and CTRL+SHFT Collective. Chan’s work was featured in Lenscratch Magazine Seawitches Zine and Thank You For Nothing Zine. She has a BA from Wake Forest University.

Roy and Frances Rydell established the Roy and Frances Rydell Visual Arts Fund at the Community Foundation in 1985 to promote Santa Cruz County artists and arts organizations. Following their passing their estate was bequeathed to the foundation. Their gift has generated more than $1.4 million in fellowships for artists and support for Santa Cruz County visual arts organizations.

The Rydell Visual Arts Fellowship program was developed with input from the local arts community to honor the wishes and intent of the Rydells. The fellowship program now in its 16th year has awarded $680000 directly to artists.

(Complete list of current and past award recipients is available at www.cfscc.org/articles/the-rydell-visual-arts-fellowship-program)

Gifts allow artists uninterrupted creative time to focus solely on their work and its impact on the local community and the larger world.

The fellowships help individual visual artists pursue their creative work and are made solely on the merits of their artistry and not tied to the completion of any specific projects.

“Roy and Frances Rydell understood that artists not only bear witness to life but they play an integral role in helping humanity process our collective experience” said Susan True CEO of the Community Foundation. “As we move into the third year of the global COVID-19 pandemic and our community continues to heal from the CZU fires there is just so much life to witness and process. This new cohort of artists–their diversity in terms of age background and forms of expression–will help us think learn grow and witness as life in all its beauty and pain continues to unfold.”

For this round of fellowships 51 artists applied from a candidate pool nominated by 26 local and regional visual arts organizations and former Rydell Fellows. Nominees were limited to working artists 25 years or older who reside in Santa Cruz County and are not enrolled in a degree-granting program.

Nominating organizations were asked to consider the broad disciplines the Rydells thought of as part of the visual arts: painting drawing printmaking ceramics sculpture installation mixed media stage set design photography costume design textiles glass film and video.

In October a panel of three nationally recognized arts professionals met at the Foundation to judge the artists’ works and select the fellowship recipients. The panel members were Maori Holmes artistic director and CEO of BlackStar in Philadelphia; Garth Johnson Paul Phillips & Sharon Sullivan curator of ceramics Everson Museum in Syracuse; and Astria Suparak independent curator former director and curator of the contemporary art galleries at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and Syracuse University.

The $80000 in new Rydell Fellowships were complemented by another $200000 in unrestricted grants made to local arts organizations this spring.

“The fellowships and arts grants we make year in year out support those making our local arts landscape as vibrant and vital as it is. The creativity of our local arts community never ceases to inspire us. We are proud of the funding we’re able to channel to the arts and it’s thanks to people who love this place have a vision of a better tomorrow and act on it by giving.” said Kevin Heuer director of engagement & impact.

The 2020-2021 Rydell Fellows will be featured in the Rydell Visual Arts Fellowship Exhibition at Museum of Art & History in downtown Santa Cruz from Jan. 21 to March 20 2022. For information visit: https://www.santacruzmah.org/exhibitions/rydell-fellowship

Target was closing in on Cub's crown as the region's grocery king. Hy-Vee the Iowa giant that dominates much of the Midwest was opening several new stores a year in the market. Even European discounter Aldi had grabbed a solid share of Minnesotans' grocery dollars.

And what's more its new owner United Natural Foods Inc. a wholesale specialist that bought Cub's parent Supervalu in 2018 wanted to sell Cub and the other remnants of Supervalu's retail division. Cub employees knew executives like Stigers would be the first to go when a deal came through.

""The communication that we gave to the team every day is that if someone buys Cub they're going to buy the best grocery company there is and let's be the best grocery company there is"" Stigers said recently.

Today Cub remains atop the Twin Cities market and is churning more profits for UNFI than it did in its last years under Supervalu. UNFI's executives say it's no longer for sale. Cub executives are drawing up plans for new stores to add to the 79 it already has.

Cub Foods remains the dominant grocer in the Twin Cities and in the pandemic turned a sizable operating profit.

Like many large grocery chains Cub flourished in the pandemic when people who were forced to stay home from work and school changed their eating patterns. ""Consumer trends consumer needs the pandemic all of those things together have put the wind at the back of Cub"" said Phil Lempert editor of supermarketguru.com.

But even in 2019 while UNFI was seeking buyers Cub continued to open and remodel stores though not as many as the year before. In May that year Stigers told the Star Tribune ""There's no slowing down the growth of this brand as we look for the correct suitor in the future.""

Stigers 63 began his career as a part-time courtesy clerk at Safeway in 1974 and worked his way up the management ranks at grocers and in other industries. He joined Supervalu in 2011 as president of Shaw's and Star Market grocery stores in New England. Supervalu sold those stores in 2013 and Stigers moved to the Twin Cities to take a leadership role in Supervalu's wholesale business its largest.

In early 2020 even before the pandemic hit there were signs that competitors were finding it difficult to overtake Cub's market dominance. Shortly before the COVID-19 lockdowns began Hy-Vee scuttled plans for a distribution center in Minnesota and froze construction of several stores.

Then as shoppers emptied shelves of toilet paper and hand sanitizer Cub added 130 new safety protocols in 100 days Stigers said. To keep up with shoppers filling its stores that spring Cub went on a spree of hiring 1000 people.

Its connection to UNFI and the former Supervalu wholesale operation gave Cub an advantage as some items turned scarce.

""The ability to keep your shelves stocked is key to getting repeat buyers"" said Michael Swenson chief agricultural economist at Wells Fargo. ""We see Cub the majors they have an advantage. When a supplier has issues about trucks and they have to make allocation decisions you always allocate to your premier accounts first.""

Just as Cub was adjusting to the pandemic the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day that spring led to riots that resulted in the looting and destruction of two Cub stores in Minneapolis — one on Lake Street and the other on Broadway.

Stigers had seen grocery stores destroyed in civil unrest and natural disasters before. He was a district manager for Jons Fresh Marketplace in Los Angeles during riots that ensued when police were acquitted of beating Rodney King in 1992. And in 2011 he led Shaw's as Hurricane Irene wrecked the northeastern U.S. and a tent market was quickly set up while a flood-ravaged store was rebuilt in Vermont.

""A grocery store is more than a grocery store"" Stigers said. ""It's really the heartbeat of a community.""

Cub Foods set up a temporary structure in the parking lot of its Lake Street location which was heavily damaged in the riots after the police killing of George Floyd. It rebuilt and reopened the store about eight months later.

In the immediate aftermath of the Minneapolis unrest Cub shuttled customers of the stores to other locations until temporary stores were set up in giant tents. The Lake Street Cub opened last February and the store on Broadway re-branded as Cub Northside opened in May.

""There was never a question in my mind that we wouldn't reopen those stores"" Stigers said. ""Not even for a second.""

Lisa Clemons founder of the nonprofit A Mother's Love was one of the community members who advocated for the Cub Northside name as well as a space in the store for a community center.

""To our hearts' delight they decided to do that. We wanted a place where kids could be tutored and where seniors could gather. Cub did that and went beyond"" said Clemons also a retired Minneapolis police sergeant. ""I was so surprised. I've never ever heard of a business wanting to rebuild and want to build out a space for community.""

With the country in recession and no deals imminent for Cub UNFI's then-Chief Executive Steve Spinner said in June 2020 that it would temporarily stop trying to sell the grocery business. UNFI needed to wait for demand for ""really healthy retailers"" to return he said.

""And now it's not the right time to disturb the communities and everything that's going on with the retailing of food"" Spinner added.

In the summer of 2021 UNFI reported that Cub and the Shoppers Food Warehouse a smaller chain it owns in the mid-Atlantic states had delivered about $100 million in adjusted pre-tax earnings over four quarters. Spinner told analysts that UNFI's entire leadership team was ""so incredibly proud of what our retail division has done.""

""They've been there they've been open they've been supporting the communities in so many different ways and yes our financial results have been just incredible throughout the pandemic and they continue to be incredible"" Spinner said. ""I think as you know we took them off the market and during COVID we just didn't feel like it was an appropriate time to try to sell a retail business. And they are not back on the market today.""

A short time later Spinner retired and Sandy Douglas former CEO of Staples Inc. became UNFI's new chief executive.

Cub's e-commerce business continued to grow adding its wine and spirits businesses around 30% last year building from the huge leap it took during the pandemic. And in November Cub said it would start its own online pickup and delivery service no longer relying solely on third parties like Instacart to get its goods delivered.

In the two years ended last October sales at the UNFI grocery business dominated by Cub were up 15%. Last month UNFI Chief Financial Officer John Howard told analysts that Cub has ""an outstanding leadership team that is in place there spearheaded by Mike Stigers."" He said UNFI would continue to invest and expand its retail units.

And to the same analyst group Douglas revived an old argument for pairing wholesale and retail businesses.

""It's a great place for us to learn"" Douglas said. ""Our retail leadership team gives us really direct feedback about what they need and what programs services brands and other things we can do to serve them better. And that visibility is very helpful to us.""

Grocery shopping volumes may decline as people eat at home less when the pandemic is finally brought to heel. But Cub executives are confidently scouting sites for a dozen new stores in the region.

""I think the best years of Cub are ahead of us"" Stigers said.",,,,,,,,,

G.M. and Ford closed one factory after another — sometimes for months on end — because of a shortage of computer chips leaving dealer lots bare and sending car prices zooming. Yet Tesla racked up record sales quarter after quarter and ended the year having sold nearly twice as many vehicles as it did in 2020 unhindered by an industrywide crisis.

Tesla’s ability to conjure up critical components has a greater significance than one year’s car sales. It suggests that the company and possibly other young electric car businesses could threaten the dominance of giants like Volkswagen and G.M. sooner and more forcefully than most industry executives and policymakers realize. That would help the effort to reduce the emissions that are causing climate change by displacing more gasoline-powered cars sooner. But it could hurt the millions of workers thousands of suppliers and numerous local and national governments that rely on traditional auto production for jobs business and tax revenue.

Tesla and its enigmatic chief executive Elon Musk have said little about how the carmaker ran circles around the rest of the auto industry. Now it’s becoming clear that the company simply had a superior command of technology and its own supply chain. Tesla appeared to better forecast demand than businesses that produce many more cars than it does. Other automakers were surprised by how quickly the car market recovered from a steep drop early in the pandemic and had simply not ordered enough chips and parts fast enough.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEvOS8yMjg3NTM4Mi90ZXNsYS1mdWxsLXNlbGYtZHJpdmluZy1iZXRhLWFzc2VydGl2ZS1wcm9maWxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla's 'Full Self-Driving' beta has an 'assertive' driving mode that 'may perform rolling stops',"Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta lets you choose from three driving “profiles” that dictate how the car will react to certain situations on the road. Each mode “Chill” “Average” and “Assertive” varies in terms of aggressiveness (and potentially safety).

A separate image posted to Twitter gives us a more detailed glimpse at what this actually means. In the description beneath the “Assertive” option Tesla notes the vehicle will “have a smaller follow distance” and “perform more frequent speed lane changes.” The vehicle will also “not exit passing lanes” and “may perform rolling stops” and it’s not entirely clear whether this means cars won’t come to a full stop at stop signs.

A YouTube video shows all three modes in action and towards the end it shows how Tesla describes each FSD profile. In “Chill” mode the vehicle will “have a larger follow distance and perform fewer speed lane changes” while “Average” mode means the car “will have a medium follow distance and may perform rolling stops.” That said it’s a bit hard to distinguish the difference between these modes from this video alone as it doesn’t test out the vehicle’s behavior in heavy traffic or harsh weather conditions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMDgvdGVzbGEtb3duZXItbWluZXMtYml0Y29pbi1ldGhlcmV1bS13aXRoLWhpcy1jYXIuaHRtbNIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzAxLzA4L3Rlc2xhLW93bmVyLW1pbmVzLWJpdGNvaW4tZXRoZXJldW0td2l0aC1oaXMtY2FyLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Tesla owner says he mines up to $800 a month in cryptocurrency with his car,"In this article TSLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

Tesla owner Siraj Raval uses his Model 3 to mine for cryptocurrencies. Siraj Raval

Siraj Raval has tried just about every way there is to mine for cryptocurrencies from his 2018 Tesla Model 3. He's run free bitcoin mining software on his Apple Mac mini M1 and powered the computer by plugging an inverter into the 12-volt power socket located in the center console of his car. He's also hooked up interconnected graphics processing units or GPUs to the ""frunk"" of his Tesla running these machines off the car's internal battery. Though it risks voiding his car warranty Raval says it's worth it. When the price of ether peaked in 2021 he claims he was netting as much as $800 a month. Bitcoin miner Alejandro de la Torre said that ultimately mining from a Tesla is just like connecting to any other power source. ""The main component is the price of the electricity. If it's cheaper doing it through an electric vehicle then so be it"" said de la Torre.

How to mine for crypto with a Tesla

Back in 2018 Chris Allessi — who tells CNBC he was Wisconsin's first-ever electric car dealer — decided to tinker with his Tesla. This is nothing new for Allessi also known as K-Man on his YouTube channel who builds custom electric cars in his free time and bills himself as a modern-day Doc Brown the character from the film ""Back to the Future"" who retrofits a car into a time machine. ""I like electricity. I like zapping stuff building stuff. You give me an electric motor I give you a finished product"" he said. Similar to Raval Allessi has tried out a couple of different ways to transform his Tesla Model S into a crypto mining rig.

In industry speak crypto mining is the energy-intensive process in which machines around the world contribute their computing power to the overall network in order to create new coins and validate transactions of existing tokens. They do that by running specialized software that crunches complicated math equations. To participate essentially all you need is a computer and power. Allessi has tried mining for bitcoin by plugging a Bitmain Antminer S9 — a type of mining rig specifically used to mint the world's most popular cryptocurrency — directly into his car battery with the help of a power inverter. The inverter adjusts the voltage of Tesla's electric battery to a level that's compatible with his Antminer. Allessi has also successfully used the vehicle's internal firmware to mine for altcoins. ""It was no big deal"" he said of the process. He used the built-in computer and screen in the car to navigate to a web page that he had set up specifically to mine for the popular privacy token monero. ""I could run the mining program within the browser"" Allessi explained. Of all the techniques that Raval has tried he said the most profitable involves a mix of hacking into Tesla's internal computer plus plugging GPUs directly into the car's electric motor. ""It's a computer with wheels...It's so simple to hack into this computer car"" Raval said who describes the process as essentially hijacking the car's internal firmware to allow for extra power usage. Tesla hacker and crypto miner Thomas Sohmers argued this step isn't necessary. ""The car is already built to deliver over 100 kilowatts and anything connecting to the car is going to be a fraction of that. There's no need to do what [Raval] says he's doing. It doesn't make technical sense"" said Sohmers. From there Raval tethers five GPUs to his Tesla battery and he runs a hashing algorithm to mine for ethereum. Professional-grade miners tell CNBC that in theory the logistics check out. ""The mechanisms are all there"" explained Whit Gibbs CEO and founder of Compass a bitcoin mining service provider. ""You have a power source you have space you have the ability to add cooling. There's certainly enough power provided by the battery to fire up an ASIC and run it"" continued Gibbs.

Profitable but worth the hassle?

Whether Tesla crypto mining proves profitable has a lot to do with when the driver bought their vehicle. Allessi for example purchased his car before Jan. 2017 meaning that he was grandfathered into a scheme where he has free and unlimited supercharging for the life of his vehicle. In 2018 he estimates that over a 60-hour window he would make $10 worth of bitcoin all of which was at a profit because he didn't have to pay for power. But even though it was profitable it was hardly worth it he says. ""Why would you want to put that kind of wear and tear on a $40000 to $100000 car?"" he said. ""And right now even though the price for bitcoin has gone up dramatically so has the difficulty level...In the same amount of time with the exact same equipment I'm probably looking at $1 or $2 worth of bitcoin.""

Mining for monero proved similarly fruitless. ""Did it work? Yes. Did it mine anything worthwhile to be able to be profitable in any way shape or form? No"" explained Allessi. Raval is more optimistic about the earning potential for his Tesla. Even though he has to pay to charge his vehicle Raval says the battery itself is ""bar none"" so he is able to get a lot of bang for his buck. Raval's car gets 320 miles per charge and it takes about $10 to $15 to charge it. If he drives it for a few hours on a daily basis it needs a charge once every one-and-a-half weeks putting his monthly bill at anywhere from $30 to $60. Raval estimates that he mines roughly 20 hours a day off his Tesla battery. Though the price of altcoins like ethereum are prone to volatility Raval has baked in other backstops to ensure profitability. For one he stakes his ethereum on ""Midas.Investments"" a custodial crypto investment platform that offers him an annual percentage yield of 23% on his investment. He also never cashes out to U.S. dollars so that his crypto nest egg keeps growing. Raval buys his GPUs used off eBay as well which helps to save money. Taking all of these steps into account Raval says that over the course of 2021 he earned anywhere from around $400 to $800 a month making the venture profitable even during crypto's doldrums. Sohmers who says he was the first to crack into the Model 3 in 2018 tells CNBC that profits that high just aren't possible.



""The best estimate I would have for the hashrate for the GPU in the Model 3 would be around 7-10 MH/s. Currently at 10 MH/s that would generate revenue of about $13.38 worth of ether before any expenses"" Sohmers told CNBC. Allessi tells CNBC that he doesn't bother with mining anymore. ""The difficulty is so high...I could make more money working at McDonald's"" he said. Allessi did offer one alternative. ""If you're working for a company you'd be better off hiding a miner up in the drop ceiling than you would be mining with a car"" he said of siphoning free electricity from an employer. But for Raval mining cryptocurrencies off his Tesla isn't just a gimmick. Instead it is a big part of his plan to make his Tesla a fully autonomous robotaxi that earns crypto anytime it's not driving. Although Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has touted the potential for vehicles to become autonomous robotaxis Teslas today are still far from being able to drive themselves. Nonetheless Raval believes in this future. ""It will use its earnings from both transportation services and cryptocurrency mining services to pay for its own expenses like repairs electricity costs and upgrades as well as invest them into a diversified portfolio of emerging crypto-community networks"" he said. CORRECTION: The article has been updated to reflect the fact that Siraj Raval has only tried mining for ethereum and bitcoin. Some of the technical details about the way Raval hacked his car have also been corrected. The story has been amended as well to include additional voices that call into question Raval's mining method.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8wOS9ob3ctbG9uZy1jYW4tYS10ZXNsYS1rZWVwLXlvdS13YXJtLWluLWEtZnJvemVuLXRyYWZmaWMtamFtLWRpcnR5LXRlc2xhLWZpbmRzLW91dC_SAXpodHRwczovL2NsZWFudGVjaG5pY2EuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMDkvaG93LWxvbmctY2FuLWEtdGVzbGEta2VlcC15b3Utd2FybS1pbi1hLWZyb3plbi10cmFmZmljLWphbS1kaXJ0eS10ZXNsYS1maW5kcy1vdXQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Long Can A Tesla Keep You Warm In A Frozen Traffic Jam? “Dirty Tesla” Finds Out [UPDATE],"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

In an opinion piece in the Washington Post (which Steve Hanley already skewered) the author wrote about the recent icy traffic disaster on I-95 in Virginia but imagined a scenario where the only vehicles were EVs. The issue the writer claimed was that if everyone had been driving EVs the mess could have been worse.

He brought up the fact that batteries lose capacity more rapidly in cold weather but noted that automakers can and do mitigate cold weather range anxiety. The author pointed out that Tesla’s heat pump helps extend the winter range but neglected to balance the opinion piece with information about how fossil-fueled vehicles have similar problems.

You KNOW that if there had been even a single disabled #Tesla in the Virginia or Tahoe traffic jams this week we would have heard about it. Over and over.

The fact that we haven't says a lot. — MelonThreads (@1LoafOfMeat) January 6 2022

According to FuelEconomoy.gov a normal gas car mileage is around 15% lower at 20°F during city driving than it would be at 77°F. It can also drop by as much as 24% for short three- to four-mile trips. It’s even harder on hybrids and EVs. Yes EVs drop 39% in mixed city and highway driving but in most cases with EVs you don’t need to burn much fuel at all while idled — unless you own a hybrid but even then you might not. So if we are going to be fair and balanced we need to point out that yes EVs in general do have a higher drop when driving but this is offset with the fact that EVs use minimal energy when not driving. That said they do use energy to heat the cabin and much concern is about how much they use. Let’s turn to someone in a position to examine this better.

Simulating The Scenario

YouTuber “Dirty Tesla” wanted to answer the question “how long can a Tesla keep you warm in a frozen traffic jam?” The video is separated into six parts: the Virginia traffic jam disaster setting up the experiment a two-hour check-in going over the Washington Post article a 12-hour check-in and extending the test to 18 hours and then the final results at both 12 hours and 18 hours.

Dirty Tesla rightly noted that the accident opened up a dialogue about how EVs would fare in a similar situation. It should be noted that there were a few Tesla owners caught in the traffic jam and in one of the comments to his video a user noted that a pregnant woman from the Facebook Tesla Divas group shared that she was stuck in her Tesla for 16 hours during the traffic jam. Her battery was at 74% and only dropped to 61% by the time she got home. She simply turned on Camp Mode and slept.

Other commenters shared how their Teslas fared during the Texas winter storm last year and a Nissan LEAF owner shared that they were stuck in traffic for 6 hours once and used the seat heater and their electric blanket. They only used 15% percent of the battery and their LEAF was a 2012 model. You can view more of the comments to his video here.

The Experiment

Dirty Tesla noted that his experiment included two Tesla vehicles. One is a 2021 Model Y with the new heat pump and the other one is a 2020 Model X with the old resistive heater. The resistive heater in the Model X uses more energy to keep the temperature comfortable than a heat pump does. However the Model X has a larger battery. The Model X had 90% charge and the Model Y had 91% charge. Neither car had been pre-warmed or heated and the battery packs were cold. Also he wasn’t in the vehicle and this makes a difference because the human body naturally generates heat. It may not feel like it during cold weather but it does make an impact on experiments such as this one.

He wanted to see how bad this could get. He pointed out that the temperatures in Virginia during the traffic jam were in the low 20s; however in Michigan when he started the experiment it was 15 degrees and had dropped to 12 degrees around the 2-hour check-in. He also set the temperature in both vehicles to 70 degrees.

12 Hour & 18 Hour Check-in

To answer the Washington Post’s question the Teslas did pretty well during 18 hours of freezing temperatures. He noted that he used solar at home to charge his cars but included the cost of electricity for those who may not have solar at home.

12 Hour Check-in

The Model Y battery level went from 91% down to 58%. It used 26.5 kWh at 0.16 per kWh which would cost $4.22.

The Model X battery dropped from 90% to 47% and used 43 kWh at 0.16 per kWh which would cost $6.88.

18 Hour Check-in

During this portion he had lowered the inside temperatures of the cars to 60 degrees.

The Model Y battery went from 58% down to 48% with 8 kWh used at 0.16 per kWh costing $1.28.

Conclusion

Although he didn’t include the results for the Model X at 18 hours it should be noted that it cost under $10 to stay warm in freezing conditions. However as he emphasized with planning for emergencies such as the Virginia icy traffic jam disaster one could survive up to 36 hours in their car. He also noted that both ICEVs and EVs have their advantages and disadvantages during emergencies but I want to emphasize that the average American who owns a gas car and thinks EVs are ill equipped to handle emergencies probably spent more than $10 to keep warm during this event — much more.

Typical misinformation or FUD (fear uncertainty and doubt) often permeates the collective during disasters such as the one in Virginia. And the Washington Post — which is a news organization with access to research information and data — chose not to use that and spread the idea that it would have been worse off with EVs than without. Now if the EVs weren’t Teslas how would they have fared? I’d like to see similar experiments with the Ford Mustang Mach-E Nissan LEAF and other EVs. However I don’t own any of those (or a car at all for that matter) and I live in south Louisiana where at the moment it’s in the 70s outside.

Sadly we live in a world where FUD is profitable and the truth isn’t as appealing. Thankfully there are good people debunking the FUD and proving the misinformation for what it is.

Rolling out to vehicles in North America this week via an over-the-air update the Model S Plaid Track Mode originated in Tesla's quest to achieve the Nürburgring lap record for production EVs according to the company. A Model S Plaid achieved that goal in 2021 with a 7:35.579 time.

The Plaid already boasts 1020 hp and a claimed 0-60 mph time of less than 2.0 seconds but Tesla upgraded powertrain cooling to give it the endurance necessary for proper track sessions. When track mode is engaged the car drops the temperature of its battery pack and motors creating a chilled thermal mass that helps keep everything cool longer after aggressive driving commences.

Tesla Model S Plaid specs

Track Mode also adds torque vectoring. In this case the torque split of the tri-motor powertrain's two rear motors is adjusted sending more power to one motor to help rotate the car through corners. Tesla says its motors allow for quicker adjustments than the differentials used by internal-combustion cars.

The adaptive suspension gets track-specific tuning that reduces pitch during hard braking and acceleration and rebalanced damping to keep the car more settled Tesla said. Track Mode also sets the ride height to Low and unlike in other drive modes the suspension won't automatically raise while driving to improve comfort Tesla noted.

Regenerative braking power was also increased to reduce heat generated by the friction brakes. This effectively allows for one-pedal driving which Tesla believes will be better for track use.

Tesla Model S Plaid Track Mode

Tesla also said Track Mode gives drivers more control over electronic nannies. It includes a Race tune for the vehicle dynamics controller that allows more tire slippage and will automatically adjust the torque split to improve cornering ability Tesla said. Drivers can also individually adjust the stability control and regenerative braking to their liking. Everything is controlled from a track-specific instrument cluster menu which also includes a lap timer g-meter and dash cam and telemetry recording capability.

Track Mode should be a nice complement to the Plaid's brutal acceleration. Jay Leno set a 9.247-second quarter mile time in one last year for his ""Jay Leno's Garage"" show. Tesla previously announced an even quicker Model S Plaid+ with over 1100 hp but then cancelled it since the regular Plaid was already outmuscling the competition."

Companies including Ford Texas Instruments and blood sensor maker Blumio are already on board.

CES organizer the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) is hosting Ripple for the time being with the goal to ""enable hardware / software interoperability and accelerate the growth of applications for general purpose consumer radar"".

As noted by 9to5Google the initiative comes out of the Advanced Technology & Projects (ATAP) group at Google previously responsible for Project Soli – miniature radar tech built into the Pixel 4 Pixel 4 XL and the 2nd-gen Nest Hub.

The Ripple effect

Those Google gadgets demonstrated some of the uses of radar components: detecting hand gestures above a phone for example and monitoring your movements during sleep without any need for a wearable. However even within Google's family of hardware devices the tech hasn't been widely adopted.

Ripple should make it easier for other manufacturers and software developers to get involved and semiconductor makers Infineon and NXP have also signed up to the project. How long it'll be before we see new devices as a result of Ripple remains to be seen.

""Ripple will unlock helpful innovation that benefits everyone"" said Ivan Poupyrev the Director of Engineering and Technical Projects Lead at Google ATAP. ""General purpose radar is a key emerging technology for solving critical use cases in a privacy-respecting way.""

Analysis: radar is more useful than you might think

If you've used a Pixel 4 or Pixel 4 XL then you'll know that the motion-sensing radar module they include can actually be very useful – not just for recognizing gestures but also for detecting when the device is being moved and when it's about to be picked up (alarms can get quieter as you reach your hand over to switch them off for instance).

Google didn't include the same capabilities in the Pixel 5 or Pixel 6 phones despite making noises that it was still invested in the technology for the long term. Radar-powered sensing did make it into the most recent Nest Hub though enabling it to monitor your sleep from the side of the bed.

The Ripple team suggests potential applications including non-invasive wellness monitoring occupancy detection in buildings human activity recognition (for everything from tracking exercise to detecting falls) and touchless gesture controls. As The Verge notes it could also enable driver assist technologies inside cars.

Most of these features can be offered with cameras and other kinds of sensors but miniaturized radar offers benefits in terms of speed and accuracy that other approaches can't match. At the moment radar components are developed on a one-off bespoke basis something which Ripple is aiming to change.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's What You Need To Remember: These improved Ship-to-Ship Connectors are beasts—when fully loaded they can carry seventy-four tons of men and supplies at a rapid thirty-five knot an hour clip

Imagine this scenario in the not-so-distant future: The United States is at war in the Pacific. U.S. Marines deployed on the USS Wasp are in the amphibious assault carrier’s well deck. About 145 of the Marines slowly board a ship-to-shore connector essentially a large amphibious landing vehicle that rides over the surface of the ocean on a cushion of air. They’re being deployed to an active war zone to relieve other Marines already on a beachhead on some far-flung island in the South China Sea. They are the second wave.

Though of course functional this scenario could play out in real life. Tensions in the South China Sea are at all-time highs—and to ensure they are prepared the Navy bought the Marine Corps some new equipment: a new Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC).

Fresh Off the Presses

A few days ago the Navy announced an award to Textron Systems for new SSCs. These improved SSCs are beasts—when fully loaded they can carry seventy-four tons of men and supplies at a rapid thirty-five knot an hour clip. Part of the new SSCs strength is their redesigned skirts which reduces both weight and drag over the surface of the water according to Textron.

These new SSCs “offer increased reliability and maintainability as well as meet requirements of increased payload and availability” and are expected to remain in service with the Navy and Marine Corps for the next thirty years according to Textron.

The Navy was equally positive about the future acquisition saying ""The LCAC replaces the existing fleet of legacy LCAC vehicles and will primarily transport weapon systems equipment cargo and personnel of the assault elements through varied environmental conditions from amphibious ships to and over the beach.”

Eyes on China

The new SSCs are just a part of the Marine Corps’ rapid modernization efforts in the past several years. In addition to adopting the Heckler & Koch HK416 rifle in service with the Marines as the M27 the Marines are also in the middle of nearly unprecedented restructuring.

The Corps recently announced the retirement of all tank battalions marking a huge shift for the branch. In addition the Corps decided to gradually phase out artillery and other non-amphibious platforms in favor of gearing towards a war in the Pacific that will likely be defined by many small groups of highly mobile sea-based Marines armed with an array of anti-ship missiles. In this anticipated fight decentralized command will play a crucial role—as will shipping of both supplies and men.

For supplies quick-and-dirty solutions like those pioneered by narcos delivering narcotics to far afield may play a part in the future. But in the ship-to-shore niche SSCs will be of utmost importance.

Dust Up

Speculation has run wild in recent days about thaw a high-tech flight in the Pacific would look like—and what the implications are for the United States Marine Corps. One thing is sure though. A dust-up in the South China Sea would likely see Textron’s SSCs.

Here's What You Need To Remember: While small groups of highly mobile Marines could be very effective on ocean battlefields in the future one of the inherent challenges to a fight in the Pacific is distance. How can the Marine Corps keep Marine Littoral Regiments supplied with anti-ship missiles food and water in highly contested far-off maritime environments?

Bell Textron the manufacturer of the iconic V-22 Osprey transport tiltrotor is pitching a new tiltrotor platform to the United States military and this one would be unmanned.

Tiltrotor Heavyweight

The success of the V-22 platform in service with the Marine Corps Air Force Navy and the Japan Self-Defense Forces is something that Bell would no doubt like to replicate. In addition to the Osprey Bell also has another horse in the tiltrotor race their V-280 Valor. The V-280 is currently in the running to win the Future Vertical Lift program an initiative that aims to replace a number of the Army’s aging helicopters with one platform.

Bell can draw on the lessons learned from both of their earlier tiltrotor platforms to design their V-247. Like the V-22 and V-280 Bell’s unmanned drone would have two rotatable rotors allowing the drone to take off vertically and fly horizontally. One of the potentially game-changing aspects of the V-247? Its range.

One advantage the V-22 has over the older helicopter and turboprop transports it replaced is its very respectable range which Bell lists as 860 nautical miles just shy of 1000 miles. This extended range is a boon to the Navy in particular as increased resupply ranges allow U.S. Navy ships to have a better force dispersal posture and stay farther out at sea. And while respectable the V-22’s range pales in comparison to the V-247.

The V-247’s range? Bell lists its range as 2500 nautical miles—or nearly 2900 miles and almost triple the V-22’s range.

All Eyes on the Pacific

Bell may have designed the V-247 with an eye on the United States Marine Corps. From Guam the V-247 would have sufficient range to reach virtually all of north and western China as well as the entirety of the South China Sea as far east as Thailand and most of the northern half of Australia.

Such extended ranges could come in handy when used in tandem with the Marine Corps’ new Pacific plan the Marine Littoral Regiment. This new force design made up of a combat team an anti-air element and a logistics group would see smaller groups of far-flung Marines dotting the Pacific Ocean. Armed to the teeth with new potent anti-ship capabilities Marines could in theory do something they haven’t done for a long time: sink ships.

While small groups of highly mobile Marines could be very effective on ocean battlefields in the future one of the inherent challenges to a fight in the Pacific is distance. How can the Marine Corps keep Marine Littoral Regiments supplied with anti-ship missiles food and water in highly contested far-off maritime environments?

Learning from Narcos?

One of the solutions that has been floated before takes a page from narcotrafficers and would see large numbers of relatively compact unmanned semisubmersibles take to the seas loaded to the gills with food and ammunition. Built on the cheap and expendable autonomous boats could be one solution—and the other could be UAVs like Bell’s V-247.

Besides phosphorylating MLKL treatment of cells by agents that activate the protein kinase RIPK3 triggers a time-dependent MLKL ubiquitination [25]. We found that such ubiquitination could be induced in human epithelial HT-29 cells by combined treatment with the cytokine TNF the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) antagonist BV6 and the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (TBZ). The ubiquitination correlated to the induction of MLKL phosphorylation and could be blocked by the RIPK3 inhibitor GSK-872. Kinetic analysis revealed that a high extent of ubiquitination was reached in the HT-29 cells several hours before any sign of cell death could be observed (Fig. 1A B and Supplementary Fig. 2). Such ubiquitination could also be induced by TBZ in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; Fig. 1C). In HT-29 cells in which caspase activation by TNF was compromised by knockout (KO) of the adapter protein FADD ubiquitination could be induced by treatment with just TNF and BV6 (Fig. 1D) whereas in cells of the L929 line that are derived from mouse fibroblasts MLKL ubiquitination similarly to its phosphorylation and necroptotic death [26] could be induced by treatment with TNF alone (Fig. 1E).

Fig. 1: Activation of MLKL triggers its K63-linked ubiquitination. A B Time-dependent MLKL ubiquitination and phosphorylation in human HT-29 cells in response to treatment with TBZ (TNF 1000 U/ml the bivalent IAP antagonist BV6 1 μM and the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk 20 μM. These are the concentrations at which these three reagents were applied in all other experiments). A Western blot analysis (WB) of 15 μg of the proteins of the total cellular lysates (bottom) and of the proteins pulled down (PD) from these amounts of lysates using TUBE1-agarose (top). Unless otherwise specified arrows pointing to western blots that were probed with anti-MLKL antibodies indicate non-ubiquitinated MLKL. B Comparison of the extents of ubiquitination and of cell death at different time points. Cell death was assessed twice in duplicates (n = 4) 6with practically identical results.

F G MLKL ubiquitination in response to TBZ depends on its phosphorylation and oligomerization. The extents of MLKL ubiquitination (top) aggregation (middle) and phosphorylation (bottom) were determined in MLKL-knockout (KO) HT-29 cells constitutively expressing wild-type MLKL and F a non-phosphorylatable MLKL mutant (T357A/S358A) or G the coiled-coil domain mutant (L162G/L165G).

K Accumulation of ubiquitinated MLKL in response to TBZ is not enhanced by treatment for 3 h with MG132 (10 μM) or bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1 0.1 μM). Full size image

While assessing the impact of various mutations in human MLKL on its ubiquitination we found that the ubiquitination was prevented by a mutation that ablates the phosphorylation of MLKL (T357A/S358A [4] Fig. 1F) while not affecting its recruitment to RIPK3 (Supplementary Fig. 3). It was also prevented by a mutation that affects neither the recruitment of MLKL to RIPK3 nor the phosphorylation of MLKL but compromises its oligomerization (L162G/L165G [8] Fig. 1G and Supplementary Fig. 3). These findings suggested that like the necroptotic effect of MLKL its ubiquitination depends on its induced oligomerization.

The MLKL-conjugated ubiquitin chains could be degraded by the K63-specific deubiquitinases CYLD and AMSH as well as by the broad-specificity deubiquitinase USP2 but not by the K48-specific deubiquitinase Otubain1 (Fig. 1H I). Comparison between the effectiveness of incorporation of the wild-type (WT) and incorporation of the K63R mutant ubiquitin to the MLKL-conjugated ubiquitin chains suggested that the ubiquitin moieties in these chains are indeed interlinked via their K63 residues (Fig. 1J).

While K48-linked ubiquitination of proteins serves mostly to dictate their proteolytic degradation in the proteasome K63-linked ubiquitination often serves other roles [27]. Consistently we found that the application of a proteasomal inhibitor to TBZ-treated cells did not result in increased amounts of ubiquitinated MLKL. Nor was such an increase observed in cells treated with Bafilomycin A1 which arrests lysosomal degradation (Fig. 1K).

In mass spectroscopy analysis of MLKL that was affinity-purified from HT-29 cells that were treated for 3 h with TBZ we discerned in two independent experiments ubiquitination of K50 K66 and K331 in MLKL (Supplementary Fig. 4). Subsequent quantitative analysis revealed that the ubiquitination was highest in K50 and that upon TBZ treatment it increased dramatically. In contrast the limited ubiquitination of K331 decreased upon TBZ treatment. The extent of ubiquitination of K66 was very low compared to that of either K50 or K331 (Fig. 2A).

Fig. 2: MLKL is ubiquitinated at specific lysine residues. A Results of quantitative mass spectroscopic analysis of MLKL ubiquitination in HT-29 cells and of its increase by treatment for 3 h with TBZ. The K50-containing peptide is VLGLIKPLEMLQDQGKR the K66-containing peptide is FKAALEEANGEIEK and the K331-containing peptide is LHHSEAPELHGKIR. Both in untreated and in TBZ-treated cells the amounts of K50-containing peptide in which the methionine residue was oxidized were less than 1% of the total amounts of this peptide. B Assessment of MLKL ubiquitination in TBZ-treated HT-29 cells in which endogenous MLKL had been knocked out and either the wild-type or the K50R-mutated human MLKL was inducibly re-expressed under control of the GEV16/pF5x UAS system. C TBZ-treated MLKL KO HT-29 cells that inducibly express wild-type MLKL but not cells expressing the K50R MLKL mutant contain ubiquitinated MLKL molecules that bind K63-TUBE (a reagent that specifically recognizes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains). D K63-linked polyubiquitination of wild-type MLKL but not of its K50R mutant can be discerned by an antibody that specifically recognizes the K63 link. Western blot analysis was done using MLKL preparations that were affinity-purified from lysates of TBZ-treated HT-29 cells as described in Materials and methods. E Assessment of MLKL ubiquitination in TBZ-treated MLKL KO MEFs expressing the indicated mutants of mouse MLKL as in B. F Assessment of MLKL ubiquitination in TNF-treated MLKL KO L929 cells expressing either wild-type or K5051R-mutated mouse MLKL as in B. The arrowhead points to phosphorylated mouse MLKL. G Site of MLKL ubiquitination within the HeLo domain structure. Shown are ribbon diagrams of the HeLo domains in human MLKL (amino acids 4–120) and mouse MLKL (amino acids 2−115) drawn using PyMOL software based on the solution structure of the human MLKL N-terminal region as determined using nuclear magnetic resonance [65] (PDB 2MSV) and the crystal structure of full-length mouse MLKL as determined by X-ray diffraction [66] (PDB 4BTF). The helices forming the four-helix bundle are denoted and colored as are the lysine residues that we found to be ubiquitinated (blue) and arginine 51 in human MLKL (green). Full size image

To further verify that K50 is a major site of ubiquitination in MLKL we knocked out MLKL in HT-29 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing then inducibly expressed in them either WT MLKL or an MLKL mutant in which lysine 50 was replaced with arginine (K50R) and then assessed the ubiquitination of both proteins upon TBZ treatment. As shown in Fig. 2B the K50R mutation greatly reduced the ubiquitination of MLKL. The polyubiquitin chains linked to K50 in MLKL could be shown both by application of agarose K63-TUBE or of an antibody specific to the K63 link between ubiquitin chains to be K63-conjugated (Fig. 2C D).

The site in mouse MLKL that is homologous to the site of ubiquitination in human MLKL possesses two adjacent lysine residues at positions 50 and 51. Mutation of the lysine residue at position 50 in MEFs did not affect the extent of its TBZ-induced ubiquitination nor was the ubiquitination affected by mutation of the neighboring lysine residue at position 51. However both in MEFs and in the mouse L929 cells ubiquitination was dramatically reduced when lysines 50 and 51 were each replaced by arginine (Fig. 2E F).

According to a recently published study mouse MLKL is also ubiquitinated at lysine 219 and it was suggested that this ubiquitination as well as ubiquitination of the corresponding lysine residue in human MLKL (at position 230) serve to facilitate death induction [28]. However in our repeated mass spectroscopy analysis we could not discern ubiquitination of lysine 230 in HT-29 cells that had been treated for 3 h with TBZ. Moreover the replacement of lysine 230 with arginine slightly enhanced death induction in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 6A). The decrease in the effectiveness of death induction that was previously reported to occur when replacing this residue with methionine [29] is thus not due to the arrest of ubiquitination but rather reflects an impact of an altered local charge in the MLKL molecule on its function.

On assessing the effects of replacing lysine 50 in human MLKL and lysines 50 and 51 in mouse MLKL on cell death induction we found that both resulted in some enhancement of the cytotoxic activity of MLKL and that its extent varied from one cell type to another (Supplementary Fig. 6B C). Such increase was observed when this necroptotic death was induced not only by TNF but also by stimulation of TLR3 which employs TRIF rather than RIPK1 to activate the necroptotic pathway [30] and in that case too mutation of lysines 50 and 51 compromised the induced ubiquitination of MLKL (Supplementary Fig. 7).

As shown in Fig. 2G both in human and in mouse MLKL molecules these lysine residues occur in the loop connecting helices α2 and α3 in the HeLo domain. Prior studies had suggested that in the case of human MLKL this region contributes to the association of the molecule with phosphatidylinositol-phosphate phospholipids and may thus affect its activation [31 32]. In mouse MLKL however this region does not seem to serve such a role and is quite remote from the residues shown to be crucially involved in the mediation of necroptosis ([33] and https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.03.442385). It therefore seemed to us plausible that the observed modulation of the effectiveness of necroptosis by MLKL ubiquitination reflects a functional role(s) of such ubiquitination that is different from its direct involvement in the necroptotic effect.

Ubiquitination of MLKL prompts its association with endosomal membranes and its exclusion from cells within extracellular vesicles

In comparing the amounts of ubiquitinated MLKL in various fractions of TBZ-treated HT-29 cells we found it to be enriched in the microsomal membranes and very low in the cytosol (Fig. 3A). Consistently some of the MLKL molecules in HT-29 cells were found to associate with isolated endosomal membranes and to co-localize with Rab5 and Rab7 markers of early and late endosomes respectively. This association underwent a dramatic increase following TBZ treatment (Fig. 3B−E and Supplementary Fig. 8).

Fig. 3: Ubiquitinated MLKL associates with endosomal membranes and is excluded from the cell within extracellular vesicles. A Assessment of the occurrence of ubiquitinated and phosphorylated MLKL induced by treatment for 3 h with TBZ in the indicated subcellular fractions of HT-29 cells. Samples of 15 μg per well of the proteins in the lysates of each fraction were subjected to western blot analysis and samples of 170 μg per well of the proteins were assessed for MLKL ubiquitination.

Staining with anti-ubiquitin antibodies revealed co-association of ubiquitin and MLKL with the endosomes (which was similarly increased in response to TBZ treatment (Fig. 3F−I)) but not with the endoplasmic reticulum or the mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. 9 and data not shown). The association of ubiquitin with MLKL in the endosomes was confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis (Supplementary Fig. 10). Strikingly HT-29 cells in which lysine 50 in MLKL was mutationally replaced with arginine (K50R) did not display these associations with the endosomal membranes (Fig. 3B−I and Supplementary Fig. 8).

We previously reported that the binding of MLKL to endosomal membranes eventually results in the exclusion of these MLKL molecules from the cells within EVs [23]. As shown in Fig. 3J MLKL molecules found in the EVs are highly ubiquitinated and to an extent much greater than those found intracellularly. The arrest of the ubiquitination of MLKL by the K50R mutation practically abolished its exclusion within EVs (Fig. 3K). These findings suggested that both the association of MLKL with the endosomes and its eventual exclusion within EVs are dictated by its ubiquitination.

MLKL ubiquitination is mediated by ITCH

In seeking a clue to the mechanism by which MLKL is ubiquitinated we re-examined the list of proteins previously found on our mass spectroscopic analysis to associate with MLKL within the EVs released from TBZ-treated HT-29 cells [23]. We noticed that the list included the ubiquitin ligase ITCH [34 35] and western blot analysis confirmed that TBZ treatment of HT-29 cells indeed induces the release of ITCH within EVs alongside MLKL (Fig. 4A).

A Comparison of the amounts of ITCH in 15 μg of proteins of the total cellular lysate and of EVs released from HT-29 cells during treatment for 3 h with TBZ. B ITCH binds to MLKL in HEK293T cells transiently overexpressing the two proteins. Samples were subjected to western blot analysis following precipitation of MLKL via a fused Strep-tag.

K TBZ-induced MLKL ubiquitination in HT-29 cells is compromised by CRISPR/Cas9-facilitated KO of ITCH but not by KO of NEDD4. Two distinct clones of HT-29 ITCH KO were analyzed with identical results. Full size image

Further evidence for a direct association of the two proteins came from the finding that when ITCH and MLKL were overexpressed in HEK293T cells they effectively bound to each other (Fig. 4B). At their endogenous cellular levels the two proteins did not associate in non-stimulated cells. However they bound together effectively following the triggering of MLKL phosphorylation by TBZ. Such association was also observed in cells expressing the K50R MLKL mutant but not in cells expressing MLKL mutants that had failed to be phosphorylated (T357A/S358A) or to oligomerize following phosphorylation (L162G/L165G) (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. 12).

Immunostaining of HT-29 cells showed that following TBZ treatment MLKL colocalizes with ITCH in both the early and the late endosomes (Fig. 4D E). In deletion analysis we found that MLKL binds ITCH via its pseudokinase motif (Supplementary Fig. 13) and that characteristically of HECT-type E3 ligases ITCH binds MLKL via a WW motif (Fig. 4F G).

In in vitro tests we found that recombinant ITCH can bind both to human and to mouse recombinant MLKL and ubiquitinates them (Supplementary Fig. 14) and that although ITCH catalyzes the ubiquitination of WT MLKL it does not ubiquitinate the MLKL’s K50R mutant (Fig. 4H). Consistently overexpression of ITCH in TBZ-treated HT-29 cells enhanced the ubiquitination of MLKL but not of K50R MLKL (Fig. 4I). Overexpression of ITCH also dramatically enhanced the association of MLKL with ESCRT proteins (Fig. 4J) which apparently dictate the association of MLKL with the endosomes and its eventual release from the cells in EVs [23].

Conversely the KO of ITCH in HT-29 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing compromised this ubiquitination. KO of NEDD4 another HECT-type E3 ligase that also occurs in the HT-29 cells had no effect on MLKL ubiquitination (Fig. 4K).

Taken together these findings suggested that ITCH is the E3 ligase that mediates ubiquitination of the HeLo domain in MLKL and thus dictates the association of MLKL with endosomes. Consistently with the observed increase in necroptotic activity of the non-ubiquitinable K50R mutant (Supplementary Fig. 6B C) KO of ITCH—the enzyme mediating this ubiquitination—was found to somewhat augment the induction of necroptotic death (Supplementary Fig. 15).

MLKL ubiquitination facilitates the destruction of intracellular Listeria monocytogenes in a manner distinct from the reported direct cytotoxic effect of MLKL on these bacteria

As shown in Fig. 5A B in HT-29 and L929 cells expressing WT MLKL induction of MLKL phosphorylation resulted in a substantial decrease in the rate of intracellular growth of L. monocytogenes. No such induced decrease was observed however in cells expressing the K50R human MLKL or the mouse K5051R MLKL mutants suggesting that this decrease occurs as a consequence of the ubiquitination of MLKL. Consistently knockdown (KD) of ITCH—the enzyme that we found to mediate this ubiquitination—abolished the anti-listerial effect of TBZ (Fig. 5C).

Fig. 5: MLKL ubiquitination facilitates the destruction of Listeria in a manner distinct from the previously described direct cytotoxic effect of MLKL on these bacteria. A B Kinetic analysis of the effects of TBZ treatment of HT-29 cells expressing the wild-type and the K50R mutant MLKL (A) and the effects of TNF treatment of L929 cells expressing wild-type and K5051R mutant MLKL (B) on the amounts of viable Listeria in the cells and on the extent of cell death. As described in Supplementary Fig. 19 TNF was applied to HT-29 cells 3 h after initiation of infection and to L929 cells 2 h after initiation of infection. Timings of bacterial yield quantification presented in the figure therefore correspond to 3 5 and 7 h of infection period in A and 2 6 and 8 h in B. At the multiplicity of infection employed in this study (20 in HT-29 cells and 15 in L929 cells) Listeria had no effect on the extent of cell death. Expression of identical amounts of wild-type and mutant MLKL in the tested cells was confirmed by western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 16). C Effect of ITCH knockdown on the amount of viable Listeria in infected HT-29 cells 5 h after infection and on its modulation by TBZ treatment. D Effects of various MLKL mutants constitutively expressed in MLKL knocked-down HT-29 cells and of treatment with TBZ on the amounts of viable Listeria in the cells.

Unless otherwise stated in this and in all other presented experiments the durations of cellular infection by the indicated bacteria and the timing and duration of treatment with TBZ or with TNF were as specified in Supplementary Fig. 19. Each of the experiments presented in panels A−G was carried out three times with duplicates of the samples (n = 6). H I Immunocytochemical analysis of the intracellular location of Listeria compared to that of the endosomal marker Rab7 at 5 h after infection of HT-29 cells with the wild-type bacteria (H) or with the DP-L2161 strain (I). Arrows point to Listeria colocalized with Rab7 (as determined by staining of the two with their specific antibodies). In all experiments presented in this figure MLKL and its mutants were re-expressed inducibly in MLKL KO cells. Full size image

This anti-listerial effect could be clearly distinguished from the cytotoxic effect of MLKL. The former occurred as early as 2 h after the induction of MLKL phosphorylation well before any sign of cell death could be observed (Fig. 5A B). Moreover on comparing the effects of various MLKL mutants on the bacteria we found on the one hand that MLKL mutants that cannot be phosphorylated (T357A/S358A) or do not oligomerize following phosphorylation (L162G/L165G) failed to mediate arrest of Listeria growth in response to TBZ. On the other hand an MLKL mutant that is both phosphorylated and oligomerized in response to TBZ but fails to mediate necroptosis (L58G/I76G [8]) did mediate arrest of Listeria growth in response to TBZ (Fig. 5D).

A recent study suggested that MLKL can also suppress the growth of L. monocytogenes independently of MLKL oligomerization upon its direct binding to the bacteria [36]. We found that mere KO of MLKL in the HT-29 cells consistently resulted in increased bacterial yield (Fig. 5E) despite the fact that—unlike after treatment with TBZ—the bacteria did not induce oligomerization or ubiquitination of MLKL (Supplementary Fig. 17).

Previous studies have shown that the extent to which Listeria keep on replicating in infected cells or are destroyed in them is subject to modulation by antagonistic mechanisms employed by this pathogen as well as by the host cells (see e.g. [37383940]). The bacteria enter cells by co-opting receptor-uptake mechanisms. They are initially found within membrane-encased niches in the cells and then with the assistance of a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin called “listeriolysin O” (LLO) that the bacteria produce most of them escape to the cytoplasm [41]. Comparing the effect of MLKL on the growth of mutant Listeria that are deficient in LLO—and therefore cannot exit to the cytoplasm—with its effect on the WT bacteria and on the mutated bacteria in which LLO was re-expressed we found that a decrease in bacterial yield that was due to mere expression of MLKL could be observed only in cells infected with the LLO-expressing bacteria. In contrast the decrease imposed by induction of MLKL phosphorylation occurred independently of bacterial LLO expression (Fig. 5E−G). Immunostaining of the infected cells confirmed that most of the WT bacteria were found in the cytoplasm whereas the mutant LLO-deficient bacteria occurred almost entirely in association with the endosomes (Fig. 5H I).

These findings suggested that MLKL has two distinct effects on Listeria which are exerted differentially at distinct sites in the cell: a direct toxic effect that MLKL exerts on the bacteria upon encountering them in the cytoplasm [36] and an effect of MLKL on those bacteria that have remained within membrane-encased niches which is exerted as a consequence of the binding of ubiquitinated MLKL molecules to endosomal membranes.

MLKL ubiquitination also facilitates the destruction of some other intracellular bacteria

Similarly to L. monocytogenes the Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica enters cells by co-opting receptor-uptake mechanisms and its replication within the infected cells is subject to modulation by antagonistic effects exerted both by the bacteria and by cellular defense mechanisms [42 43]. On assessing the yields of these bacteria in infected HT-29 and L929 cells we found that as with Listeria in cells that express WT MLKL the yield of Y. enterocolitica was effectively decreased by their treatment with TBZ and TNF respectively whereas in HT-29 cells expressing the K50R MLKL mutant and in L929 cells expressing the K5051R MLKL mutant these treatments had no effect on their bacterial yields (Fig. 6A B).

Fig. 6: MLKL ubiquitination also facilitates the destruction of some other intracellular bacteria. A−C Yields of the indicated bacteria 5 h after infection of HT-29 cells or their HT-29 K50R mutant and 6 h after infection of L929 cells or their K5051R mutant and the modulation of these yields obtained by treatment of the HT-29 cells with TBZ and treatment of the L929 cells with TNF. D Yields of E. coli 8 h after infection of L929 cells or their K5051R mutant and the modulation of these yields obtained by treatment of the L929 cells with TNF. E Yield of S. typhimurium 5 h after infection of HT-29 cells and modulation of the yield by TBZ treatment. In A and B three independent tests were performed (n = 6). C and D were done twice (n = 4). F Yield of S. typhimurium 8 h after infection of L929 cells and modulation of the yield by TNF treatment. E and F were performed twice (n = 4). In all experiments presented in this figure MLKL and its mutants were re-expressed inducibly in MLKL KO cells. Full size image

We also examined the impact of MLKL activation on the infection of these cells by Escherichia coli a bacterium that mainly grows extracellularly but can also adhere to mammalian cells and be phagocytized by them. We found that the yields of E. coli that could be recovered from HT-29 and L929 cells were decreased by TBZ and TNF treatments similarly to the effects exerted by those respective treatments on the yields of L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica and that these effects were also compromised by mutation of lysine 50 in human MLKL or of lysines 50 and 51 in mouse MLKL (Fig. 6C D). No such effects of TBZ and TNF were observed however on the retrospective yields of Salmonella typhimurium in the HT-29 and L929 cells (Fig. 6E F).

The anti-bacterial effect of ubiquitinated MLKL is mediated by the enhancement of bacterial translocation in the endosomes towards the lysosomes

We have previously shown that MLKL downregulates the cellular response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) by enhancing the lysosomal destruction of this cell-growth factor and its receptor and that MLKL similarly affects TNF following receptor-mediated uptake of this cytokine into the cell [23]. Those findings raised the possibility that the anti-bacterial effect of ubiquitinated MLKL is also mediated by the enhancement of lysosome-mediated destruction. Indeed as shown in Fig. 7A B blocking of lysosomal function in HT-29 cells by means of chloroquine application obliterated the inhibitory effect of TBZ on L. monocytogenes growth. In the absence of TBZ the chloroquine had no effect on bacterial yield nor did it affect the difference between bacterial yields in the MLKL KO and the WT cells. Chloroquine similarly affected the inhibitory effect of TNF on the growth of L. monocytogenes in mouse L929 cells (Fig. 7C). It also blocked the inhibitory effects exerted by TBZ and TNF on the growth of Y. enterocolitica in HT-29 and L929 cells respectively (Fig. 7D E). Pepstatin A a cathepsin D inhibitor also obliterated the inhibitory effects of TBZ and TNF on bacterial growth in HT-29 and L929 cells (Fig. 7C−E).

C Effect of chloroquine (CQ 25 μM) and of pepstatin A (PepA 10 μg/ml) applied to L929 cells as in A and B on the TNF-induced reduction in Listeria yields.

Both Yersinia and Listeria have been shown to activate autophagic mechanisms and it was suggested that those mechanisms facilitate the destruction of the bacteria [44 45]. Activation of MLKL was also reported to facilitate autophagy [46]. It therefore seems plausible that the lysosomal destruction of intracellular bacteria that we found to be induced by ubiquitinated MLKL is exerted via enhancement of autophagy. However KO of ATG5—a protein that plays a crucial role in both canonical and non-canonical autophagy—had no effect on the extent of MLKL ubiquitination in TBZ-treated HT-29 cells or on the TBZ-induced decrease in the growth of L. monocytogenes or Y. enterocolitica (Supplementary Fig. 18). This rendered it unlikely that the effect of ubiquitinated MLKL on these bacteria reflects enhanced autophagy.

We have previously shown that MLKL enhances translocation of the EGF receptor in EGF-treated cells from the early to the late endosomes and from there to the lysosomes [23]. By applying immunostaining to track Listeria in infected HT-29 cells along the endosomal pathway we found that stimulation of MLKL phosphorylation and ubiquitination similarly enhances Listeria translocation from the early to the late endosomes and from there to the lysosomes and that no such enhancement occurs in cells expressing the K50R MLKL mutant (Fig. 7F H). Immunostaining of Listeria-infected L929 cells revealed similar increases in translocation of Listeria from the early to the late endosomes and from there to the lysosomes in response to TNF which did not however occur in cells expressing the K5051R-mutated mouse MLKL (Fig. 7G I).

These findings suggested that the suppression of bacterial growth by stimulation of MLKL phosphorylation is an outcome of the enhancement of endosomal trafficking by ubiquitinated MLKL molecules.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Customers who succumb to the “cuteness” factor of fluffy baby chicks and ducks generally become return and often long-term customers.

Such was the case when York County 4-H’er Wyatt Baker spied a pen of fluffy chicks back when he was just 7 or 8 years old.

“We went to a Tractor Supply store and I saw the chicks” said Baker about the tiny balls of fluff that would significantly shape his future interests. “We started with eight of them. They were Red Sextons sometimes called Red Stars.”

“I just wanted some chickens and they are bred specifically for eggs” Baker said about his first flock which remained at the family’s Abbottstown home for the next several years.

Initially a York County 4-H’er in the shooting sports club Baker’s interest in chickens eventually blossomed into membership in the 4-H poultry club. After starting “from scratch” in his knowledge about the poultry industry Baker has become a poultry veteran with hatching raising butchering and exhibiting poultry.

“Poultry is the only kind of livestock I could have” Baker said adding that there’s not enough space on the family’s property to house larger livestock.

As his knowledge and experience with breeding and showing poultry developed one breed of chickens particularly caught Baker’s interest: Buckeyes.

“I just like how the Buckeyes look” he cites as a key reason why the large dual-purpose (meat and egg producing) birds have earned a spot as his favorite. Baker explains that the Buckeye breed originated in the state of Ohio and sport sleek deep-reddish-brown feathering. The flowing tails on the handsome roosters shimmer with a green iridescence.

“It was a choice between them and Barred Rocks or Rhode Island Reds” Baker said about how he winnowed out the breed on which he would focus. “I like their smaller more compact ‘pea combs’ which do better through the winter and aren’t as likely to freeze in really cold weather. But there aren’t very many of them in the shows.”

Adding the new young Buckeyes to his existing small flock became an overnight demonstration of the term “pecking order.” While feeding the flock the following morning Baker found one young bird “ripped apart” and others somewhat injured and hastily separated the new birds from the older flock. Although one young chicken was lost he managed to save the rest with some extra care.

Showing Poultry

“I showed both a hen and a rooster” Baker said about his initial competition venture after joining the poultry club. By utilizing show opportunities to listen to and speak with the judges Baker has expanded his knowledge and expertise in many facets of poultry care and competition.

“I learned through 4-H what to look for in show chickens” said Baker.

Judges he said evaluate not only the quality and coloration of the entries’ outer plumage but also that of the softer feathering beneath. Eye color beak conformation quality of the comb and smoothness of the feet are other physical characteristics closely examined for adherence to each breed’s standard for the ideal bird.

And as in all livestock competition preparation ahead of the show plays an important role.

“We do give them baths” he said “and we put baby oil on their faces and their feet to make them shiny. It helps bring out their color.”

Some competitors may remove or blunt the birds’ spurs although Baker said that is not a requirement. His personal feeling is that spur removal detracts from the overall appearance.

Baker’s initial poultry competition at the York Fair soon expanded to include entering his birds at the Pennsylvania Farm Show. At this year’s Farm Show Baker will not only be exhibiting his prized Buckeyes but helping with routine maintenance and clean-up chores around the poultry display area. He also serves as a member of the Farm Show’s poultry committee.

In addition Baker assists with educational presentations given during the Farm Show. One in which he participated a few years ago entailed demonstrating how incubating eggs are candled to determine embryo development. His preparations for that presentation included having to start incubating fertilized eggs so that they would develop embryos at increasing days of maturity.

Following the avian flu disruption of poultry competitions several years ago blood-testing requirements were added for poultry entries at farm shows. Each bird entered in a show must be pre-tested by a veterinarian or certified testing individual and certificates must accompany each entry.

'An Incubator Addiction'

Although his first birds were purchased Baker soon graduated to breeding incubating and hatching many of his flock additions and show birds.

During his fourth-grade year at nearby Paradise Elementary School Baker’s class hatched eggs a project done in conjunction with a teaching program of the Cooperative Extension Service. His interest was piqued by that experience so Baker borrowed a Styrofoam incubator available through the 4-H poultry program.

“That started an incubator addiction” he said grinning explaining his later purchases of incubators acquired from various sources. “I now have several.”

One of Baker’s early incubating experiments involved several dozen tiny bobwhite quail eggs. Most of the eggs successfully hatched only for Baker to discover that the tiny chicks needed to be taught how to eat. Eventually he found that spreading starter feed out on pieces of aluminum foil encouraged the chicks to peck at the shiny foil surface thus finding the food. To his disappointment though many of the tiny hatchlings were still lost.

“After that I got better at it and have incubated and raised chicks since” he said.

Sometimes the chicks hatched out during various show displays like the crowd-popular ones at Farm Show and area fairs. Ultimately the chicks find a home among Baker’s trio of backyard coops each with its own spacious outdoor wire-enclosed run. Multiple pens allow him to separate birds of varying ages and development stages as needed and quarantine show birds for a brief period following competitions.

“I don’t use heat lamps; they bring down barns” Baker said about the classic chick-warming lights. Instead his newly hatched chicks may snuggle under “brooder plates” small table-like appliances gently warmed from overhead that mimic the comfort of chicks nestling under a hen. As the chicks grow the warming plate can be raised to accommodate their increasing size. Coverings are also installed over his coop windows during wintry months to reduce cold and drafts.

Now a senior at Spring Grove Area High School Baker plans to major in animal science at Penn State with a minor focus on poultry production. His goal which took root with those first tiny chicks is a career in the poultry industry beginning perhaps as a field service technician and working into higher-level management responsibilities.

Along with his studies and 4-H activities Baker works part-time at the nearby H & H Truck Services facility. He also assists with some milking and general farm chores at the Walk-Le dairy farm nearby.

As he prepares to “age out” of the 4-H program Baker hopes to encourage more young people to get involved in the poultry project. He’s observed over the years that poultry competition has generally attracted a more mature crowd and hopes to see enough young members become involved to keep the 4-H club membership going.

“Chickens are generally stereotyped as loved” Baker wisely observes. “People could keep a few chickens maybe 3 or 4 to have their own eggs. It’s a very affordable thing to do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXNzbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAxL3ZldGVyYW5zLWluLWhvbHlva2Utc29sZGllcnMtaG9tZS1kb3JtLWZvci10aGUtaG9tZWxlc3MtZmFjZS11bmNlcnRhaW4tZnV0dXJlcy1hcy1jbG9zdXJlLW9mLXByb2dyYW0tbG9vbXMuaHRtbNIBpAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXNzbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAxL3ZldGVyYW5zLWluLWhvbHlva2Utc29sZGllcnMtaG9tZS1kb3JtLWZvci10aGUtaG9tZWxlc3MtZmFjZS11bmNlcnRhaW4tZnV0dXJlcy1hcy1jbG9zdXJlLW9mLXByb2dyYW0tbG9vbXMuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Veterans in Holyoke Soldiers’ Home dorm for the homeless face uncertain futures as closure of program looms,"HOLYOKE — A Vietnam-era Air Force veteran sits in a makeshift library that is a bit dated.

Built on a cluster of islands in the Venetian lagoon with centuries-old buildings rising from the canals in all their decadent glory Chioggia is called “piccola Venezia” or little Venice. Locals beg to disagree: If anything they say it’s nearby Venice that should be described as Chioggia’s larger doppelgänger and it’s true Chioggia is older. Venice is so worried about being overwhelmed once again after the pandemic that it is planning to resort to surveillance cameras and cellphone data to control the crowds; visiting other culturally rich places like Chioggia can help relieve the pressure. Today Chioggia is popular with Italian and German visitors drawn both by the architectural beauties in the historic center and the family-friendly beaches of its mainland suburb Sottomarina. The city which has preserved a rough maritime vibe can serve as an ideal base for bicycle tours. It is also known for its radicchio. During a time of increased awareness of overtourism this miniature Venice is a delightful alternative for travelers looking for a lesser-known destination.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had predicted heavy snowfall in Murree and the Galiyat mountainous regions from January 6 to 9. But despite appeals by authorities to postpone plans due to bad weather and roadblocks tens of thousands of snow-tourists arrived in Murree 64 km (40 miles) northeast of the capital Islamabad in the past two days.

On Saturday the local administration declared Murree “calamity hit” with long lines of cars stuck in the resort town after a snowstorm made the roads impassable stranding motorists without food and water in the freezing cold. The Rescue 1122 emergency service announced that 22 people including nine children had died.

Prime Minister Imran Khan’s special assistant on communication Shahbaz Gill said early Sunday morning that major roads in Murree had been cleared for traffic.

“About 600 to 700 vehicles were evacuated from Murree last [Saturday] night” Gill wrote on Twitter. “Rawalpindi police district administration Pakistan Army men and our locals remained active throughout the night.”

مری کی تمام مین شاہراہوں کو ٹریفک کے لیے کلیئر کر دیا گیا ہے۔ مری سے رات گئے 600 سے 700 گاڑیوں کو نکالا گیا، راولپنڈی پولیس، ضلعی انتظامیہ،پاک فوج کے جوان اور ہمارے مقامی لوگ رات بھر متحرک رہے۔راولپنڈی اسلام آباد سے مری آنے والے راستوں پر پولیس موجود ہے، راستے آج بھی بند رہیں گے pic.twitter.com/Bdr5QOOO2H — Dr. Shahbaz GiLL (@SHABAZGIL) January 9 2022

The Pakistan army’s media wing said army engineers’ troops with road clearance machinery were working to clear roads.

“More Than 300 snow affected people including children have been provided medical care by team of army doctors and paramedics. Cooked meal served to more than 1000 stranded people in Jheekagali Kashmiri Bazar Lower Topa and Kuldana” the military said adding that stranded people had been accommodated and provided shelter with hot meals and tea at various military rescue centers set up in the area.

On Friday evening the Islamabad administration announced it was closing the roads leading to Murree for the rest of the weekend “in public interest.”

For hours overnight and well after daybreak on Saturday thousands of cars lined the snow-clogged roadway as their drivers grew increasingly desperate about their predicament and exasperated by what appeared to be a slow response by authorities.

Authorities in Rawalpindi which is adjacent to Islamabad said on Saturday over 23000 stranded vehicles had been already evacuated from Murree and around 1000 were still stranded.

A strong westerly wave entered Pakistan’s western and upper parts earlier this week producing rain and snowfall. It is forecast to grip the areas until Sunday.",,,,,,

Russell Jennings customer service and permitting manager for Spartanburg County said that during the testing phase the county issued 600 permits through the EnerGov software. He said the system made inspections more accurate and helped show what was on each site because photos can be attached.

Beginning Jan. 10 users will be able to submit permits through a self-service portal and see comments from various county departments. Instead of paying for and picking up permits in person it can all be done online. Users and approvers will have access to shared documents and notes.

A progress chart will show where each permit stands with planning engineering and building code approvals.

The software also corrects mistakes related to addresses or parcel numbers.

“It helps other people internally in our departments and even externally outside of our departments” said Richie Smith development coordinator for Spartanburg County. “It’s a simple enough software that can be easily served by an address or a parcel number.""

On average the county handles 10000 permits a year. County development officials said the system will make the permitting process more efficient as people move to the area. The population of Spartanburg County was 325433 in the 2020 census an increase of almost 41000 over 2010.

“We're hoping that the process gets sped up a lot quicker that things don't sit” said Leigh MacDonald current planning manager for Spartanburg County.

The software is used by more than 600 clients according to Greg Savard general manager of the civic services business unit of Tyler Technologies. The company acquired EnerGov in 2012.

“We’re excited that the county is ready to go live” Savard said. “It's been a great experience working with them and they came in with a very well documented set of goals for the project.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGplcnNleS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sL3N3aW1taW5nLzIwMjIvMDEvMDgvbmotc3dpbW1pbmctcmVzdWx0cy1wYXNzYWljLWNvdW50eS1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXBzLzkxMTcxODIwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NJ swimming: Results from the Passaic County championships,"WAYNE – Passaic Tech swam back on top of the county Saturday. Adam Kiss swam to honor his coach.

The Bulldogs swept the team titles at the 14th annual Passaic County meet which returned after getting canceled last year due to COVID. It was the girls' fourth straight county championship and the seventh for the boys.

This year's coronation came without boys coach Denise Aronson who was forced into quarantine due to COVID. Passaic Tech assistant Linnette Cummings said Aronson received a positive test on Friday but was feeling asymptomatic.

""It's unfortunate that she got sick. I wanted to race for her"" Kiss said. ""She pushes you but it's out of love and motivation.""

Inside the dynasty

Kiss pushed Passaic Tech to the top of the standings by accounting for three of his team's nine wins. The speedy sophomore raced to gold in the individual medley then set the Passaic meet record in the 500 freestyle. Freshman Tyler Roer added wins in the backstroke and 200 freestyle to give Passaic Tech the most points in tournament history.

""So impressed with them and their attitude and their work ethic"" Cummings said. ""They're really going to be leaders of the team in the future.""

During the meet Cummings and other members of the coaching staff sent updates to Aronson from the bench. Maybe the only suspense was how to navigate the celebratory dip in the pool.

""I brought the change of clothes even though I'm superstitious"" said Cummings now in her fourth season on staff. ""I said I'm going to do it just in case. It was good. It wasn't too cold.""

Double dip

The Passaic Tech girls completed the four-peat by scoring 374.5 points to eclipse second-place Wayne Hills with 294 and third-place Wayne Valley with 293. The Bulldogs received a big effort from senior Julia Bartoszewicz who swept the sprint freestyles along with solo winners Julia Berkenbosch (breaststroke) and Karyme Lozano (butterfly).

In the big picture the Bulldog girls tied Wayne Hills (2010-13) for the longest title streak in Passaic County.

""It feels pretty good"" Bartoszewicz said. ""It's been a hard season a little bit but everybody pulled through. I'm really happy that I'm going out a champion.""

Bartoszewicz finishes her career with five individual county titles matching former teammate Symi Lall for the most (male or female) in school history. She also leaves with a meet record in the 100 freestyle having surpassed state champion Meaghan O'Donnell.

""I had no idea"" Bartoszewicz said after touching the wall in 53.39 seconds. ""I just knew that that's actually one of my fastest times.""

Newcomer steps up

One of the big winners on Saturday didn't score an official point at all.

That hardly mattered to Pompton Lakes' sophomore William Torticill who won 100 freestyle gold while swimming as an independent. The split-second victory made him the Cardinals' first champion since Russell Stoll in 2013.

Even without any teammates present the 15-year-old Torticill was full of enthusiasm for his first high school meet. He planned to keep his medal above his bed.

""I felt amazing. I felt healthy. I had a little bit of doubt halfway through but eventually I felt like it was mine to win"" Torticill said. ""I went out and did it.""

Peaks and valleys

Wayne Valley freshman Sarah Rodrigues established herself as a bona fide state title contender after a stunning performance in the backstroke. Rodrigues shattered the Passaic meet record in 55.97 then gave a thumbs up to the crowd.

""That moment was amazing"" Rodrigues said. ""Our boys coach is actually my club coach. He came up to me before the event and said 'you have a really good shot of breaking the record. Go for it.' I just went for it. My parents are sitting over there so it felt really good.""

Rodrigues placed first in the individual medley earlier while senior teammate Grace Weaver capped a special career with 200 and 500 freestyle gold.

Veganism ""is a cult"" says the outspoken health and fitness guru.

Tortorich's previous films ""Fat: A Documentary"" and its 2021 sequel argue conventional narratives surrounding fat intake are misleading to say the least. ""Beyond Impossible"" takes on a bigger target: the new wave of fake meat products peddled everywhere from your corner grocery to Burger King and White Castle restaurants.

Impossible Food and Beyond Meat two of the big new players in the market deliver food products that both resemble and taste like real meat its proponents say. They also offer less fat plenty of protein and are made completely from plants.

The products Tortorich noted aren't directly aimed at vegan consumers but at people who can't get enough of thick juicy steaks and burgers. Problem is the product's nutritional benefits elude him.

""I thought being a vegan was about being healthy"" Tortorich says of a product he dubbed a ""Frankenfood"" sometimes produced in China and shipped stateside.

Fake meat ""is not helping the environment or people yet that's exactly what they're selling"" he argues.

Impossible Foods disagrees saying it offers a much greener production blueprint than traditional meat processing which requires extensive land among other resources.

""The best way to reduce your carbon footprint limit global warming halt the collapse of biodiversity save wildlife and ensure enough clean water for all of us is to ditch meat from animals"" its website argues providing an environmental impact calculator so consumers can crunch the numbers themselves.

""Beyond Impossible"" leans into that eco-connection suggesting the global push for fake meat products is driven by environmental concerns as much as nutritional dictates.

The film includes speeches by various gurus extolling how a vegan diet specifically the Planetary Health Diet can dramatically impact Earth for the better. And they have some corporate support with powerhouse companies like Unilever (Knorr Hellmann's and Ben & Jerry Ice Cream) actively promoting that lifestyle.

Tortorich who has worked with celebrity clients to get them in red carpet shape promotes a ""no sugar no grains"" eating regimen via his social media accounts his 2013 book ""Fitness Confidential"" and podcast of the same name.

He maintains a meat-based diet is superior to plant models in part because the former affords proteins that are difficult to reproduce in a vegan diet. Vegans often must supplement their diets with B12 pills because that nutrient doesn't exist in vegetation.

The author and podcaster tried to include alternate voices in the documentary specifically vegan experts like Dr. Walter Willett former chair of nutrition at Harvard. ""Beyond Impossible"" highlights those attempts as well as the various responses. Some experts initially seemed open to the possibility but eventually they all turned Tortorich down.

The fitness guru offers a similar invitation to appear on his podcast ""Fitness Confidential"" with the same results.

Fake meat products are a booming industry at the moment. The consulting firm Kearney predicted the market would grow to become one-fourth of the $1.8 trillion meat market by the year 2040 with meat protein products ""peaking"" in just three years.

Even traditional meat players like Tyson Foods are gambling on the new wave of meat alternatives.

The 2018 documentary ""The Game Changers"" chronicles elite athletes who embraced a vegan diet. Tortorich's film debunks some of the information in the movie pointing out one of its producers Oscar-winner James Cameron of ""Avatar"" fame is financially invested in the vegan diet movement.

In 2017 Cameron announced the formation of Verdient Foods an organic pea protein facility in Vanscoy Saskatchewan.

""Follow the money"" Tortorich says.

""Beyond Impossible"" offers something beyond nutritional debates. We see expert after expert suggesting ways to impose taxes and other punitive measures to cajole if not outright force people to leave meat behind for good.

""There are a lot of agendas going on [in the nutrition industry]"" Tortorich says citing for example veganism's ties to PETA.

Tortorich would be happy if consumers simply started to question what they see and hear on nutrition and make up their own minds. He's gotten used to swimming against the nutritional tide having done just that since the 1980s. He has few kind words for organizations many would deem trustworthy like the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association.

Their research is often ""bought and paid for"" by companies like Pepsi and Mars rendering their findings questionable he claims.

Even areas where he finds some common ground like the meat-friendly Keto diet offers more reasons for concern.

""You can market a bowl of sugar and call it Keto"" he says. ""Oreos are vegan … of course everyone's confused.""

Tortorich says independent voices on the nutritional front face discrimination from Big Tech.

""We get shut down left and right"" he says adding he's been shadowbanned on Twitter and his private Facebook group endures bizarre disciplinary action. One such incident involved ""offensive language"" that drew a warning from the social media giant. The phrase in question he says was ""bacon fat.""

""Who's doing this? Who's controlling the narrative?"" he asks pointing to other voices questioning received narratives who face similar digital cancellations figures like Joe Rogan whose interview with Dr. Robert Malone a medical innovator who questions elements of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout was banned by YouTube recently.

""We're trying to get the word out but the powers that be say ‘Not so fast'"" Tortorich says.

He struggled with something similar from Amazon when his original ""Fat"" feature came out in 2019. The megaplatform repeatedly mislabeled the film dubbing it a ""drama"" initially and later putting it in the ""fiction"" category before eventually properly labeling it a documentary.

Tortorich clings to his independent status as a late-blooming filmmaker.

""I make 'em myself"" he says. ""I don't have a gatekeeper. That's why I can tell the truth. It's my money.""

His detractors he acknowledges have claimed he's funded by various meat and egg councils. ""I wish they would give me money"" he says with a laugh.

The original ""Fat"" feature got a boost from a crowdfunding campaign but proved successful enough to fuel a sequel. Those films helped Tortorich fund ""Beyond Impossible"" but his film career could end at any moment.

""If no one buys this movie I'm out of the film business"" he says adding his films cost him between $300000 to $500000 with him wearing multiple hats on and off set. ""I'm not a filmmaker. I'm just a guy who's telling a story.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay9zcG9ydC8xNzI2ODA4Ny90eXNvbi1mdXJ5LWxhdW5jaGVzLWljZWxhbmQtcmFuZ2UtZGlldC_SAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW4uY28udWsvc3BvcnQvMTcyNjgwODcvdHlzb24tZnVyeS1sYXVuY2hlcy1pY2VsYW5kLXJhbmdlLWRpZXQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyson Fury set to launch his own range of food & drink with Iceland – as boxing star’s 5000 calorie-a-day...,"KNOCKOUT RANGE Tyson Fury set to launch his own range of food & drink with Iceland – as boxing star’s 5000 calorie-a-day diet revealed

""To be a Vikings fan is to always be hopeful"" said Debbie Danich 51 of Eagan who ""absolutely"" approved of the mask mandate implemented last week by the city of Minneapolis ahead of the game. She wore two masks with a purple cloth over the surgical grade covering.

Committed as Vikings fans may be there are apparently limits. The team sold 66625 tickets to the game but the stadium appeared to be no more than 80% full. Plenty of purple seats remained unoccupied especially on the upper levels.

The uneven performance of the hometown team kept the energy and noise levels decidedly subdued even as the Vikings took the lead in the second half. Fans' expectations had long ago been placed firmly in check. The Vikings got off to a grim start trailing division rivals the similarly woeful Chicago Bears 14-3 at the half.

Going into Sunday's game Vikings fans knew they would once again be waiting until next year for the thrill of chasing a championship. Instead of bantering about prospective playoff opponents or hugging and high-fiving strangers after improbable game-winning receptions fans could only speculate about the extent of off-season upheaval on the team's roster and among the staff.

Despite the abysmal season the vicious cold and the mask mandate some heavily layered fans brought big energy to the pregame party in the few remaining tailgating spaces north of the stadium.

Vikings fan Ray Bewidt watches players warm up on the field ahead of Sunday’s game against the Bears.

""How many more months until we get football again?"" a cheerful 32-year-old Isaac Schweer of Bloomington said as he stood with friends in the surface lot around a portable table dotted with cans of rum beer seltzer and Moscow mules.

""It's no stress today. We already know our fate. It's probably (coach Mike) Zimmer's last game"" Schweer said.

Neither he or his four friends considered selling their tickets and staying home.

""Not for one second"" said Jordan Obermiller 27 of Milaca who was celebrating her birthday and attending her first Vikings game.

Fellow reveler Nick McElhone 32 of Big Lake insisted on the outdoor party despite the deep freeze. ""To get the full Vikings experience you've got to tailgate"" he said. ""You can't hold anything back now it's the last game of the year.""

The quintet of friends dressed for the weather. Obermiller said she had hand and foot warmers buried in the layers. The crew was similarly prepared to wear face coverings at the game saying masks are now a way of life.

""It will be hard for them to enforce but we'll do our best and wear them"" McElhone said.

He and his friends called out to a passerby fellow tailgater Jeff Mills 31 of West St. Paul. ""Lifetime Vikings fan"" Mills responded ripping open his jacket to reveal he was wearing a jersey with the number of wide receiver Justin Jefferson. ""Jettas!"" Mills yelled using a nickname for the dazzling player.

Mills said he's been vaccinated and has had COVID-19 an astonishing three times with minor symptoms. ""I'm going to wear a mask in there"" he said nodding to the stadium.

Inside the stadium masks could come off while eating and drinking a wide exemption open to exploitation. Compliance was largely voluntary. A few stadium employees could be spotted on the concourses carrying signs that read ""Please keep your face covering on while in your seat.""

Standing behind the double-masked Danich in a concessions line were four friends carrying drinks and not wearing masks.

Ben Siegfried 26 of Prior Lake said he was unvaccinated. The Bears fan wearing a Brian Urlacher jersey shrugged off the mask requirement. ""Nobody's told us we have to"" he said.

His friend Matt Sloan 27 of Shakopee was similarly not masked but said he's vaccinated. Wearing a Randy Moss jersey Sloan said going to the game was something to do on a cold winter day. He waxed philosophical about the tradition of disappointment after a Vikings season. ""We can't figure it out in the end. And it's not just this season it's the last 10 years"" he said.

The Vikings ended up winning the game 31-17 but that was beside the point for the committed crew of fans who weren't undeterred by a losing season. They say they will be back.

Danich expects to continue buying season tickets. ""I think we'll always have them because it's my husband's passion"" she said.

Sloan expressed similar devotion. ""I'm a die-hard fan"" he said. ""I'll always be here.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2MzZTRiY2NlLTAwZmEtNDNmYi1hNDI3LTYyNTUyM2NkZWJkYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street banks set to report record profits for 2021,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

It came in the form of Proton (XPR) a blockchain cryptocurrency token.

Congress chartered the First Bank in 1791. Located on 3rd Street within Philadelphia’s Independence National Historical Park the corporation was dissolved when its charter expired in 1811.

However the building constructed in 1796 remains. Now the Independence Historical Trust is hoping to give the First Bank renewed purpose.

The Independence Historical Trust is a nonprofit dating back nearly 50 years. As official philanthropic partner of the Independence National Historical Park its original mission was to prepare for the nation’s bicentennial.

These days the Trust’s mission is to raise money for projects supporting educational services within the Independence National Historical Park. To that end Trust Executive Director Thomas Caramanico said the goal is to reopen the building as a museum.

“The bank is a beautiful picturesque building. But it’s in need of repair and it’s underutilized” said Caramanico. The Trust began fundraising for the restoration in 2017.

The biggest windfall from individuals came through benefactors Denise Foderaro and Frank Quattrone. They offered a $1 million challenge grant.

Using these funds and others the Trust has already hired architects and planners to refurbish the First Bank. The plan is to begin construction in 2023 and finish by 2026 for America’s 250th birthday.

But the most unusual donation came from Metallicus Inc. a firm focused on the crypto industry. Caramanico called it “a proposal so revolutionary that we think Alexander Hamilton himself would approve.”

“This is the first gift of its kind to our organization and it seems fitting that we would be receiving it for the First Bank project” said Caramanico. “It’s a wonderful example of the new technology the new financial system supporting the history of the original financial system.”

Based in San Francisco Metallicus offers an app called Metal Pay for trading cryptocurrency. CEO and Co-Founder Marshall Hayner transferred the funds on the First Bank’s front steps using his smartphone.

“We feel a little bit like those founding fathers of finance working to create the next generation of banking — a new system based on blockchain technology and the evolving ways in which we see send and use money” said Hayner. “We are honored to contribute to the preservation of the First Bank of the United States as a token of what banking means to the free world.”

“We feel a little bit like those founding fathers of finance working to create the next generation of banking — a new system based on blockchain technology and the evolving ways in which we see send and use money.”

Connecting the First Bank and Metallicus is Lee Woolley. He serves as Vice Chairman for the Independence Historical Trust and is a senior executive at Metallicus.

Cynthia MacLeod Superintendent of the Independence National Historical Park thanked Hayner and Woolley for their work in facilitating the crypto contribution.

“The donation the trust will accept this morning will enable the project to move closer to our goal and we are so close” said MacLeod. “People who have marveled at the stunning exterior of this building can also be amazed by its magnificent interior and learn about the financial foundation of our country.”

Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) attended the transfer as a guest speaker and noted the donation has “terrific symbolism.” For Toomey the contribution serves as an example of how the country’s understanding of money has changed over time.

“And so here we have in the form of a cryptocurrency donation to this almost ancient bank a real meaningful contribution to our country’s history” said Toomey “but also a symbolic reminder of the evolution of money in our society — an evolution that is going to continue and that the federal government is going to have to figure out how to come to terms with as technology never rests.”

For present and future generations.

“The materials we have are distributed to scientists and researchers throughout the world and those are used in breeding and research programs so that we can improve agriculture everywhere and feed the planet successfully” explained Volk.

With so many diverse materials the gene bank can be used for a variety of reasons.

A disease could emerge that wipes out a large population of livestock. The genetic diversity lost could be replaced because the gene bank has it safely stored away.

Or a plant breeder could introduce new sources of resistance to such a disease by acquiring plant materials from the bank. Volk pointed out that this is already happening in New York where researchers have provided genetic materials from a crop wild relative species of apple that “have new strains of resistance to diseases such as apple scab.”

This could also be done for drought or heat resistance for example which is especially important in the face of climate change.

Blackburn explained: “We've collected samples from all over the United States whether that's going to be in temperate areas like here in Colorado or a lot further south say along the Gulf coast region of the United States where animals may be better adapted to a higher degree to various factors such as heat temperature [or] stress that they may encounter.”

According to Blackburn this idea could even go so far as to reduce methane emissions from the livestock sector by introducing select genetic material.

For plant materials the Fort Collins facility also acts as a backup for other gene banks in the national system. For livestock this is the only facility of its kind in the nation.

This means a lot of freezing.

The freezing process for a given sample depends on the type of sample. Scientists must worry about moisture proper protectants and how samples will be stored. Samples can be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees Celsius or into tanks where they either sit in or above liquid nitrogen."

The part-time Uber driver told CNN he didn’t know that Monday’s severe winter storm had created a 50-mile-long backup that left some motorists stranded for more than 24 hours when he agreed to make the trip from Washington DC to Williamsburg Virginia.

Williams 32 said he picked the girl up at Union Station at about 2 a.m. on Tuesday after her train had been canceled because of the weather conditions.

They were about 20 miles into the two-and-a-half hour trip when Williams realized there was a problem.

“I noticed trucks and cars there’s a ton of red lights ahead of me” he said.

He tried taking an alternate route but police directed him back onto the Interstate because those roads were also closed due to downed trees and power lines.

“Once we get back on I-95 my GPS instantly updates itself and it adds another hour-and-30 minutes to the trip” Williams said.

He said he kept checking on his passenger and offering her drinks and snacks he kept in the car.

“She’s telling me she’s okay but I could hear her on the phone talking to family and friends and I can hear that she’s just exhausted emotional and just tired” he said.

Williams said he didn’t have any blankets in the car and he was concerned about his gas getting low from him running the car to use the heat.

He was eventually able to follow a work truck and some other cars and turn around on I-95 and head back to DC.

Williams didn’t want to leave the passenger at Union Station by herself so he convinced her parents to let him get a hotel room for her – with his own money – so that she could rest and be safe.

The parents were reluctant at first but agreed that it was the best idea.

“They don’t know me I don’t know them and I get it” Williams said. “They just want to make sure their child is safe.”

He got her checked into the hotel at about 8 that morning and offered to take the passenger back to Williamsburg for free once the roads cleared.

A friend of her family was able to take her home.

“So around about 8:30 Tuesday night she texted me and said she was safe” he said. “She thanked me for everything and her parents had also thanked me for doing what I did for their daughter because I didn’t have to do it.”

Uber is reimbursing Williams for the cost of hotel room and thanked him for doing so much for his passenger.

“Mr. Williams went above and beyond during this very stressful situation and we thank him for his thoughtful actions” a company spokesperson said in an email to CNN.

The company said that “not all heroes wear capes” in a post on Twitter.

Williams got paid $107 for the ride but his extraordinary customer service has earned him a new opportunity.

He was offered a part time job as a lead driver at Alto an upscale rideshare company that operates in Dallas Houston Los Angeles Miami and DC.

Williams said he would be training other drivers on customer service and maintaining their vehicles.

“We are thrilled” a spokeswoman said in an email to CNN. “DaVante is exactly the type of customer and safety focused leader we are looking to help lead our DC presence.”

Williams said they are still working out the details of the offer because he works full time as a property manager and realtor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9saWZlYW5kc3R5bGUvMjAyMi9qYW4vMDgvaGFybGFuLWNvYmVuLWktdXNlZC10by13cml0ZS1pbi10aGUtYmFjay1vZi11YmVyc9IBZmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9saWZlYW5kc3R5bGUvMjAyMi9qYW4vMDgvaGFybGFuLWNvYmVuLWktdXNlZC10by13cml0ZS1pbi10aGUtYmFjay1vZi11YmVycw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harlan Coben: ‘I used to write in the back of Ubers’,"In college I worked as a tour guide on the Costa del Sol. It was a weird scene. I saw some wild stuff; some violence I’d like to forget. I lived in one hotel room with four or five people for a while. I worked in a discotheque. But it inspired my first attempt at really writing. I needed to get it all down.

I think most writers have impostor syndrome. On the one hand you think “I suck I’ve got nothing to say this isn’t working at all” and the next moment you have the hubris to say “I’m going to write 500 pages and people are going to pay me to read it.”

My advice for writers? Just get it out. You can fix bad pages. You can’t fix no pages.

There’s a lot of me in my stories. No writer likes to admit this but when I started my Myron Bolitar series a lot of it was wish fulfilment. He’s smarter than me faster stronger. I played basketball; he was a better player than me. As the series went on I created a tension between us. His parents are alive. Mine died young. His dream in life is to get married and have kids. I did that. We’re jealous of each other.

I used to write in the back of Ubers. I can’t write in the same place for very long. I basically finished The Stranger over three weeks of Uber rides. Then that stopped working so I tried something else. Planes were it for a while. Not that I was taking planes everywhere but I was drawn to long flights. Generally speaking I like being disturbed a bit. It makes me focus harder.

I don’t know any writer who doesn’t like being alone. I’m an introvert. A socially adept one but an introvert all the same. I can be fine in company but when I go home I’m exhausted. I need to not see anyone for a while. If you’re a person who constantly wants people around you writing probably isn’t for you.

Only one of my kids had any interest or talent in writing. That’s Charlotte she’s a really good scriptwriter. She’s worked with me on my Netflix adaptations. The rest are all science-based like their mother a physician. One of my daughters is majoring in computational biology. I don’t even know what that means. My son just got a job in flight control at Nasa. I like bragging about that. I’m really proud.

The importance of my Jewishness changes. I’m secular but it’s the world I grew up in. It’s in my makeup. I view my Jewishness as cultural. There’s a weird deal with Jews where they will define themselves as Jewish even if they don’t buy a word. You don’t see too many Catholics or Christians or anybody Muslim saying “Oh I’m a Catholic but I don’t buy a word of it!”

I can’t tell you the secret to writing a great mystery other than to say I’m always asking “What if?” It’s a fair criticism that I twist too much. If you don’t like a twist I’m really not your guy! But really what I’m trying to do is make every paragraph every page every sentence and every word more compelling. How can I make you want to turn the page even more?

Davante Williams 32 was taking his teenage passenger on a ride in his BMW when the pair suddenly became stuck on an icy stretch of Interstate 95 in Virginia together with hundreds of other drivers.

The fare was already going to be substantial as he attempted to navigate his way from downtown D.C. to Williamsburg Virginia a journey of 150 miles.

But Williams found he was going nowhere fast as 48 miles of I-95 was shut down with weather conditions making the road impassable.

Drivers wait for the traffic to be cleared as cars and trucks are stranded on sections of Interstate 95 on Tuesday after 48 miles of the Interstate was closed due to ice and snow

Despite attempting to avoid the Interstate at one point there was no other option leaving the pair stuck in the horrendous traffic jam.

'I just figured out maybe it was a little fender bender but when I got closer I noticed traffic was not moving.' Every time Williams tried to get off the freeway he was advised by police officers to get back onto the main road because surrounding roads were also closed by snow and ice.

Williams said that he gave the girl who was sitting in the back seat his supply of water and crackers during the journey. Nevertheless she became extremely anxious and upset during the ordeal.

'At this point we are just sitting on the same location hours are starting to go by and people are starting to get off their cars to stretch' Williams explained. 'This doesn't look good.'

Upon exiting the freeway at the earliest opportunity Williams drove to a hotel to make sure his teenage passenger was safe

Drivers were faced with never-ending tailback after the Interstate was completely shut down

At one point he became so concerned about fuel levels that Williams had to keep switching his car engine on and off every few minutes in order to conserve gas while still attempting to keep the interior warm.

'I need to get out of this traffic because my anxiety is starting and I'm in a car with a complete stranger' Williams told The Washington Post. 'I'm responsible for her and me at this moment.'

'My passenger she was so distraught' he told NewsNation. 'Apparently I picked her up from Union Station and her train was canceled due to derailment. So she only could call for Uber and I was her driver.

Williams spoke to the girls' parents to explain that he would drive her back to Washington D.C. without charge.

'I had to explain to her parents that 'Hey I'm not anyone crazy. I'm just trying to get your daughter somewhere safe.

Williams 32 even telephoned the girls' parents so they wouldn't worry

'I understand your fear and what's going through your mind' Williams told the girl's mom. 'But please see that this is coming from a genuine place. I just want her to be safe and get rest.'

Williams ended up getting the girl a hotel room for the night and even footed the bill.

'I wind up having to put her in a hotel because she wasn't old enough to get a room … So I wanted to make sure she was comfortable. And I didn't want to leave her stranded' he said.

His story went viral with Uber tweeting the tale of his good deed and refunding the $150 it cost for her hotel room.

Uber tweeted about the story and even footed the bill for the hotel he paid for

Some drivers were stuck overnight after the Interstate was completely closed

'Not all heroes wear capes. Thank you Davante!' they tweeted.

'Mr. Williams went above and beyond during this very stressful situation and we thank him for his thoughtful actions' added Uber spokesperson said in a statement.

Since then Williams has received nothing but praise as well as offers for a new job.

'I received an offer to be a lead driver for Ride Alto where I will be pretty much in the office just being a supervisor.'

Following the drama the teenager reached out to thank him for his moment of kindness.

'She actually texted me and just thanked me … for everything that I had done for her that night.

'The following morning her parents also … just outpouring of thanks again for all that I could do to assist their daughter.

'At the end of the day the situation was larger than me and it was not about the money' Williams said. 'It was about me doing the humane thing for me and her to be safe.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHkxMDAuY29tL3ZpcmFsL3ViZXItZWF0cy1kcml2ZXItdGlrdG9rLXZpcmFsLWIxOTg5NTA00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Eats driver goes viral for adding handwritten poem and card to customer's order,"An Uber Eats driver has gone viral due to the extra mile he went when delivering food to a customer by adding a handwritten card and poem to the delivery.

Many other people were touched by his thoughtful gesture. “The fact that he puts extra effort into his job just to make other people smile” said one person in response.

“PLEASE FIND HIM. I wanna tip him and he didn’t even delivery to me” wrote a second person.

As reported by Daily Dot initially Uber wouldn’t disclose the driver’s full information for privacy reasons. All she knew was that his name was Donald.

In a follow-up video Ramirez first tries to contact Uber to try and see if she can get in contact with him and increase his tip.

Eventually though she was able to find him and shared a clip of a phone call that she made to him. Donald admitted that he was shocked at the lengths that Ramirez had gone to contact him and he even admitted that he almost didn’t take the order but he is overall overwhelmed by his viral success.

My family and I were guests of another family at a fishing lodge reachable by a series of planes each one smaller and older than the previous. Right before leaving New York on the first plane my friend impulsively got lash extensions. And there we were the only two women on an island 300 miles from the nearest road hauling salmon into a fishing boat with a guide who hadn’t showered in weeks.

From the neck up my friend could have been at the Met Gala; neck down it was Deadliest Catch.

Eyelash extensions false eyelashes eyelash serums and lash lifts are everywhere now probably including remote Alaska. I’ve seen big fake lashes on executives during earnings calls on geniuses at the Genius Bar on the person who administered my coronavirus test in a tent on Lexington Avenue.

Ulta Beauty stores now carry at least 10 different brands of false lashes and have seen a spike in sales of everything lash-related. The boom is part of an “expressive revival” says Monica Arnaudo the chief merchandising officer at Ulta—a movement that includes “brighter colors imaginative eye looks and evolved takes on Euphoria makeup” the HBO show about teenage sex drugs and glitter.

The lash frenzy could also be linked to the mainstreaming of drag culture the doll-like women in anime and unavoidably the Kardashians.

The pandemic has also played an unexpected role in the trend. While the population was masking up “expression became vital for our human connection and our lashes and brows are essential to that” says Jerrod Blandino a co-founder of Too Faced Cosmetics. “When they’re masked you can’t tell if people are smiling unless their eyes smile. Then you can see their spirit their twinkle their sadness and joy.” He decided to enhance that spirit with false lashes the logical next step to his best-selling mascara called Better than Sex. “I mean what more can you do if you’re a total glamour girl?” asks Blandino.

I’ve seen big fake lashes on executives during earnings calls on geniuses at the Genius Bar on the person who administered my coronavirus test in a tent on Lexington Avenue.

For inspiration he turned to Marilyn Monroe Audrey Hepburn Elizabeth Taylor “my friend Madonna and our holy godmother of glamour Dolly Parton. Oh also My Little Pony.” The resulting Better than Sex false lashes are a bit wonky comprising different lengths and thicknesses of vegan synthetic mink thatched and crisscrossed almost haphazardly. “They’re not perfect because lashes aren’t perfect. That’s the secret to beauty.”

Jenna Lyons’s entrance into lash land was slightly more subdued. After leaving J. Crew where as the creative guiding light she taught America to wear sequins with T-shirts in broad daylight Lyons worked with a makeup artist to invent a line of false lashes. It wasn’t the obvious first move. “It was a very personal thing because I don’t have any eyelashes” she says. “The things you’re insecure about you notice in yourself and other people.”

For lash inspiration industry taste-makers are looking to movie and music stars of yesteryear. Here film director Federico Fellini shows off his own lid accessories for the camera.

She also noticed that beauty was divided into extremes: either over-the-top excess or the minimalist no-makeup aesthetic. “Some of these girls on TikTok and YouTube look like paintings and I’m fascinated by that.” That said she wanted her false lashes to be “an amped-up version of yourself.” Some of the 10 lash styles are wispy; some are gently exaggerated; some mix brown and black hairs for verisimilitude. In other words sequins with a T-shirt.

Amplified beauty is a concept for our time when people are more likely to be seen on social media than in real life. With ring lights at the ready everyone has become the star of their own movies the target of their own paparazzi photographs dressed and embellished for high impact.

The name of Lyons’s eyelash line LoveSeen sounds like a weapon against invisibility. “Putting on makeup is like putting on armor. It’s a way of showing up in the world with the world as a stage.” The play on “love scene” speaks to the performative role of makeup now; we’re all putting on a one-person show a love scene with ourselves.

We may be on the brink of peak lashes. On Supergreat the on-demand and livestreaming beauty shopping app exaggerated makeup is starting to give way to individualistic self-expression. “Glam makeup used to be the standard” says Savannah Scott the content-and-editorial lead at Supergreat.

The Instagram face ruled with contour highlighter arched brows overdrawn lips and lashes for miles. “That look was all about huge fluffy false lashes that were immediately identifiable as fake. Now we’re in a trend of crazy unique balls-to-the-wall makeup and with all this diversity has come a bunch of lash alternatives.” She points to the success of Jenna Lyons’s real-looking false lashes and Lashify Gossamer lashes which also look relatively credible. “It’s like makeup is louder and more varied than ever but lashes have become a lot more quiet.”

With ring lights at the ready everyone has become the star of their own movies the target of their own paparazzi photographs dressed and embellished for high impact.

For those of us (me) who lack the dexterity to smear glue onto a strip of lashes and then affix that with tweezers directly over the eyeball—a terrifying process that according to Lyons takes three tries to master—there are lash serums with conditioners and oils that prevent breakage extending the natural growth cycle. None of the serums claim to make lashes actually grow longer because that would qualify them as drugs. Nevertheless I’ve applied several different formulas and swear that after a few months my lashes practically needed pruning.

Alicia Grande (“no relation to Ariana”) founder of Grande Cosmetics discovered a formula from a scientist and test-drove it for a few months with low expectations. “It was transformational” she says. “Even my husband noticed my lashes.” With a few tweaks GrandeLash-MD Lash Enhancing Serum was born eventually becoming a top seller at Sephora and Ulta.

Some reviewers even gripe that the serum works too well lengthening so extravagantly that their lashes bump into their glasses and invade their eyebrows. “If it works too well for you then good for you” says Grande. Sales of the product jumped by almost 40 percent in 2021. “My dream is for all women—I should say all people—to reach their full lash potential” says Grande.

As dreams go it’s a modest one for a small territory just 140 tiny hairs more or less per lid. The lash cycle continues the salmon spawn and on a remote island in Bristol Bay Alaska a moose blinks slowly its eyelashes dark and thick the inspiration for the next great beauty product.

Minorities are increasingly becoming privileged while growing numbers of white people face discrimination.

Diversity initiatives have been around for years but over the past year and a half innumerable companies and corporations have ramped up their efforts with the goal of “diversifying” their workforce. Tech giant Facebook for example has committed to half of its employees coming from “underrepresented communities” (i.e. black Native American and Hispanic) by 2023. Best Buy is hiring one person of color for every three new hires over the next five years. United Airlines has promised that at least half of the pilots they will train in the next decade will be women and “people of color” (currently only 13 percent of pilots are people of color).

In May Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot suddenly declared she will only give interviews to “journalists of color” — something that would be an impeachable offense if the situation was reversed (only giving interviews to “white journalists”).

The push to promote people of color has become so pervasive that the most objective scientific institutions have seemingly become captive to woke ideology. For example the NIH and CDC use taxpayer dollars to incentivize biomedical research labs to hire ethnic minorities because “research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams” — without quoting or citing any actual research.

Minorities are now even advantaged when seeking medical treatment. Last week the New York City and state departments of health authorized life-saving antiviral treatment for COVID-19 for everyone belonging to a “non-white race or Hispanic/Latino ethnicity” regardless of risk factors but for whites only those with risk factors are allowed it. The DOH cites its rationale as: “longstanding systemic health and social inequities have contributed to an increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.”

Meanwhile the rise of minority advantage has come with a parallel war on whiteness especially in academia. In June the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association — “one of the world’s most respected publications in psychoanalysis” — printed a peer-reviewed paper entitled “On Having Whiteness.” The abstract of the paper describes “whiteness” as a “malignant parasitic-like condition” requiring “effective treatment consist[ing] of a combination of psychic and social-historical interventions.” It adds “there is not yet a permanent cure.” There are real accredited university courses that instruct anti-white racism: “Race Theory & the Problem of Whiteness” (Arizona State University) and “Abolition of Whiteness” (Hunter College).

Institutionalized anti-white bigotry has escalated to genocidal rhetoric. As Bari Weiss revealed in her recent Substack piece Yale University hosted a lecture by Dr. Aruna Khilanani this year about the “The Psychopathic Problem of the White Mind” where the speaker revealed her fantasies to kill white people. Other than university administrators later saying the lecture was found to have “tone and content antithetical to the values of the school” the backlash was tempered. While social media erupted and Khilanani’s Manhattan-based practice is now closed for unknown reasons she still has her license. One can only imagine the riotous demonstrations that would have reverberated across the country had Yale hosted a talk about “The Psychopathic Problem of the Black Mind.”

The upshot is that pro-minority bias is not only permitted but socially incentivized. Employers professors and administrators are lauded for implementing radical diversity initiatives. As minorities are preferentially hired across the board and given a host of other benefits by way of their genetic lottery we must fundamentally reframe our discourse surrounding race relations.

While “white privilege” may still exist in some margins of society it no longer reflects the progressive era we live in.

Seven & i Holdings Co’s China-based convenience store business was fined for identifying Taiwan as an independent country on its Web site the latest crackdown by China against companies over its stance on disputed territories.

Seven & i operates the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores.

Fines of about 150000 yuan (US$23530) were imposed by the Beijing local authority against Seven & i a spokesman for the Japanese retailer said confirming an earlier report in the Nikkei newspaper.

Enterprises operating in China — from Gap Inc and Daimler AG to airlines including United Continental Holdings Inc and ANA Holdings Inc — have apologized or changed their Web sites after depicting Taiwan as a separate state. The companies usually comply accepting it as part of the cost of doing business in China.

Seven & i “is taking the issue seriously and making sure to prevent a recurrence” the company’s spokesman said.

Beijing’s municipal authorities last month issued the fine and a warning a government-linked credit information Web site showed. Seven & i also failed to use Chinese names for some South China Sea islands as well as for the disputed Diaoyu Islands (釣魚島) known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan and which are also claimed by Taiwan.

Hackers Mail Malicious USB Flash Drives to Spread Ransomware,"The FBI or the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation warned that hackers are sending malicious USB flash drive devices through mail to various US firms to spread ransomware and carry out cyberattacks.

FBI Warns That Hackers Sends Malicious USB Drives

Per the report by BleepingComputer the FBI issued a warning that the cybercriminal group that goes by the name FIN7 has been sending malicious packages to various companies which contain malware-spreading USB flash drives.

On top of that the FBI also revealed that the cybercriminal group pretends to be the US Department of Health & Human Services or the HHS and even the e-commerce tech giant Amazon to trick their ransomware targets into receiving the suspicious packages.

The US agency also found out that packages that the ransomware gang has been sending out to its targets even include a fake letter regarding the guidelines for COVID-19 from the HHS or online gift cards from Amazon.

According to the news story by The Record the FBI said in a statement that these incidents have been occurring since Aug. 2021.

The Bureau further said in the same statement that ""the FBI has received reports of several packages containing these USB devices sent to US businesses in the transportation insurance and defense industries.""

FBI added that the suspicious packages are being sent either via the United States Postal Service or the United Parcel Service.

USB Drives with Ransomware

Aside from the impersonation letters the package also contains a Lily Go USB flash drive which the FBI warned could install ransomware to the computers of its targets.

The Bureau further disclosed that the USB flash drives from the package would execute a BadUSB attack once it is plugged into the computer of the target.

The Record said in the same report that the BadUSB attack uses a thumb drive to install itself into a machine and pretend to be a keyboard device instead of a USB flash drive.

From there it could now carry out the cyberattack on a computer it is plugged into as it performs automated keystrokes.

It would then go on to download and install malware virus to the PC of the target which could then attack the whole network of the victim making it another successful ransomware attack.

The US agency went on to reveal that the BadUSB attack have been spreading two of the biggest ransomware out there namely BlackMatter and REvil to the network of its victim enterprises.

A few weeks later with the Omicron variant spreading fast it's even harder to know when that conversation should start.

But an unofficial debate about health care in Canada is already taking shape — between demands for more public funding on one side and calls for a ""greater role for private health care delivery"" on the other.

With the highly contagious Omicron variant and a sizeable population of unvaccinated Canadians threatening to swamp hospitals health care capacity is the concern of the moment.

Canada is hardly unique in that respect. Thousands of surgeries have been cancelled in the United Kingdom since the pandemic began. But the strain on the Canadian system was also foreseeable. In fact Frances Woolley an economist at Carleton University predicted that COVID-19 would expose the fragility of the system back in March 2020.

As Woolley wrote Canada has the second-lowest number of acute care beds per capita among nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and nearly all of those beds tend to be filled.

While the total number of acute care beds has declined broadly across advanced economies over the last 50 years as a result of changes in technology and care the especially low number in Canada can be traced to ""a failure of funding levels to keep up with population growth"" Woolley argued.

Danyaal Raza a family physician in Toronto and a former chair of Canadian Doctors for Medicare made a similar case last fall. He said that when it comes to health care costs Canadian governments are picking up a smaller share of the bill than governments in many of our peer countries.

The case for spending more

That's due in part to the fact that Canada's universal system doesn't include things like pharmacare and mental health. Raza argued it's also due to a lack of public investment.

While Trudeau has declined to engage with provincial demands for a substantial increase in the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) — the primary mechanism through which the federal government funds health services at the provincial level — the Liberals have proposed to deal with specific services.

Building on previous agreements to fund mental health services the Liberals promised last fall to create a dedicated Canada Mental Health Transfer with an ""initial investment"" of $4.5 billion over five years. The Liberal platform also promised $9 billion to improve long-term care and $3.2 billion to help provinces and territories hire new doctors and nurses.

Lingering somewhere in the background is an outstanding federal commitment to expanding pharmacare. Ottawa signed its first (and so far only) agreement to improve drug coverage with Prince Edward Island last August.

But the provinces have been demanding much more than that — an immediate increase of up to $28 billion in the CHT the dedicated fund for hospitals and doctors that gives provincial governments money they can spend as they see fit.

Promises without price tags

In that year-end interview Trudeau contended that the support the federal government has provided to the provinces during the pandemic — which includes a $4-billion ""top-up"" to the CHT this year — proved that ""yes the federal government is absolutely willing to step up on more health care. How much and what it looks like and what is needed well those are really important conversations to have.""

Those conversations will pose big questions that need answers.

In the last election Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole proposed to increase the CHT at an annual rate of six per cent for at least the next ten years. He didn't account for what that would mean for the federal budget in the long term. The Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy warned such an increase might ""require significant reductions to other spending measures or increases in revenue measures to maintain fiscal sustainability.""

Back at the start of the pandemic Woolley argued the federal government was best positioned to shoulder the burden of increased investment. She also suggested the GST could be raised by two points to pay for it.

That option might seem politically untenable. But while Raza said Canada needs to be ""smarter"" about its health spending he also argued that the public system faces not a cost problem but a revenue problem driven by lower taxes on corporations and the richest Canadians.

The public-private debate ramps up again

Greg Marchildon executive director of the last royal commission on health care in Canada suggests that rather than increasing the CHT the federal government should focus on pharmacare and long-term care which would help cover heavy costs currently being carried by the provinces.

But Sean Speer a former senior policy adviser to Stephen Harper wrote this week that 2022 should be the year Canadians face up to the shortcomings in the health care system and consider a greater role for private delivery.

Such talk might revive a debate that played out clumsily during the last election.

Though it was almost completely lost in the tempest over the editing of a video posted by Chrystia Freeland there was a real point of disagreement between the Liberals and Conservatives over private health services.

Arguing that access to care should not depend on the ability to pay the Liberal government has threatened to withhold CHT funding from Saskatchewan in response to a program in the province that allows residents to pay for MRI scans from for-profit clinics so long as those clinics provide an equal number of scans to people on the provincial waiting list. The Liberals made similar threats in 2016 in response to user fees charged by the Quebec government.

But O'Toole has said he would support ""innovations"" like Saskatchewan's program that offer Canadians ""more choice"" — a notion that while debatable might appeal to Canadians frustrated with the public system.

""I think the thing that creates these discussions [about privatization] is when we under-invest in these public universal systems that we know are the most equitable way to deliver care"" Raza said in an interview this week.

Most prime ministers might be unwilling to transfer a lot more money to the provinces without some assurances that the money will be well spent.

But if the Liberal government wants to forestall those angling for private ""innovation"" it might need to ante up. And then if necessary make the case that the cost is worth it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiIWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvMTY2ODM3ONIBJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvYW1wLzE2NjgzNzg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HEALTH: THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE,"Globally governments are being urged to come up with strategies to expand affordable and quality healthcare to their populations under the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for health. As a signatory to the UN 2030 Agenda Pakistan has committed to moving towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) the upfront global target for all countries under the UN which includes the full spectrum of essential quality health services from health promotion to prevention treatment rehabilitation and palliative care across the life course.

Pakistan has a large private health sector which is very much entrenched in the DNA of the country’s health system. Overstretched government delivery systems because of increasing population and inadequately staffed and stocked government facilities have led to private providers filling the service gaps for the affluent the poor and the struggling middle class alike.

But can private-sector engagement deliver effective results? And how best can the private sector be engaged for affordable quality healthcare? This needs to be unravelled before blindly embracing public-private partnerships.

National surveys show that more than 70 percent of health consultations take place in the private sector and more than 90 percent of total clinics/ first-level care facilities are in the private sector as per official mapping studies.

Another area where private health providers have made deep inroads is laboratories and diagnostic imaging (X-Ray ultrasound MRI CT-Scan). More than 60 percent of registered laboratories are managed by the private sector. Hospital services are still largely catered by the public sector particularly for the underprivileged: only one-fifth of the country’s hospital beds are in the private sector while the rest are catered by the public sector’s teaching hospitals civil / district hospitals parastatal hospitals and military-run hospitals.

What lessons can be learnt from existing public-private partnerships for primary healthcare provision?

A reasonable starting point then for engaging private providers is primary health care — engaging clinics and diagnostic facilities to expand accessible affordable care. This is where Pakistan’s government infrastructure is thin and private providers are the main recourse for much of the population.

The problem is highly acute in Pakistan’s expanding cities and town centres in the rural districts which bear the onslaught of population growth but the government’s pre-colonial health infrastructure comprises hospitals that have an almost non-existent network of primary health centres.

But how have we dealt with this? Successive policymakers have emphasised investment in hospitals — hospitals are big visible and win votes. Government budgets continue to tilt towards hospital spending and successive health insurance initiatives over the last decade have focused exclusively on in-patient hospital care.

The problem is that unless affordable primary health care with diagnostic services is made accessible to the poor and less affluent groups basic health issues will continue to complicate and land the population into hospitals — for example simple hypertension left unmanaged at the primary-care level leads to kidney failure undetected diabetes leads to stroke hepatitis-C unscreened at the primary care level leads to liver failure.

A sparse network of affordable primary care outlets leads to a bucket of problems — unnecessary overcrowding of hospitals strained government resources for free hospital care and a burden on the pockets of those paying for care. In short a leaky bucket of public expenditure and arguably little health gains as many health issues could have been avoided.

This brings us to the next question: Can state funding of private providers deliver effective results for primary health services to the poor?

ASSESSING EXISTING INITIATIVES

Pakistan does have some examples to provide initial lessons.

One noticeable example is Sindh’s public-private initiative for primary healthcare whereby private providers have been brought in to manage several government-run primary care health facilities to improve delivery of services.

The services are provided free of cost and are guided by the Sindh government’s Essential Health Services Package which was developed during the early days of devolution under the 18th Amendment. Since the primary health facilities are based in rural areas it can arguably be seen to benefit the disadvantaged and the poor.

National surveys show that more than 70 percent of health consultations take place in the private sector and more than 90 percent of total clinics/ first-level care facilities are in the private sector

Our recent performance assessment shows promising results and identifies opportunities for maximising health gains. Visible improvements over government-managed facilities are cleanliness clinical waste disposal electricity back-up fewer stock-outs of medicines availability of essential equipment and health guidelines for patient care. This has resulted in high volumes of outpatient consultations pregnancy care visits and maternal deliveries verified by independent assessors.

There is still room for improvement in other areas. For example family planning provision for maternity clients or disease screening of adults turning up in OPDs for hypertension diabetes hepatitis etc. by providing disease control targets and building up government capacity for monitoring.

There have also been challenges in delivery. One challenge is ensuring staffing as staff on government payroll does not always comply to serve in rural areas with private providers hiring contractual staff to cover staff shortfalls. Another area is to meet the demand of the rising patient volumes with the available health facility resources — a common challenge seen when responding to the unmet needs of the poor.

An earlier countrywide initiative the President’s Primary Healthcare Initiative grew from an innovative pilot in district Lodhran Punjab funded by a private provider to manage government-run Basic Health Units from 2008-2012. This too revealed promising results: well maintained and better equipped facilities with higher outpatient and maternity volumes although less impact on immunisation and family planning services was recorded.

Going back a little further in the era of district devolution there were also small-scale instances of district governments funding medical charities. A prominent example is from Battagram in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where a number of public-sector health facilities debilitated by the 2005 earthquake were contracted to a non-governmental organisation (NGO) with reportedly positive results in medicine supplies staffing and patient numbers.

In Sindh the private-sector engagement initiative has more mature design features compared to the older initiatives in Pakistan such as more formal contracts based on a defined Essential Health Services Package at least some level of target-setting competitive selection of private health providers rather than a selective single NGO of choice and legal frameworks drawn from a larger public-private partnership initiative across sectors.

Many private providers are wary of entering monetary arrangements with the government as commercial gains can be made without recourse to state funds

In all the instances cited above whether originating from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Punjab or Sindh the premise has been the same — pulling in private providers at government health facilities to ensure at minimum the availability of services and at best deliver higher quality services.

So where do we go from here?

Current and past initiatives provide encouraging proof that government funding to private providers for service delivery in poor and disadvantaged areas can work in Pakistan. But to fulfil the UHC 2030 criteria much more needs to be done and more strategically.

Government health facilities even if running at 100 percent capacity through private provider arrangements cannot be sufficient to meet the health service needs of our overpopulated country. Setting up more state-funded infrastructure is time-consuming more costly and the effort can be duplicative with both public and private providers competing for the same patients.

Government primary health outlets — dispensaries basic health units rural health centres — must be supplemented through the funding of existing private provider networks of clinics polyclinics laboratories and maternity homes etc. for basic minimum services to the poor at free or subsidised rates. These can serve as stand-alone primary health care initiatives to supplement the government’s own infrastructure or they can be attached to existing hospital-focused insurance schemes.

In developing countries with an entrenched private health sector similar to Pakistan for example Egypt and Iran state-funded family practices have been set up with private clinics and NGOs to provide a basic package of curative care and disease prevention services in defined localities.

The family practices also act as gatekeepers for referrals to hospital insurance reducing unnecessary and expensive hospital overuse. In India maternity services have been expanded for the poor with state funding to private-sector maternity homes and clinics. A prominent example from a developed country setting is from the United Kingdom where neighbourhood general practitioner clinics are contracted and funded as part of the National Health Services and regulated for quality of care.

The penny needs to drop in Pakistan’s policy corridors that more funding commitment is required for affordable and accessible primary care services purchasing — inevitably but cautiously — from private health providers. Research from the Pakistan context also provides useful pointers to support a more strategic rollout of public-private partnerships.

STEP BY STEP

First professionally licensed private provider clinics and laboratories are amply seen in urban centres and towns which can serve as reasonable starting points rather than remote areas where the so-called private sector comprises mostly unlicensed providers or quacks practising as doctors.

Second private providers tend to overlook preventive care services such as screening for basic diseases nutrition counselling and family planning unless they are given quality leadership.

Third sustainable financing is critical as private providers lose interest and exit public-private arrangements when there are cash flow problems and delayed financial releases. Typically in Pakistan contracts with private providers financed from recurrent budgets have flowed more smoothly than when financed from slow-moving development funds.

Fourth the motivations of private providers to make public-private engagement work need to be understood for them to really work. Many private providers are wary of entering monetary arrangements with the government as commercial gains can be made without recourse to state funds. While the Covid experience successfully brought in several highly professional private laboratories to report testing for the government many private providers preferred to confine this to data-sharing arrangements and in-kind support for PCR kits.

Large private providers when questioned emphasise the importance of trust and goodwill within the government as the main factor for entering into partnership agreements for service provision. Public recognition also matters such as for example that gained from operating well-functioning paediatric emergencies within public-sector hospitals.

Smaller private providers report that the opportunity for training accreditation and positive branding are the pull factors for potential partnership arrangements. This will enhance local standing and lead to self-development. Smaller private providers also prefer to partner under the umbrella of medical universities medical charities and NGOs rather than directly with the state.

It is time to have a national strategy for moving towards primary health care under UHC; the hospital-centric focus is too limiting for health gains and too expensive to fulfil the unmet need for basic care. Sustainable funding realistic service packages defined pro-poor geographies some extent of quality regulation by the government and creating communication platforms will be key ingredients.

The starting points and pathways for engaging private providers with state funds can differ across provinces under common national goals. Above all evolving experience from Pakistan and other countries shows that there is no perfect model of public-private arrangements and that patience and persistence is required.

By Vineet Aggarwal Numerous advances in technology are happening right in front of us almost on a regular basis reshaping all industries. The healthcare sector is one such example where technology is connecting the dots in the health system as well as narrowing the gap between the private and public sector to remain focused on the single vision of better healthcare delivery to the population of the country.The Indian healthcare system has undergone one of the biggest changes by incorporating the use of technology to gather data and make it more accessible and usable. By using digital apps and wearable devices data is being uploaded securely on cloud platforms so that clinical trial patients can participate directly from home without the need to travel to study sites. Also many healthcare providers are adopting the use of telemedicine to make healthcare more accessible to people especially those residing in remote parts of the country. For digital healthcare to succeed the government also recently launched the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission that will provide Health ID to people that will contain their health records. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the use of digital technology that allowed public and private health providers to reinvent service delivery and revise policy collaborate across sectors to introduce innovative approaches and ensure access to care even during these pressing times. With so much to offer and change technology will continue to play the role of an enabler ushering in a digital revolution for the country’s healthcare sector.Scaling up of the healthcare system of the country is one of the top priorities of the Indian government at the moment. This is reflective of this year’s budget allocation for health which was increased to INR 223846 crore in 2021-22 a 137% increase over the previous year. The government is trying to improve public health delivery and huge ongoing investments are being made in infrastructure. Between 2000 and 2014 there was a 370 per cent increase in health expenditure. As healthcare transformation continues to be a critical priority for both the government and private organizations the adoption of technology can be utilised to address the specific challenges faced in the country. Here are some of the primary healthcare problems that technology can solve for a better and healthier world:If India is to realise its goal of universal health coverage (UHC) it is imperative that technology and healthcare talk to each other seamlessly. Here’s how technology can be the backbone of growth for the healthcare industry in the years to come:While there's no doubt that a digitally transformed healthcare system will help ensure a patient-focused approach helping healthcare providers to streamline their operations and build loyalty and trust amongst their patients but it's equally important to keep a close watch on patient data security. The healthcare sector deals with sensitive patient information. Offering adequate data security to a large number of connected devices is challenging. Most IoT devices are vulnerable to cyber-attacks as they do not offer encrypted communication. The impact of a breach is too high as patients trust these devices and are dependent on them for their life.Artificial Intelligence (AI) is commonly defined as the capability of devices to learn on their own without an explicit program and act on the information gathered cognitively. The applicability of AI in health sciences is being enhanced on a regular basis to use it at the very core of the healthcare industry. According to PwC’s 2017 Global Digital IQ Survey 31 per cent of the global healthcare executives interviewed rate AI as the most disruptive tech in the industry. AI applications are being developed to digitally represent the physiology of a patient thereby enabling simulations to predict the likely progression of chronic diseases in the future based on choices made today. These simulations assist hospitals pharmaceutical providers researchers and insurance providers to better understand choices and therapeutics and their implications for patient’s health outcomes and impact on associated costs.In India around 50% of women who are diagnosed with breast cancer die within half a decade. There is a lack of adequate facilities and specialised radiographers. The cost of breast cancer screening is also very high which makes it unaffordable for most of the population in the country. AI-based cancer screening using machine intelligence over thermographic images has been utilised to develop to a low-cost easy to operate portable solution to detect breast cancer that too at a much earlier stage in comparison to traditional diagnostic methods. This can provide a great level of improvement in survival rates. Also based on the symptoms a patient might be having and comparing them with a library of symptoms AI is helping physicians save time for medical cases which might require immediate attention. When machines start doing simple tasks people can work at a higher cognitive level—and the need to work 24/7 reduces.Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) refers to the worldwide network of interconnected medical devices and applications. The Indian healthcare sector stands to gain significantly from this technology with its application in both clinical as well as non-clinical scenarios. Here’s how:In-Patient CareIn-patient continuous monitoring of patients whose conditions require vital signs to be monitored more regularly can alert doctors of patient health deterioration leading to quicker recovery and lower cost of treatment. For example post operation patintes and those with chronic diseases require continuous monitoring; however a small nurse to patient ratio in ICUs may lead to complications and/or death as patients’ vitals may change tremendously over a short amount of time. Continuous monitoring would transmit data about patients to nurses continuously allowing for earlier detection recognition and treatment of any abnormalities in a patient’s condition.Personal Emergency Response SystemsSeveral products are already well established and serve many needs of seniors inside and outside of their residences such as fall detection emergency assistance and navigation guidance back to residence (for dementia patients for example) or even boundary perimeter breach alerts (for Alzheimer’s patients for example). Some products even include additional features such as medication reminders.Smart Senior HomesCare staff can monitor seniors with the use of wrist-worn wearables that track their location as well as activities performed (such as bathing walking sleeping etc.). Wearables allow seniors to request assistance with the touch of one button and will soon also provide two-way audio communication with care staff.Blockchain has plenty of applications and uses in healthcare. The ledger technology assists in the secure transfer of patient medical records manages the medicine supply chain and helps researchers unlock genetic code. Keeping important medical data secure is the most preferred blockchain healthcare application at the moment. Security is a major issue in the healthcare industry. Between 2009 and 2017 more than 176 million records of patients were exposed in data breaches. Blockchain's has the ability to keep a decentralized incorruptible and transparent log of all patient data makes it a technology ideal for security applications. On top of that while blockchain is transparent it is also private concealing the identity of any individual with complex and secure codes that can protect the sensitivity of medical data. Estonia began using blockchain technology in 2012 to secure healthcare data and process transactions. Now the country's entire healthcare billing is handled on a blockchain.Robotics Process AutomationThe RPA solutions prevalent in the healthcare industry can be described as software that orchestrates other applications and performs tedious back-office tasks on its own thus freeing healthcare workers’ time for diagnostic work and meaningful doctor-patient interactions. In particular intelligent software agents are good at processing transactions manipulating data triggering responses and conversing with internal and external IT systems.Thus from operations in different healthcare organizations to manufacturers of pharmaceuticals technology is going to play a key role in organizing processes and making healthcare more accessible. Interoperability and data sharing are going to become increasingly critical for delivering effective healthcare with an ageing population and people living longer. In addition to helping physicians and other healthcare providers see a more complete view of their patients health data interoperability can help organizations across the healthcare industry. If health information systems are more integrated then health plans would be able to develop a better understanding of their utilization rates and demand for services. Government service providers would be able to access population data to see trends and meet their citizens’ needs. Also life science organizations would be able to leverage robust datasets to drive faster more informed research.By Vineet Aggarwal CIO Paras Healthcare(DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETHealthworld does not necessarily subscribe to it.

Esta vez no hubo cierres en concesionarios ni fábricas detenidas a causa de la crisis sanitaria pero sí una escasez de semiconductores que azotó la producción a nivel global e impactó en las ventas dando como resultado una recuperación lenta y movimientos importantes en el ranking de los autos más vendidos de México.

La popularidad pasó a segundo plano durante 2021. El volumen de ventas de cada modelo estuvo condicionado por disponibilidad de inventario en concesionarios. Los consumidores buscaron alternativas cuando se encontraron largas listas de espera —que podrían durar meses— al preguntar por el auto que inicialmente tenían en mente.

El Nissan Versa se mantiene como el auto más vendido de México con casi 70000 unidades seguido por Nissan NP300 y Chevrolet Aveo. En el top 10 de 2021 entraron tres nuevos modelos: Toyota Hilux KIA Forte y KIA Seltos en reemplazo a Beat Notchback Onix y Jetta que abandonaron su posición en la lista por falta de producción o salida del mercado.

Si analizamos a los líderes por segmento entre las categorías más importantes de México encontraremos que el Nissan Sentra se convierte en el sedán compacto más vendido mientras KIA Seltos mantiene su liderazgo como el SUV más popular de nuestro país. En la categoría de los SUV compactos el Toyota RAV4 se coloca como líder por encima de CR-V y de Taos.

En el mercado de los hatchbacks el Nissan March se quedó la delantera en el segmento de los urbanos durante 2021. Entre los subcompactos el SEAT Ibiza recupera el liderazgo de la categoría y rebasa a KIA Rio y Suzuki Swift. En el mercado de los compactos el Mazda3 Hatchback se coloca como el más vendido con una notable diferencia por encima de Forte y León.

Algunos de los lanzamientos más recientes del mercado ya reportan un volumen interesante de ventas como Chevrolet Groove que en pocos meses logró vender 2919 unidades. También encontraremos 847 unidades de Ford Maverick 788 de Toyota Raize 245 de Volkswagen Nivus y 316 de Toyota Corolla Cross.

Ahora bien en la pequeña categoría de autos eléctricos el modelo más vendido —y que curiosamente no aparece anunciado en la página web de su fabricante— es el JAC E J7 con 93 unidades seguido por JAC E 10X y la versión eléctrica del MINI Cooper.

UU. serán autos ecológicos para 2030 | AGENCIA DE NOTICIAS ...,"Seúl 9 de enero (Yonhap) -- Hyundai Motor Co. aspira a que la mitad de sus ventas de vehículos en Estados Unidos sean modelos ecológicos para 2030 mientras planea producir vehículos eléctricos en el mercado automovilístico más importante del mundo dijo el miércoles (hora estadounidense) el director de operaciones globales de la firma el español José Antonio Muñoz Barceló.

Muñoz realizó los comentarios en una entrevista con un grupo de reporteros surcoreanos al margen del Salón de Electrodomésticos (CES según sus siglas en inglés) 2022 que se llevó a cabo en la ciudad estadounidense de Las Vegas.

Agregó que el fabricante de automóviles surcoreano está totalmente preparado para aumentar la proporción de vehículos ecológicos en sus ventas en EE. UU. al 40-50 por ciento en los ocho próximos años dado que ahora está equipado con una cartera bien diversificada y competitividad de productos.

El director de operaciones eligió como factores clave que impulsaron las ventas en Estados Unidos la línea de vehículos utilitarios deportivos (SUV) fortalecida de Hyundai la rápida incorporación de modelos eléctricos a su línea y su imagen mejorada como fabricante de automóviles de gama alta a través de la marca Genesis.

Muñoz señaló que el 65 por ciento de las ventas de Hyundai en el mercado estadounidense -en donde está aumentando la demanda de SUV- son de este tipo de vehículos compuestos por los modelos SUV Tucson Santa Fe y Santa Cruz de la firma.

La demanda de sus modelos totalmente eléctricos (VE) híbridos enchufables e híbridos de gasolina también ha aumentado en los últimos años alcanzando rápidamente a sus rivales más grandes como BMW Audi y Lexus en términos del ritmo de crecimiento.

Los modelos de cero emisiones y de menos emisiones de carbono representan alrededor del 10 por ciento de las ventas totales de Hyundai en EE. UU. pero se espera que la proporción aumente con el tiempo.

Hyundai planea lanzar este año para los consumidores estadounidenses vehículos eléctricos con la insignia IONIQ específica para VE.

En cuanto a la producción de VE en EE. UU. el ejecutivo mencionó como sitios de producción de este tipo de vehículos tanto la planta de Hyundai en Alabama como la planta de Kia en Georgia.

El Grupo Hyundai Motor anunció el año pasado que invertirá 8 billones de wones (7.400 millones de dólares) en EE. UU. para 2025 y que las inversiones planeadas cubrirán las efectuadas en la empresa emergente Boston Dynamics -con sede en EE. UU.- la movilidad aérea urbana y la producción de VE en el país norteamericano dijo Muñoz.

En cuanto a los mayores desafíos que se avecinan en el mercado estadounidense dijo que la falta de piezas de semiconductores y los problemas de logística seguirán siendo este año las principales preocupaciones de la industria automotriz.

Citando el último logro de Hyundai en EE. UU. dijo que la firma ha vencido a Honda Motor Co. en términos de reconocimiento de marca y se encuentra justo por detrás de Toyota Motors Corp. entre los fabricantes de automóviles asiáticos.

Hyundai y Kia vencieron a Honda en 2021 vendiendo un total combinado de 149 millones de vehículos en EE. UU. y se espera que vendan más de 15 millones de automóviles este año impulsados por los nuevos modelos.

Hyundai tiene como objetivo vender este año 432 millones de automóviles en todo el mundo un 11 por ciento más que los 389 millones de unidades vendidas el año pasado.

(CNN) -- El streaming ha dominado la industria de la música durante años pero en 2021 se registró un aumento notable en las ventas de álbumes físicos gracias en parte al éxito del más reciente álbum de Adele.

Tanto los CD como los vinilos experimentaron altas ventas en 2021 según un informe anual de datos musicales de fin de año de MRC Data publicado esta semana.

El resurgimiento del vinilo en la cultura ha sido nada menos que un cohete. En 2011 el vinilo solo representó el 17% de las ventas físicas de música y los CD el resto. En solo 10 años ese número aumentó al 504% lo que significa que los vinilos ahora han superado a los CD como el formato físico más vendido por primera vez desde 1991 informó MRC.

""En los últimos años noté que los clientes prefieren poseer música físicamente además del streaming generalmente en su mejor forma (vinilo)"" dijo Tobago Benito propietario de la tienda de discos DBS Sounds en el resumen de datos de MRC.

Él atribuye eso tanto a la inclusión de tocadiscos en películas y televisión como a la alegría que la gente obtiene al buscar cierto vinilo en una tienda de discos uno que puede ""traer recuerdos maravillosos"" afirmó.

El incremento en las ventas de vinilos también es un salto significativo con respecto a hace solo un año en 2020 cuando los vinilos representaron 275 millones de ventas de música física aproximadamente el 40% de todas las ventas totales. Representar ahora casi la mitad de las ventas totales es significativo.

Parte del éxito de este año podría ser el lanzamiento de ""30"" el primer álbum de Adele en seis años. En vinilo ""30"" vendió 108.000 copias en su primera semana la segunda semana de ventas de vinilo más grande desde 1991 cuando MRC Data comenzó a rastrear dichas ventas. El álbum fue el más vendido en vinilo este año seguido por la reedición de ""Sour"" de Olivia Rodrigo y ""Red"" de Taylor Swift.

Parte de esto informó MRC tiene que ver con el éxito del Record Store Day una popular promoción que tiene lugar en la primavera. Las ventas de nuevos lanzamientos y reediciones han crecido en Record Store Day desde 2011 dijo MRC impulsadas por la participación de artistas populares.

""Desde Metallica dando credibilidad a RSD (y por extensión discos / tiendas de discos) a través de su lanzamiento de RSD hace una década hasta Taylor Swift que puso en primer plano las ediciones en vinilo de sus lanzamientos recientes no como una ocurrencia tardía sino como una parte importante de su lanzamiento"" dijo Carl Mello director de compromiso de marca de Newbury Comics en un comunicado.

Pero una sorpresa con respecto al año pasado fue el repunte de las ventas de CD en Estados Unidos que aumentó un 11% de 402 millones de ventas en 2020 a 406 millones en 2021. Las ventas de CD han disminuido constantemente durante años por lo que el hecho de que no disminuyeron activamente el año pasado podría ser significativo.

Una de las razones del aumento en las ventas fue el lanzamiento de ""30"" de Adele y ""Red (Taylor's Version)"" de Taylor Swift.

La versión en CD de Target de ""30"" que contenía tres pistas extra ayudó a que la versión en CD del álbum vendiera 378.000 copias en su primera semana la semana de mayor venta de CD de 2021 dijo MRC. Solo una semana antes ""Red (Taylor's Version)"" vendió 146.700 copias.

No está claro si este minúsculo aumento significa que los CD están en ascenso pero podría indicar un ligero cambio para aquellos que todavía se aferran al medio.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZXMubW90b3IxLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU1ODg0MC90b3lvdGEtc3VwZXJhLWdtLXZlbnRhcy1lZXV1L9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vZXMubW90b3IxLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU1ODg0MC90b3lvdGEtc3VwZXJhLWdtLXZlbnRhcy1lZXV1L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toyota adelanta a General Motors en ventas en Estados Unidos,"El mayor fabricante de automóviles del mundo Toyota acaba de convertirse en 2021 en el número uno del mercado de Estados Unidos por primera vez en su historia y por delante de cualquier firma de origen estadounidense.

De hecho es la primera vez en 90 años que el gigante norteamericano General Motors no se corona como el líder en volumen de ventas de automóviles en su propio país en parte debido a todos los problemas que han azotado a la industria durante el último año.

Así pues Toyota ha logrado comercializar 2.332.263 coches en Estados Unidos durante el año 2021 lo que supone un incremento del 104% frente a 2020 mientras que General Motors ha sumado 2.218.228 ejemplares un 129% menos que el año previo.

El producto más vendido de la marca japonesa en Estados Unidos ha sido el Toyota RAV4 con 430.387 unidades lo que supone un 1845% de sus ventas en el país si bien esta cifra representa una caída del 53% con respecto al año 2020.

Por su parte el modelo más vendido de todas las marcas de General Motors ha sido por supuesto un pick-up. En concreto el Chevrolet Silverado con un total de 380.715 coches o un 127% menos que en 2020. Si añadimos también los Silverado 'medium duty' y 'heavy duty' hablamos de 529.765 vehículos (108% menos que el año previo).

""Toyota está agradecida a sus clientes fieles por poner su confianza y su seguridad en manos de vehículos Toyota y Lexus. Ser el número uno nunca es un objetivo o prioridad. El foco de la compañía siempre ha sido ser la mejor marca en cuanto a seguridad calidad y valor en las mentes de los clientes"" ha afirmado a Automotive News Jack Hollis vicepresidente de operaciones de Toyota Motor Norteamérica.

Tanto General Motors como Toyota se han enfrentado a los problemas en la cadena de suministros y sobre todo a la crisis mundial de semiconductores que ha obligado a muchas marcas a detener su producción o a prescindir de ciertos elementos de equipamiento en sus vehículos para poder seguir con su fabricación.

De hecho Toyota detuvo algunas de sus fábricas y redujo su producción global de automóviles en 360.000 unidades mientras que General Motors también tuvo que parar la producción aunque no sabemos qué número de automóviles dejó de fabricar.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vY2FkaXouY29zYXNkZWNvbWUuZXMvbGFzLTMwLXZlbnRhcy1ndWVuYXMtZ3VlbmFzLWxhLXByb3ZpbmNpYS1jYWRpei_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las mejores ventas de Cádiz,"Sierra La Janda Campo de Gibraltar Bahía de Cádiz…las hay por todas las comarcas. Actualizada en 2022

Hoy es un buen día para ir de ventas…bueno siempre es un buen momento para visitar estos templos del buen comer de la provincia. Así que aqui tienes un listado de las mejores de la provincia según la selección de Cosasdecome. Elige la que más te guste. Pulsando sobre cada una de ellas obtendrás todos los detalles del sitio:

Si quieres ver completa la guía de las ventas de la provincia de Cádiz clasificada por ciudades pincha aquí.

Si quieres que te contemos como hemos hecho esta guía y algunas cursiladas más sigue leyendo

A modo de explicación

Dicen los cazadores de tendencias esos tíos que están pensando que será lo próximo que le va a gustar a la gente que los que son de comé vuelven a lo auténtico que huyen de la sofisticación para encontrarse con lo esencial con la materia prima de máxima calidad servida sin pamplinas…nos pareció por tanto un buen momento para hacer una guía de las ventas de la provincia de Cádiz el máximo exponente de “lo auténtico” por aquí.

Nuestra idea es dar respuesta a esta pregunta del fin de semana de ¿a dónde vamos hoy? Aqui encontrará sitios donde ir…mejor dicho encontrará excusas parar en una venta para descubrir el Cádiz rural el de carretera un Cádiz que da muchas emociones. No lo decimos por decir la realización de esta guía nos ha permitido disfrutar además de mojar pan en salsas pa tirarse de cabeza de sitios inigualables carreteras de quedarte con la boca abierta paisajes que te obligan a parar el coche.

Pero hacer esta guía ha sido muy divertido pero también ha sido dificil hacer la selección. No hemos querido hacer una enumeración de sitios hemos querido facilitaros la tarea daros los nombres de locales que por alguna razón merecen una visita…dos o tres.

Nuestra primera pregunta para hacer la selección fue de estas filosóficas de las que te tienes que hacer delante de una copa de oloroso de Jerez. Primero nos releimos por enésima vez la obra maestra sobre las ventas de Cádiz “Cádiz Venta a Venta” un libro que elaboró Elena Posa para la Diputacion de Cádiz en 1999 y al que de una manera muy modesta también queremos rendir homenaje con este trabajo.

Bueno a lo que vamos…¿Qué es una venta?

No nos vamos a enrollar a contaros la historia y todo eso para estas cosas está Google. Las características que hemos mirado para seleccionar son las siguientes:

Qué esté junto a una carretera y tenga su aparcamiento.

Qué se llamen ventas (vale también venta con apellido como venta restaurante venta asador o venta mesón…no vale venta gastrobar o venta tapería).

Qué ofrezca desayunos

Qué también tenga además de servicio de restaurante o bar venta de productos

Qué su cocina está basada en los productos locales

Todos los establecimientos que salen tienen al menos tres de estas características.

¿Cómo las hemos clasificado?

La guía se organiza en torno a un mapa de la provincia la mar de bonito por cierto y con fondo “en colorao” en homenaje a las salsas “entomatás” una de las habituales de las ventas. En el mapa se puede seleccionar la ciudad que se desee consultar. Al pulsar sobre cada población salen las ventas seleccionadas en ella divididas en dos clases: Las “güenas güenas” y “las que tienen su puntito”. Las primeras son las ventas que rozan la perfección o incluso alguna de ellas la consigue. Se come muy bien y además el sitio tiene encanto. Las otras que hemos puesto son algunas que destacan por algo en concreto bien por su gastronomía por sus precios por sus desayunos por sus vistas o porque tienen una exposición de calabazas gigantes…que la hay…y no te voy a decir donde está.

La guía tiene dos características. La primera como siempre es que está abierta a vuestra opinión. En todas las fichas de las poblaciones hay un espacio para que podais poner vuestras opiniones…si hay alguna venta que falte o sobra nos conteis experiencias venteras o nos digais donde habeis comido un potaje de garbanzos para cubrirlo de besitos.

La segunda característica es que es una guía en continua actualización por lo que irá cambiando en función de nuevas aperturas cosas que vosotros vayais aportando o porque algún establecimiento mejore o empeore.

En total salen unos 140 establecimientos el número va cambiando. Los términos municipales con más ventas destacables son Jerez y Vejer. Hay algunas poblaciones donde no hemos encontrado ninguna venta que nos haya parecido interesante (probablemente por torpeza porque las habrá).

The Domains business is its legacy core business and makes up approximately 45% of the company's revenue and has been growing by 12.7% per year. This business was traditionally the domain registrar business where a customer pays GoDaddy a yearly fee for their domain. The actual .com and .net domains are owned by Verisign through an agreement with the government and GoDaddy pays a pass-through fee to Verisign for .com and .net URLs. However no pass through fee is paid on other extensions like .nyc .co or .biz. so GoDaddy can keep all of this revenue. The Domains business has also been augmented by an aftermarket business in which users can buy and sell domains and GoDaddy takes a piece of the transaction. GoDaddy is by far the leader in Domains with approximately 20 million customers and on a .com basis they have as many domains registered on GoDaddy as the next 10 competitors combined. The Hosting and Presence segment makes up approximately 35% of the company's revenue and is comprised of two businesses one that hosts servers for clients and one that is a website builder. This business was completely rebuilt in recent years and has approximately $400 million in annual recurring revenue through its subscription products and has been growing by 12.3% per year with 17% growth in the most recent quarter. The Business Applications segment makes up 20% of GoDaddy's revenue. This business is comprised of homegrown applications such as security e-mail marketing and other productivity tools for small businesses and a Microsoft 365 reseller. The Business Applications segments has been growing by 22.5% per year and continues to have opportunities to gain market share.

Activist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. The firm also has a successful track record in the information technology sector. In 45 prior engagements it has a return of 42.25% versus 17.69% for the S&P 500 over the same period.

As we often see with Starboard investments there are a few different paths to win here and in this situation it is centered around finding the right balance between growth and profitability. Over the past few years the company has been investing for growth but the market is not convinced that this strategy is working. If the investment pays off and GoDaddy can show itself to be a growth company with credible and sustainable growth in the low teens the multiple and stock price should re-rate creating material value for shareholders.

If the sustainable growth is not there the company can focus on the second opportunity which is margin improvement. Since they are spending money on investing for growth they have EBITDA margins in the mid-teens while their peers are above 30. With their scale and product mix they could achieve margins higher than peers.

There is also a capital allocation opportunity. Over the past 6 to 7 years the company has made approximately 30 acquisitions. There is an opportunity to have more disciplined M&A and return capital to shareholders. While share buybacks on their own are not a respectable long-term activist strategy in conjunction with long-term value-creating strategies this is a good way to create additional shareholder value by buying back stock before the operational improvements set in.

These three strategies are not mutually exclusive nor black and white. The key is to have the right mix of growth and profitability and that is something that needs constant attention as it is fluid and can change from year to year or quarter to quarter when a company is at this point in its life cycle. There is a rule of 40 for software companies: Growth rate and margins should equal or exceed 40%. That rule is not technically applicable to a company like GoDaddy but at the very least it is analogous. GoDaddy should be working to have growth plus margins exceed 40%.

Starboard has extensive experience in helping companies optimize growth and margins from a board level. The board does not currently have a shareholder representative on the board. However it still has a KKR and Silver Lake director from when the two funds took the company private in 2011 and back public in 2015 even though neither fund still owns one share of the company. GoDaddy could benefit greatly from a true shareholder director particularly one with a public market perspective like Starboard's. The window for Starboard to nominate directors is between Feb. 2 and March 4 2022. Starboard has a month to work with the company on an agreement to add directors and if an agreement is not reached by then we expect Starboard to nominate directors.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor an institutional research service on shareholder activism and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments. GoDaddy is owned in the fund.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The deal will restore access to WVEC the Hampton-licensed ABC affiliate Tegna spokesperson Anne Bentley said in an email.

Bentley said WVEC would return to Hampton Roads’ channel listings.

WVEC went dark to local customers Tuesday evening after Verizon’s agreement with station owner Tegna expired.

Verizon spokesperson Chris Serico said in an email the company was disappointed.

“Unfortunately Tegna has a reputation for this type of practice with providers which ultimately results in viewers losing out on their content” Serico said.

Other affected channels included a CBS station in Washington; a Fox affiliate in York Pennsylvania; a Buffalo New York-based NBC station; and a CW station in the Hartford Connecticut area.

According to its online FAQ Verizon representatives negotiate hundreds of content agreements each year with channel owners and programmers. Verizon says it fights against rate increases in contract negotiations in order to prevent passing those costs to customers.

Tegna leaders said in an email they have been working for months on a new contract with Verizon.

“We even offered Verizon an extension that kept our stations available to viewers through the holiday weekend” according to the emailed statement.

This isn’t the first time Tegna has pulled its channels from local providers. Fios customers suffered a WVEC blackout in early 2019 and DirecTV lost the channel temporarily in late 2020. Tegna also pulled its channels from almost three million DISH TV users in October according to the American Television Alliance advocacy group.

The ATA is calling on lawmakers and Federal Communications Commission leaders to reform the video market spokesperson Jessica Kendust said.

“American consumers cannot continue to be used as private leverage to extort higher fees for broadband conglomerates like TEGNA” Kendust said in a news release.

Verizon said some WVEC content can be accessed via the station website or through a digital antenna.

Update: This story has been updated with information reflecting an agreement between Verizon and Tegna Saturday morning following a contract dispute that resulted in Verizon Fios TV customers losing access to WVEC.

By Virginia Bruce

Starting around November 15 last year I noticed that I wasn’t getting regular cell service on my Xfinity Mobile phone when I was home. I posted on a couple of social media sites and found that I wasn’t alone.

A cell coverage map from CellMapper

Xfinity Mobile uses the Verizon network. I had always had good service at my home in the Bonny Slope area. I used to have Verizon and switched to Xfinity when I realized they could provide the same network for less money. I was a happy customer until that day.

After much online discussion I waded through the layers of resistance and spoke to a service rep and through diligence was able to talk to someone senior and received a $65 credit on my bill. Service didn’t improve though.

I contacted the Oregon Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and learned that nobody has authority over the provision of cellular service except the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)! No state or local agency has any jurisdiction. And the Service Agreement* basically says they don’t have to provide anything!

After filling out the PUC complaint form however I learned that at least they could notify the carrier. I got a call from Xfinity corporate and at first I thought I’d get somewhere. Many of those who posted were told that service was fine despite our experience! But in the end that’s what they told me also. “Cellular service availability is determined by the operator of the cellular network and is not guaranteed.”

Then a participant in one of the social media discussions shared this:

“I called Verizon on Friday last week to challenge my bill given their obvious reduction in service. I went through their business office side rather than the Tech Support side. I guess that I got lucky as I randomly got a Senior Support manager. I told him that I had TWO distinct issues abrupt loss of service and my bill not being reflective of the service that they spend millions of dollars advertising as being the best. He listened to the facts that I presented to him then he painstakingly searched their database and validated every point that I made.

What he shared (which I believe he was not supposed to do) was that about a month ago they transitioned three towers in our area to ‘Microwave’ towers that as he described it give better local coverage but do NOT have the distance coverage…. so the people living close to those towers are celebrating our friends at Verizon.

In conclusion: 1) He said that our area needs one or two additional towers and he was going to use his executive contacts to push this project to the top of the list…which as he confessed does still take time to get boots on the ground to survey the best sites order equipment schedule crews etc. 2) He reduced our November bill by half which was less than I was pushing for but more than I realistically expected.”

We’re all using wi-fi to boost our home signal as we’ve been advised to do. But what if we want to use our phone when we go for a walk or even work in the garden?

I don’t have any great suggestions for how we can make an improvement but here’s the contact information for the person I spoke to at Xfinity corporate:

Kimberly F. Executive Resolutions TPX CX Care Operations Phone 844-963-0087 Extension 3052564 M-F 9 am-5:30 pm EST Xfinity_Mobile@comcast.com

As we gathered information from neighbors it became obvious that none of the carriers provided great service around here. But when you have decent service and then lose it because of a corporate decision it grates!

Safety regulators picked airports based on location traffic volume and the likelihood of low visibility — all factors that may increase cancelations delays and diversions as both carriers roll out 5G C-band service.

As pointed out by the Wall Street Journal notably busy airports like Chicago O’Hare Orlando International Los Angeles International and Dallas / Fort Worth International are included on the list along with airports in locations that are often impacted by foggy conditions such as Seattle / Tacoma International and San Francisco International.

AT&T and Verizon will turn off 5G transmitters at buffer zones for six months

The FAA notes that AT&T and Verizon have agreed to turn off their 5G transmitters at these specific buffer zones for six months which should “minimize potential 5G interference with sensitive aircraft instruments used in low-visibility landings.” Some airports — including major hubs like Hartsfield / Jackson International and Denver International — didn’t make the list either because they aren’t in locations where 5G C-Band deployment will take place or they can’t permit low-visibility landings.

AT&T and Verizon have been itching to deploy their improved 5G service ever since they spent a combined $70 billion last year on securing chunks of the C-band spectrum which should provide a middle ground in terms of 5G speed and coverage — something that both carriers’ 5G service is currently lacking. The two currently offer 5G service using super fast high-band millimeter wave technology that only covers small areas as well as the low-band spectrum which provides a lot of coverage with slow service akin to 4G LTE. T-Mobile already offers mid-band 5G service but it isn’t in the C-band range."

The store located at 263 Walmart Drive closed at 2 p.m. Sunday and will reopen at 6 a.m. Tuesday according to a written company statement. The closure is part of a company-initiated program that was enacted in response to the surge in COVID-19 cases nationwide.

The decision to temporarily close the store comes alongside dozens of similar store closings across the country and follows the company’s decision to close 60 stores in December amid the rising Omicron variant. In recent weeks Walmart has closed stores in Pennsylvania Maryland New Jersey and Texas.

On Friday the company closed a store in northeast Philadelphia following the closure of another nearby location in the city earlier in the week. Similarly a store in Laurel Maryland was closed for the last two days of 2021 before reopening on New Year's Day.

“As an essential business and a member of the Camden community we understand the role we play in providing our customers with food medicine and other essential items especially at this time” spokesperson Charles Crowson said.

“Everything we’re doing is for the well-being of our associates and the thousands of customers we serve daily and in consideration of guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and health experts.”

On Saturday 784 Delawareans were in the hospital due to COVID-19 breaking another grim record according to state data. On Jan. 6 Delaware saw 4347 new positive daily cases the highest number recorded since the start of the pandemic.

When the store reopens Tuesday the company will continue to conduct associate health assessments and enforce local and state mask mandates among its employees. Unvaccinated employees will still be required to wear face coverings the company said.

The company will also offer vaccines to their employees at their home store pharmacy on or off the clock. Employees will receive two hours of paid leave to get their vaccination and up to three days' paid leave should they experience an adverse reaction.

Walmart Inc.'s decision to cut its pandemic-related paid-leave policy in light of new federal quarantine guidelines will likely set a precedent for other retailers industry experts say.

A memo distributed to employees this week said Walmart will continue through March 31 to provide paid leave to workers who test positive for covid-19; fail the company's daily health screening; or are mandated to quarantine by a health care provider government or Walmart.

However the memo said the company has ""updated"" its covid-19 emergency leave policy by cutting paid leave in these instances from two weeks to one.

A company spokeswoman said in an email that employees who contract the virus and are unable to return to work after that week of emergency leave ""may be eligible for additional pay replacement for up to 26 weeks.""

The memo refers workers to its employee website to look at their other pay options.

Chief People Officer Donna Morris and Chief Medical Officer John Wig said in the memo that the policy change aligns with current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal agency said late last month that it was shortening its recommended isolation time for people with covid-19 from 10 days to five.

After that period the CDC said patients who are asymptomatic or go 24 hours without fever should wear a mask for another five days when around others to avoid spreading the virus. The agency was mum on whether these people should show a negative covid-19 test before being allowed out of isolation.

The agency said it based the new guidelines on scientific evidence that indicates most virus transmission occurs in the first day or two before the onset of symptoms and another two to three days after.

Since most Walmart employees many of whom work part time have little sick leave anyway some may decide to leave for other job opportunities said Brad Hershbein senior economist and communications adviser at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.

Some of those who leave may go to work for a competitor such as Amazon Hershbein said.

""Walmart's leadership probably thinks the additional number of employees who will quit for these reasons on top of the normally very high number of people who leave is a relatively small cost compared to being able to adequately staff stores and warehouses and keep their sales up"" Hershbein said.

The company may also think its competitors will follow its example in cutting employees' paid leave for covid-19 Hershbein said which would negate any disadvantage to Walmart.

Carol Spieckerman a retail consultant and president of Spieckerman Retail said shortening its emergency paid leave policy benefits Walmart both financially and in terms of productivity.

The CDC's revised guidance paved the way for Walmart's move ""and other retailers can comfortably follow now that Walmart has led the way"" Spieckerman said.

""Over the past few years Walmart has gotten quite comfortable taking the lead on potentially controversial topics"" Spieckerman said. ""In this case it isn't having to step out too far.""

In Walmart's memo the company said that in light of the new CDC guidance it will also change the questions that are part of the daily health screening employees undergo daily before entering a Walmart facility.

Workers have previously been asked each day whether they had received a positive covid-19 test had symptoms of the illness or been exposed to someone with the virus within the last 10 days. They will now be asked if they've experienced any of those things within the previous five days.

Walmart still requires all employees even those who are fully vaccinated to wear a well-fitted mask inside company facilities. It will also continue through Jan. 31 to pay a $150 incentive to workers who become fully vaccinated.

Nolan said the temporary closure would allow time for a third-party specialist to sanitize the store. It also will allow time for store associates to re-stock shelves.

""Everything we're doing is for the well-being of our associates and the thousands of customers we serve daily and in consideration of guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and health experts"" Nolan said.

She added Walmart will continue to follow CDC guidance with everyone including fully vaccinated people wearing masks in indoor public settings in counties where there is substantial or high transmission of the virus.

On Thursday the most recent day for which numbers were available 1466 people tested positive for COVID-19 in Orange County out of 5621 tested — a positivity rate of just over 26%.

Nolan said in addition to offering vaccines to customers through walk-in or online appointments Walmart also is offering easy access to vaccines for associates.

(WAFB) - A Walmart store in Prairieville will temporarily close its doors in order to deep clean and sanitize the building the company announced Saturday.

According to a company spokesman Walmart located at 17585 Airline Hwy will close today (Jan. 8) at 2 p.m. and will remain closed through Jan. 9. This will give associates time to restock shelves and prepare the store to reopen on Jan. 10 at 6 a.m.

The company released a statement on the matter:

“As an essential business and a member of the Prairieville community we understand the role we play in providing our customers with food medicine and other essential items especially at this time.

As you know several areas across the country have begun seeing a renewed increase in positive COVID-19 cases and we want to assist health officials working against the pandemic. In support of this effort we have chosen to temporarily close our Prairieville store location at 17585 Airline Hwy today at 2 p.m. as part of an ongoing company-initiated program. This will allow extra time for a third-party specialist to further sanitize the store and will also give our associates additional time to restock shelves and prepare the store to once again serve the community. We plan to reopen the store to customers at 6 a.m. on Monday Jan. 10.

Everything we’re doing is for the well-being of our associates and the thousands of customers we serve daily and in consideration of guidance by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and health experts. We will follow CDC guidance which includes fully vaccinated people wearing masks in public indoor settings in counties with substantial or high transmission.

In these counties and where there are state or local mask mandates associates will be required to wear masks inside our facilities including stores clubs distribution centers and fulfillment centers. You can find the county-by-county breakdown here. The CDC updates its data on transmission rates weekly so the guidance on mask usage is likely to change over time in different locations.

When the store reopens Monday we will continue conducting associate health assessments and all unvaccinated associates must still wear face coverings.

In addition to offering COVID-19 vaccines to customers through walk-in or online appointments we’re also offering easy access to vaccines for associates. Associates can receive their vaccinations at their home store pharmacy on or off the clock. They’ll receive two hours of paid leave to receive their vaccination and up to three days paid leave should they experience an adverse reaction.

These protocols and convenient access to vaccinations are in addition to the extensive measures we’ve put in place during the pandemic to help protect our associates and customers. We will continue working closely with elected and local health officials adjusting how we serve the community while also keeping the health and safety of our customers and associates in mind.

Universal Citywalk Review: Food Things to Do,"I much prefer Disney Springs overall but I still think there are things to be appreciated about CityWalk.

I took this picture at Disney Springs while visiting the Christmas Tree Stroll. Amanda Krause/Insider

In my opinion Disney Springs is the better place to spend a day. Parking is free there are more things to do and both adults and children can enjoy it.

That said I understand why some people might enjoy Universal CityWalk more. The free shopping center is in the same spot as its theme parks and it's a great option to visit popular places that you might not have access to at home.

At the end of the day it all comes down to personal preference. But if I was to recommend only one there's no doubt I'd choose Disney Springs any day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMDkvZGlzbmV5LWlzLWhpcmluZy1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEtZXhwZXJ0cy10by1ncm93LXRoZWlyLXRpa3Rvay5odG1s0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDEvMDkvZGlzbmV5LWlzLWhpcmluZy1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEtZXhwZXJ0cy10by1ncm93LXRoZWlyLXRpa3Rvay5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney is hiring TikTok creators — you need to love theme parks food and social media,"If your new year's resolution is to vlog about castles eccentric characters and Dole Whip Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S. Inc. has you covered.

On Thursday the company announced it's hiring a social media content coordinator to ""expand DPEP (Disney Parks Experiences and Products) social media presence"" – especially on TikTok. The chosen applicants would work at Walt Disney World in Orlando Florida.

The job description calls for social media savants who have experience in digital marketing video editing and ""an affinity for the Disney Brand including a passion for being in the Disney parks"" – but the biggest requirement for the role is that the new coordinator is savvy on the platforms' trends.

That experience and intuition is essential to support the widely popular Disney Parks accounts. Between TikTok Instagram and Twitter its audience is made up of approximately 8 million users. Disney Parks uses TikTok the platform with the most followers at 4.1 million to share hidden details exclusive guest experiences and team members' perspectives from inside the parks.

""The goal is to find creative ways to build brand trust and loyalty within internal and external audiences as well as achieve the greatest reach and shareability through compelling visual storytelling and content"" the job posting says.

It also mentions applicants should be proactive solution-oriented and adept at time management.

Working in Disney's parks also has its perks – employees receive exclusive discounts affordable childcare and 100% of college tuition at select schools according to its website.

But Disney's parks have not been immune to the pandemic-related consequences. Due to Covid restrictions Disney World's main parks were closed from March to July 2020 and Disneyland was closed for a year. As a result tens of thousands of workers were laid off – 32000 in the first half of the 2021 fiscal year. A majority had been employed by the company's parks experiences and products division.

""It's been absolutely hard to pay bills and put food on the table"" Laura Cave Braunston a then-former Walt Disney World server told the Guardian amid the layoffs in August 2020. ""We've had to go to food drives and those started out with a few hundred people now the lines are over a thousand.""

But since then Disney has rehired ""a vast majority"" of its furloughed cast members including Braunston according to a Disney spokesperson. In the ""early days of the pandemic"" the company also supported many of its employees by maintaining their health benefits. Because the Disney Aspire program also pays its hourly cast members' tuitions up front students still received support.

""Our cast is the most important part of our company and the key to our success"" the spokesperson said. ""We've heard from so many of them that they missed working for Disney and are happy to be back making magic for our guests.""

Last June Walt Disney World Co. also began offering $1000 signing bonuses to new housekeepers and select kitchen staff according to Bloomberg. Around that time the Orlando theme park also reinstated its paid summer internship program.

Given Covid's omicron surge now might not be the best time to work in high-traffic theme parks. All four of Disney's cruise ships are currently being observed for recent outbreaks by the CDC and Hong Kong Disneyland will be closed through January 20 to mitigate the spread of the virus.

The U.S. parks however are still open and require guests to wear masks while indoors.

The content coordinator would have to follow Disney's safety compliance requirements too. Salaried and non-union employees at both parks are required to be vaccinated.

Bear in mind with a release date nearly a year away and Warner Bros. gaining new leadership under Discovery mid-year it is still too early to say exactly what this film will end up doing. The possibilities are endless so let's take a look at the 7 Ways The Flash Could Change The DCEU. WARNING: 🚨SPOILERS🚨 AHEAD!!! Warner Bros. / Via YouTube

7. Batman Will Die

Ben Affleck has recently voiced his desire to step away from starring in ""IP movies"" so this film could mark his last appearance as the Caped Crusader in the DCEU (for now at least). His death was hinted at with the shot of Batman's cowl with blood and what looks like a corpse lying next to it. This could indicate that Batsy bit the dust due to the Flash's time-traveling or he died fighting to protect the world in the end. Or maybe his death is what drove the Flash to go back in time in the first place as he might want to go back and save him like Marty McFly in Back to the Future. But let's not rule out Keaton's character possibly dying instead. Warner Bros. / Via youtube.com

6. Flash Creates the ""Burtonverse""

If the Flash does end up creating a new reality by altering the past the appearance of Keaton's Batman suggests that the former inadvertently created the universe in which his movies took place. Why else would the Flash be in that one particular universe? While the trailer suggests Barry Allen simply traveled to this timeline on purpose the Flashpoint comic showed him not remembering exactly how the alternate world he made came to be. What a twist it would be if the Flash created the world in which Tim Burton's classic films are set in. Warner Bros. / Via youtube.com

5. Barry Will Create the New Flash

While we haven't yet seen Barry's origin story in the DCEU we could very well see him repeat it in this film. With the existence of another Barry Allen in this film there is the possibility that this variant never got his powers due to his mother not dying in his timeline. The spraypainted costume Barry's doppelganger wears also suggests that he is just starting out as the Flash. In the face of the film's great conflict the Barry we already know might even help his variant join the fight by repeating the accident that gave him his superpowers with him. Warner Bros. / Via youtube.com

4. Zod Will Rule Over The New Earth

It has recently been confirmed that Michael Shannon and Antje Traue will return as General Zod and Faora-Ul in this film. Fans of the DCEU remember that Zod was infamously killed by Superman and that Faora was sent to the Phantom Zone in Man of Steel so what their roles are in this new film is anyone's guess. Their previous fates suggest that the Flash will either go back in time to stop Zod from wreaking havoc in Metropolis altering the present or we could see him enter an alternate world in which Zod took over the Earth. The latter seems pretty likely given that the Flash inadvertently creates a dystopian world in the comics thanks to his time-traveling. Supergirl's presence in the film also suggests that the Man of Steel lost against Zod and that she will take his place (hence Henry Cavill's possible absence in future films). Warner Bros. / Via youtube.com

3. Val-Zod Will Appear

General Zod's return could herald the appearance of this fan-favorite hero as there have been reports of this character being adapted for live-action by Warner Bros. For those of you who don't know Val-Zod is a Kryptonian orphan who takes up the mantle of Superman in his own alternate universe. While his parents were never revealed in the comics his name suggests that he is the son of General Zod and this film might make it that way with the return of the alien warlord.

ADVERTISEMENT

If the evil Kryptonian does take over this new Earth Val could help the Flash and his allies rise up against him making for an interesting battle between father and son (especially since the Flash's relationship with his father is an important part of his character). It could also allow both Val and Supergirl to fill in Clark Kent's place as their world's Superman.

2. The Film Will Reboot the DCEU

This one will no doubt anger a lot of Snyderverse fans out there. It's no secret that Warner Bros. has beef with Zack Snyder's DCEU films and they've been trying to distance themselves from them as much as possible. But now it has been rumored that they will erase his films from the main timeline with the Flash's time-altering abilities. This could be tricky as they have already set up successful and ongoing franchises with Wonder Woman Aquaman Shazam and the Suicide Squad. However in the comics the Flash was able to reset reality by merging multiple timelines into one creating the world seen in the New 52 reboot. Bear in mind these rumors of a reboot are just rumors but DC and Warner Bros. still risk losing a large chunk of their audience if they take Snyder's films out of the main canon. They've already angered fans enough for one lifetime. Warner Bros. / Via youtube.com

1. The Franchise Will Branch Off Into Earth-2

While rumors suggest that this film will end with the re-creation of a DCEU those rumors could only be half-true. Future films could follow the heroes of this alternate Earth which could be based on DC's Earth-2. In this universe the Justice League (going by the Eight Wonders of the World) is composed of super-powered characters like Power Girl (a variant of Supergirl) Hourman and Val-Zod. Michael Keaton's Batman the Flash's variant and Supergirl could be a part of this new league and with projects for Hourman Val-Zod Blue Beetle and Batgirl currently in development sooner or later we could see all these characters joining them as well. This wouldn't be the first time DC has done this as the CW's Arrowverse has produced many hit shows across multiple universes that eventually crossover. And with Marvel Studios recently establishing twin universes with Sony's Venom films we now know that this change could work. All in all The Flash could be setting up a whole new universe for audiences to follow while preserving the DCEU's main timeline.

Larry Baldwin and Rick Dove his colleague at the Waterkeeper Alliance an international nonprofit focused on clean water stood next to a small Cessna airplane going over their flight plan before taking off.

Baldwin’s mission was to fly over eastern North Carolina—host to an increasing number of industrial-scale hog and poultry barns often crowded right next to one another to collect evidence of the waste being discharged into nearby creeks and waterways which could threaten neighboring communities with air and water contamination.

For years Baldwin and his colleagues from Waterkeeper organizations across the state have been undertaking airborne sorties in privately chartered planes to document hog and poultry waste leaking into watersheds. Baldwin would snap pictures to supplement ongoing investigations into livestock operations he suspected were illegally contaminating water with waste from open pits of hog feces and urine.

“These Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations or CAFOs are spread over large areas mostly in rural North Carolina and it’s not easy to discover a violation from the road” Baldwin said. “That is why we have to get into these small planes to see from above if a swine or poultry facility is committing a violation.”

Flights Baldwin said are the best way to compile evidence of violations and potentially illegal waste management practices by CAFO operators he said as well as monitor the increasing proliferation of large-scale hog and poultry operations into areas with low-income communities of color.

“The most typical pollutants found in air surrounding CAFOs are ammonia hydrogen sulfide methane and particulate matter” according to a report from the National Association of Local Boards of Health “all of which have varying human health risks.”

A recent study by the National Academy of Sciences attributed 95 premature deaths annually in North Carolina’s Sampson County and 83 such deaths in its Duplin County to the fine particulate air pollution caused in part by ammonia emissions from hog operations. Minority neighborhoods in the state are disproportionately impacted by hog farm pollution and face myriad health problems from the pollution including anemia infant deaths kidney disease and septicemia according to research from Duke University.

Civil rights activists have for years pointed out long-standing environmental issues related to the continued usage of lagoon and sprayfield systems an outdated waste management practice in which untreated hog urine and feces are stored in giant open lagoons and periodically sprayed into the air and onto nearby fields as fertilizer.

Unregulated Chicken and Turkey Operations Add Contamination

The problem is compounded by the rapidly proliferating poultry industry which is largely unregulated. The state’s Department of Environmental Quality does not even have information on the location or waste disposal practices of these industrial-scale chicken and turkey barns.

Commercial poultry farms produce more waste laden with nitrogen and phosphorus than the state’s massive commercial hog farms but need no operating permits face no requirement to submit waste management plans to the DEQ and can only be inspected if someone in the community complains about their operations.

Nutrient pollution from the over-application of nitrogen and phosphorus in animal manure and chemical fertilizers is considered one of the country’s most widespread and costly environmental problems causing algae blooms that kill fish harm aquatic habitats and sicken humans with elevated toxin concentrations and bacterial growth.

The near absence of regulatory controls and enforcement action has left communities to fend for themselves. Waterkeepers attempt to fill in the gaps by monitoring air and water pollution from CAFOs.

“We combine aerial monitoring with on-the-ground investigation including testing ground water to assess if there are elevated levels of nutrients or harmful bacteria in the water body near the suspected hog or chicken facility” Baldwin explained. When elevated levels of pollution are detected those results are passed on to the DEQ for action.

But the state regulator has failed to take action against violators despite the evidence of illegal discharge proven by thorough water testing over time Baldwin said. “The DEQ does not have the resources to undertake independent investigation to detect a violation nor would they admit our findings because it’s done by a third party” he said.

Josh Kastrinsky a DEQ public information officer responded that the department “investigates complaints involving animal feeding operations to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations for the protection of the environment and public health.”

Kastrinsky said the department’s Division of Water Resources “may consider third party evidence as a part of their investigation but could not proceed with an enforcement action based only on that data without verification by inspectors.” The Division of Water Resources he said investigates complaints alleging immediate threats to the environment or human safety or health within 24 hours. For other complaints it conducts site visits within five business days.

So the Waterkeepers also inform the public about the environmental harms and risks to public health their investigations into CAFOs uncover. “Hopefully this will lead to increased public pressure that can get the state to do the right thing” Baldwin said.

For years environmental groups have joined communities near swine and poultry operations in urging policymakers to devise a better waste management system than the outdated lagoon and sprayfield systems currently in use.

Instead last July the North Carolina state legislature passed the Farm Act of 2021 which requires the state regulator to come up with a general permit within a year to enable interested swine operations to trap methane gas from the hog waste stored in open lagoons and convert it into biogas.

The DEQ has already granted four biogas permits to the hog facilities in eastern North Carolina as part of a $500 million program known as Align Renewable Natural Gas or Align RNG a joint venture between Smithfield Foods and Dominion Energy Inc. that began in 2018.

Two North Carolina civil rights groups have filed a complaint with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to investigate the approval of the plan to produce biogas by the state environmental agency despite the concerns that the project will increase air and water pollution.

DEQ is required to finalize the general permitting process before a July 1 2022 deadline.

The accumulation of non-recyclable waste on landfills all around the world and the huge amount of time that most of its materials take to biodegrade can affect in a significant manner our lifestyle in the near future if we as a society don't take action to prevent this from happening. Moreover among the most notorious risks for humans waste accumulation can enhance the disease spread via vectors such as flies mosquitoes and many more insects. Also in addition to the ruin of the beauty of natural habitats deforestation and terrain occupation to provide enough space to landfills soil and water can be susceptible to be polluted due to the toxic chemicals located in improperly treated materials. At the same time that pollution can alter the food chain which inevitably leads to more diseases and health issues for humans and the natural ecosystems worldwide.

There are mainly three reasons why waste accumulation is becoming an increasingly severe problem during the last 50 years. The first one is the absence of recyclable items available on the market even though companies have been developing more sustainable and ecological products for a long time. The second reason is another of the most popular problems present nowadays denoted as overpopulation. The fact of having to supply a large number of people with resources of all kinds supposes a very complex logistic challenge when dealing with trash generation so there is an increase in the percentage of products that could be recycled but in contrast end in a landfill or even the ocean affecting the lives of thousands of marine species. Finally the third reason consists of the lack of involvement that we show as a society over these kinds of problems such as climate change.

To show the waste accumulation problem in terms of data it's essential to know that the world population produces between 7 and 9 billion tons of waste every year of which 70% is mistreated ending in landfills with the risk of polluting natural environments and causing new threats for human health like ocean microplastics. This data refers to the total amount of used unwanted and discarded objects that humankind creates. However there is a distinction between the total waste produced and the so-called Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) which only includes garbage generated in urban centers or their areas of influence. Concerning the amount of MSW with respect to the rest of the waste approximately 2 billion tons of urban garbage is produced yearly with around 33% of that not adequately managed. It means that each person generates from 0.1 to 4.5 kilograms of waste every day with an average of 0.7kg. In addition it's expected that the MSW will increase to 3.4 billion tons by the year 2050 due to the rapidly growing global population and the need for the intensive use of natural resources for the development of industry and the sustaining of our civilization.

Ideally a fully implemented circular economy model would essentially be an excellent solution for the accumulation problem besides the climate change and even supply crisis in some places of our world. That's because its three principles (eliminating waste and pollution circulating products and materials and regenerating nature) lead towards an effective way of managing natural resources that sometimes we don't correctly value. Nevertheless it isn't easy to carry out such a complex plan in a complete manner due mainly to technology engineering and logistic limitations.

Machine Learning in environment care

Despite these limitations some emerging new state-of-the-art technologies are starting to change how we see and face these problems. One of the most notorious nowadays is Machine Learning a branch of Artificial Intelligence that makes it possible for machines to learn specific and complex tasks like classification prediction decision making content generation etc. by using large amounts of data in combination with advanced learning algorithms inspired on the way we humans learn. Automating such tasks using machine learning can sometimes be extremely useful for humans due to its scalability and performance.

Regarding its relationship with sustainability and circular economy implementation machine learning has the potential to automate a wide variety of tasks. From data trend predictions that improve the quality of the air we breathe and finding patterns on data collected to measure global warming over time identifying waste in natural environments or even classifying between several types of garbage materials to boost the performance of waste treatment plants. So the proper identification and differentiation of recyclable items from the rest of the litter can also be a significant advance towards a sustainable circular economy model. However machine learning is now present in more processes related to environmental care than we think. For example a correct energy or product demand prediction made by a model can avoid the waste of natural resources. Also advanced enough models can even discover new materials by working with chemical structures improving the efficiency and recyclability of everyday products.

Objective

The goal of this article is to contribute to the development and improvement of machine learning techniques focused on solving environmental issues like the above-mentioned (waste accumulation global warming pollution etc.) by creating a model capable of sorting between nine different types of waste depending on the fabrication materials and thus its recyclability. Furthermore it will be subject to experimentation by professionals and subject matter experts since its open-source. That experimentation is key when improving the performance of models in the field of machine learning along with the data gathering and processing techniques used in the process.

Also intuitively explaining the internal functioning of machine learning algorithms and the benefits they could bring to humankind in the future can raise the understanding and trust that society has over such new exponential technologies. Additionally focusing on the use of new disruptive methods to attempt to solve environmental problems increases the awareness that we all have about taking care of our planet giving place to the possible implementation of new sustainable habits in our daily lives.

How does it work?

So to build a classifier that correctly sorts out different types of waste we will need a model architecture denominated as Convolutional Neural Network since our dataset will be composed mainly of labeled images meaning that each image has a corresponding label that indicates the correct prediction (type of waste material) the model will have to provide as output. At the same time the model will also need a fully-connected network after the convolutional module to transform an arbitrary response given by it to a set of values with a particular structure that will allow us to determine the class predicted by the model.

The aim of using a Convolutional Network to process an image resides in its ability to extract certain patterns or features from images with an invariance in position rotation and scale. To understand the power of these properties when detecting features in images let's consider an example.

For instance we could use an entire fully-connected network if we want to detect the handwritten number three as a feature. Still it would only 'see' the digit in a specific image area and rotation giving wrong predictions when the element is placed in a random position or rotated. In contrast a model with a convolutional part can effectively detect the feature independently of its properties.

If you wonder how this can be done this architecture's fundamental operation is the Convolution hence the name Convolutional Network. In a nutshell the Convolution operation takes as input the pixels of an image and outputs a feature map which is no more than a matrix of values that can perfectly represent an image. As you can see in the above animation a matrix colored in dark grey called kernel goes through all the input image pixels (blue matrix) multiplying each pixel value of the kernel by the corresponding pixel values of the input image. After that it places the sum of all the resulting values in the feature map matrix sequentially. To preserve the dimensionality of the feature map with respect to the input image you can add padding which is a line of null values around the image. Also you can change parameters like stride which determines the 'steps' that the kernel takes to the left while traversing the image.

A machine learning model can modify the values of a kernel to detect complex features like human faces car wheels etc. For example as you can see above you can pass an eye detector kernel through an image using Convolution and know where the eyes are located just by looking at the output feature map.

Before jumping into the complete network let's first look at the basics of neural networks. This mathematical model learns patterns and relationships in a set of data by imitating how our human brain works. The most fundamental component of a neural network is the neuron which takes n input values and computes its weighted sum (sum of all inputs multiplied by a corresponding weight parameter). Then it passes that value through an activation function to introduce non-linearity and outputs the result of that function. Thus a combination of multiple neurons organized in different layers enables the network to acquire 'knowledge.'

Operational Plan: 2021

Project Duration: 30 months

Start date: November 15 2021

Marine litter is a growing problem that negatively affects economies threatens ecosystems and poses a potential risk to human health. It is estimated that 80% of marine litter originates from land-based sources often due to the improper disposal of items or uncollected waste that becomes litter and travels through watersheds to the oceans. Previous work included the development of guidance and engagement tools to reduce marine litter in inland communities. Building on this past work the current project aims to build public awareness about marine litter deploy litter capture devices collect comparable data across the three countries. This project will reduce land-based marine litter including single-use plastic products and packaging in communities located inland along waterways and river systems in North America.

Towards meeting the outcomes of the Paris Agreement India has committed to getting 40% of its electricity through renewable sources by 2030. The government has made great strides to achieve this target well before the stipulated time as the country’s installed renewable energy installed capacity crossed the 40% mark in November 2021 itself.

Solar energy leads India’s energy transition with a whopping contribution of 100 GW. As of November 30 2021 India ranked sixth worldwide in installed solar energy capacity (48.56 GW).

Indeed the solar photovoltaics sector in India has been growing with rapidly falling tariffs subsidies from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) 100% FDI through the automatic route and performance-linked incentives for high-efficiency photovoltaic modules manufacturing.

The flip side

The government has promoted solar energy as the key to India’s low-carbon energy transition. But the rapid diffusion of solar photovoltaic technology has come the unregulated end-of-life management and disposal of photovoltaic waste.

Solar photovoltaic systems generate waste of two forms: primary and secondary. Primary waste comprises waste generated directly from solar panels before and at the end of life. Secondary waste constitutes materials generated during the fabrication and the disposal of balance systems like inverters wires and mounting structures.

Although the estimated lifespan of solar panels is 20-25 years they are often disposed of well before this time thanks to damages during transportation installation soiling faulty manufacturing poor maintenance and harsh weather. In an ongoing study in Bengaluru suppliers reported that consumers often exchange their photovoltaic rooftop installations in 2-3 years and upgrade to more efficient panels. This adds to the issues surrounding waste management and disposal.

Given India’s considerable solar energy target studies have indicated that the volume of solar photovoltaic waste is projected to reach 200000 tonnes a year by 2030 and grow almost 10x to 1.8 million tonnes by 2050. These are big numbers and anticipate a considerable challenge to India’s sustainable energy transition.

India under-prepared

In addition the secondary waste includes components that have a lifespan of 3-10 years and will contribute to an additional high-volume stream of toxic substances (including heavy metals like cadmium and antimony) and e-waste further down the line and which pose significant threats to human and environmental health. India appears to be less than prepared to deal with these potential outcomes.

The country doesn’t have any specific regulations to dispose and recycle solar photovoltaic waste. The only reference to solar waste is in the MNRE guidelines. The ministry directed the Central Pollution Control Board to amend the 2016 E-waste Rules to include antimony in the ‘hazardous substances’ category (rule 16) with indirect consequences for the management of solar modules containing antimony.

MNRE has also accepted that India currently doesn’t have facilities to recycle solar panels containing antimony but has shifted the onus to industry actors once an adequate amount of photovoltaic waste becomes available to recycle.

But curiously the 2016 E-waste Rules don’t consider solar modules themselves to be e-waste leaving the disposal and management of end-of-life solar technologies in a limbo.

According to Central Pollution Control Board data the e-waste recycling capacity available with registered recyclers and dismantlers in India can handle only 22% percent of the waste produced (i.e. 0.4 million tonnes a year). And between 2015 and 2017 only 4% of the total e-waste generated was reportedly sent to registered dismantling facilities.

If this gap between waste production and handling persists India’s energy transition story could soon turn into an environmental nightmare.

To avoid this India needs a multifaceted approach focusing on stakeholder engagement and technology development. It is imperative that we have a specific and comprehensive regulatory ecosystem that restricts the accumulation of solar waste without slowing the transition to renewable sources. We must also ban photovoltaic waste from reaching landfills and craft legislation for ‘extended producer responsibility’ to hold industry actors responsible. We can borrow from successful efforts on this front in Europe and China.

Industry intervention like in the UK EU and Australia could also make for a successful recycling model. Given the large size of the MSME and informal sector in India they can offer transport module-handling recycling and decommissioning services at the end-of-life stage. This would also generate employment opportunities. With the government’s focus on increasing solar-cell and module manufacturing capacity in India critical elements such as silicon lithium and germanium can be salvaged from recycled panels and help offset any impending resource crunch in the photovoltaic manufacturing segment.

Parallelly investment in R&D to develop homegrown solar waste recycling technologies and incentivisation of the allied infrastructure is required. The stakes are high and if concrete steps aren’t taken soon India will have a tenacious challenge comparable to its plastic-waste management problem.

Africa’s first floating liquified natural gas plant has arrived in Mozambique and gas production is on track to begin in the second half of the year.

The Coral South project is the first of a few planned projects which will exploit a significant gas find in the offshore Rovuma Basin.

After a seven-week voyage Africa’s first-ever deep-sea floating Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) facility has entered Mozambican waters marking a major milestone ahead of imminent production from an offshore gas field.

The floating plant – known as the Coral Sul FLNG – arrived in Area 4 of the Rovuma Basin this week Mozambique’s National Petroleum Institute announced.

The plant is critical to the $7 billion Coral South project which is operated by Italian oil and gas company Eni. It will produce and sell gas extracted from the southern part of the field.

The 220 000 ton vessel the main component of which was constructed by Samsung Heavy Industries in South Korea is the first FLNG built for deep waters and the first specifically built for Africa. Some 432 meters long and 66 meters wide the plant has the capacity to liquefy 3.4 million tons of natural gas per year.

It will be linked to six subsea gas producing wells with its LNG earmarked to be sold exclusively to BP under a 20-year offtake agreement signed in 2016.

Eni’s partners in Area 4 are ExxonMobil the China National Petroleum Corporation Empresa Nactional de Hidrocarbonetos Galp Energia and the Korea Gas Corporation.

Gearing up for production

The Coral Sul FLNG embarked on its voyage from South Korea on 15 November and entered Mozambiquan waters on 3 January.

According to the National Petroleum Institute the vessel’s arrival is “a milestone in the project’s implementation”.

Since arriving in Mozambican waters a complex process of anchoring surveys inspections and certifications had begun with a view to issuing the vessel with an operating license so that production can start as planned in the second half of the year.

According to Eni’s website the installation campaign includes mooring and hook-up operations at a water depth of around 2000 meters by means of 20 mooring lines that weigh 9000 tons in total.

The Coral South project will see Eni providing specialist training for more than 800 Mozambican workers who will be employed in the project’s operational phase. The company said it has committed to a “huge programme of work” for local communities to improve their access to basic services such as education clean water and health care while supporting long-term diversified sustainable socio-economic growth.

Coral South is one of a number of energy projects located in the Rovuma basin.

Also under construction is TotalEnergies’ substantially larger $20 billion Mozambique LNG project. Work is yet to resume after the site was evacuated in March last year as a result of nearby Islamic State terrorist attacks.

Still awaiting a final investment decision is ExxonMobil’s $30 billion Rovuma LNG project which was delayed in 2020 in light of an oil price collapse amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

“It is great news for Mozambique and the region that Coral FLNG is now in Mozambique ahead of commissioning” said Paul Eardley-Taylor Standard Bank’s head of oil and gas for Southern Africa.

“3.4 million tons per annum of LNG can support 4 GW of base load cleaner gas to power and demonstrates that Mozambique’s LNG developments continue despite the pandemic and other challenges” he said.

Across the border in South Africa the government has long paid lip service to developing a gas economy but the pace has been frustratingly slow for many industry proponents. Climate concerns have made it more difficult than ever for oil and gas companies to pursue new projects – as shown by fierce opposition to Shell’s plans to conduct seismic surveys off SA’s Wild Coast.

The arrival of the Coral Sul FLNG is yet another reminder of where South Africa could have been if it had sprang into action sooner to develop a local gas economy said Niall Kramer an independent energy consultant.

“It’s just frustrating that the world is moving ahead and we are talking about things and not doing what we said we would do” he said. “I think that there’s almost an intentional delay in the assumption that if government talk about it and set up a committee and have a meeting that’s enough to pacify business. But it’s not.”

South Africa needs to develop an environment that’s attractive to investors in gas the likes of who are investing in neighbours like Nambia and Mozambique despite the political and security challenges said Kramer.

While he recognises there has been some progress – most recently was the release of a draft gas master plan – Kramer said South Africa’s gas and renewables policy and execution suffers from “sheer ineptitude” and a “lack of vision” on the transition path toward renewables.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2VzdC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvZ29sZC9zeW5lcmd5LWJvc3MtZ2V0cy1wZXJ0aC1taW50LWdpZy1hZnRlci1leHRlbnNpdmUtc2VhcmNoLWMtNTI0NzgzMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Synergy boss gets Perth Mint gig after ‘extensive’ search,"Having purportedly embarked on a global search Perth Mint has gone no further than St Georges Terrace for its new chief executive tapping the head of the State Government’s electricity monopoly Synergy.

After finishing its third consecutive year of double-digit percentage gains in 2021 the S&P 500 started off 2022 with a down week.

On Friday the Labor Department reported the U.S. economy added just 199000 jobs in December well short of economist estimates of 422000 jobs. U.S. wages grew 4.7% from a year ago and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.9%.

The Fed is projecting three interest rate hikes this year and the bond market is currently pricing in a greater than 70% chance the first rate hike will come in March.

Rising U.S. Treasury yields weighed on tech stocks. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes climbed to 1.79% on Friday up from 1.5% at the end of 2021 and 1.12% a year ago.

The survey was conducted on 1569 respondents and over 32% selected gold as the precious metal that’s set to outperform in 2022. Coming in second was silver which also has a higher use case than gold which is seen more as a store of value and an inflation hedge.

As far as what Wall Street thinks they appear to share the same sentiment based on analysts’ views.

“After facing numerous headwinds in 2021 we believe gold’s path higher looks clearer in 2022. Moderating equity market returns and inflation concerns may bring the market’s focus and flows back to the yellow metal next year. [The] greenback will not be a substantial headwind in 2022 as it was in 2021” said Wells Fargo. “While we are optimistic that gold could finally move higher in 2022 a stronger price trend may take some time to develop which prompts us to lower our year-end 2022 target range to $2000-$2100.”

As Wells Fargo mentioned gold will have to contend with rising interest rates. That could potentially prop up the U.S. dollar as inflation continues to run hot.

“A primary question for 2022 might be what stops gold from regaining the upper hand vs. most commodities and our bias is for enduring trends (notably since the financial crisis) to prevail which favors precious metals more than industrial and the metals sector over broad commodities” said Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone. “Since the end of 2007 gold’s roughly 115% gain has underpinnings from an unlimited supply of fiat currency. Greater supply elasticity is a copper headwind. Indicating the difference for investors the Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return is about 20% vs. 40% for the spot.”

Back in 2019 I received an email from Brad Currey about economic inequality — passionately calling for early education and quality childcare to lead people out of poverty.

That was Brad Currey — a leader who was willing to address Atlanta’s biggest challenges — from the environment to race relations to business excellence – over more than six decades.

Currey first got on my radar in 1991 when Susan Neugent then a senior vice president at the Metro Atlanta Chamber offered to give me background info on Atlanta’s business leaders. Since I had just become a business columnist for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution she wanted to keep me honest and make sure I didn’t get co-opted by corporate spin. Neugent let me know which leaders were the good guys (yes they were almost all men) and which ones were not.

Then she said there was one great man who was in a class all by himself — Brad Currey.

“What a leader! What a good soul! What a friend to so many! How much good can one person do?” Neugent wrote me in an email when she heard Currey had died. “The good he did would be an extraordinary measure for anyone.”

Accolades poured in as the word got out among Currey’s admirers.

“We have lost and Heaven has gained one of the very finest men that our world contained” wrote Tom Johnson retired president of CNN. “It isn’t the age at which Brad died. It is how he lived those years the Good Lord gave him. Always Kind. Thoughtful. Generous. Humble. Selfless. Determined to help others. He was my Atlanta mentor for 31 years. He exemplified integrity doing what is right service to his community. I will do my best in my 8th and 9th inning to make Brad proud of me. I loved him.”

The first time I went to interview Brad Currey he was CEO of RockTenn (now WestRock). As we sat in his office with a large picture window facing railroad tracks we could hear a train coming. Currey interrupted the interview to swivel around to watch the train go by — counting the number of engines carrying railroad cars.

“That’s how I know how the economy is doing” he told me. If there were four engines the economy was booming. If there was one we were in a recession. That day Currey was happy to see three engines letting him know the economy was in good shape.

Over the years I counted on his wisdom guidance and support — knowing there were many of us who relied on him as we tried to navigate issues in Atlanta and Georgia.

Currey was instrumental in the renovation of St. Luke’s Episcopal Church where Bill Bolling founded the Atlanta Community Food Bank – leading to a friendship that lasted decades.

Brad’s death saddens me greatly” former Emory University President Jim Laney who served as U.S. ambassador to South Korea wrote in an email. Laney said they bonded when Currey agreed 40 years ago to join the Emory board of trustees. “I was especially touched and grateful for the most generous scholarship program he funded in the College in my name for Korean students. Our annual lunches with those students are forever etched in my memory.”

When Bill Bolling and I first had the idea more than five years ago to establish the Atlanta Civic Circle a nonprofit civic journalism site Currey was the first to make a donation — even before we had our nonprofit tax status. Currey continued to be our most consistent donor giving us significant grants every year including one we received in December.

The last time I saw Brad Currey was when my colleague Britton Edwards and I went to Canterbury Court to visit with another great leader — Howell Adams. I told Britton we should go to see Brad since we were there. When we visited his apartment we were told he was in the exercise room. There we found Brad pedaling hard on an exercise bike — delighted to see us and as endearing as always.

Laney spoke for all of us in his email to Currey’s family.

“I shall miss him more than I can say” Laney wrote. “He was dear friend counselor and partner. His integrity strength of character and profound sense of service gave him enormous influence in our region through the institutions he loved. He was in every sense one of a kind a gentleman of honor and Christian discipleship.”

The services for Brad Currey will be held on Saturday Feb. 19 at 11 a.m. at his beloved St. Luke’s.

Here is the email about economic inequality that Brad Currey sent to me on July 10 2019 through his longtime executive assistant Catherine Grist:

Maria

Please think about writing a column about economic inequality being the product of a failure of education and child care. We absolutely know that every child can learn. Parents and the community must start early. When a child is born both parents need to cradle them in their arms start reading to them even before they learn to speak provide books pictures good music newspapers and turn off the television . If the parents cannot then the community needs to find a way. They need to start formal education as soon as possible and continue it vigorously as long as possible. As the second of seven children six of whom grew up I know this because I watched my mother read to each of us almost from birth. My father didn’t finish high school went to work as a “runner” in a bank at age 14 in 1901 and except for two years in the U.S. Army in World War I worked in banks in Nashville Tennessee New York City and Chattanooga until retiring at age 67. He took us all walking from about age 4 on the CCC trails around Chattanooga and taught us about all the different varieties of trees plants and animals in the world. All six of us became college graduates! The girls were both Phi Beta Kappa smarter than all four of their brothers. My mother had no formal education but was taught at home by her father a lawyer and her mother born in 1867 and then given to and raised by an old maid aunt schoolteacher. (My mother’s three older sisters went to school but my mother and her young sister were taught at home because the sixth child was a boy and they started saving money to send him to school eventually getting him into West Point!)



Child care is just as important as education. Both save big money in the long run and should be considered public responsibilities.



Obviously I feel strongly about all this.

Brad Currey

Here is the family’s obituary which was largely written by Brad Currey himself:

Longtime Atlanta resident civic leader volunteer and businessman Bradley Norton Currey Jr. died January 6 2022 at home in Atlanta Georgia. He was 91.

Brad Currey (second from left) on April 8 1974 at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium honoring Hank Aaron’s 715th home run. (Special: Currey family.)

Throughout his life Brad loved civic and business work but also activities outside of work such as playing with children and grandchildren swimming hiking gardening and listening to music. He used to say he was the “luckiest guy that ever lived.” Since the early 1980s he has spent time with family in the north Georgia mountains where he walked the woods; read Jack Tales and Pogo to beloved grandchildren nieces and nephews; built roaring fires in the winter and in summertime took very long swims. He loved people eschewed extravagance cared about the community and was generous with his time and resources.

Brad graduated from Princeton University in 1951 with an A.B. degree from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He then enlisted in the U.S. Army serving as an infantry soldier (RA 14401949) and armor officer (01937889) during the Korean War. He saw no combat his service spent going to and teaching in Army Schools. He declared infantry basic training and infantry leaders’ courses in the recently-integrated Army the “best possible antidote to four years at Princeton University.”

He loved his work from boyhood on. His first management job was head busboy in the dining halls at Princeton University. He joined Trust Company of Georgia in late 1953 as a trainee rising from teller to credit analyst securities analyst commercial lender bond portfolio manager head of Atlanta commercial banking head of marketing controller strategic planner chief financial officer and member of the board of directors of the bank and bank holding company – in short a wonderful and productive banking career. In 1976 he joined Rock-Tenn Company of which he had been an outside director for nine years. He and A. Worley Brown led the company until Brown became disabled in the late 1980s after which Brad served as CEO until retiring in 2000. The company grew from $12 million in sales in 1967 to $1.3 billion in 2000. He and Worley Brown built the Rock-Tenn Team and by his report “had more fun than the law allowed.” Throughout his remarkable career he led by example listened mentored and cultivated talent. The list of people who are grateful that Brad Currey coached encouraged motivated cajoled and inspired them to give their best may be as long as the Atlanta phone book in 1953 the year he arrived in Atlanta.

From the mid-1950s through 2000 Brad was an active and influential volunteer. He helped lead Community Chest and United Way campaigns headed the Graduate School of Banking of the South at Louisiana State University from 1971-74; and chaired the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce in 1974 the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra board in 1976-78 and the Woodruff Arts Center board in 1983-85. From 1983-88 he served the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta as deputy chairman then chairman of the board. He was an outside director of Genuine Parts Company and Brown & Brown Inc. Standard-Coosa-Thatcher Company Dempster Brothers Inc. and Enzymatic Deinking Technologies LLC. He also served on the boards of the American Paper Institute the American Forest and Paper Association and the Paperboard Packaging Council and was a founder of the Paper Recycling Coalition. In education he was a trustee of Randolph-Macon Woman’s College The Lovett School and Emory University where he served as chair from 1994-2000.

Immediately following “retirement” he went to work on water policy in Georgia and the so-called water war between Georgia Florida and Alabama that started in 1990. Three governors appointed him to committees and councils charged with problem-solving related to water supply and conservation. He was particularly proud of contributing to the accomplishments of the ACF (Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint) Stakeholders a board of fifty-six people from three states. He recruited key board members helped raise the money for engineering studies and computer modeling and worked to keep the economic development interests and environmental interests all in the same tent. After five years of hard work all fifty-six people on that board agreed that they “could live with” a Sustainable Water Management Plan for the ACF basin. The plan did not stop the litigation which reached the U.S. Supreme Court but it did show that stakeholders who depend on the river basin from all three states and all four sub-basins could agree on a practical solution to the twenty-six-year-old water war.

As much as he valued his work Brad was most proud of his big family: his brothers and sisters his wife and children nieces nephews and grandchildren. Beyond work and family the things that mattered the most to him were the following: First St. Luke’s Episcopal Church’s acquisition of the full two blocks of land on which the church is located. Second working with L. L. Gellerstedt Jr. Ivan Allen III George Goodwin and others to roll out the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce slogan “Atlanta the World’s Next Great City” in the early 1970s. This same group traveled the world securing foreign consulates and persuading international airlines to initiate service to Atlanta. Third his work with Mrs. Betty Sands Fuller to keep Robert Shaw as the genius leading the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus when he was at risk of being fired. Fourth establishing the Paper Recycling Coalition as the voice for paper recycling in the USA. And lastly the Sustainable Water Management Plan completed in 2015 by the ACF Stakeholders that proved that intractable differences can be resolved by stakeholders using facts science engineering and the willingness of the participants to recognize that as Brad would say “nobody gets everything they want!”

NM Redevelopment a subsidiary of Boston real estate firm Bulfinch Companies Inc. partnered with Chicago-based investment management firm Harrison Street to buy the 94000-square-foot space last month according to records at the Middlesex County Registry of Deeds.

The building which features 18-foot-high ceilings and about 450 garaged parking spaces is currently assessed at $9.6 million according to Natick property records.

Developers are mum on what they plan to do with the property but they say its new use will cater to current market needs said Bulfinch Companies CEO Eric Schlager in a Dec. 17 press release.

“Bulfinch is excited to partner with Harrison Street and Brookfield Properties as we reposition this irreplaceable property to meet current market requirements” said Schlager. “This transaction is consistent with our mission to “Discover + Deliver” and we look forward to activating this unique asset and to further developing our strong partnership with the MetroWest community while creating value for our stakeholders.”

The sale closed on Dec. 16 in a deal brokered by Scott Black of Atlantic Retail after working through various issues including the building's change of use Black told the Daily News.

A spokesperson for Bulfinch said the company could not yet comment on what type of property is being developed at the location because it still needs to receive its special permit.

In May 2020 department store chain Neiman Marcus based in Dallas filed for bankruptcy. Though its Natick location was originally slated to close last year it will instead remain open through September. Bulfinch will serve as developer and property manager.

Bulfinch owns and manages about 3 million square feet of medical biotech and office assets according to its website. Some of its projects include:

Transforming a 25000-square-foot Allen Furniture Warehouse in Needham into a 75000-square-foot office building

Redeveloping a corporate building in Lexington into a 162119-square-foot office and lab building

Turning a four-story office building in Cambridge into a 63200-square-foot space to host office education and technology companies (the property is currently leased by Harvard University’s Information Technology Services Department)

Bulfinch and Harrison Street have partnered for several other projects including remaking the Atrium Mall in Chestnut Hill into the Life Time Center in 2012 a 286000- square-foot wellness and medical destination.

New York-based Brookfield Properties owns the Natick Mall which is the largest mall in New England by tenants and occupied square footage. But Neiman Marcus had owned its own building.

Neiman Marcus is one of several retailers to exit the mall over the last few years including Sears the American Girl store Brookstone Gymboree Lord & Taylor and Wayfair.

In 2018 Wegmans replaced the former J.C. Penney department store and Dave & Buster’s took over a portion of the former Sears store a year later. Level 99 took over another portion of Sears last year.

The deal is reportedly worth more than $100 million over a five-year period.

Typically that amount of money is what corporations spend on naming rights for arenas or stadiums not three-inch patches on player uniforms.

While NASCAR drivers have donned sponsors' logos on their uniforms for decades the concept of teams using player uniforms as advertising space is fairly new with major professional sports leagues in the U.S. and it's gaining ground.

Both the Minnesota Timberwolves and Wild announced partnership deals in the fall for jersey and helmet ad placements. The Wild are fielding inquiries for jersey sponsors.

""We've already had brands reach out to us unsolicited so we know there's demand"" said Carin Anderson Minnesota Wild's senior vice president of corporate partnerships and retail management. ""It creates a brand new opportunity for us at an unprecedented level as it related to a marquee asset.""

The Minnesota United has had a deal with Target Corp. for jersey sponsorship since it joined Major League Soccer in 2017 said Bryant Pfeiffer the team's chief revenue officer.

Some of the biggest leagues in the U.S. however have been slow to adopt that form of advertising. Major League Baseball has not approved helmet or jersey advertising leaving the Twins unable to venture into jersey or helmet deals.

The NFL does not yet allow teams to sell jersey patches or helmet decals ads for game-day jerseys. Teams can however sell ads for practice jerseys.

Training Haus — an athletic training and rehabilitation facility and service operated by Twin Cities Orthopedics the Vikings' training facility sponsor — became the team's practice jersey partner in 2021.

Meanwhile European soccer teams have used jersey sponsorships for more than 20 years. The 2020-2021 European soccer season brought in nearly $1.6 billion in sponsorship revenue said Jon Stainer of Nielsen Sports the New York-based sports intelligence company.

The Timberwolves this fall announced a multi-year partnership with Aura a provider of digital security for consumers while the Wild announced existing partner Twin Cities Toyota Dealers had become a multi-year exclusive partner for helmet ad placements.

Terms of both deals were not disclosed. But according to Navigate a Chicago-based sports and entertainment consulting firm NBA jersey patch deals are going to market in the $5 million to $20 million range and across the NHL helmet ad placement deals range from $1 million to $10 million.

Over the course of the 2020-2021 regular seasons uniform sponsor placements accounted for 3.1% of the total media value generated for the Wild through all sponsorship assets that are visible during game broadcasts which is about the league average and 16.6% for Minnesota United which is just below average for teams playing in Major League Soccer according to Nielsen's Sport24 service which measures and quantifies brand exposure during game broadcasts in terms of exposure time on screen and clarity of logos.

Since 2017 the NBA has allowed teams to sell advertising patches on the left shoulder of team jerseys. The WNBA meanwhile has had partner branding on jerseys since 2011. Mayo Clinic has been the marquee presenting sponsor of the Minnesota Lynx jersey since 2014 while Atlanta-based digital health company Sharecare has been the jersey patch partner since 2019.

The NBA's patch program has generated over $150 million since 2017 according to industry reports.

Nielsen's Sport24 data for the Timberwolves was not available since the team did not have a jersey patch for the 2020-2021 season. Fitbit the electronics and fitness company owned by Google reportedly paid $3 million per year to be the first exclusive jersey patch partner of the Timberwolves according to SportsPro Media. The 2019-20 season was the final year of the Fitbit partnership.

In addition to being the official jersey partner of the Timberwolves Aura will also be the official digital security provider for the Timberwolves and will have the title of season presenting partner along with in-arena and on-court signage.

""They will go wherever we go home or away games so fans in other markets either in the arena or watching from home will be exposed to those brands"" said Ryan Tanke chief operating officer for the Timberwolves.

Aura's name also will be placed on the jerseys of T-Wolves Gaming players the Wolves' e-sports NBA 2K franchise marking the first time the gaming franchise has had a jersey sponsor Tanke said.

Anthony Edwards left is a brand ambassador for Aura a digital protection company that recently struck a marketing deal to put its name on the Timberwolves jersey over the next several years.

The NHL in 2020 allowed teams to sell advertising placements on helmets so brand partners could recoup some of their investments with teams that were playing in empty arenas due to COVID. Those placements brought in $100 million in revenue among NHL teams according to Sportico.

Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy the naming rights holder to the Wild's home arena in St. Paul was the first to have a Wild helmet decal under that pilot. The league extended the helmet program and the Wild made the deal with Twin Cities Toyota Dealers.

""To have the opportunity as a brand to embed yourself with the player likeness it's a unique opportunity and connects you to the high-performance athlete that consumers are paying attention to during play"" said the Wild's Anderson.

In late 2021 the NHL Board of Governors approved allowing teams to sell advertising patches on player jerseys for the 2022-23 season. The official team jersey sold in the Wild store at Xcel Energy arena will have the new jersey patch Anderson said.

Beginning in the 2020 season MLS allowed teams to sell patches on the sleeve of a jersey as well as the front. Minnesota United is having conversations with a few companies about selling ad placement on the jersey sleeve said Pfeiffer the chief revenue officer.

Ad placement on soccer jerseys has the potential to drive meaningful revenue for Minnesota United  Pfeiffer said. It also allows the soccer club to partner with emerging categories of tech companies that soared during the pandemic.

Though it does not present the same exposure as game-day uniforms for NBA NHL and MLS players corporate identities on NFL practice jerseys receive broad exposure during training camps which draw thousands of fans and are widely covered by media outlets.

And with more than 90 players in training camp being recorded and photographed corporate identity on those jerseys results in significant exposure said John Penhollow chief revenue officer for the Vikings.

Linebacker Anthony Barr’s practice jersey shows the team’s sponsor Training Haus.

""It can roll into a pretty significant amount of exposure for them when it's all said and done"" Penhollow said.

The Training Haus patch on the Vikings practice jersey remains throughout regular season Penhollow said.

If the NFL permits patches on game-day jerseys or helmet stickers it will significantly change sports marketing deals Nielson Sports' Stainer said.

Kim Sovell an adjunct instructor of marketing at the University of St. Thomas says the new revenue stream may be included in future equations that determine how teams are valued.

Entering 2021 the Vikings' value rose 14% year over year to $3.35 billion according to Forbes. The Timberwolves' worth rose 2% to $1.4 billion and the Wild's 35% to $675 million. Minnesota United was valued at $520 million according to Sportico up from $300 million in 2019.

Given the revenue opportunities of jersey patch and helmet sticker placements partnership deals of that nature will be commonplace in American pro sports said Sovell who compared such placements to banner ads on the internet.

""We may not necessarily be consciously aware of the logo helmet or jersey patch but it is beginning to build familiarity with everybody whose subconscious sees that"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vZm9vZC1kcmluay93aW5lL3dpbmVtYWtlcnMtdG8td2F0Y2gtMTIzNDY1MjE1OS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Rising Winemakers—and Wines—to Watch in 2022,"For the cellar hound nothing is quite as satisfying as discovering a talented new winemaker—tucking little-known bottles onto your shelves before the name of the producer is bouncing around in almost every wine conversation. The only thing better maybe is “discovering” a whole region and snapping up bottles before prices surge as the place becomes all the rage.

There are pros of course whose job it is to relentlessly discover—to taste a thousand (or ten thousand!) bottles a year and sort out tomorrow’s stars. And no one takes that job more seriously or puts more skin in the game than independent wine shop owners. Their reputation—their appeal to inquisitive and acquisitive customers—demands it.

To launch 2022 on promising wine footing we tapped the proprietors of two great wine shops—one on the West Coast and one on the East—to not only name check some vintners they newly love but also clue us in on what they look for when spotting a rising star.

Karen Williams who owns remarkably well-situated Acme Fine Wines in Napa’s north-valley hub of St. Helena has a reputation for finding (and carrying) wines practically before the brands hit the market. A longstanding network of relationships with producers throughout California and beyond gives her inside intel on who’s making wines that are likely to be sought-after right out of the gate. And because Williams has supported nascent winemakers who’ve risen to collector status many have in turn supported her with access to their hard-to-find wines even after they’re well hard to find. (To shamelessly name drop her “IPO” brands have included Dana Estates Hundred Acre Tusk Scarecrow Realm and more.)

Williams describes Acme’s niche as “an incubation launchpad featuring the best of the rare micro start-up projects and the soon-to-be-launched not-yet-famous side projects from rising-star winemakers.” Part of her discovery comes in the form of branding help or blind barrel-tastings of yet-to-be-released wines. “We recognize promising projects first by taste” Williams says “then by the people and their stories.” Her instinct takes it from there.

WATCH

In Boston’s South End TJ and Hadley Douglas have grown the Urban Grape which they launched in 2010 into one of the country’s most innovative shops—wines for instance are organized by weight as opposed to variety or region putting the emphasis on what people like instead of what they know. And in 2021 the US Chamber of Commerce gave its Dream Big Small Business of the Year Award to the Urban Grape.

TJ and Hadley have a take slightly different from Williams’ on the up-and-coming producers they always keep their eye out for. “To call them ‘new’” says TJ (who is the shop’s wine buyer) “is probably a misnomer. Most of them have been working on getting to this point for years if not decades!” But he knows what he’s looking for: “The first thing is a clarity in the vision for the wine. I want to take a sip and understand what the winemaker is trying to achieve. It’s important to me that a new brand has a clear point of view that it’s not just trying to do the same thing as everyone else.”

For her part Hadley (the CMO) is looking for the brand story a through line from packaging to marketing. “What is the ‘why’ behind the wine?” she always asks. “It’s hard to stand out on a wall of wine so having a clear brand vision is so important.”

Williams and the Douglases tipped us off on a handful of producers launching at the high end as well as winemakers—and a whole region—coming into their own as we speak. The best place to start looking for these wines (as you might expect) is at Acme Fine Wines and the Urban Grape.

Harrison’s path to Sauvignon Blanc–centric Fluent as Williams describes it ran through a role with Bill Harlan leading an elite team working with high-profile guests like “celebrities royalty and heads of state.” In spite of the beautiful First Growths and premium vintages of Napa Valley Cabernet he showcased at countless dinners for said guests—Château Lafite-Rothschild Château Margaux Harlan Estate Screaming Eagle—Harrison reports that it was a 1993 Château Haut-Brion Blanc that virtually overshadowed the vaunted reds one night and changed the trajectory of his life. “It was time to launch a premium age-able white wine project to rival the top whites from Bordeaux and the Loire Valley.”

Fluent Wine Company 2019 Glass Cat Sauvignon Blanc Napa Valley ($125)

The inaugural vintage of Harrison’s Sauvignon Blanc from just one acre within St. Helena’s legendary Panek Vineyard (Pulido-Walker Rivers Marie etc.) is according to Williams a Chardonnay drinker’s Sauvignon Blanc in its richness and texture. “The silky smooth palate is layered with a mélange of tropical fruit: guava pineapple green mango and kiwi. Bright notes of Meyer lemon and peach along with Asian pear and subtle hints of vanilla are intertwined with the luscious yet mouth-watering finish.”

Michael Brughelli Brvghelli Wines

A graduate of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (with a double major in Wine and Viticulture and Agribusiness) Brughelli built his resume in different hemispheres. But lured back to California’s Central Coast he embedded himself in Santa Barbara’s Santa Maria Valley and focused on farming practices to elevate wine—“extrapolating cause and effect” as he says—in celebrated sites including iconic Bien Nacido Vineyard (where worked with luminaries like Sine Qua Non Au Bon Climat and Chanin).

Brvghelli 2018 Pinot Noir Santa Maria Valley ($205)

As Williams puts it Brughelli’s Chardonnay and Pinot Noirs “have a certain je ne sais quoi”—they’re graceful yet powerful. “This stunning Pinot engages the senses with succulent raspberry boysenberry pomegranate and violets. Hints of dusty chaparral sandalwood and pronounced mineral follow with exotic spices. Cerebral yet precise this wine is as sexy as a wine gets.”

Suzanne Deal Booth Bella Oaks

In Napa Valley the legendary Bella Oaks Vineyard—planted in 1973 to Cabernet Sauvignon by vineyard pioneers Barney and Belle Rhodes—was the subject of concern and intriguing rumor until arts and cultural heritage advocate Suzanne Deal Booth acquired it. Then came a collective sigh of relief with expectations that the historic property would be honored “for all it has been and all it can still be in its new chapter” according to Williams.

Bella Oaks 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley ($275)

In the hands of Napa Valley’s “golden trifecta”—winemaker Nigel Kinsman international master blender Michel Rolland and vineyard manager David Abreu—the wine matches the legacy of the historic vineyard. “The fruit literally sings” says Williams “balanced with perfumed floral aromatics bright acidity and fine-grained tannins. The layers of complexity are dreamlike and alluring.”

Rising-star picks from TJ and Hadley Douglas the Urban Grape

Tara Gomez Kitá

“Tara is a member of the Chumash tribe in California” says TJ “and is farming on the only indigenous-owned vineyard land in the country. She has spent time making wine all over the world and her wines have a very Old World sensibility that meshes perfectly with her respect of the land. Everything Tara does—from the label to the brand story to the wine itself—is done with an eye toward telling the story of her ancestry her land and her vision for wine in America. She’s as exciting a new voice in wine as we’ve seen in a while.”

Kitá 2014 Hilliard Bruce Vineyard Pinot Noir Sta. Rita. Hills ($65)

As TJ says “this Pinot Noir sums up everything I love about Tara Gomez’s winemaking. Her European education shows in the wine’s elegance and restraint. But her clear respect for and love of the land on which she grows her grapes shines through. This is a wine that practically screams with place and purpose.”

Black winemakers of South Africa

For Hadley globally “the most exciting new voices in wine” are coming from this talented group. “These winemakers are the whole package—with a strong ‘why’ behind their brands a clear winemaking vision and a desire to turn the oldest winemaking dirt in the world into something fresh and modern. I’m mesmerized by the Kumusha Flame Lily White Blend (Western Cape 2020; $35) every time I sip on it. South Africans know their way around Chenin Blanc but Tinashe Nyamudoka blends Chenin with Roussanne Colombard and Sémillon for the most beguiling and yet still laser-sharp white wine. When our imports for Ntsiki Biyela’s Aslina Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch 2020; $22) were interrupted in 2020 our customers panicked. There was actual hoarding! That’s how addictive this complex but also bright and fun white wine is.” (Update: Imports were restored and all’s well.)

And finally “Berene Sauls is doing something so special—restoring the ancestral land where her family was held as slaves into vineyards that provide work for the area’s descendants—that you simply cannot separate the purpose from the wine itself. Each sip of her Tesselaarsdal Pinot Noir (Hemel-En-Aarde Ridge 2018; $62) is a gift for past present and future generations.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMjQuY29tL25ld3MyNC9zb3V0aGFmcmljYS9uZXdzL3doaXN0bGVibG93ZXItYXRob2wtd2lsbGlhbXMtaW0taW4tZGFuZ2VyLWFuZC1pLWRvbnQta25vdy13aGVyZS1pdC13aWxsLWNvbWUtZnJvbS0yMDIyMDEwONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Whistleblower Athol Williams: 'I'm in danger and I don't know where it will come from',"Athol Williams was forced to leave the country over his safety.

This after he blew the whistle on companies and individuals involved in state capture.

Williams fears his danger has heightened following publication of the first section of the State Capture Inquiry report.

Whistleblower Athol Williams who fled the country after alleging high-level corruption under the presidency of Jacob Zuma said on Friday he was ""in danger"". This followed publication of the first section of the State Capture Inquiry report.

Williams testified before the commission after his testimony he asked in vain to be afforded state protection and left the country.

""If anything my danger increased now. I'm in danger and I don't know where it will come from"" Williams said during an online press conference from an undisclosed location.

""There's a conscious effort to leave me and other whistleblowers exposed"" he said adding someone had warned him there was a ""coordinated effort"" to silence him.

Williams a former business strategy advisor was hired as a consultant at financial firm Bain which the South African government hired between 2015 and 2016 to restructure its tax collector.

An original six-week contract worth R2.6 million mushroomed more than sixty-fold over two years and went beyond the tax body into other sectors prompting allegations the bloated deal covered illegal deals under the Zuma administration.

The commission compiled more than 800 pages of findings after an almost four-year investigation.

The full report is due for release by the end of February and President Cyril Ramaphosa has until the end of June to announce what action if any is to be taken against those implicated.

Last August saw another whistleblower former regional health authority finance officer Babita Deokaran 53 and a key witness in an inquiry into allegations of a corrupt Covid-19 procurement shot dead in front of her Johannesburg home.

Zuma 79 and facing multiple corruption allegations was handed a 15-month jail term for refusing to testify before the commission but was granted release on medical grounds last September."

How Do New York Sportsbook Promos Work?

How exactly do NY sportsbook bonuses work? It depends on the type of offer.

So let’s go ahead and take a closer look at some of the most common types of sports betting promotions available in New York today:

Deposit Match Bonuses

One common promotional offer in the sports betting industry is the deposit-match bonus where the sportsbook matches a percentage of the bettor’s initial deposit up to a certain amount. For example a sportsbook might offer a 100% deposit match bonus up to $250 meaning if a bettor deposits $250 they receive an additional $250 in bonus funds to wager with.

Bet & Get Promos

Another popular promotion is the “Bet & Get” promo. With these offers bettors are required to place a qualifying bet to receive a bonus. For instance a sportsbook might offer $150 in bonus bets to anyone who signs up and places their first wager of $5 or more. So regardless of your first bet’s outcome you’d be guaranteed to receive a $150 bonus on the platform.

No Sweat Bets

Lastly “No Sweat Bets” are promotions where the sportsbook provides insurance against losses on certain bets. If the bettor’s wager loses they receive a refund in the form of bonus funds. For example a sportsbook might offer a no-sweat bet of up to $500 to new customers. So if your first wager of $500 happens to lose then you’d get a $500 bonus bet token and a second chance to win your money back!

NY Sportsbook Promo Terms To Know

Ridderbusch who runs one of Minnesota's five largest electricity retailers says the frozen rates were made possible through energy conservation innovation and growing investments in solar energy throughout the eight-county service territory northwest of the Twin Cities.

The secret sauce includes: cost-saving rate options now chosen by 10% of customers which provides rebates for cutting demand during peak times and also saves Connexus money by shaving the peak demand most expensive wholesale power purchases; two-way automated metering infrastructure; and distribution-grid tools such as battery storage and voltage controls.

""This is a great way to start the year"" said Anoka County Commissioner Scott Schulte a businessman who represents Anoka Andover and Coon Rapids. ""Anoka County appreciates Connexus Energy's hard work to control costs while supplying such reliable service.""

Ridderbusch has a favorite slide which he displayed at a 2021 presentation to the Minnesota Renewable Energy Society which says: ""When we generate power from solar in our service territory it saves $30 per megawatt hour"" compared to the $85 per megawatt hour that Connexus pays to its power wholesaler Great River Energy.

""Our biggest opportunity for improvement now is to lower the cost of wholesale power purchased from Great River Energy (GRE)"" Ridderbusch wrote Connexus customers recently. ""Connexus works to maintain the lowest distribution cost in the state — a strength offset by the highest wholesale power costs.""

Therein lies the rub. Connexus is the largest of the cooperative customer-members that own and buy power from Great River.

""We are ahead of the game"" said Ridderbusch a Great River executive before he joined Connexus. ""We are an innovator and as a co-op we share what we do. GRE is a good reliable solution for most of its members. But we want a different arrangement. We have a contract through 2045. The contract never anticipated the innovation of today.""

Ramsey-based Connexus last summer announced plans to exit as a co-op member and become a customer that can negotiate rates. That also would free Connexus from a 5% limit on the amount of electricity it can generate independently from its own renewable-energy projects.

Maple Grove-based Great River has said it ""welcomes the conversation"" with Connexus.

""Great River and Connexus are working on a new contract that works for Connexus and doesn't harm our member-owner cooperatives"" said GRE spokeswoman Therese LaCanne.

Both parties express optimism that they can negotiate a satisfactory solution. Connexus owns about 20% of Great River which is owned by 28 co-op and other power retailers.

Great River is Minnesota's second largest electricity provider ultimately serving about 700000 Minnesota households and businesses. It is no slouch on renewables generating 30% of its power from wind a number expected to jump to 50% in 2030.

Still the Connexus board voted unanimously last year to end its membership in Great River.

Connexus says it pays for some GRE services that it doesn't need. For example in addition to investing in small-scale solar and high-tech conservation programs that are driven by consumer choice Connexus also has the scale and deep enough pockets to market on its own unlike smaller Great River co-ops Ridderbusch said last week.

Connexus has kept its rates flat over the last four years and also gets high marks from independent rating agencies for reliability. Yet it pays the same wholesale rates as other Great River members.

Ridderbusch believes he has the leverage to lower wholesale costs from Great River if ""more of our power is competitively sourced.""

And Ridderbusch said he believes Connexus can easily double the power it gets from small-scale solar projects very popular in its service territory that now generate enough juice to power 3700 homes at peak output as well as more battery storage.

""We want to do more on our own and buy more economical power from GRE"" Ridderbusch said.

Connexus was the only Great River member last summer to vote against the sale of Great River's huge Coal Creek power plant in North Dakota along with an accompanying high-voltage power line. Connexus said the sale to Rainbow Energy Center won't lead to as much savings as projected nor reduce greenhouse gases something disputed by GRE and Rainbow.

Great River had planned to close Coal Creek saying it couldn't sell the unprofitable power plant for even $1. But North Dakota government officials moved to save hundreds of jobs by arranging the Rainbow deal. On Thursday the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission voted in favor of the transmission line sale one of the last hurdles for the deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMi8wMS8wOC9jYXBpdGFscy13aWxkLW93bi1nb2FsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capitals fall to Wild in shootout after yielding a bizarre own goal,ST.

Marketing has always been a little full of it and there are many forms of marketing B.S. Ironically the more that brands push to sound “authentic” the more these efforts can come across as fake.

YUM! Brands CMO Ken Muench oversees global marketing for KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. He has a particular pet peeve about brand purpose. He recently told MarketingWeek:

“Brand purpose truly is a bunch of crap because it’s disingenuous. You’re saying ‘My purpose is to make the world a better place’. No your purpose is to make money…

“What I rally against is training marketers to use ‘purpose’ as a way of defining and marketing your brand. It often leads to very fake communication that belittles any real effort companies are trying to achieve.”

With so many brands sounding off on the same issues most purpose-driven marketing is not only not resonating; it’s not cutting through the clutter.

A 2019 study from DoSomething Strategic found that 58% of younger consumers would be likely to buy from brands that support a social cause yet only 12% had top-of-mind associations (unaided awareness) between brands they knew and their causes. Providing a list of social causes (aided awareness) only increased these associations to 24%.

Marketers need to cultivate a B.S. detector at least as sensitive as the customers they’re trying to reach.

Unlike most other “protein industries” that are more vertically-integrated cow/calf producers often like to operate apart from backgrounders feeder operations and feed yards.

Consolidation in the beef industry is undesirable to a lot of folks but the independent nature leads to some challenges for beef producers across all segments said Dr. Jess Hinrichs DVM for Zoetis.

Those challenges include the large diversity of producers geographical diversity lack of veterinary availability lack of labor transporting calves to feed yards and the reality of commingling.

“If you look at the average size of a cow/calf operation in the U.S. and compare it to the average size of the feed yards there is a vast difference in those numbers” Hinrichs said. “Because of that we are strictly forced to find ways to bring cattle together from many different operations in the cow/calf industry into larger feeding entities.”

He asks that each cattle producer think about the ways they prepare their cattle for the next phase in the feeding out process to ultimately produce high quality products for the beef consumer.

“I’d like to talk about some ways to hopefully overcome those challenges as we move forward” Hinrichs said. “Each system operates independently at times but we all need to work together to prepare our calves to move on to the next phase of production.

“If we handle things the right way in the beginning they should finish the right way in the end” he added.

He identified a few areas of “influence” that help bring calves to their best potential in the next phases of production.

These include making certain each calf can reach their genetic potential regarding growth efficiency and carcass traits.

Hinrichs wants to see more emphasis placed on genetic potential for good health too. The dairy industry is far ahead of the beef industry in this regard he said.

Dairy producers keep very detailed health records and their cattle have a narrower genetic profile compared to beef animals. That has allowed dairy producers to compare the genetics of their cows to their health records and they’ve developed some tools to look at the potential health outcome based on the genetic makeup of each cow.

“That would be great if we could accomplish that in beef cattle” he said “but we’re going to need a lot of cooperation down the road from all phases of production.”

In addition to genetic evaluation improvement Hinrichs thinks the beef industry can still improve nutrition and water availability. Improving nutrition helps cattle deal better with stress and mount a better immune response to vaccinations.

“Don’t overlook the micronutrient portion of nutrition” he said. “The mineral status of our cows can greatly influence their production their reproduction and their ability to fend off diseases that they encounter or are challenged with.”

Work with your veterinarian

Finally Hinrichs asks producers to use veterinarians to assess the risks imminent to the herd based on geography and exposure.

Certain areas of the country have endemic diseases – like anaplasmosis.

When replacement cows are added to the herd quarantines are needed to rule out new diseases that could be brought in. In addition when animals die on the farm it is good to have post-mortem exams.

“When we use them as a tool to determine why animals died and potentially influence problems early on in the disease process it can be the most cost-effective thing we can do as producers” he said.

He also encourages producers to evaluate their vaccination program from time to time and talk with their veterinarian about how well a vaccination program is working and the goals of the program.

To support the next phase in feeding cattle Hinrichs said that managing reproductive issues through vaccines is the top priority in the cow herd and then moving into the calf vaccination program. In addition to preventing respiratory diseases in calves finding the means to prepare the calves for the next phase of production is important.

Vaccines need to be given correctly with proper equipment and timing and at times when cattle/calves aren’t stressed by other factors. Sick animals have a very poor chance of responding well to a vaccine. Following the rules for vaccine handling and administration as well as following Beef Quality Assurance standards needs to be a given.

Proper documentation of vaccines and then using other tools like dewormers and implants need to be standard operating procedures on farms today.

“Ultimately I know everyone is looking for the same thing the same goals” Hinrichs said. “Let’s do the right thing for all of our resources for the animals for the environment for the next owner in the chain and also for our customers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVwb3VsdHJ5c2l0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAxL2NvYmItbG9va3MtdG8tdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1hbmQtbmFtZXMtZm9ybWVyLWVsYW5jby1wZml6ZXItYW5pbWFsLWhlYWx0aC1leGVjdXRpdmUtam95Y2Utai1sZWUtYXMtcHJlc2lkZW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cobb Looks to the future and names former Elanco Pfizer Animal Health Executive Joyce J.
